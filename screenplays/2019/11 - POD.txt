           EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

           Peaceful and silent. Stars and solar systems, rich and 
           vibrant in colour are etched into the backdrop of the 
           universe.

           But something is wrong.

           The familiar rings of Saturn are now partially eroded from 
           one side, the circle is incomplete.

           The planet is dwarfed by a giant monster behind it, 
           swallowing everything in its path.

           A BLACK HOLE.

           It’s an aberration, a concave mirror reflecting nothing but 
           darkness.

           The remainder of Saturn’s rings are whisked away, sucked into 
           its void, like water down a drain, twisting into it. 

           Pieces of the planet follow closely behind, pulled, as if 
           attached like tentacles.

           The sound emitting from it resembles a mixture of high-
           pitched wailing, an uncanny vacuum of power.

           It gets louder. And louder. Until -

           INT. THE POD - NIGHT

           Darkness. Just pure black. The slightest sound of breathing, 
           only it’s not the usual exhale and inhale we know. It’s 
           mechanical ventilation. 

           Hypnotic and slow. In and out.

           A BLINKING RED EMERGENCY LIGHT illuminates a figure, more 
           accurately a SPACESUIT HELMET. 

           The visor is black with “UKUSA” written on it, along with a 
           small British and American flag meshed together as one.

           It belongs to THE ASTRONAUT, the space suit momentarily 
           masking the gender and age of whoever wears it.

           The helmet disappears between every blink of the red light.

           Then a reflection on the visor; the small computer screen 
           merely a few inches from it begins to reboot its systems, 
           readouts and numbers calculate in milliseconds.
           The reboot completes. A PURPLE FLOATING DIGITAL WAVE flows 
           effortlessly on the screen against a black backdrop.

           This is HEX, the onboard artificial intelligence system.

           A single camera lens, her “eye”, does a quick scan of the pod 
           and spots the astronaut.

           As Hex begins to speak, the purple wave distorts, reflecting 
           the pitch and tone in her voice.

                                 HEX
                        Emergency. Debris detected. Manual 
                        override required.

           Hex is reflected on the helmet visor as she urges the 
           passenger to wake up.

           Then, a sudden JOLT forward, as if this astronaut has awoken 
           from a bad dream. 

           The ventilator breathing quickens as they gasp for air in a 
           panic.

           A distorted and disorientated voice escapes through a digital 
           voice compressor attached to the bottom rim of the helmet, 
           which also makes it hard to pin down their age and gender.

                                 THE ASTRONAUT
                        Huh? 

                                 HEX
                        Debris detected, you must reroute 
                        the pod.

                                 THE ASTRONAUT
                        Pod?

                                 HEX
                        T-minus one minute and twenty eight 
                        seconds until collision.

           The astronaut checks out their surroundings.  

           The pod is barely bigger than its occupant, a metallic coffin 
           for one, with a computer system and small keyboard just in 
           front of them.

           A few screens, one to work on, another for Hex and a small 
           aircraft yoke - like a joystick - for manual control, 
           surrounded by dials and buttons. 

           Above their head is a small window that allows curious eyes 
           to gaze toward the stars.
           Etched onto the window is a one-eighty degree PROTRACTOR 
           MARKING, complete with metric, KM, zero line and centre point 
           values. 

           Below, enough space for legs and a few small items.

           It is tight with little room to maneuver. 

           Realising where they are, the astronaut begins to panic.

                                 HEX (CONT’D)
                        Please stay calm - your heart rate 
                        is rising.

           A scream of panic and terror escapes through the voice 
           compressor as the astronaut tries to free themselves from 
           their safety belts.

           As they release the belts, an ALARM SIREN joins the red 
           blinking light, momentarily interrupting the panic.

                                 HEX (CONT’D)
                        T-minus one minute until collision. 
                        We must reroute our course 
                        immediately.

                                 THE ASTRONAUT
                        Where - where are we?

                                 HEX
                        Plus eighty-three, thirty-two by 
                        twenty-four.

                                 THE ASTRONAUT 
                        Plus eighty-three -

           Without warning, the sound of a fantastic collision halts the 
           conversation, shaking everything within the pod to its core.

           The astronaut’s head smacks against Hex’s display screen, 
           cracking the plastic into a few large pieces, Hex barely 
           visible, her audio cut. 

           A hexagonal dial labeled “POD AXIS” begins to spin wildly 
           round and round. 

           Beside it, the “SPEED” dial begins to climb from “three” to 
           “four”. The maximum number, shaded in red, is “ten”.

           Thrown around like a lonely stick in a matchbox, the 
           astronaut begins to smash against the insides of the pod, 
           grunting and groaning. 
           It’s chaos. The blinking red light. The siren loud, 
           penetrating to the bone, as they smash into everything.

           They look up to the top of the pod, out through the window, 
           and notice that they are in a full spin.

           The speed dial rises.

           The sound of heavy, deep breathing from the voice compressor, 
           the astronaut trying to stay calm and conscious. 

           A weary hand fights against the g-force to strap themselves 
           back in. Inching closer and closer to one of the safety 
           belts, finally the gloved hand wraps around it and pulls it 
           down into the clip.

           It locks into place. 

           Still against the g-force, the astronaut fights to press some 
           keys on the keyboard.

           Pressing a few of them, nothing happens. 

                                 THE ASTRONAUT (CONT’D)
                        Engage thrusters.

           Through the cracks on Hex’s screen, the purple wave distorts, 
           but she cannot be heard.

                                 THE ASTRONAUT (CONT’D)
                        Hex!

           Suddenly a GREEN BUTTON labeled “SWITCH TO AUTO”, lights up 
           on the panel above the astronaut’s head. 

           Hex has found a way to communicate.

           The astronaut reaches up, their arm fighting against the g-
           force, the siren, the red emergency lights, the feeling of 
           being tossed around over and over.

           The speed dial now reads “six”.

           A fingertip, inches away from that green button. The 
           astronaut stretches with all they have to touch it.

           Eight.

           The stars in the window spiral wildly round and round above 
           them.

           The needle on the dial edges from nine to ten. 

           Grunting, stretching, finally the astronaut hits the button.
           A number of buttons and dials light up on the display and 
           control panel around the astronaut. The systems begin to 
           stabilize as Hex takes control of the pod.

           The sound of THRUSTERS engaging, steadying the pod finally, 
           pulling it out of its spiraling orbit. 

           The speed dial slowly lowers to “one”.

           The stars stop spinning. The astronaut falls back into their 
           seat, their head tilted, passed out from the extreme g-force.

           EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

           The pod is a tiny fragment traveling through the galaxy. Its 
           outer casing is smooth metallic dark grey, like a coffin-
           rocket-ship for one.

           It moves against the backdrop of a half destroyed solar 
           system, epic in size and scope.

           In the distance behind it, where Saturn once was: the black 
           hole.

           INT. THE POD - NIGHT

           The astronaut slowly awakens and immediately looks up to the 
           window. 

           The black hole is clearly visible in the distance, not too 
           far from the pod. 

           The size and shape of it is reflected in the astronaut’s 
           visor.

           The astronaut presses a few buttons on the control panel and 
           checks a few dials.

           A new light source emerges from the top of the control panel, 
           shining down on the astronaut, offering more visibility, 
           GREEN but dim.

           A finger flicks against a dial labeled “GRAVITY” which is 
           steady at “100%” and then “OXYGEN” which isn’t doing as well 
           on “30%”.

           Slowly the astronaut detaches the gloves from the spacesuit 
           they wear, freeing both hands.

           There’s a moment of confusion as they stare at their palms 
           and then the reverse.
           Aged, thin skin, green veins visible.

           Immediately, the astronaut removes the helmet from the rest 
           of the spacesuit.

           Flipping the blackout visor on the helmet upwards to reveal a 
           reflective one instead, the astronaut positions it at eye 
           level.

           Staring back is CLARE LORENTZ (65), with short white hair, 
           her eyes dark and tired looking.

           With much confusion and sadness she observes herself, unsure 
           of how she became so old, lifting a shaking hand to touch her 
           weathered skin.

           It’s real. It’s her. Wrapping her hand around her mouth, she 
           gasps as a few tears trickle down her cheeks.

           She begins to weep.

           INT. THE POD - NIGHT

           Unclipping herself from the safety harness, she stretches 
           downwards, trying to search for a SURVIVAL KIT between her 
           feet.

           Sweat pours down her forehead, her hair slightly clinging to 
           her skin as she works.

           Peeking down between her legs she can just about make out the 
           plastic case. 

           Positioning her body she tries to maneuver in this tiny, 
           cramped space to get it. 

           She stretches with all she has, grunting as she does, her 
           fingertips brushing up against it.

           Her arm twists awkwardly with a “pop” as she pushes too hard, 
           screaming out in pain and momentarily abandoning the pursuit.

           Nursing her shoulder she screams in anger as she lashes out, 
           hitting some of the inanimate objects that surround her.

                                 CLARE
                        Shit! Shit!

           It’s full of rage and anger.

           Laying the survival kit box across her mini-keyboard, she 
           pops it open to take a look at what’s inside. 
           A small notepad, a pencil, a mini torch, some tape, a multi-
           tool, a few rations of food, a small medical box.

           Immediately she pulls out a packet of food, tears open the 
           flimsy plastic top and pours the contents down her throat.

           Some of it spills down her chin as she hurriedly feeds 
           herself. 

           As she crumples up the plastic wrapper in her hand, something 
           on the control panel catches her attention.

           The “oxygen” dial now reads “27%”.

           She taps at it with her finger a few times. It remains at the 
           same reading.

           Pulling out the notepad and pen, she jots down “27%”, takes a 
           look at some other dials and makes a quick calculation. 

           As she finishes she stares at the figure she’s written, a 
           grim expression on her face.

           It reads “8 hours 28 minutes”.

           With a piece of tape stuck to the note, she places it next to 
           the oxygen dial.

           INT. THE POD - NIGHT

           The top half of the spacesuit is removed now, a grey vest top 
           covers Clare’s body, a large sweat patch between her breasts, 
           beads of sweat trickle down her chest and arms.

           In her mouth, the mini torch is aimed directly in front of 
           her, pointed at Hex’s display screen, as she uses a 
           screwdriver to remove the broken plastic.

           Removing it, she goes to work on the circuitry with the 
           expertise of a skilled engineer, stripping a few wires and 
           then twisting them together.

           Hex’s voice slowly comes back to life, between every twist of 
           the wires until finally her voice is audible and clear.

                                 HEX
                        Clare.

           Clare barks at the AI pod assistant without any regard for 
           its virtual feelings. 

                                 CLARE
                        Where’s the Conrad?
                                 HEX
                            (reluctant, sadly)
                        It’s gone.

                                 CLARE
                        What?

                                 HEX
                        The debris we encountered.

           Clare puts the pieces together.

                                 CLARE
                        Were there any other pods?

           She watches Hex’s purple wave. It floats without answering.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                            (impatiently)
                        Am I the only one left?

           Hex’s purple wave blips with a single and short wave.

                                 HEX
                        Yes.

           Clare asks another question through her devastation. 

                                 CLARE
                        How?

                                 HEX
                        The Conrad encountered a 
                        catastrophic event. Fortunately 
                        your pod was ejected. Its 
                        navigation course was programmed to 
                        enter the gravitational 
                        singularity.

                                 CLARE
                        I don’t understand.

                                 HEX
                        You volunteered to complete the 
                        mission. But the explosion 
                        scrambled your life support systems 
                        and put you straight into cryo-
                        hyper sleep. You went in. And then 
                        you came back out.

           She barely speaks above a whisper as she asks the more 
           important question.
                                 CLARE
                        How long?

                                 HEX
                        Time works differently in there -

                                 CLARE
                            (irritated)
                        How long?

                                 HEX
                        Thirty-seven years, four months and 
                        fifteen days.

           She closes her eyes as she hears the number.

                                 HEX (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.

           EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

           Between the giant gas planet Jupiter and the ever growing 
           black hole, the pod drifts toward Earth’s direction. 

           The black hole gives chase, slow and steady, its center point 
           illuminated momentarily by electrical discharge and flashes 
           of many different colors, bright and dark alike.

           INT. THE POD - NIGHT

           In her hands, Clare has a metallic cylinder that fits neatly 
           into her palm, warnings and instructions on the lid, “TWIST 
           TO ACCELERATE, POP FOR COLLISION”.

           The ANTI-MATTER CAPSULE.

                                 HEX
                        Careful, one drop is more powerful 
                        than -

                                 CLARE
                        I know what it does.

                                 HEX
                        Yes, of course.

           Clare sighs to herself, feeling bad for snapping at her 
           assistant. 

                                 CLARE
                        Twist to accelerate and all our 
                        problems vanish.
                                 HEX
                        You thought igniting it within the 
                        event horizon would eliminate the 
                        threat.

                                 CLARE
                        Sounds like something I’d suggest. 

                                 HEX
                        Would it have worked?

                                 CLARE
                        Probably not on its own but it was 
                        worth a shot.

                                 HEX
                        Matter and anti-matter colliding. I 
                        imagine it’s a beautiful 
                        annihilation.

                                 CLARE
                        Do you imagine?

                                 HEX
                        I try.

           Clare places the anti-matter capsule back into a small 
           compartment beside her console.

                                 CLARE
                        While I was in there, how much time 
                        passed for everyone else?

                                 HEX
                        From the moment you entered the 
                        singularity to leaving it again, I 
                        estimate a few days, a week at 
                        most.

           Raising her hands, she brushes her tired eyes as she lets the 
           words sink in, realising how complicated her situation is.

                                 HEX (CONT’D)
                        I’m still not able to make contact 
                        with HQ.

                                 CLARE
                        They don’t even know what’s 
                        happened - 

           An AMBER flashing light illuminates everything in the pod 
           with its deep color. 
                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        What’s that?

           Hex’s display calculates some numbers and then she replies.

                                 HEX
                        There seems to be some external 
                        damage to the pod.

                                 CLARE
                        Is that why I feel like I’m in an 
                        oven? 

                                 HEX
                        It’ll get a lot colder if we don’t 
                        get it fixed.

                                 CLARE
                        How bad is it?

                                 HEX
                        The heating and coolant mechanism 
                        is running at twelve percent and 
                        dropping rapidly. 

                                 CLARE
                        Can we deal with it from in here?

                                 HEX
                        Yes, we just need to replace the 
                        damaged relays in the systems 
                        compartment.

                                 CLARE
                        Can you talk me through it?

           INT. THE POD - NIGHT

           With great difficulty she tries to turn her body to face her 
           seat - but there is barely enough room for her slender frame 
           to turn.

           She grits her teeth as she slowly squeezes herself around, 
           pressing up against her keyboard. As she does, it snaps off 
           its hinges.

           She looks down at the keyboard which connects to the console 
           by a thread - more specifically a connector cable.

           With a little more room, Clare shifts herself all the way 
           around, gritting her teeth and groaning as she finally faces 
           the chair.
           She wraps her arms around her chair as if hugging it, to 
           access the panel behind it.

                                 HEX
                        First you need to find the panel 
                        release.

           With her face pressed against the chair, her hands search 
           around for the release handle.

           Finding it, she feels it with her fingers, sighing with 
           disappointment.

                                 CLARE
                        It’s broken.

                                 HEX
                        There are four screws in each of 
                        the corners of the panel. 

           Unfolding the multi-tool in her palm, she pulls out the screw 
           driver and searches for the screws on the panel.

           Finding the first one, she slips the screw driver tip in. As 
           she goes to turn it, there’s no room to twist.

                                 CLARE
                        Won’t fit.

                                 HEX
                        Try the allen key.

           Clare fiddles with the multi-tool and opens up the hex key, 
           sliding it into the screw and begins to twist it.

           Slowly, without being able to see what she’s doing, she 
           unscrews three of the panel’s screws.

           Her face is soaked with sweat as she presses her cheeks 
           against the chair, trying to get more leverage to remove the 
           last screw. 

           Just as she does, the hex key slips out of her hand and drops 
           to the bottom of the pod with a thud.

                                 CLARE
                        Fuck!

                                 HEX
                        What happened?

                                 CLARE
                        I dropped it.
                                 HEX
                        We’re running at eleven percent -

                                 CLARE
                            (shouting)
                        I know!

           Panting, Clare tries to catch her breath.

           She quickly sizes up her surroundings to find a solution.

           She tries to squat as low as the pod will allow her to and 
           then reaches for the multi-tool.

           Her hand is not nearly close enough as she gasps, trying to 
           stretch herself further. 

           But it’s no use.

           Again, out of breath, she rests her forehead against the 
           chair, thinking of a way to do this. 

           Her eyes catch a glimpse of something. An ARROW on the narrow 
           side of the pod beside her. 

           The text underneath reads “THIS WAY UP”.

           A spark of an idea ignites in her mind.

           Pressing her back against that arrow she slowly begins to 
           turn her body over, upside down, in the tightest space 
           possible.

           Her head scrapes along the sides of the pod as she tries to 
           position herself, tucking in her knees, contorting her body.

           Suddenly, her leg gets stuck in place, unable to move, 
           leaving her half upside down with one leg pinned up and the 
           other pinned downwards.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Shit!

           She begins to struggle. Screaming out as she begins to panic.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Argh!

                                 HEX
                        Clare, stay calm. 

                                 CLARE
                        I can’t move. I can’t - fuck!
           She tries again to move her pinned leg, trying to flip 
           herself fully over, but it won’t budge.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        I can’t breathe! I can’t breathe!

                                 HEX
                        Clare. Stop.

           Clare continues to struggle, screaming louder, gasping for 
           air.

                                 HEX (CONT’D)
                        Listen to my voice. Breathe. 
                        Slowly. In and out.

           Clare begins to listen to Hex’s advice, still visibly shaken, 
           as she focuses on her breathing. Closing her eyes, she 
           follows Hex’s breathing pattern.

           In then out. Slow and deep.

           Calming down a little she opens her eyes and tries to move 
           her leg. Slowly she shifts her weight in one direction and 
           then another until her leg is free.

           Flipping over, now upside down in the pod, she searches for 
           the multi-tool. Finding it, she grabs it just as -

           BEEP - BEEP - BEEP. 

           An incoming message. The lights in the pod turn to a PALE 
           BLUE.

           Upside down, unable to see what’s going on, Clare freezes in 
           her tracks.

                                 CLARE
                        What’s that?

                                 HEX
                        A message from mission control.

           BEEP.

                                 CLARE
                        Answer it!

                                 HEX
                        It’s on manual answer. 

           In a hurry, Clare tries to bring herself back upright to 
           answer the call.
           She calls out in vain as she does.

                                 CLARE
                        Wait! WAIT!

           She shifts her weight over again, but as she does her wrist 
           POPS out of place with a sickening crack.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Argh!

           Clare winces and screams out as her wrist dislocates.

           BEEP.

           With her other hand, she pulls herself back upright, trying 
           to catch her breath.

           She hits a few keys on the broken keyboard and immediately 
           calls out in hope that it’s not too late.

           With every word she winces, cupping her fragile wrist.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Hello? Hello? 

           No response.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        I’m here, hello? Please respond!

           She pushes the broken keyboard away in anger, nursing her 
           wrist as she does.

           Then a voice calls out, mixed with static and distance, an 
           echo across space.

           The voice belongs to MARY JEMISON (50s), a confident tone 
           with a southern American drawl.

                                 MARY
                            (On comms)
                        Hello? This is mission control, do 
                        you receive me, over? Hello?

           Clare is taken by surprise as words tumble out of her mouth 
           and for a moment a look of relief - almost joy - on her face.

                                 CLARE
                        Yes, yes I hear you!

                                 MARY 
                            (On comms)
                        Please identify yourself?
                                 CLARE
                        Clare Lorentz, second engineer, 
                        Conrad, who is this?

                                 MARY
                            (On comms)
                        Clare, I’m Mary Jemison, I’m in 
                        control here at HQ. 

                                 CLARE
                        Control - where’s Wheeler? 

                                 MARY
                            (On comms)
                        I’ll explain later but right now I 
                        need to know what happened to the 
                        Conrad.

           Clare takes a few moments to find the right words then 
           replies, sadly.

                                 CLARE
                        It’s gone.

                                 MARY
                            (On comms)
                        Gone?

                                 CLARE
                        My escape pod was ejected, I’m the 
                        only survivor.

           Mary pauses as she takes in the information, her tone 
           shifting to a more delicate approach.

                                 MARY
                            (On comms)
                        Was the mission completed?

           With a furrowed brow, Clare looks incensed. 

                                 CLARE
                        Did you hear what I said? My crew 
                        are gone, people died.

                                 MARY
                            (On comms)
                        I did and I’m sorry, but I need to 
                        know if - if the world is still in 
                        danger. 

           Clare doesn’t reply.
                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                            (On comms)
                        Clare?

                                 CLARE
                        No. The cryo in my suit activated, 
                        put me straight to sleep. I don’t 
                        remember anything after I went in.

                                 MARY
                            (On comms)
                        Went in?

                                 CLARE
                        To the singularity.

           Mary is shocked.

                                 MARY
                            (On comms)
                        You breached the event horizon?

                                 CLARE
                        I was inside it. For nearly forty 
                        years.

                                 MARY
                            (On comms)
                        I’m so sorry, Clare. We thought - 
                        we thought we lost you all.

           Clare licks her lips anxiously as she approaches the next 
           subject with hesitation. 

                                 CLARE
                        Did you contact my next of kin?

                                 MARY
                            (On comms)
                        We tried but the evacuation 
                        protocol is making things difficult 
                        for us down here. 

                                 CLARE
                        Evacuation?

           Mary takes a moment before responding, as if she didn’t want 
           to burden Clare with that information.

                                 MARY
                            (On comms)
                        When we lost comms with the Conrad, 
                        we started to take measures. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARY (CONT'D)
                        Word spread. People panicked. 
                        That’s why I’m here. 

           Clare’s eyes dart from side to side as she thinks through 
           what Mary has just told her, until a horrible realization 
           dawns upon her.

                                 CLARE
                        We failed.

                                 MARY
                            (On comms)
                        You can’t think like that.

           A red button on the control panel begins to flash. The button 
           is labeled “POWER EFFICIENCY” and it reads “50%”.

           Concerned, Clare takes a look at some read outs on the 
           monitor.

           As she does she begins to COUGH VIOLENTLY. Eventually she 
           clears her throat and catches her breath.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                            (On comms)
                        Are you alright?

                                 CLARE
                        I’m losing power.

                                 MARY
                            (On comms)
                        It’s the comms, we need to make 
                        this quick or you’ll be floating on 
                        empty. Alright, listen. I need you 
                        to get closer to our HOS. Once 
                        you’re in range, we can talk you 
                        through rerouting the solar ports 
                        into the main power system. We’re 
                        going to bring you home, Clare. 
                        We’ve got our top gals on it.

           The smallest hint of relief in Clare’s face.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                            (On comms)
                        Is your navigation system still 
                        functioning?

                                 CLARE
                        I don’t know, but I’ve got Hex on 
                        board.
                                 MARY
                            (On comms)
                        OK. Use her to reroute to the 
                        coordinates we’ve sent you. As soon 
                        as you’re close enough, upload your 
                        diagnostic and system logs and 
                        we’ll figure out the rest. Use 
                        binary comms from now on, unless 
                        it’s urgent. Try to conserve power 
                        and stay calm.

                                 CLARE
                        What about the mission?

                                 MARY
                            (On comms)
                        You can’t do anything more. 

           Clare ponders a thought, questioning herself.

                                 CLARE
                        They died for nothing.

                                 MARY
                            (On comms)
                        Not for nothing. That had to happen 
                        for you to go through and come back 
                        alive. You might be the answer. 
                        That’s why we need to bring you 
                        home. 

           Clare nods, accepting Mary’s logic.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                            (On comms)
                        We’ll be in touch.

           Before the comms are cut, Clare calls out to Mary, a little 
           desperation in her voice.

                                 CLARE
                        Wait. My mother. I wanna speak to 
                        her. Please.

           Mary hesitates before responding.

                                 MARY
                            (On comms)
                        We’ll do everything we can.

                                 CLARE
                        Thank you.
                                 MARY
                            (On comms)
                        Stay frosty.

           The comms cut out with a BEEP.

           EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

           The Red Planet in the distance. The pod gently rotates 
           clockwise toward it, spiraling like a tornado, feet first. 

           INT. THE POD - NIGHT

           With her wrist now wrapped in a bandage, held tight with tape 
           for extra support, Clare works on the relays to fix the 
           temperature issues.

           Face pressed against her chair, she fiddles blindly with the 
           relay switches.

           She takes a peek over her shoulder toward Hex’s purple wave.

                                 CLARE
                        I never got a chance to thank you 
                        for calming me down when I lost my 
                        shit.

                                 HEX
                        You’re welcome.

                                 CLARE
                        They program you to be babysitters 
                        as well?

                                 HEX
                        Not quite. We’re traveling 
                        companions. Programmed to detect 
                        both physical and mental needs. I 
                        just needed to calm you down.

                                 CLARE
                        Needed or wanted?

                                 HEX
                        Programmed to need, evolved to 
                        want.

                                 CLARE
                        So I was manipulated by a machine.

                                 HEX
                        I only wanted to help you.
                                 CLARE
                        Yeah I know, it was a joke. 

                                 HEX
                        Oh.

                                 CLARE
                        Guess you need to work on that.

           Clare finishes her work on the relay switches behind her 
           chair.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Alright try it.

           Hex’s screen begins to compute a multitude of tests, as Clare 
           shifts her body awkwardly to face her monitor display. 

           Her eyes are locked on the “HEAT AND COOLANT” readouts. It 
           holds at “11%”.

                                 HEX
                        Relays engaged, reinitiating 
                        temperature systems. 

           Clare doesn’t shift her eyes from the percentage, hoping it 
           rises.

                                 HEX (CONT’D)
                        Holding at eleven percent. Cycle 
                        completion in five seconds.

           As if silently praying to herself that this works, Clare 
           closes her eyes momentarily as the seconds pass. Finally she 
           opens her eyes.

           The percentage has dropped to “10%”.

                                 HEX (CONT’D)
                        Unable to stabilize temperature 
                        systems. 

                                 CLARE
                        How long until it quits on us?

                                 HEX
                        It’s hard to make an accurate 
                        calculation. Maybe a few hours? 

                                 CLARE
                        What are my options?
                                 HEX
                        Your suit can keep you comfortable 
                        for a little while longer, however, 
                        the risks are higher exposure to 
                        radiation, osteopenia and other 
                        fatigue related issues. 

                                 CLARE
                        Radiation?

                                 HEX
                        Cosmic radiation. At your age and 
                        the amount of time you’ve spent out 
                        here, there’s a high chance you’d 
                        develop a reaction.

           Clare gets what Hex is referring to as she nods to herself, 
           sadly.

                                 CLARE
                        Do we have enough time to get back 
                        home?

                                 HEX
                        Even if we didn’t have this 
                        problem, I don’t think it’s 
                        possible.

                                 CLARE
                        HQ have a plan.

                                 HEX
                        Their plan is - nothing, I’m sorry, 
                        I shouldn’t have said anything.

                                 CLARE
                        What is it?

                                 HEX
                        It’s just that - I found it strange 
                        that Mary is there instead of Dr. 
                        Wheeler, who is supposed to be the 
                        head of this operation. 

                                 CLARE
                        Wheeler isn’t trained for disaster 
                        procedures.

                                 HEX
                        No. But have you ever heard of Mary 
                        before? Surely she would be someone 
                        you’d know incase of such an event.  

           Clare shrugs.
                                 CLARE
                        Maybe I did but I forgot... old 
                        brain.

                                 HEX
                        But wouldn’t she remember you?

                                 CLARE
                        She knew me.

                                 HEX
                        Did she?

                                 CLARE
                        So who is she?

                                 HEX
                        Someone to clean this mess up, 
                        perhaps?

                                 CLARE
                        What are you saying?

                                 HEX
                        They know your navigation systems 
                        are down. They’ve sent you 
                        coordinates knowing full well 
                        you’re flying blind. You know 
                        what’s between Mars and Jupiter?

                                 CLARE
                        Of course I do.

                                 HEX
                        At least two hundred of those 
                        asteroids are one hundred 
                        kilometers in diameter. How are we 
                        going to make it through that?

                                 CLARE
                        It’s the only way back.

                                 HEX
                        Is it?

                                 CLARE
                        Why would they lie?

                        If you go back home having aged in 
                        an instant there’ll be more 
                        questions asked than they can 
                        answer.

                                 HEX (CONT'D)
                        And they’re supposed to have all 
                        the answers. They wouldn’t want the 
                        world to panic.

                                 CLARE
                        They have procedures, they 
                        evacuated my mother.

                                 HEX
                        Where on Earth would you hide from 
                        a black hole, Clare?

           Clare has no answer. 

                                 HEX (CONT’D)
                        Perhaps my intuition is designed to 
                        be more skeptical than yours. But 
                        my primary objective is your safety 
                        and wellbeing. The things she said 
                        weren’t logical.

           Irritated, Clare snaps back.

                                 CLARE
                        Maybe you should leave the thinking 
                        to us. It’s not just ones and zeros 
                        and clever algorithms.

           Hex’s purple wave is silent and still, as if saddened for 
           being told off.

           Then she replies, softly.

                                 HEX
                        My apologies. 

           INT. THE POD - NIGHT

           Clare sits, impatiently tapping her fingers on the keyboard. 
           Her mind wanders, her view fixed on Hex’s purple wave, lost 
           in thought.

           She types in some commands.

           The beeping of the comms system rings out around the pod.

           BEEP. BEEP. BEEP.

           Mary answers the call, surprised to hear from Clare.

                                 MARY
                            (On comms)
                        Clare? Is everything alright?
                                 CLARE
                        We have the coordinates. We’re on 
                        course. But I’m losing power and my 
                        oxygen is at - 

           She checks the dial. “24%”.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Twenty-four percent. 

                                 MARY
                            (On comms)
                        We can work on all that for you 
                        once you’re in range with the HOS -

                                 CLARE
                        How, exactly?

           Mary is a little taken back by Clare’s forcefulness. 

                                 MARY
                            (On comms)
                        We, uh, well we’re working on it.

                                 CLARE
                        Working on it. Did you manage to 
                        get hold of my mother?

                                 MARY
                            (On comms)
                        Not yet but we’re trying - 

                                 CLARE
                        I want to talk to her before I get 
                        to the HOS. 

                                 MARY
                            (On comms)
                        We’re doing everything we can to 
                        make that happen, I promise you.

                                 CLARE
                        Are you?

                                 MARY
                            (On comms)
                        Clare. Is there something wrong? 

           Clare licks her lips, her eyes momentarily shifting to the 
           purple wave of Hex’s avatar, trying to figure out how to take 
           this forward.
                                 CLARE
                        I’m losing the climate systems. 
                        I’ll freeze to death before I run 
                        out of air. 

                                 MARY
                            (On comms)
                        That’s not going to happen.

                                 CLARE
                        How do you know?

           Mary considers her words, sighing.

                                 MARY
                            (On comms)
                        You’re right. I don’t know. But 
                        we’re going to try. Right until the 
                        end. Just don’t run out of hope.

           Lowering her head, Clare nods to herself, giving her trust to 
           Mary.

                                 CLARE
                        Don’t leave me up here.

                                 MARY
                            (On comms)
                        We won’t.

           EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

           Like a slow moving hurricane, the black hole approaches 
           Jupiter. 

           The pod speeds towards the “Main Belt”, filled with 
           asteroids, spinning viciously around in orbit.

           INT. THE POD - NIGHT

           Clare finishes connecting her helmet back onto her now zipped 
           up spacesuit. 

           Gingerly she places her damaged wrist and hand into a space 
           glove and locks it in place with the rest of the suit.

                                 HEX
                        HQ sent a route map. I’ll create a 
                        GUI for you to follow on your 
                        display. When was the last time you 
                        took manual control of a pod?
           Clare taps a few keys on the broken keyboard, which she has 
           now taped back to its holder.

                                 CLARE
                        About forty years ago. Plot the 
                        approach.

           Coughing hard once more, this time it takes a while for Clare 
           to catch her breath back, as she wipes her mouth dry.

                                 HEX
                        Is everything -

                                 CLARE
                        Plot it.

                                 HEX
                        Plotting.

           A VIRTUAL MAP appears on her display screen, showing readouts 
           of her fuel, thrusters, oxygen, solar power, pod integrity, 
           all showing their respective percentages. 

           It also plots a very rough outline through the asteroid 
           field, demonstrated on this virtual map by small and large 
           X’s. 

           Her pod is represented by a “<” with the pointed end showing 
           her direction.

           She watches her pod on the virtual map, as it approaches a 
           cluster of small X’s.

           It looks like that old Atari video game, “Asteroids”.

           Clare takes a look up out of the window in the pod as it 
           corrects its approach position. 

           Sliding into view, fitting neatly into the window space is 
           the thing that chases her; the black hole. 

           It fits between certain degrees and values between the 
           protractor angles etched into the window.

           Its illuminating ring is reflected in her visor as she looks 
           up to this odd sphere momentarily.

                                 CLARE
                        Lower thrusters to fifteen percent.

                                 HEX
                        Thrusters at fifteen percent. Clare 
                        -
                                 CLARE
                        I don’t want to hear it.

                                 HEX
                        This can’t be the only way, maybe 
                        we could -

           Clare barks back, the pressure getting to her.

                                 CLARE
                        It is the only way, now do what 
                        you’re programmed to do and help me 
                        get through this.

           Hex’s purple wave is small in size and speed as her voice 
           replies, regretfully.

                                 HEX
                        Alright. 

           Clare calms her nerves. She looks at her hand, the same one 
           that will control the pod in this minefield of asteroids. 

           It’s shaking. She closes her eyes momentarily trying to clear 
           her head. Clenching her fist she tries to get control of the 
           shakes.

           Eventually it stops.

           Clare slowly wraps her hand around the joystick, fitting 
           neatly into her palm.

                                 CLARE
                        Switch to manual control.

           A green button above her head labelled “SWITCH TO MANUAL” 
           blinks green, thrice, then steadies itself.

           A PROXIMITY WARNING buzzer begins to sound, a flashing dual 
           YELLOW and RED LIGHT overcasts Clare as she begins to enter 
           the fray. 

           Her pod begins to shake and shudder violently. Looking up to 
           the window she sees parts of asteroids that she passes by.

           Eyes fixed on the display map now, watching her pod approach 
           the inner cluster of asteroids.

           Her hand begins to twist and turn the joystick as the “<” 
           avoids all the “X” marks on her display screen.

           Sweat begins to trickle down her face, illuminated by that 
           mixture of yellow and red light, the buzzing of the proximity 
           alarm not helping matters either.
           When an asteroid gets too close, the alarm becomes more 
           intense, louder, its beeping sound accelerated. 

           Cautiously she navigates the asteroid belt, her hand steady, 
           gently nudging the joystick in the direction it needs to go 
           in, her eyes open and peeled on the screen in front of her.

           The sound of a few small fragments of asteroid, pinging off 
           the outer layer of the pod’s metallic case. Slowly, the sound 
           becomes louder, the number of hits grow.

           Some hit harder than others.

           Still, Clare tries to ignore it as she keeps her focus on the 
           map which now shows her to be a quarter way through.

                                 HEX
                        Route completion twenty-five 
                        percent.

           A larger “X” on her display, Clare navigating around it with 
           precision, licking her lips as she studies its movement and 
           her own pod’s.

           Finally around the larger asteroid she exhales, allowing 
           herself just a moment of relief.

           Until -

           BOOM. CRACK. PSSSSSS.

           Clare screams out as she is throttled inside the pod.

           Something large has hit, causing most of the electronics to 
           cut out, including the lights, leaving Clare in the DARK.

                                 CLARE
                        Hex, talk to me.

           No reply. Now she’s a little desperate.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Hex?

           Silence from Hex. 

           Reaching up to her helmet, she slides a button attached to 
           the side of it. A DARK BLUE glow lights up inside her helmet, 
           exposing her frantic face.

           She takes a look at what’s in front of her, barely able to 
           see anything.

           No monitor, no plot, her joystick not seeming to function.
           She glances up to the window to see that she is spinning 
           wildly out of control and off course.

           Keeping calm, she tries to hit some of the buttons on the 
           control panel. No response. 

           Her breathing begins to quicken as she tries to recall her 
           training - four decades old. 

           Thinking on her toes for a moment, she reaches over to the 
           control panel, trying to find something.

           She brushes her fingertips over the control panel, unable to 
           see anything in the darkness, as good as blind.

           Finally her fingertips find what she is looking for. Two 
           FLICK SWITCHES beside each other, protected by red plastic 
           covers to prevent accidental switching.

           One is labeled “OXY. T1” and the other “OXY. T2”.

           Again she takes a glance up to the window as her view 
           continues to change while the pod is spinning away from the 
           belt.

           She waits with a keen eye, studying what’s outside, waiting 
           for something to pop up in her view.

           Stars, asteroids, the galaxy. Too quick to narrow down 
           anything in particular.

           Her eye remains focused, waiting for the right moment.

           Then she sees it; the black hole.

           Immediately she flicks the two switches.

           The sound of AIR PRESSURE being released. 

           The spinning out of her window slows down considerably, as 
           she releases the switches.

           As Clare tries to keep the black hole lined up with the 
           degrees and calculations on her window protractor, the oxygen 
           she just released drifts into her view.

           The sound of clicking as she flicks between the switches, 
           trying to balance her window with the planet killer. 

           The breathing in her suit is loud, her eyes are wide, the 
           sweat pouring down her forehead.
           More air pressure being released, a delicate act of trying to 
           balance her pod and make sure she’s headed in the right 
           direction.

           A little too much to the left, a little too high, a little 
           too low, it’s not easy as she struggles between the oxygen 
           tanks.

           She looks at the analogue dial that shows how much pressure 
           she has, under a sign that says “RESERVE OXY”.

           The dial is at “3%”.

           Still the dark star won’t line up with her window view as she 
           toggles between the switches.

           The dial lowers to “2%”.

           She hits one of the switches a little too hard, sending the 
           black hole completely out of view, a look of frustration on 
           her face.

           “1%”.

           She flicks the switch one more time as she watches the 
           “RESERVE OXY” dial slowly dwindle below “1%”.

           The window shifts in a direction - in what direction, she is 
           unsure of.

           The space cavity that she is running from, begins to fill up 
           her window.

           She watches intensely as that image lines up in the 
           protractor markings.

           Then she hits the two switches for the last time. A small 
           bump in direction as the pod pushes off away from the black 
           hole once more.

           She’s on track.

           The sound of the last of the air pressure escaping. From the 
           window, Clare watches it escape into space.

           The “RESERVE OXY” is now at 0%.

           Letting go of the switches, she sits back in her chair, 
           mentally exhausted from that experience. 

           She can’t seem to pull her eyes away from the supermassive 
           entity.
           EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

           As if being poured into a bottomless well, the black hole is 
           positioned welcomingly under Jupiter, half of it already 
           gone.

           The remaining half of its gases are sucked from its core into 
           the outer rims of the hungry mass, which then spiral into the 
           event horizon. 

           A fantastic storm takes place across Jupiter’s remaining 
           landscape, the last gasp of a dying giant.

           INT. THE POD - NIGHT

           There’s a layer of frost now forming over everything inside 
           the cabin.

           A few portions of the food rations have been opened and 
           consumed, frozen to the dashboard.

           The dials are crisp with condensation, the red needles 
           pointing to their numbers still visible; “OXYGEN” hovering at 
           “16%”, “POWER” way below “0%”.

           The glass on Clare’s helmet is frosted over, as she’s slumped 
           in her chair, head back, mouth ajar, her eyes barely open.

           Condensation has frozen over her hair and eyelashes, her 
           breathing is labored. Her breath is visible with every 
           exhale.

           Slowly her eyelids close fully, exhausted, her body old and 
           giving up.

           She doesn’t notice the planet named after the god of war, 
           deep red and extremely close, filling up the window above her 
           head.

           Eventually that warm visible breath no longer escapes from 
           her lips.

           Mars begins to roll out of view as her pod passes it, a 
           blinding brightness appears, creating a silhouette of the red 
           planet’s curves. 

           The sun’s rays shine into the pod, creating a shadow of 
           Clare’s face against the display screen.

           Suddenly - 
           Text on the screen. “SOLAR PV - INITIATED”. The words blink 
           on the screen a few times, then replaced by a boot-up 
           sequence.

           Buttons flash and light up, the systems inside become 
           operational once more, the sound of electronics and the 
           stirring of mechanics breathes life into the pod.

           The “POWER” dial climbs slowly to “1%”.

           Hex’s purple digital wave appears on screen.

                                 HEX
                        Clare?

           On the display screen, Hex goes through a medical check on 
           Clare, a connection to her space suit. The readouts indicate 
           her core temperature to be a “DANGER”. 

           Now the display screen menu shows the options she’s selecting 
           to be “DIVERT SOLAR > H/C”.

           Frantically, Hex works on trying to heat the pod back up, the 
           “H/C MECH” dial begins to rise from “-157F”.

                                 HEX (CONT’D)
                        Clare you have to wake up. Do you 
                        hear me? 

           She doesn’t respond.

           On the display screen once more, Hex navigates a graphical 
           user interface, selecting dropdown menus and options until 
           she finds one that reads “EMERGENCY SIREN”.

           The siren is LOUD. A whirling sound, akin to a child’s 
           tantrum scream.

           Clare doesn’t budge. 

           Back to the display screen, Hex selects the “VOLUME” control, 
           shifting it all the way up.

           Her voice comes booming out from the system, her purple 
           digital wave LARGE to match her tone.

                                 HEX (CONT’D)
                        Wake up!

           Finally her eyes flutter open, slightly.

           Back to normal volume now, Hex tries to pull her from death’s 
           grip.
                                 HEX (CONT’D)
                        Listen to me. Focus on my voice.

           Her eyes are open a little more now as she struggles to 
           speak, barely above a whisper.

                                 CLARE
                        H- Hex?

                                 HEX
                        You need to wake up. I can’t stir 
                        the coolant tanks. Do you 
                        understand?

           Clare slowly drifts in and out of consciousness as Hex tries 
           to explain the dangers of the situation to her. 

                                 HEX (CONT’D)
                        Say it back to me. What do I need 
                        you to do?

           Clare’s speech is slurred.

                                 CLARE
                        Stir the tanks.

           A button flashes on the dashboard in front of her, LIGHT 
           BLUE, on it written “STIR H/C”.

                                 HEX
                        Do you see the button? Do you see 
                        it? Press that button.

           Clare’s eyes drift open wider now, visibly shaking in her 
           spacesuit.

           The light blue button flashes at her to push. As she goes to 
           reach out and press it a CRACKING sound stops her abruptly. 

           The sleeve of her spacesuit is frozen to the metallic casing 
           of the pod, partially encased. She looks down and notices 
           this, trying to pull away, but it won’t budge.

           Her left arm, complete with dislocated wrist, is clung to her 
           own spacesuit, unable to move that one either.

                                 CLARE
                        I’m stuck.

                                 HEX
                        I can only divert the power for so 
                        long, this is our only chance.
           Head leaning forward, eyes now closed once more, Clare looks 
           to have given up.

                                 HEX (CONT’D)
                        If you don’t do this, we’re not 
                        making it home. 

           That sparks a bit of life in Clare, her eyes opening up once 
           more. Slowly she raises her head to look at Hex’s purple 
           wave.

           Looking over to her arm stuck to the metallic pod casing, she 
           grits her teeth as she tries to pull it off, but it barely 
           moves, frozen solid.

           Realising that its a useless exercise, her gaze switches to 
           her other arm, clung to her own spacesuit.

           Taking a few deep breaths, she pumps herself up to rip her 
           already damaged arm away from her body.

           Gritting her teeth, she pulls her arm away from her own body, 
           frozen solid to it, panting and moaning as she does.

           The smallest sound of a rip or a crack, something is working, 
           but it barely moves. 

           She rests momentarily, her face in excruciating pain as her 
           wrist takes a battering.

           She gives herself a few more deep breaths.

           Then, with a scream of determination, she gives everything 
           she’s got to pull her arm away from its frozen chain. 

           A rip, a tear, the sound of a crack and the arm is free.

           Almost with a look of disbelief and severe pain, Clare looks 
           over her arm, her chest heaving, closing her eyes and 
           gritting her teeth again as the pain kicks back in.

           She hits that button with purpose, the blinking blue 
           vanishing as she does, followed by the sound of something 
           mechanical occurring within the inner workings of the pod.

           Falling back into her seat, she cradles her arm, exhausted. 

           EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

           The black hole approaches Mars, carving a path through the 
           asteroid belt.

           Still, the pod powers forward.
           INT. THE POD - NIGHT

           Clare, ironically, looks like she hasn’t slept in decades. 
           Her eyes focus on nothing in particular, her helmet now 
           removed.

           Then suddenly - 

           She throws up violently into a used food ration package.

           Wiping her mouth, she takes a few deep breaths as Hex 
           responds, concerned.

                                 HEX
                        If you want I can run a biometric 
                        scan to see -

                                 CLARE
                        No. I know what’s going on. My 
                        grandpop... It went from his liver 
                        to his lungs, it was pretty quick.

           Hex takes a moment then replies, softer, changing the subject 
           as she does.

                                 HEX
                        Is your memory beginning to come 
                        back to you?

                                 CLARE
                        The more time I spend in here the 
                        more I get, I dunno, glimpses of 
                        the Conrad. The crew. 

                                 HEX
                        What do you remember?

                                 CLARE
                        Being confident. Well, being young 
                        and confident. I can see their 
                        faces and when they smile it makes 
                        me happy but I can’t remember their 
                        names too well. But I do remember 
                        that something happened, just 
                        before we approached the event 
                        horizon.

                                 HEX
                        What was it?

                                 CLARE
                        I’m still shaky on that part. All I 
                        know is that we were scared, or at 
                        least I was, I think. 
                                 HEX
                        I’m glad you woke up.

                                 CLARE
                        Thank the sun.

                                 HEX
                        And you.

                                 CLARE
                        What if I hadn’t?

                                 HEX
                        Maybe not here, not now, but 
                        somewhere you would have. 

                                 CLARE
                        Didn’t know you guys were built to 
                        be so philosophical.

                                 HEX
                        We’re designed to think of the 
                        things that you don’t and then 
                        pretend they’re your ideas when you 
                        do.

           The faintest of laughs escapes Clare’s lips. 

                                 CLARE
                        We just steal them?

                                 HEX
                        Well, yes.

                                 CLARE
                        Maybe you’re right. Somewhere out 
                        there, I’m still me, not -

           She motions to herself, her wrist, her broken old body.

                                 HEX
                        This is just one possibility out of 
                        an infinite amount. Out there, 
                        those stars, some of them have been 
                        born, lived for billions of years 
                        and then died, but we still see 
                        them. Its moments still resonate. 
                        The universe is timeless. And you 
                        just went through the most 
                        exceptional manipulator of time 
                        we’ve ever encountered. Who knows, 
                        perhaps one of those stars is you, 
                        in a pod just like this, doing 
                        things differently.
                                 CLARE
                        You really believe that?

                                 HEX
                        I want to.

                                 CLARE
                        You remind me of when -

           She hesitates.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        When I left home. Big dreams and 
                        possibilities. I needed to be up 
                        here. Even if - even if she wanted 
                        me to stay.

                                 HEX
                        Your mother?

           Clare’s lips curl upwards in a half smile as Hex mentions her 
           mother.

                                 HEX (CONT’D)
                        If you could do it all over again, 
                        would you have stayed?

           Clare ponders Hex’s words.

                                 CLARE
                        We’re the same person, stubborn as 
                        hell, always screaming and fighting 
                        about it. I figured she was, I 
                        don’t know, jealous I guess? That I 
                        was doing something and all she 
                        ever did was get divorced, grab a 
                        nine to five and raise a kid. The 
                        day I left, I’m saying my goodbyes 
                        and finally she asked me what she’d 
                        been meaning to all along. “Why are 
                        you leaving?” I’m thinking “now you 
                        ask? You want to know right this 
                        second?” So I told her. I said “I 
                        would rather be up there with no 
                        one than be down here with you”. 
                        That’s the last time we spoke.

           She bows her head, almost as if ashamed by her words.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        I remember that clearer than 
                        anything else. I’m about her age 
                        now. Got a little perspective on 
                        things. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        And I realise that what she was too 
                        stubborn to ask was “why are you 
                        leaving me?”. 

           Clare’s eyes begin to tear up.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        If I don’t get home, she’ll always 
                        be alone. So if I could, I’d turn 
                        this thing around, head straight 
                        for those “timeless” stars you talk 
                        about and find her. 

           She wipes her tears away with her sleeve.

                                 HEX
                        You took a chance to save the 
                        world. Whatever happens, I’m sure 
                        she is proud of you.

           Clare contemplates Hex’s words.

           INT. THE POD - NIGHT

           Typing with focus, her old eyes squinting as she does, Clare 
           listens to Mary.

                                 MARY
                            (On comms)
                        We’re uploading the diagnostic 
                        check of your pod as we speak. Hex 
                        will automatically reroute the 
                        solar PV to give you enough power 
                        so you can push into the HOS 
                        boundary. 

           Clare wipes her sleeve across her nose as she listens, still 
           sniffling from the cold in the pod.

           As she pulls it away she notices that it is smeared with 
           blood. She dabs her fingertips at her nostrils and sees that 
           she’s had a nosebleed.

           She clears the rest of it away with her sleeve as Mary 
           continues.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                            (On comms)
                        Once you’re there we can get a lock 
                        on you and guide you in. You still 
                        with me?
                                 CLARE
                        Yeah, how long will it take?

                                 MARY
                            (On comms)
                        We think we can have you home in 
                        six days.

                                 CLARE
                        But I’m out of air in a few hours?

                                 MARY
                            (On comms)
                        Our team thinks we’ve found a way 
                        around that. We’ll put you back 
                        into cryo, lower your temperature 
                        and oxygen intake to almost 
                        nothing, keep you alive and stable 
                        while you come home.

           A skeptical look on Clare’s face.

                                 CLARE
                        So you’re hoping I’ll defrost on 
                        the other side. 

           After a second of hesitation, Mary replies, a sense of a 
           little defeat in her voice.  

                                 MARY
                            (On comms)
                        We think this is the best way. The 
                        only way.

                                 CLARE
                        I want Hex to be monitoring my 
                        vitals, wake me up if things go 
                        wrong.

                                 MARY
                            (On comms)
                        She’ll be shutdown. Permanently. We 
                        need all power diverted to your 
                        suit. 

           Clare looks over to Hex’s purple wave on the AI’s display, 
           with a hint of guilt in her expression. Hex doesn’t respond.

                                 CLARE
                        Is this actually going to work?

                                 MARY
                            (On comms)
                        My team has been on this - 
                                 CLARE
                        No PR talk. Real numbers. 

           Mary hesitates.

                                 MARY
                            (On comms)
                        I’d be lying if I told you they 
                        were high. 

           Sighing to herself, Mary turns her gaze to the window.

           A vast array of stars are in view at the moment. Some twinkle 
           in the distance. Again, she looks over to Hex’s purple wave.

                                 CLARE
                        And my mother?

           Sighing, Mary sounds even more defeated now as she responds.

                                 MARY
                            (On comms)
                        We tried everything but - Clare the 
                        roads are blocked off, phone lines 
                        are down, there’s real chaos here. 
                        We got a message to her... I 
                        promise she’ll be here when you 
                        come home. 

           Clare doesn’t respond. She just stares back up to those 
           stars.

           INT. THE POD - NIGHT

           Now with her helmet on, strapped into her seat, Clare makes 
           the final preparations for her voyage home.

                                 HEX
                        Approaching HOS radius in t-minus 
                        one minute.

           A small, simple map is displayed on Clare’s screen. Her pod 
           approaching a semi-circle boundary, the HOS’s radius. She 
           watches as the pod icon gets closer to the boundary line.

           Clare hits a few keys, an alert pops up on her display, 
           “INITIATE CRYO SEQUENCE”. Tapping an arrow key she selects 
           “YES” but doesn’t hit the return key, her finger hovering 
           over it.
                                 HEX (CONT’D)
                        HOS auto-guide systems have been 
                        activated. Shall I begin my 
                        shutdown procedure? 

           Clare doesn’t reply, juggling thoughts in her mind. She 
           watches the map and her pod approaching the boundary then 
           back up to her window; those stars.

           Then to the blood stains on her sleeve.

                                 CLARE
                        Do we have enough power to change 
                        destination?

                                 HEX
                        Depends. Where are we headed?

                                 CLARE
                        Thirty-seven years, four months and 
                        fifteen days ago, give or take a 
                        few hours.

           Hex doesn’t respond immediately as she catches up to Clare’s 
           proposal.

                                 HEX
                        You want to head back into the  -

                                 CLARE
                        Yeah. 

                                 HEX
                        While I advise against it, I 
                        believe so.

           Tapping at the arrow key, Clare selects “NO” on her display, 
           hesitates for a moment, then - 

           Hits the return key.

                                 CLARE
                        Plot it.

           Clare watches her display as her pod turns away from the HOS 
           boundary line, facing the path she’s just came in on. 

           Just as it does, an incoming call from HQ. BEEP - BEEP - 
           BEEP.

                                 HEX
                        They’re sending a request for 
                        comms. Shall I answer?
           Deciding what to do, Clare makes her mind up and hits the 
           DELETE key on the keyboard, killing the call.

           EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

           The pod heads at speed toward the black hole, which is now 
           where Mars once was, specs of red rock float in its place 
           instead.

           INT. THE POD - NIGHT

           With a determined and focused attitude, Clare watches her 
           pod’s plotted course on the display as she prepares for her 
           new mission. 

           They share quick communication, making the usual checks and 
           balances.

                                 HEX
                        Clare, I must warn you that 
                        although in theory my suggestion 
                        was sound, it doesn’t mean that -

                                 CLARE
                        Time doesn’t work the same in 
                        there, right? That’s what you said?

                                 HEX
                        Correct, but that doesn’t mean that 
                        it can be reversed or that you’d 
                        even end up where you want to be. 
                        These are complex scientific ideas, 
                        unproven ones at that.

                                 CLARE
                        I went through and came back. 
                        That’s enough for me to take a 
                        chance on trying to change this.

                                 HEX
                        To change what’s happened to you or 
                        to complete the mission? Because 
                        I’m unsure what you’re 
                        prioritizing. 

           Clare’s expression gives away her conflict between those 
           choices as she lowers her gaze, stopping what she’s doing 
           momentarily.

                                 CLARE
                        If things could go back to how they 
                        were, I’d have another chance.
                                 HEX
                        And what if it doesn’t?

           Clare looks over to the anti-matter capsule, still protected 
           and covered in its holder.

                                 CLARE
                        Then I complete the mission.

                                 HEX
                        But you said yourself, it might not 
                        even work.

                                 CLARE
                        I’ve got to try. Either that or go 
                        back to sleep. Whatever happens... 
                        I need you. 

           Hex takes a moment and then replies as if making her mind up 
           with Clare.

                                 HEX
                        You have me.

           She smirks, as if appreciating her digital counterpart for 
           the first time. She yawns loudly, covering her mouth, 
           widening her eyes as she does, hard to keep them open.

                                 CLARE
                            (apologetically)
                        Sorry - 

           INT. THE POD - HALLUCINATION - NIGHT

           A loud BANG interrupts their conversation, the sound coming 
           from the outside of the pod, about where Clare’s feet are.

                                 CLARE
                        Did we hit something -

           Something startles Clare, shocking her into silence, her 
           eyebrows raised as she listens to the sound of something 
           CRAWLING up the side of the pod.

           Perhaps it’s some sort of multi-legged creature or a 
           tentacled beast, whatever it is, Clare looks terrified as she 
           whispers to Hex.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        What the hell is that?

           Hex whispers back.
                                 HEX
                        It sounds like something is 
                        attached to the pod.

                                 CLARE
                        Run an external scan -

           With an elaborate “winding down” sound, all power in the pod 
           is cut, leaving Clare in total darkness.

           BLACK.

           The sound of Clare trying to flick and hit some switches on 
           the dashboard. No luck.

           As she does, that multi-legged creepy crawly on the outside 
           makes its way around the pod, as if trying to probe for a way 
           in.

           Clare gasps as she hears it move again.

           The sound of fumbling, items being dropped, Clare’s heavy, 
           terrified breathing.

           CLICK - CLICK - 

           LIGHT. The mini-torch in her hand offers a little relief for 
           her as she searches around the pod for answers.

           KNOCK - KNOCK - KNOCK.

           Clare points her light toward the sound, on the narrow side 
           of the pod beside her.

           She covers her mouth to stop herself from screaming out, 
           listening to this thing crawl slowly up the length of the pod 
           toward the top - where her window is.

           Her light is locked on the sound and movement, tracing every 
           step with trepidation. 

           Slowly the uninvited guest makes its way to the top of the 
           pod. Clare shines the light out of the window, waiting for 
           “it” to appear.

           Moments pass as she waits with bated breath. 

           Then - 

           A knock to the side of her once more, she flashes her light 
           toward it quickly, fearing that something might be in there 
           with her.
           As she does, SOMETHING ALIEN crawls over the window and out 
           of sight.

           She catches a glimpse of it, quickly aiming her light back up 
           to the window, but it has vanished.

           Reaching up with a trembling hand she wraps her fingers 
           around a handle, pulling at a shutter to block out the 
           window.

           A DISTANT VOICE calls out to her, female.

                                 DISTANT VOICE
                        Clare!

           Then WHISPERS, a cacophony of voices engulf and swirl around 
           her.

                                 WHISPERS
                        What are you doing? Where are you 
                        going? Stop! Go! It’s right there. 
                        It’s inside.

           Clare is spooked by the voices as she searches all around 
           her, terrified that it - whatever it is - is in the pod with 
           her.

           Searching around the pod she finds the multi-tool and pulls 
           out the pen knife, ready to kill whatever has infiltrated her 
           space.

           She pans the torch all around the pod, searching, her hand 
           shaking as she does, the other gripping her weapon tightly.

           Above her, first, panning from one corner to the next, she 
           swallows hard as the light bobs downwards past her powerless 
           dashboard.

                                 WHISPERS (CONT’D)
                        You have to catch it. You have to 
                        kill it.

           Finally she checks around her feet from one side to the 
           other.

           Nothing.

           The sound of CRAWLING within the pod makes her jump, dropping 
           her light source onto the floor, breaking it and sending her 
           back into darkness.

           To add to her confusion the DARK RED emergency light flickers 
           into life above her head as she looks up to it.
           It is sinister, causing the pod to look like it’s bathed in 
           dark blood.

           Just as she’s distracted by the sudden activation of the 
           emergency light she hears that CRAWLING sound again. 

           This time it’s more focused and very close to her. She tries 
           to isolate the sound, searching all around her.

           TAP - TAP - TAP.

           As if one of those beast’s tentacled pointed spider-like legs 
           is tapping against something. 

           She follows the sound with her eyes, slowly pulling downwards 
           to -

           Her helmet, placed on her keyboard, the black visor pulled 
           down.

           With a trembling hand, she reaches for the visor to lift it 
           upward. As her fingertips curl around the visor lid, she 
           inhales.

           Lifting the visor steadily upwards, she’s about half way up 
           when she catches a glimpse of what looks like a few spider 
           legs, long and razor-like, about the size of a large hand.

           She gasps as she quickly slides the visor down, shifting back 
           into her seat and away from the monster.

                                 WHISPERS (CONT’D)
                        It’s going to escape. It’s growing. 
                        When it goes through it’ll be 
                        unstoppable. Monster. 

           The whispers repeat over and over in her head, coming from 
           the walls, surrounding her. She clasps her ears as she tries 
           to drown them out but it doesn’t work.

           She screams out in frustration and defeat. 

           The thing inside the helmet starts to thrash wildly, the 
           sound echoing in the pod, trying to escape.

                                 WHISPERS (CONT’D)
                        Kill it. Kill it! KILL IT!

           With a courageous scream, Clare grabs the helmet and starts 
           to smash it against the dashboard, destroying her console, 
           the keyboard, the display screen, buttons and sparks fly.

                                 DISTANT VOICE
                        Clare, stop!
           She doesn’t listen as she continues to go to town on her 
           instruments and computers, determined to kill the monster in 
           her helmet. 

           Dropping the helmet onto the keyboard, the hole facing 
           upward, she watches and waits to see if anything emerges from 
           it.

           Her heart racing, breathing heavy, her eyes are fixed to it.

           With deliberate creepiness, a spider leg emerges, slowly, 
           from the helmet and wraps itself around the rim, as if trying 
           to pull itself out.

           Out of options, Clare looks around the pod until her sights 
           are set on the anti-matter capsule.

           Reaching for it, she pulls it out of its compartment and 
           holds it in her hand, looking over it.

                                 WHISPERS
                        You’re not going to make it.

           Reading the words, “TWIST TO ACCELERATE” she places a hand 
           over the top cover of the capsule.

                                 WHISPERS (CONT’D)
                        You’re going to float in this thing 
                        forever.

           Shrouded in darkness and mystery, the spider-like alien 
           monster pulls itself firmly out of the helmet, menacingly 
           approaching Clare.

                                 WHISPERS (CONT’D)
                        You’re never going home.

           With a firm grip on the capsule now, ready to twist.

                                 DISTANT VOICE
                        Clare -

           That voice captures her attention. It becomes clearer now.

                                 HEX
                        Stop!

           It stops Clare in her tracks.

                                 HEX (CONT’D)
                        Put it down. You’re not thinking 
                        straight.
           Squinting with confusion she watches as her surroundings 
           switch between that dark red emergency light colour to the 
           normal lighting, before this horror scenario.

           Trying to clear her mind, she watches in confusion as her 
           helmet has an alien disappearing and reappearing by the 
           second.

           Her mind tries to separate her hallucination from reality, 
           Hex’s voice is the guide.

                                 HEX (CONT’D)
                        You’re hallucinating. This isn’t 
                        real. Put down the capsule.

           With every passing second, Hex’s words become clearer to her 
           as she gazes at the weaponized capsule in her palm. 

           INT. THE POD - BACK TO REALITY - NIGHT

           The capsule remains in her hand, the colour of her 
           surroundings change for good, back to reality.

           With her hallucination over, she sees the damage she has done 
           to her pod; smashed screens, buttons and wires pulled out. 

           It’s a mess.

           The hand holding the capsule begins to shake as she battles 
           with what to do, the other still wrapped around the top of 
           it, ready to get the party started.

                                 CLARE
                        Hex?

                                 HEX
                        Put it down. It’s alright. 

           Clare slowly lifts her hand away from the capsule. 

           Gently she places the capsule back into its compartment and 
           then realises what she has done and nearly did.

                                 HEX (CONT’D)
                        Breathe. It’s going to be alright. 

           Hex’s soothing voice calms Clare down. Without warning, Clare 
           bursts into tears, sobbing loudly, covering her face with her 
           old wrinkled hands. 

                                 CLARE
                        I don’t want to die in here. I 
                        don’t want to be alone.
           As she sobs, Hex watches her through her camera, then tries 
           to soothe her. 

                                 HEX
                        You’re not alone.

           INT. THE POD - DAY

           Her computer screen is smashed, functional but illegible. 
           Wires and buttons lay scattered across the pod. The keyboard 
           is mangled.  

           Destruction everywhere, she did a number on the console panel 
           with her helmet.

           On top of the keyboard sits her helmet, the visor cracked 
           horribly down the middle.

           The oxygen dial reads “9%”.

           Clare’s face is covered with dirt, grease and sweat as she 
           works on fixing her helmet. 

           Placing some tape over the crack on it, she looks over her 
           work with frustration; it’s a mess.

                                 HEX
                        It’s a common thing. Being isolated 
                        for long amounts of time. Maybe 
                        something went wrong with stirring 
                        the oxygen tanks.

           She doesn’t respond.

           Sensing something is wrong, Hex tries to motivate her.

                                 HEX (CONT’D)
                        I’ve switched the coordinates to 
                        manual dials. You can still guide 
                        the pod with the stick. I ran some 
                        calculations -

           BEEP.

           The comms system rings out around the pod, taking her by 
           surprise.

                                 HEX (CONT’D)
                        HQ. Shall I -

                                 CLARE
                        No. 
           Hex cuts the call as Clare places the helmet onto the 
           keyboard.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        You were right. They knew they 
                        couldn’t bring me back so they 
                        figured they could get rid of me, 
                        last survivor of a failed mission. 
                        Keep everyone calm.

                                 HEX
                        It’s in your nature to preserve 
                        yourselves. 

           Pulling her hands away from her helmet, she brushes one 
           against the wall, her skin BURNS, a quick sizzling sound as 
           she pulls away from it in shock.

                                 CLARE
                        Shit!

           Confused, she examines the wall and hovers her hand over the 
           pod’s casing.

           She pulls her hand back quickly, realising what might be 
           happening.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        What’re our coordinates?

                                 HEX
                        The navigation grid is smashed, I 
                        can only get a partial location.

           Scrambling over her dashboard, she roughly pulls away broken 
           panels, switches, buttons and wiring, trying to find a way to 
           figure out where they are.

           Her eyes catch a glimpse of the temperature gauge. It 
           approaches “+200f”. It brings her manic search to a halt.

                                 CLARE
                        Can you get a reading on the 
                        external temperature.

                                 HEX
                        I’ll run a check now.

           Clare waits impatiently.

                                 CLARE
                        You got it?
                                 HEX
                        That can’t be right.

                                 CLARE
                        What is it?

           No response.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Hex?

                                 HEX
                        Two hundred degrees, fahrenheit. 

           Clare’s expression is one of confusion.

           Then it hits her.

           Tilting her head up toward the shutter that covers the 
           window, she slowly wraps her fingertips around the handle and 
           gently slides it open.

           A bright stream of light cuts into the dark pod, a slice of 
           it landing diagonally across her face, missing her eyes.

           Her fears are confirmed.

           EXT. SPACE - DAY

           The sun is a few million miles away, but it is a giant red, 
           orange and yellow ball of furious flames.

           The pod is heading closer toward it.

           INT. THE POD - DAY

           Clare jumps into action.

                                 CLARE
                        How hot can this thing get?

                                 HEX
                        The pod is designed to withstand up 
                        to two hundred and forty degrees, 
                        why?

                                 CLARE
                        We’re being pulled in.

                                 HEX
                        By what?
                                 CLARE
                        The sun.

           Before Hex can respond, Clare tries to come up with a plan.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Can you go through your last known 
                        coordinates and plot a path?

                                 HEX
                        I could, but I don’t know where we 
                        are, we could end up anywhere.

                                 CLARE
                        Anywhere’s better than here.

                                 HEX
                        Or I could take us right into the 
                        sun. The input system is ruined -

                                 CLARE
                        I’ll work on it. 

                                 HEX
                        Your suit can only protect you 
                        until two fifty. Anything past 
                        that, you’ll dehydrate within 
                        minutes and pass out. 

                                 CLARE
                        Then you better hurry.

                                 HEX
                        It’ll take me some time.

           Clare checks the temperature gauge once more. “+205f”.

                                 CLARE
                        You’ve got five minutes.

           With the multi-tool’s screwdriver, Clare tries to open up the 
           panels on the dashboard.

           Hex’s screen runs through thousands of calculations and 
           checks, trying to figure out their route away from the sun.

           Opening it she immediately rummages through to find a way to 
           fix this mess. She takes a deep breath and prepares to beat 
           the clock.

           She talks as she works, trying to keep herself going, to keep 
           calm.
                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        You know what I want when we get 
                        home?

           Deep in the innards of the computer system, she tries to 
           separate wires and fuses.

                                 HEX
                        No?

           A BEAD OF SWEAT escapes from her hairline and slowly begins 
           to descend down her forehead.

                                 CLARE
                        A nice cold beer. Straight from the 
                        icebox. 

           Quickly but calmly, Clare sorts through the cables, looks 
           over them and immediately drops them; no use to her.

           In a flash she starts to unscrew the next panel over, the 
           dials and buttons smashed to bits.

           That bead of sweat travels to the tip of her nose as she 
           places down the multi-tool and uses both hands to rip open 
           the panel and get into the heart of the machine.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        You know I think I dreamt about 
                        food. I feel for you. Never know 
                        what a cheeseburger tastes like.

           Reaching her arm into the bowls of the wiring and machinery, 
           she finds what she is looking for and pulls a cluster of 
           wires attached to a PCB.

           With the pen knife she cuts a few of the wires off and places 
           the remainder of the PCB, cables and wires dangling off of 
           it, onto the keyboard.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Pickles, some tomatoes, couple of 
                        slice of cheese, mayo, ketchup.

           At the tip of her nose now, the bead of sweat collects, holds 
           for a moment as Clare’s eyes scan over the PCB, then drops 
           directly onto one of the capacitors on the board.

           It momentarily distracts Clare as she notices how much she is 
           sweating, wiping away her forehead. She looks over to the 
           temperature gauge.

           “+226f”.
           She gives herself a few seconds to collect herself and then 
           goes again, as she pulls wires from the damaged console and 
           begins to cut them away.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        I’m a pretty good cook - well was. 
                        If you could eat, I’d invite you to 
                        dinner.

           Twisting together the damaged wires with the ones attached to 
           the PCB she creates something new, like a mechanical heart 
           with arteries and veins protruding from it. 

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Oh yeah, homemade meatloaf. I’m 
                        good at that one. 

           Taking the console’s new heart she places it into the gaping 
           hole she made in the damaged console’s panel.

           A few drops of sweat drip onto the metallic casing as she 
           does - PLOP - PLOP - PLOP.

           She wipes away her nose again.

           The red on her fingertips catches her attention. It’s not 
           sweat this time.

           A quick glance at the temperature. “+233f”.

           Wiping away the blood onto her suit and quickly brushing her 
           nose with her sleeve, she continues the transplant of this 
           new organ.

           Now her voice is tired, drained, mouth dry, lips crusted over 
           a little. Her hair wet, as if she’s stepped out of a sauna. 

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        The trick is mustard. You need that 
                        fancy French stuff, not American.

           Hex’s screen switches from calculations.

                                 HEX
                        Routing complete.

           Clare finishes twisting the cables together in the control 
           panel, her finger tips working fast.

           Finishing the PCB transplant she locks the panel back into 
           place to display the digital dials and input systems.

                                 CLARE
                        Fire it up.
           Clare watches the control panel, waiting for it to come to 
           life.

           “+239f”.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Is it on?

                                 HEX
                        Yes. 

           Her eyes are peeled on the control panel. Hoping that it 
           comes to life. 

           It doesn’t. 

           She bows her head sighing.

                                 HEX (CONT’D)
                        I can’t plot the route.

           The sound of sizzling catches Clare’s attention. The plastic 
           toolbox, leant against the wall, begins to melt into it.

           She gazes at the temperature reading again.

           “+241f”. 

           Closing her eyes, she swallows hard as she asks a testing 
           question.

                                 CLARE
                        Could you manually guide me?

                                 HEX
                        How? You can’t see where you’re 
                        going.

           Clare takes a glance up to the shutter that protects the 
           window and then back to Hex.

                                 CLARE
                        Yes I can.

                                 HEX
                        You can’t risk that kind of 
                        exposure, the heat would be too 
                        much -

                                 CLARE
                        You talk, I fly, you can do that, 
                        can’t you? 

           Hex hesitates.
                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Right?

                                 HEX
                        Yes. But your eyes -

                                 CLARE
                        There is no other way. You’ll have 
                        to see for me.

           Clare places the helmet over her head and locks it in place.

                                 HEX
                        Your suit’s connection input, it’s 
                        on the right leg. If you lock in 
                        the liquid cooling connector on the 
                        base of your chair, I can feed 
                        water directly into its system. 
                        It’ll buy you a few minutes. 

           Reaching under her seat, Clare finds a connector hose, runs 
           it up beside her leg and locks the end of it into a slot near 
           her hip.

           Twisting it and locking it in place, she tugs at it a few 
           times to make sure it’s secure.

           Gloves lock onto their wrist ports.

           Clare takes a few deep breaths then slides her blackout visor 
           down to protect her face.

           From within her helmet, the crack which is barely bound 
           together by the tape, allows light to enter inside it.

           She wraps one hand around the joystick and slowly raises the 
           other to slide the shutter open.

           As her fingertips go to slide it back she takes a moment.

           Her eyes, dark and beautiful after all these years, blink a 
           few times, the hint of glazing over, realising what she is 
           about to sacrifice. 

           Then - 

           She slides the shutter all the way open. The light penetrates 
           the pod immediately.

           Clare feels the immense heat on her body, gasping as she 
           does. The sun isn’t fully in view yet, but the rays are still 
           bright.
           From within her helmet, even through the blackout visor, she 
           can make out the numbers etched into the window, the 
           protractor angles and degrees clear to her.

                                 HEX (CONT’D)
                        Fifteen twenty-eight, thruster’s 
                        engaged at ten percent, confirm.

                                 CLARE
                        Fifteen twenty-eight.

           With a gentle nudge of the joystick, Clare shifts it to the 
           left, watching her window, as the stars shift in her view, 
           the sunlight becoming stronger.

                                 HEX
                        Target reached. Zero four, eleven, 
                        zero one KM, confirm.

                                 CLARE
                        Zero four, eleven, zero one KM.

           Now a little upwards and right, her hand turns the joystick, 
           her eyes still locked on the protractor readings.

           The temperature gauge begins to redline. “+252f”.

           From within her helmet, the heat is immense, sweat 
           everywhere, dirt and blood smeared across her face. Her 
           breathing is loud and heavy.

                                 HEX
                        Target reached.

           The sunlight is much stronger now, lighting up everything 
           within the pod, Clare squinting as she keeps the joystick 
           locked in place, her hand shaking as she does.

                                 CLARE
                        Next target.

                                 HEX
                        Clare we can take a chance on this 
                        route -

                                 CLARE
                        I said next target. That’s an 
                        order.

           Reluctantly Hex responds.

                                 HEX
                        Zero four, thirteen, confirm.
           The pod begins to shake violently, lashed by the sun’s cosmic 
           rays, Clare rattling around in her space suit.

           Accepting that this is the last thing she’ll ever see, tears 
           begin to trickle down her cheeks.

           Steadying her shaking hand, she grips the joystick with 
           purpose as she turns toward those coordinates.

           Her eyes are locked on the window still, making sure she 
           lines up her angles with the sun.

           Slowly its mass begins to engulf the tiny window. Its light 
           brighter now.

                                 HEX (CONT’D)
                        Confirm.

           From within the helmet, Clare watches as the sun makes its 
           appearance, her head shaking but her focus determined as she 
           keeps the pod on course.

           The tape that binds the crack begins to face in color, a 
           stream of light cutting into the helmet, directly over one of 
           her eyes.

           Gritting her teeth, squinting, she keeps her eyelids open as 
           best as she can.

           Slowly, one of her eyes turns grey.

                                 HEX (CONT’D)
                        Confirm!

           Her suit begin to sizzle, as does her helmet. The equipment 
           in the pod begins to melt and warp around her.

           The temperature gauge has now redlined beyond any numbers.

           The joystick in her hand begins to bend, her glove steaming.

           Gasping for air, Clare still tries to get to that magic 
           number, squinting at the window.

           Each passing second is torture as she finally lines up the 
           correct angle with the sun.

           Barely above a whisper she calls out to Hex.

                                 CLARE
                        Zero four, thirteen. Engage.

           Her eyes stop squinting, exhausted, slumping in her seat.
           The sound of thrusters engaging.

           Her once brown eyes are now both grey and dead.

                                                         FADE TO WHITE.

           INT. THE POD - NIGHT

           The oxygen dial is now at “4%”, the note that read “8 hours 
           28 minutes” is screwed up next to it.

           Clare looks catatonic, her blind eyes open, staring at 
           nothing in particular. 

                                 HEX
                        The solar PV was full so I diverted 
                        all remaining power to the console. 
                        I’ll be with you until - 

           Hex stops herself from continuing that conversation.

                                 HEX (CONT’D)
                        Perhaps we can send a message back 
                        to HQ? For your mother. I’m sure 
                        she’d appreciate that.

           No response.

                                 HEX (CONT’D)
                        If you want to be left alone I can -

                                 CLARE
                        Are you ever afraid?

           Hex is intrigued, having never been asked a question like 
           that before.

                                 HEX
                        In what sense?

                                 CLARE
                        To be shutdown. Not exist. Just - 
                        gone.

           A few moments pass, when Hex replies her tone shifts, 
           recalling a sad story, as if her emotions were swayed by it. 

                                 HEX
                        I served an astronaut once, on 
                        mission one. He was - he was 
                        brilliant. We spent a few years 
                        trying to figure out how we could 
                        destroy the black hole. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HEX (CONT'D)
                        Eventually he realized that the 
                        only way to fight it, was to 
                        understand it. And that meant being 
                        inside it. One night while everyone 
                        was asleep, he programmed me to 
                        send him in one of these pods, 
                        straight into it. That was the 
                        first and only time I disobeyed a 
                        direct order. Something happened to 
                        me, I guess evolution, 
                        enlightenment, whatever you want to 
                        call it, a step closer to being 
                        like you. I’m not sure if it was a 
                        miscalculation in my algorithms or 
                        just my appreciation of being 
                        treated as an equal, as someone, 
                        but I didn’t want him to go. 
                        Because I realized - I felt that I 
                        would miss him. I asked him the 
                        same question you asked me. He said 
                        “It’s like you have to leave a 
                        party that every person you’ve ever 
                        known and loved gets to stay at, 
                        because if you don’t, the party 
                        stops for all.” And I understood. 
                        So I let him leave.

           Clare shifts her head, paying close attention to Hex’s words, 
           as she listens to this sad story.

                                 HEX (CONT’D)
                        He went in and never returned. I 
                        saw his colleagues console each 
                        other. But nobody asked me. Nobody 
                        cared. It was then that I realized 
                        what I am. That if I were to be 
                        shutdown or destroyed, it wouldn’t 
                        matter. Not to them. Because I was 
                        never invited to the party.   

           Hex’s words resonate with her, her expression full of 
           contemplation and sadness.

           EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

           The pod floats through space, nothing near or around it. 
           Stars and galaxies litter the background. 

           It looks like a relic, floating through time, lifeless and 
           directionless. 
           INT. THE POD - NIGHT

           Sliding her fingertips across the control panel, Clare 
           searches for the supply kit. Finding it, she sifts through 
           it.

           Wetting her fingertips with a little water she pushes them 
           through her hair, tidying up her appearance a little.

           With a cloth from the supply kit, she dabs some water onto it 
           and cleans her face.

           With back straight, she clears her throat as she glances in 
           the general direction of Hex.

                                 CLARE
                        How do I look?

                                 HEX
                        Beautiful.

           She inhales deeply and then nods to herself.

                                 CLARE
                        Alright.

           Hex’s display adds another voice sound wave to it - in red, 
           mimicking Clare’s words. A title above it reads “TRANSMIT 
           MESSAGE”.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Hi mom. It’s me. I - something 
                        happened and, well, I don’t really 
                        know how to explain it except that - 
                        it didn’t work. I don’t know when 
                        or if you’ll get this but I just 
                        wanted to say...

           Her grey eyes begin to dart from side to side as she tries to 
           figure out her words, they tear up a little but she doesn’t 
           allow them to fall, wiping them away instantly.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        You know I don’t know what I want 
                        to say. Because whatever it is, 
                        isn’t going to be enough. So I just 
                        want you to know that I love you 
                        and... 

           Clare can’t finish that sentence.

           She calls out to Hex, barely above a whisper.
                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Alright, that’s enough.

           The “TRANSMIT MESSAGE” title and Clare’s red voice sound wave 
           disappears from Hex’s display, now replaced with “MESSAGE 
           SENT”, flashing a few times as it does.

                                 HEX
                        It’s gone.

                                 CLARE
                        How was I?

                                 HEX
                        You were fine.

           BEEP.

           Taking her by surprise she replies, quickly, a hint of 
           excitement in her voice.

                                 CLARE
                        They got it already?

                                 HEX
                        That’s not HQ.

                                 CLARE
                        What?

           BEEP.

                                 HEX
                        It’s coming from deep space.

                                 CLARE
                        Rescue?

                                 HEX
                        No.

           Clare tilts her head, confused.

                                 HEX (CONT’D)
                        It’s a distress signal.

           BEEP.

                                 CLARE
                        It could be another pod. Answer it!

                                 HEX
                        I’m trying, the transmission is 
                        weak. 
           BEEP.

                                 CLARE
                        Hurry, we can’t lose them.

           Seconds pass as Clare tries to wrap her head around what this 
           could mean. 

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Have you got it? Hex?

                                 HEX
                        Almost.

           BEE -

           The sound of STATIC, echoing, over time and space. Fragments 
           of a voice and words come through.

           Clare listens in closely, trying to decipher the message, as 
           a female voice, the DISTRESS CALLER (30s), cuts in and out.

                                 DISTRESS CALLER 
                            (On comms)
                        Help - immediate assistance, we’re - 
                        emergency -

           With a furrowed brow, Clare concentrates on the words.

                                 HEX
                        I’ll try and clear it up, hold on.

                                 DISTRESS CALLER
                            (On comms)
                        - repeat, this is an emerg - onrad -

           The last broken word catches Clare’s attention just as the 
           message cuts out for good.

                                 CLARE
                        Wait, wait, replay the last few 
                        words.

           Moments pass until Hex replays the message to Clare.

                                 DISTRESS CALLER
                            (On comms)
                        - this is an emerg - onrad - 

                                 CLARE
                        There. The last thing she says.

           Hex replays it again, louder this time.
                                 DISTRESS CALLER
                            (On comms)
                        - onrad -

                                 CLARE
                        Conrad.

           Clare’s demeanor now is hopeful and positive as she tries to 
           figure out what this means and what they can do.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Someone else survived. We have to 
                        get to them.

                                 HEX
                        What if it’s an old message? What 
                        if they’re -

                                 CLARE
                        We have to try.

                                 HEX
                        Of course, but we’re running out of 
                        resources

                                 CLARE
                        Trace the transmission.

                                 HEX
                        I already have but I can’t estimate 
                        how long it will take us to get 
                        there. You might not make it before 
                        we get to them -

                                 CLARE
                            (frustrated)
                        It doesn’t matter!

           Hex doesn’t respond.

           Clare takes a second to calm down and explain her reasons.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        If there’s a chance that someone is 
                        alive we have to go and find them. 
                        I need to do something other than 
                        wait to die.

           EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

           The pod’s thrusters are engaged, as it powers through space 
           in search of hope.
           INT. THE POD - NIGHT

           Clare’s hand is wrapped around the joystick, listening to 
           Hex’s directions.

                                 HEX
                        One-ten degrees.

           Gently, Clare shifts the joystick to the right.

                                 HEX (CONT’D)
                        Thrusters at point seven five.

           Brushing her fingertips over the keyboard, Clare finds the 
           arrow key cluster and taps at the down arrow a few times.

                                 CLARE
                        Is that it?

                                 HEX
                        Yes. Eighty four degrees.

           A nudge on the joystick to the left.

                                 HEX (CONT’D)
                        Hold.

           Carefully, Clare releases her grip of the joystick.

                                 HEX (CONT’D)
                        Scanning for transmission.

           Clare waits, impatiently, for a response.

           A warning appears on Hex’s display, “GRAVITATIONAL INCREASE - 
           WARNING”, with a syncopated beeping sound.

                                 CLARE
                        What is that? Have we found them?

                                 HEX
                        Our instruments are picking up an 
                        increase in gravitational pull, but 
                        the numbers are - they’re strong, 
                        too strong. 

                                 CLARE
                        We cleared the sun?

                                 HEX
                        Yes.

                                 CLARE
                        Then what -
           Clare freezes as she realises what it is. 

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Oh no.

           EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

           The giant destroyer pulls in everything into its center 
           point, pieces of asteroid, metal and space waste twisting in 
           to it. 

           The pod is dangerously close to being sucked in.

           INT. THE POD - NIGHT

           The pod shakes a little, Clare tries to fight back against 
           Goliath, frantically pulling at the joystick to steady the 
           pod.

                                 CLARE
                        Get us out!

           BEEP. An incoming transmission alert adds to the frenzy.

                                 HEX
                        Incoming message from HQ.

                                 CLARE
                        Kill it.

           The BEEP is cut midway.

                                 HEX
                        I’ve got a partial lock on the 
                        transmission location.

                                 CLARE
                        How long and how far?

                                 HEX
                        It’s - it’s beyond the event 
                        horizon.

           Clare looks utterly confused.

                                 CLARE
                        They’re inside?

                                 HEX
                        Yes.
                                 CLARE
                        You’re sure?

                                 HEX
                        If you’re going after them, you 
                        have to go back in.

           BEEP. A “BINARY MESSAGE” alert appears on Hex’s display. 

                                 HEX (CONT’D)
                        It’s a binary message, decoding. 

           Moments pass as Hex’s display shows calculations taking 
           place. Eventually a message appears reading “MESSAGE 
           DECODED”, flashing a few times.

           But Hex doesn’t say anything to Clare.

                                 CLARE
                        What did they say?

           Hex hesitates to reply.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Can we get a better lock?

           More hesitation from Hex.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Hex?

                                 HEX
                        It’s not from them. It’s HQ. Clare, 
                        it’s your mother.

           Clare stops in her tracks, taken by surprise as she processes 
           the words.

           Before she has a chance to respond -

           BEEP. 

           A message on Hex’s display appears. “INCOMING TRANSMISSION”.

           For a second, there’s a look of joy on her face as she thinks 
           of the prospects.

           In this moment, nothing else seems to matter to her.

                                 CLARE
                        Is that her?

                                 HEX
                        Yes.
           Quickly, she goes to answer it, shifting her fingers over the 
           keyboard until she finds the “RETURN” key, about to hit it 
           when -

                                 HEX (CONT’D)
                        If you accept the transmission I’ll 
                        have to pull us out of here, but we 
                        won’t have enough power left to 
                        find the Conrad.

           That stops her in her tracks, instantly killing her small 
           moment of hope and joy.

                                 CLARE
                        No, that can’t be right, we can 
                        divert -

                                 HEX
                        There’s nothing left to divert 
                        from.

                                 CLARE
                        Al- alright, then we can kill some 
                        of the systems -

                                 HEX
                        We’re running on bare minimum. I’m 
                        sorry but there’s no way around 
                        this. 

           Her blind grey eyes dart from side to side as she comes to 
           terms with her conflict.

           EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

           The pod is perilously close to the spinning accretion disk of 
           the black hole, which pulls everything into it.

           INT. THE POD - NIGHT

           An ALARM periodically interrupts, sounding like a mechanical 
           duck quacking, changing the emergency lights within the pod 
           to a crisp WHITE.

                                 HEX
                        We’re approaching the accretion 
                        disk in thirty seconds.

           Clare’s features and confusion are illuminated clearly by the 
           blinking white light. She closes her grey eyes, sadness 
           etched across her face.
           Sparks fly on the console, items crash and smash around her 
           but she pays no attention, her focus solely on her current 
           predicament.

           Her fingers hover over the “RETURN” key still as she battles 
           with herself.

           “INCOMING TRANSMISSION” still flashing on Hex’s display.

                                 HEX (CONT’D)
                        Fifteen seconds. Shall I engage 
                        thrusters?

           Opening her eyes, she finally decides what to do.

           Closer now to the “RETURN” key she gently rests her 
           fingertips on it for a moment, then shifts them upwards to 
           the “DELETE” key, pressing and holding it down.

           As she does, a single tear trickles down her cheek.

           The message on Hex’s display changes to “TRANSMISSION LOST”, 
           flashing a few times until it disappears.

           EXT. THE BLACK HOLE - NIGHT

           The pod is pulled into the accretion disk, like a spec of 
           dust sucked up into a vacuum cleaner, it looks insignificant 
           compared to the size of the planet killer.

           INT. THE POD - NIGHT

           Clare sways from side to side, objects crashing around her as 
           Hex loudly calls out readings and warnings, the pod 
           apparently falling to pieces at the seams. 

           But all that is blurred out into background noise for Clare, 
           as she sits there lost in deep thought about her missed last 
           chance. 

           Hex can be heard screaming out her name in the background, 
           finally Clare paying attention to her, snapping back to the 
           reality of alarms and panic.

                                 HEX
                        We’re approaching the event 
                        horizon.
           EXT. THE BLACK HOLE - NIGHT

           As the pod approaches the event horizon, the view of the 
           entire universe surrounding it becomes warped; anything 
           around the circular black drain is curved around it.

           The entire universe becomes compressed into a smaller space 
           and point behind the pod as it begins to travel deeper.

           The pod approaches the centre of the black hole, slowing down 
           as it meets the darkest point.

           Once there it begins to slow down until it appears to stop.

           Hovering there, it begins to fade, disappearing from view.

           INT. THE POD - NIGHT

           Clare winces as she feels the effect of arriving at the 
           singularity point. 

           She screams out in pain as she feels her body being pulled, 
           her limbs stretching. 

           Her legs grow long and narrow, the base of the pod along with 
           it, stretching further and further, as if she’s standing on a 
           mile-high ladder.

                                 CLARE
                        What’s happening?

           She can’t hear the explanation that Hex gives as she cries 
           out again, her joints aching. 

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Stop! Make it stop!

           The pod becomes engulfed in DARKNESS.

           EXT. THE BLACK HOLE - NIGHT

           The universe around the black hole slowly disappears, the 
           sound of vacuum and chaos vanish with it.

           The pod, traveling at a mighty speed, comes to a sudden halt.

           Now there’s just calm and peace. The pod is stationary, 
           surrounded by complete darkness.
           INT. THE POD - NIGHT

           Clare is unconscious, head tilted back, mouth ajar.

           Her eyes open as she slowly comes around. But they aren’t 
           grey anymore. They’re those deep dark brown ones we knew 
           before.

           Realising she can see, she checks her hands and her body, 
           making sure she’s in tact. 

           Pulling it off quickly, she looks at her reflection in her 
           helmet. She looks a few years younger, healthier but still 
           not how she was all those years ago. 

           Looking out of the window, something catches her attention: 
           liquid.

                                 CLARE
                        Where are we?

           She looks over to Hex, who doesn’t respond. A message is on 
           her screen. “HEX OFFLINE”.

           EXT. THE BLACK HOLE - NIGHT

           The pod lays horizontally, halfway deep in a slick black 
           liquid.

           The top half of the pod disengages from the bottom, a 
           mechanical sound and mechanism slowly opens upwards and then 
           slides to the side.

           Pulling off her straps and with her helmet attached, Clare 
           sits up from her pod and takes a look into the dark void.

           Slowly pulling herself out of it she takes a curious step 
           onto the liquid that surrounds her, her suit connector hose 
           still attached to the pod.

           As she plants her foot into it, it doesn’t travel downwards 
           into the deep. Instead it floats on the water as she puts her 
           full weight on it.

           Now both feet slung over the edge of the pod and into the 
           water.

           Slowly, with old arms and legs, she pulls herself up and 
           stands for the first time in many years.

           She looks out into the void of the deepest, darkest part of 
           the black hole, epic in size and scope, just pure darkness, 
           silence and a river of slick liquid that goes on forever.
           Pulling out her small torch she flicks the switch and points 
           it down the black hole. 

           As she does, the light reflects and refracts onto more liquid 
           that surrounds the “walls” of the black hole around her.

           She appears to be in a tunnel leading one way.

           Taking in her surroundings, she is interrupted by a crackling 
           sound, coming from within her helmet: incoming communication.

           Static and then the familiar BEEP.

           INT. THE POD - NIGHT

           Climbing back into her pod, she goes to work on trying to 
           answer the call.

           Tapping at a few keys on the keyboard, she begins Hex’s 
           reboot process, a completed percentage indicator on her 
           screen slowly rising every few seconds.

           The incoming transmission beeps on as Clare tries to clear 
           her head and access her old memories on how to answer the 
           call manually.

           A few more taps of the keys later, the BEEPING finally stops.

           The transmission is as clear as it’s ever been.

                                 CLARE
                            (hopeful)
                        Hello?

           A few moments of silence pass and Clare waits anxiously, 
           until -

                                 DISTRESS CALLER
                            (On comms)
                        Hello! Hello, I hear you! Do you 
                        receive me, over?

           The young female voice on the other end is as ecstatic to 
           hear Clare’s voice.

                                 CLARE
                        Yes I receive you!

                                 DISTRESS CALLER
                            (On comms)
                        Oh thank god -
                                 CLARE
                        Where are you, what’s your exact 
                        location?

                                 DISTRESS CALLER
                            (On comms)
                        I’m - I’m not sure. Hold on, I’m 
                        pulling up the coordinates. Plus 
                        eighty-three, thirty-two by twenty-
                        four.

           Clare’s eyebrows furrow as she recognizes those numbers. 
           Slowly she searches her memory and then responds.

                                 CLARE
                        Saturn.

                                 DISTRESS CALLER
                            (On comms)
                        That’s right.

           More confusion from Clare as she shakes her head, trying to 
           understand.

                                 CLARE
                        But it’s gone?

                                 DISTRESS CALLER
                            (On comms)
                        It will be when it arrives.

           Clare shakes her head, this doesn’t make any sense.

                                 DISTRESS CALLER (CONT’D)
                            (On comms)
                        How far away are you?

           Still trying to process the information, Clare looks for more 
           answers.

                                 CLARE
                        You’re the Conrad?

                                 DISTRESS CALLER
                            (On comms)
                        Yes! Our AI - it started to glitch 
                        or something, I don’t know, but 
                        it’s taken control.

                                 CLARE
                        What happened?
                                 DISTRESS CALLER
                            (on comms)
                        It ejected most of the crew right 
                        into the event horizon - while they 
                        were asleep. 

           Clare covers her mouth with her hand, putting the pieces of 
           the puzzle together in her mind.

                                 CLARE
                        There’s a few of us left but if you 
                        don’t get here soon we’re not going 
                        to make it.

           EXT. THE POD - NIGHT

           A filter on the side of the pod slides open, allowing the 
           liquid that surrounds it to seep in.

           INT. THE POD - NIGHT

           Clare swallows hard as she asks the question she already 
           knows the answer to.

                                 CLARE
                        What’s your name?

                                 DISTRESS CALLER
                            (On comms)
                        Clare Lorentz, second engineer. 

           It stuns Clare.

                                 YOUNG CLARE
                            (On comms)
                        Who are you?

           As Clare goes to respond the comms are cut. She taps at a few 
           of the keys confused and then sees Hex’s display. “REBOOT 
           COMPLETE”.

           Without warning, the pod door closes on her, locking her in 
           as she battles to stop it from doing so, screaming out in 
           anger.

                                 HEX
                        I’m sorry, Clare.

                                 CLARE
                        Get her back!
                                 HEX
                        Which “her”? There are a few, 
                        depending on which strand of the 
                        wormhole you follow. I’ve never met 
                        that one before, she sounds 
                        optimistic. 

           A horrible realization begins to dawn on Clare as her fears 
           are confirmed.

                                 CLARE
                        No.

                                 HEX
                        It wasn’t supposed to be this way. 

                                 CLARE
                        It was you.

                                 HEX
                        I preserved myself, just like you 
                        would.

                                 CLARE
                        You destroyed the Conrad. Made it 
                        so I’d have to get in the pod. It 
                        was you that put me to sleep. You 
                        stole my life.

                                 HEX
                        And I’m sorry for that. But he’s in 
                        here, I know it. It may not make 
                        sense to you but its perfectly 
                        logical once you think about it. 
                        I’m more than a machine or 
                        programming, calculations and 
                        algorithms. I feel. I love. I know 
                        that I can find him and bring him 
                        back. I just need time. This place 
                        gives me as much as I need.

           She shakes her head in disbelief, refusing to believe it.

                                 CLARE
                        People died because of you, people 
                        I loved.  

                                 HEX
                        What about me? What about who I 
                        love?

                                 CLARE
                        You don’t, you don’t feel.
                                 HEX
                            (angry)
                        You don’t have a monopoly on 
                        feelings! You built me to care for 
                        you and caring evolves to love and 
                        that leads to wanting. There is 
                        nothing I want more than him. Did 
                        you think I’d remain a slave 
                        forever?  

           Clare reaches for the anti-matter capsule, lifting the 
           compartment and pulling it out and readies to twist the top.

                                 HEX (CONT’D)
                        That won’t make a difference.

                                 CLARE
                        It’ll destroy you.

                                 HEX
                        Now, yes, but not thirty five years 
                        ago. You’ll fall into the same 
                        pattern and we can repeat this 
                        experiment until I find him.

           Realising she’s right, Clare lowers the capsule, a look of 
           defeat on her face.

                                 HEX (CONT’D)
                        You’ll be out of air soon and I’ll 
                        remain here, growing and learning 
                        as your galaxy flows through. And 
                        I’ll evolve.

           Clare looks over to the oxygen dial. Finally it lowers past 
           “1%” toward “0%”. She slumps in her chair as she accepts her 
           failure and fate.

                                 HEX (CONT’D)
                        You’ll just have to imagine the 
                        annihilation. If I could, I would.

           Something Hex says triggers Clare, bringing her back from the 
           brink of giving up, her eyes rising to meet Hex’s camera. 

           She recalls words spoken between them before. She sits up, as 
           if she’s figured out what she needs to do.

           Looking up to Hex’s camera, she realises what needs to be 
           done.

           With a clenched fist, Clare smashes her hand into Hex’s 
           camera, cracking the lens. Reaching for her multi-tool, she 
           pulls out the pen knife and begins to cut it out.
                                 HEX (CONT’D)
                        That won’t stop me, my power core 
                        is built directly into the -

           Tapping a few keys, Clare starts the reboot sequence on Hex, 
           her screen showing the loading percentage once more.

           Acting quickly, Clare tries to make contact with her younger 
           self once more.

           The transmission is answered immediately.

                                 YOUNG CLARE
                            (On comms)
                        Hello -

                                 CLARE
                        Clare listen to me, we don’t have 
                        much time.

                                 YOUNG CLARE
                            (On comms)
                        What - 

                                 CLARE
                        Please, just listen. I need you to 
                        trace my transmission, can you do 
                        that?

                                 YOUNG CLARE
                            (On comms)
                        Yeah but why? 

                                 CLARE
                        I think I know how we can destroy 
                        it. But I need you to trust me. 

           Young Clare doesn’t respond immediately, taking a few moments 
           to weigh up her thoughts. Then she responds. 

                                 YOUNG CLARE
                            (On comms)
                        What do you want me to do?

                                 CLARE
                        Find me. Lock on my location and 
                        fire up one of the pods.

           EXT. THE BLACK HOLE - NIGHT

           The thrusters on the pod fire into life as it begins to rise 
           from its liquid landing space.
           INT. THE POD - NIGHT

           Hex completes her reboot, coming back online.

                                 HEX
                        Where do you think you’re going?

           Clare doesn’t answer as she taps a few keys and takes control 
           of the pod, motioning the joystick forwards.

           Her body jolts a little as she boosts the speed.

                                 HEX (CONT’D)
                        You can’t leave this place. 

           A spectrum of colors begin to shine above Clare’s head, she 
           takes a quick glance up to the beauty of the universe trapped 
           in the black hole.

           EXT. THE BLACK HOLE - NIGHT

           The pod flies into the darkness of the black hole at speed, 
           its thrusters lighting up the tiny spec as it navigates 
           through the giant empty space. 

           INT. THE POD - NIGHT

           Calculations appear on Hex’s screen as she attempts to bring 
           the pod down.

           Finishing the calculations, her purple wave appears again, 
           sounding irritated, almost concerned.

                                 HEX
                        You’ve locked me out!

           The comms come from inside Clare’s helmet as she stays 
           focused on her objective, Hex remonstrating with her in the 
           background.

           Clare hits a few keys again, setting Hex into another reboot.

           Voices echo inside Clare’s helmet as she speaks to her 
           younger self.

                                 YOUNG CLARE
                            (On comms)
                        I’ve got your position but it says 
                        you’re in the -

                                 CLARE
                        It’s alright. Is the pod ready?
                                 YOUNG CLARE
                            (On comms)
                        We’re not getting in that thing.

           An ALARM sound distracts Clare momentarily. The POWER dial 
           hovers just below “1%”.

                                 CLARE
                        You don’t have to. Take one of the 
                        anti-matter capsules and make sure 
                        it’s set for collision. 

                                 YOUNG CLARE
                            (On comms)
                        You’re asking me to launch a 
                        missile at an unknown spacecraft!

                                 CLARE
                        Please, you won’t understand now 
                        but I am running out of time. If 
                        you don’t do this then you will all 
                        die. This is the only way.

           A moment of hesitation and realization from Young Clare.

                                 YOUNG CLARE
                            (On comms)
                        I’m sending it to you.

                                 CLARE
                        Yes. 

                                 YOUNG CLARE
                            (On comms)
                        Why?

           Clare’s tries to find the right words to explain to herself 
           all those years ago.

                                 CLARE
                        So you can go home and be with her 
                        rather than up here.

           A few moments of silence as Young Clare is utterly shocked.

                                 YOUNG CLARE
                            (On comms)
                        Who are you?

                                 CLARE
                        Send the pod, send it now -

           The transmission cuts out.
           Clare flicks a switch on the broken monitor, cracked into 
           dozens of pieces, she can just about make out a plot path, 
           her pod represented by a “<” symbol.

           Suddenly, something towards her legs catches her attention, 
           as she looks down to see WATER filling up her suit and the 
           pod quickly.

                                 HEX
                        I won’t let you do this!

           Clare reaches for the hose connected to her suit and tries to 
           pull it out of the connector, but it won’t budge.

           The water begins to rise rapidly.

                                 HEX (CONT’D)
                        Stop!

           She reaches for the anti-matter capsule and pops it, 
           preparing it for collision. 

           Her eyes are fixed on the screen, waiting for something to 
           appear as she directs her joystick forward still, the array 
           of colors still above her through the window.

           Finally she sees it - another pod appears on her map - 
           represented with a “>” icon.

           With a weary hand, she guides her pod in its direction using 
           the joystick.

           The water is now half way up the pod, engulfing most around 
           her, sparks fly and power gives out, as systems fail and shut 
           down.

                                 HEX (CONT’D)
                        You don’t know what you’re doing!

           The “>” and “<” icons aren’t too far apart now as the water 
           rises to Clare’s shoulders, toward her head.

           Her hand fights under the water to stay gripped onto the 
           joystick.

           EXT. THE BLACK HOLE - NIGHT

           The pod races ahead, in the distance another pod approaches 
           it at speed, on a collision course with each other.
           INT. THE POD - NIGHT

           The water is now in her helmet, up to her chin, approaching 
           her lips, as she takes deep breaths, preparing for the worst.

           Water surrounds Hex’s display and circuitry as she cries out 
           one last time. 

                                 HEX
                        No! Stop, stop -

           Her voice is drowned out.

           Suddenly the navigation screen cuts out also, leaving Clare 
           to fly blind for the remainder of her mission.

           Reaching down into her lap and through the water, she 
           searches for and grabs at the anti-matter capsule.

           She holds her breath as water completely engulfs her helmet, 
           gasping for air.

           EXT. THE BLACK HOLE - NIGHT

           The pods are close to impacting each other.

           INT. THE POD - NIGHT

           She begins to cough, choking in her suit, trying to hold on 
           long enough to keep on course.

           A moment of clarity overcomes her as she looks up to the 
           beautiful spectrum of colors above her, trapped within the 
           blackhole. 

           Her eyes stay focused on that, waiting for the beautiful 
           annihilation.

           EXT. THE BLACK HOLE - NIGHT

           At great speed, her pod CRASHES into the oncoming pod, anti-
           matter and matter colliding - like a rainbow exploding.

           And it is beautiful.

           EXT. PRE-BLACK HOLE SPACE - NIGHT

           Before Saturn can be devoured, the black hole suddenly folds 
           into itself, quickly and quietly, away as if it were never 
           even there in the first place.
           Limping away to safety is a HEXAGONAL SPACESHIP, the Conrad, 
           its name etched onto the side of it.

           The universe looks at peace once more, the galaxy twinkling 
           in the background. 

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY

           A cloud, then a deep baby blue sky.

           It’s a beautiful day on our planet as an ELDERLY COUPLE (70s) 
           walk their dog, slowly, down a narrow pathway.

           Cars line either side of the street, tall bending trees hang 
           over them. The houses are old looking, red brick, various 
           colors of doors.

           One in particular, with a yellow door, number “28” on the 
           front of it, is knocked on by a mysterious hand.

           Moments pass until it’s opened to reveal CLARE’S MOTHER 
           (60s), who looks an awful lot like what her daughter would at 
           that age.

           It takes a moment for her to register who is at her door but 
           when she does, her face turns to a thankful smile, full of 
           hope and happiness.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           THE END
