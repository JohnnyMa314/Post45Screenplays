           INT. THE MANSION - DAWN

           Someone slumbers beneath the sheets, twilight obscuring their 
           identity for now. A shadow falls over the bed. The cast of a 
           killer, holding a knife. 

           The shadow advances. The person in the bed stirs and rolls 
           over, revealing an attractive, naked man. Sensing danger, his 
           eyes fly open.

                                 MAN
                        Shit. 

           The camera reveals the shadow in the room. A woman, in a 
           cocktail dress, the zipper open to her lower back. She holds 
           one stiletto in her hand—the “knife.” She is whispering; 
           frantic.  

                                 WOMAN
                        I fell asleep! I didn’t mean to! 
                        I’ve been so exhausted lately. Help 
                        me with this thing... 

           She backs up against the edge of the bed. He zips her up. 

                                 MAN
                        What time is it?

           The woman paces the room, looking for something.

                                 WOMAN
                        Early. Maybe no one will notice I 
                        didn’t sleep in my room? But I 
                        mean, whatever, right?

           She laughs nervously as she tears the room apart. We notice a 
           tuxedo has been hung on the door of a wardrobe. There’s a 
           suitcase on the floor. The decor is a bit grand, a bit 
           shabby. A luxury hotel room, maybe. In need of an update. 

                                 MAN
                        Just say you ran out for coffee.

           The woman gestures at what she’s wearing.

                                 WOMAN
                        Looking like smacked ass in my 
                        rehearsal dinner dress?!

                                 MAN
                        Keep your voice down! You have to 
                        go. 

           The woman holds up her lone shoe. 
                                 WOMAN
                        I have to find the other one. Or 
                        I’ll be the bridesmaid in flip 
                        flops. 

                                 MAN
                        I’ll get it to you somehow. 

           The woman hooks the chain strap of her purse over her 
           shoulder. 

                                 WOMAN
                        Pictures at noon so it has to 
                        before—

                                 MAN
                             (panicked)
                        I know! Just go!

           The woman gives him an odd look on her way out. 

           INT. THE MANSION HALLWAY - DAWN

           The woman closes the door behind her, gently. The hallway is 
           plushly carpeted, the walls adorned with oil portraits of 
           smug white men. Mahogany side tables frame the runner, topped 
           with heavy bronze lamps. The house is from another era, or at 
           least decorated to appear as much. Look closer, and you’ll 
           see that the silk painted wallpaper is peeling in corners; 
           the carpet unraveling at the edges. Pipes clink; floorboards 
           creak. The place is in dire need of a face lift. 

           The woman tiptoes down the hall, passing a a series of doors, 
           each with a room number. Some sort of hotel; maybe a bed and 
           breakfast. Just as she is about to reach the landing, a door 
           in front of her opens and a man steps into the hallway in his 
           boxers, holding his phone up, searching for a signal.

           The woman clamps a hand over her mouth, stifling a gasp. She 
           starfishes the wall while the man continues to wave his phone 
           around. He pauses at the top stair for what feels like an 
           eternity, before deciding to try the first floor for service. 
           The woman exhales as he descends the stairs. She counts to 
           ten, then follows him. It’s the only way out.  

           INT. THE MANSION - STAIRWELL - DAWN

           The woman checks around the bend when she reaches the large 
           balcony stair. No one waiting for her. She continues. 
           INT. THE MANSION - FIRST FLOOR - DAWN

           The woman tiptoes through the central court of the mansion. 
           The space is palatial and ornately appointed, bracketed by a 
           wide, arcing double staircase. The woman looks around and, 
           seeing no one, makes a dash for the other set of stairs. She 
           freezes when she hears a key in the lock outside the door. 

           She has but a split second to hide. She ducks inside the 
           downstairs bathroom just as the door opens.  

           INT. THE MANSION - DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM - DAWN

           The woman holds her breath, listening. 

           INT. THE MANSION - FOYER - DAWN

           Two people enter the mansion, carrying crates of wine—the 
           caterers and her assistant, here early to set up. 

                                 CATERER
                        Just stack them here for now. It’s 
                        about to pour.

           They set the crates on the long console table, next to the 
           bathroom door. One is placed precariously close to the edge. 

           INT. THE MANSION - DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM - DAWN

           The woman listens, her ear pressed to the door. She hears 
           feet on gravel. She is just about to open the door when she 
           notices a rustling in the stall behind her. 

           The woman whips around, clutching her lone stiletto to her 
           chest. There are three stalls in the bathroom, all with full 
           length doors, all closed. She opens one door. Empty. The 
           rustling continues. 

           INT. THE MANSION - FOYER - DAWN

           The caterer and her assistant appear with another crate of 
           wine, setting it on the table. 

           INT. THE MANSION - DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM - DAWN

           The woman opens the second stall door. Empty. The rustling is 
           louder, more frantic. She takes a deep breath and reaches for 
           the third door knob... 
           EXT. THE MANSION - DRIVEAWAY - DAWN

           The caterer’s assistant stops when he hears a faint cry. 

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Did you hear that?

           The caterer has her head in the back of the van. Raindrops 
           begin to speckle the driveway. 

                                 CATERER
                        Hurry, will you?

           INT. THE MANSION - FOYER - DAWN

           HOLD on the door to the bathroom. We hear a struggle inside.

           EXT. THE MANSION - DRIVEAWAY - DAWN

           The caterer and her assistant have their heads halfway in the 
           van. The rain picks up, drowning out the sound of the attack. 

           INT. THE MANSION - FOYER - DAWN

           The camera holds on the bathroom door and the table next to 
           it, where the crates of wine have been stacked unevenly. A 
           body slams into the bathroom door from the inside, hard 
           enough to send a reverberation through the wall. The crate of 
           wine moves one inch closer to the edge. The body slams 
           against the inside of the bathroom door again, harder. In the 
           grim silence that follows, a small pool of blood seeps under 
           the bathroom door, pooling in the entryway. 

           EXT. THE MANSION - DRIVEAWAY - DAWN

           The caterer and her assistant rush for the door as the sky 
           opens up. A loud crash eclipses the rain, startling them. 
           They look at each other, eyes wide. 

           INT. THE MANSION - FOYER - DAWN

           Hold on the horrified face of the caterer in the doorway. 

                                 CATERER
                        Please no.

           The shot widens to reveal the source of her distress: a crate 
           of wine is upturned on the floor, bottles broken, red wine 
           everywhere. It mixes with the blood, concealing the crime. 
                                 CATERER (CONT’D)
                        The ‘97 Piedmont! 

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Want me to get a Taskrabbit to 
                        replace it?

                                 CATERER
                        Another case of the ‘97 will put us 
                        over budget.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        What do you want me to—

                                 CATERER
                        Get something red and on sale. Then 
                        tell the bartender to get these 
                        people sloshed at cocktail hour so 
                        they don’t notice they’re drinking 
                        Cupcake Cab with their filet 
                        mignon.

           The caterer takes a step back as the blood and wine mixture 
           creeps dangerously close to her feet. 

                                 CATERER (CONT’D)
                        And find a mop for this. 
                             (sniffs the air)
                        And Febreeze or something. 
                             (sniffs again)
                        Maybe we dodged a bullet. Smells 
                        like the ‘97 turned. 

           INT. THE MANSION - BRIDAL SUITE - LATER THAT MORNING 

           French manicured fingernails stroke a white silk wedding 
           dress, lovingly. Pull back to reveal a young woman in her 
           early twenties, very tan, very blonde, very skinny. She 
           reaches into the closet and removes the wedding dress on its 
           hanger, holding it in front of her body and admiring herself 
           in the full length mirror. The room is obscenely white and 
           lacy; a virgin bride’s boudoir on steroids. 

           The door to the bathroom opens and another woman walks out in 
           a towel, the shower running behind her. Her hair hasn’t seen 
           a brush in fourteen hours and she has mascara smudged under 
           her eyes. This is JULIE WHEELER, MD, PhD, 34, the bride. 

                                 JULIE
                        Uh. What are you doing?

           The young woman jumps three feet in the year, caught. This is 
           KAREN KULBACK, the wedding coordinator. Not the bride. 
                                 KAREN
                        Just seeing if your dress needed 
                        steaming! 

           She puts it back in the closet, running her fingers down the 
           material one last time, longingly.  

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                             (sighing)
                        It’s perfect though. 

           Behind her, Julie tries not to laugh as she digs through her 
           suitcase. Karen checks her watch, then consults her 
           clipboard.

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        Hair and makeup will be here in 
                        seven minutes.

           Julie finds her razor in her toiletry kit and lifts her arm, 
           examining her stubbly armpit. 

                                 JULIE
                        Yeah. Sorry. I thought I could get 
                        away with another day of not 
                        shaving but...

           She moves closer to Karen so she can see. 

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        What do you think? Probably should 
                        shave, right?

           Karen is appalled that this is even up for debate, but she is 
           a consummate professional, always. 

                                 KAREN
                        I don’t think a bride ever regrets 
                        shaving her underarms on her 
                        wedding day.  

           She looks at her clipboard as she reaches for the door. 

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        We should be on schedule for family 
                        portraits in the rose garden at 
                        noon. The photographer found the 
                        turn. 

                                 JULIE
                        Thanks, Karen. I didn’t realize he 
                        missed the turn. 
                                 KAREN
                        Most people do.
                             (beat)
                        I’ll give you your—

           She breaks off with a shrill scream as she opens the door to 
           the killer in a black mask. 

                                 MEG
                        That felt racist. 

           It’s not the killer. It’s MEG BRUNI, 35, Julie’s matron of 
           honor and best friend. She’s wearing a charcoal face mask. 

                                 KAREN
                        It was the face mask. Not 
                        your...not the...I am not racist. I 
                        preordered Michelle Obama’s book!

                                 MEG
                        You are a true ally.  

           Meg flops on Julie’s bed and folds her arms behind her head 
           with a sly grin. Something out the window makes Karen gasp.

                                 KAREN
                        Oh, no, no, no. The hydrangeas need 
                        at least two more hours in cool 
                        water! 

           Both Meg and Julie look out the window to see the florists 
           carrying in the table arrangements. Karen gives them a brave 
           if warworn smile. 

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        Do not panic. 

           Karen runs out of the room in a panic, clipboard clutched to 
           her chest. Meg and Julie look at each other and cackle. Meg 
           tosses something at Julie, wrapped in tissue paper. 

                                 MEG
                        Something borrowed.

           Julie unwraps the gift. It’s a white satin thong, BRIDE 
           bedazzled on the crotch in rhinestones.  

                                 JULIE
                        Your dirty underwear from 2010? 

                                 MEG
                        The satin tube sock I wore down the 
                        aisle required me to go commando. 
                                 JULIE
                        You looked like such a slice. And 
                        your wedding was fun. 
                             (beat; somber)
                        I hope this is fun.

                                 MEG
                        What’s not fun about this? I would 
                        have died to consummate my marriage 
                        in this room. 

           Julie takes inventory of the frilly, all white princess room.

                                 JULIE
                        It’s like engineered to make your

           Meg pats the bed, and Julie lays down next to her.

                        to do with her life than wear a 
                        blazer and run a tight ship?

           Julie half-smiles, still a little unsure about something.

           two of her bridesmaids walk in, proffering trays of 
           Starbucks, bottles of Veuve, and pitchers of orange juice. 
           This is SABRINA WEISENBERG and HEATHER JIANG, 34 and 35. 
           Heather is extremely pregnant.

                                 HEATHER
                        The closest Starbucks was like 
                        thirty minutes away and Waze

                        And then we had to stop for 
                        Dayquil. 

           Heather hands Julie her coffee. It reads: The Bride!

                        But it turned out to be a blessing 
                        in disguise—

           A third woman enters the room, a little awkwardly. This is 
           TABITHA HANOVER, late 20s.

           mixing the mimosas. She takes a big gulp of one and Sabrina 
           gives her a look. Heather gestures to her huge stomach.

                        It’s gonna need a tutor. 

                                 JULIE
                        Tabitha! I’m so sorry you had 
                        trouble finding the place. I should 
                        have given you directions from the 
                        city just in case.  

           Julie extends her hand. Tabitha shakes it, weakly. She gazes 
           around the room, awestruck. 

                                 TABITHA
                        Wow. This place...

           Julie laughs. Yup. “This place.”

                                 JULIE
                        It’s something. Right?

           Heather starts to pass out the mimosas. She’s made five. One 
           for Tabitha, one for Sabrina, one for Meg, one for Julie, and 
           one for....

                                 HEATHER

           EXT. THE MANSION - DRIVING RANGE - MORNING

           FOCUS on the face of the man in the bed from this morning. 
           This is DYLAN CUNNINGHAM, 37. The last known person to have 
           seen Becca alive. Pull back to reveal that he has just 
           thwacked a golf ball into the woods. His father, CHUCK 
           CUNNINGHAM, 65, is with him. Behind them, The Mansion looms, 
           and workers set up chairs for the ceremony. The rain gave way 
           to a clear and chilly fall day. Before them, a sharp drop, 
           and then the land rises up again. It’s a breathtaking 
           backdrop, a wildly romantic place to say I do. 

                                 CHUCK
                        Striped that one.  

           Dylan wipes sweat off his brow.

                        Might have broke a window in the 
                        community center.  

           Dylan smirks. There’s nothing but acres of trees below them.  

                                 DYLAN
                        I thought this is supposed to be 
                        the community center.  
           He gestures at The Mansion behind him. 

                                 CHUCK
                        That’s the farm to table 
                        restaurant. 

           Chuck hits a ball, hard. Father and son watch it sail. Chuck 
           slings his golf club over his shoulder and turns to Dylan.

                        your knucklehead brother, that is.  

           Dylan takes his swing. 

                                 DYLAN
                        I’m trying, dad. It’s a solid 
                        offer.   

           Chuck pushes a brochure into Dylan’s hands. It’s a digital 
           rendering of the property as a luxury neighborhood. 

                                 CHUCK
                        It’s more than a solid offer, 
                        Dylan. Your grandparents set it up 
                        so that when you do decide to sell 
                        this place, your mother walks away 
                        with half the interest and you and 
                        Tom split the rest. The Mansion 
                        will never recover after what you 
                        idiots got up to that summer. Have 
                        you made sure your brother 
                        understands this?

                                 DYLAN
                        He’s a romantic schmuck. Three 
                        generations of our family have 
                        gotten married here. 

                                 CHUCK
                        And only one ended in a bitter 
                        divorce. 

           Dylan hits another ball, not wanting to feed into his 
           father’s mounting tantrum. 

                                 CHUCK (CONT’D)
                        I have supported your mother 
                        financially for twenty eight years, 
                        and we were only married for half 
                        of them. If she accepts the very 
                        generous offer the developer has 
                        made all of you, I have grounds to 
                        request that alimony be terminated. 
                                 DYLAN
                        And I’m tired of getting up at 2am 
                        every day to work Hong Kong hours.  

                                 CHUCK
                        Your brother has never worked an 
                        honest day in his life. And I’ve 
                        always supported his global CEO’s 
                        tastes on a slipshod start-up 
                        budget. And now he’ll just bottom 
                        feed from Julie.  

           Chuck is on a roll. His face is turning red and angry.

                                 DYLAN
                        He loves that girl, dad. 

                                 CHUCK
                        He loves that woman. Some of you 
                        are closer to forty than thirty. 

           Chuck lowers his club and takes a step toward his son. 

                                 CHUCK (CONT’D)
                        Get through to him, or else. 

                                 DYLAN
                        How do you reason with someone who 
                        says it’s not about money?

                                 CHUCK
                        It’s always about the money. 

           Chuck stalks off. Dylan watches him go, shaking his head. 

           INT. THE MANSION - FIRST FLOOR - MORNING

           Chuck appears on the first floor, amid the hustle and bustle 
           of the ceremony set up. Florists are putting together 
           beautiful arrangements, the photographer is taking test 
           shots, the caterer is ferrying boxes of food. Chuck watches 
           as Karen bosses everyone around. 

                                 KAREN
                        Who’s Jeep is that in the drive? 
                        Yours? 

           The server shakes his head as he walks by. She addresses 
           another one.

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        Yours? 
                             (shakes his head)
                                 (MORE)
                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        Well, find a way to move it! It’s 
                        not like it’s a Cayenne!

           Chuck notices the bartender setting up the bar and makes a 
           beeline for him. 

                                 CHUCK
                        How about a finger of Bulleit for 
                        the father of the groom?

                                 BARTENDER
                        Oh, uh...
                             (looks around under the 
                              table)
                        I haven’t brought in the liquor 
                        yet. Just some champagne. 

           Chuck slides a hundred dollar bill across the bar top.

                                 CHUCK
                        Champagne is for people who have 
                        something to celebrate.  

           The bartender steps out from behind the bar. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        I’ll be just a moment, sir. 

           Chuck nods, happy money still talks to some people. He rests 
           an elbow on the bar, watching everyone else work around him. 

           EXT. THE MANSION - MORNING

           The bartender approaches a white service van and opens the 
           back doors. He scans the boxes packed chest high—V for Vodka, 
           T for Tequila. No W for Whiskey. He climbs into the van. 

           INT. VAN - MORNING

           The bartender is in the back of the van, walled in by stacks 
           of boxes, when someone slams the back doors shut. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        Hey! Someone’s back here!

           He tries to squeeze his way out. Suddenly, he hears the 
           driver’s side door slam shut. The engine starts. 

                                 BARTENDER (CONT’D)
                        Hey! Stop! 
           The bartender reverses his path, toward the divider between 
           the front seats and the cargo. The van lurches, violently to 
           the left, and the bartender loses his footing. The van is 
           driving recklessly now, bumping and swerving and picking up 
           speed. The bartender manages to get close enough to the 
           divider to peer through the small frosted window. He discerns 
           a white and shapeless form behind the wheel. He pounds on the 
           glass, shouting. With no warning, the van comes to a crashing 
           stop. The bartender ricochets off the divider, landing in a 
           daze among the boxes. He groans, softly, bringing a hand to 
           his temple. His fingers come away with blood. 

           Through the bartender’s fuzzy POV, we watch as one back door 
           opens, then another. Everything sharpens into focus when the 
           blade of an axe cleaves the top of a box. The killer flings 
           the box outside. It lands in the grass, vodka bottles 
           shattering everywhere. 

           The bartender dodges left, just as the axe whizzes by his 
           head, connecting with another box. The killer hurls the boxes 
           onto the ground, until the bartender, and by proxy the 
           audience, can see the killer clearly for the first time.  

           The killer wears an all white robe and an all white morph 
           face mask. No holes for the eyes or nose or mouth. 

           The bartender grabs a stray bottle of whiskey, throwing it at 
           the killer’s head. The killer stumbles, and the bartender 
           dives onto the grass, taking off. 

           The woods are dense and disorienting. Before he knows it, the 
           bartender has circled back around to the van. He jumps behind 
           the wheel of the van, hoping, praying. YES. The keys have 
           been left in the ignition. Just as he starts the car, the axe 
           shatters the small window divider. The killer hacks at the 
           bartender’s hand on the wheel. The bartender screeches as his 
           finger flies out the open window. The killer raises the axe 
           and sinks the blade into the seatbelt, pinning the 
           bartender’s head to the seat. He crashes into a tree, the 
           seat belt severing his neck. The bartender bleeds out. Only 
           once he’s gone limp does the axe release the seatbelt, 
           disappearing through the shattered divider. We see the killer 
           walk away—but not before grabbing a bottle of whiskey, 
           lifting the bottom of the mask, and taking a swig.  

           EXT. THE MANSION - WINDING DRIVEWAY - MORNING

           We hear heavy breathing before we see him: a man running. The 
           camera tracks his path from behind, carefully avoiding his 
           face. He’s wearing a baseball hat, and he’s shirtless, fit, 
           and sweaty. We follow him up the final, last push of his run. 
           The Mansion appears before him, the circular driveway crammed 
           with service vans and workers.  
           INT. THE MANSION - FIRST FLOOR

           The man enters the mansion. A few of the female workers turn 
           to check him out as he makes his way up the stairs. His hat 
           is pulled low over his eyes, his face still concealed.  

           INT. THE MANSION - GROOM’S WING - GUEST ROOM

           The man enters the room to find three men reclined in a 
           chair, hot towels on their faces, a barber readying his 
           tools. This is EVAN JIANG, 36, Heather’s husband, OLIVER 
           WEISENBERG, 37, Sabrina’s husband, and MATT BRUNI, 37, Meg’s 
           husband. Matt is a little tubby, a lot hairy. 

                                 MATT
                        Two hour run. Slacking, man.

           The man stretches his arms above his head. Matt watches a 
           bead of sweat take a bumpy ride down his washboard abs. 

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        Jesus. Will you marry me?

           The man plops down in a chair. He removes his hat, but before 
           we can see his face, the barber covers it in a hot towel. 

                                 MAN
                        Your wife’s not enough above your 
                        pay grade for you? 

                                 MATT
                        Meg is an overachieving lunatic, 
                        bro. She’s skinnier now than she 
                        was before she had the kids. 
                             (his phone buzzes and he 
                              looks at it)
                        But not, like, too thin. 

                                 MAN
                             (sarcastic)
                        Too thin is what’s gross.

           The other guys snicker. Matt does not realize the man is 
           making fun of him. He’s reading a text and distracted. 

                                 MATT
                        Not as gross as fat. You want 
                        anything from Starbucks? Meg says 
                        the girls are going. 

                                 EVAN
                        Grande soy latte.
                                 OLIVER
                        When the barista writes your name 
                        on the cup, does she capitalize the 
                        P in Pussy? 

                                 MATT
                        Soy gay. 

           Evan flips them off. The guys crack themselves up. The man 
           from the run rolls his eyes beneath the hot towel.

                                 MAN
                        Iced coffee. 

                                 MATT
                        Skim milk, I presume. 

           He sends the order via text. A fifth man appears in the 
           doorway, phone in hand, a worried expression on his face. 
           This is JASON GIBSON, 36, husband of Becca, the missing 
           bridesmaid. We recognize him as the man who walked out of his 
           room earlier this morning, looking for service.

                                 JASON
                        Anyone spoken to the girls this 
                        morning?

                                 MATT
                        Talking to Meg right now. You want 
                        anything from Starbucks—FUCK!

           Evan plugs his ear. Matt is a loudmouth.  

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        Meg sent that text like an hour 
                        ago. They’re already back. Service 
                        here can suck my choade! 

                                 JASON
                        Can you tell Meg to tell Becca to 
                        call me? She’s not answering her 
                        phone. 

           The man turns to look at Jason, causing the hot towel to slip 
           from his face. Matt starts to text Meg. 

                                 MATT
                        What should I have her tell your ex-
                        wife it’s about?
                                 JASON
                        The nanny called. She thinks Molly 
                        has an ear infection and she can’t 
                        find the number for the 
                        pediatrician. 
                             (beat)
                        And we’re not divorced yet. 

                                 MATT
                             (reading off his phone)
                        According to Meg, Becca dropped her 
                        phone at the rehearsal dinner last 
                        night and the screen is smashed.  

           Another text comes in. Matt reads it again.

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        She’s had three mimosas already.

                                 JASON
                        Just ask her where the number for 
                        the pediatrician would be. And 
                        screenshot that and send it to me 
                        so I can show the judge exactly why 
                        she should revoke full custody from 
                        my ex-wife. 

           Matt takes a screenshot of the text as told. 

           INT. THE MANSION - BRIDAL SUITE - MORNING

           Meg, Sabrina, and Heather are huddled in one corner of the 
           room. Julie is on the other, getting her hair and makeup 
           done, answering Tabitha’s interview questions. She doesn’t 
           hear their hushed conversation.  

                                 MEG
                        Jason wants the number for the 
                        pediatrician.  

                                 SABRINA
                        Seriously? How does he not have the 
                        number for his child’s doctor saved 
                        in his phone? 

                                 HEATHER
                        Call Becca again. 

           Meg calls. Suddenly, the sound of the phone from the hallway. 
           Meg looks at the other women, eyes wide. She motions that she 
           will go outside to check and that they should stay put. 
           INT. THE MANSION - BRIDAL WING - HALLWAY - MORNING

           Meg is surprised to find a server outside the door, holding 
           Becca’s ringing phone. Not Becca. 

           INT. THE MANSION - BRIDAL WING - JULIE’S ROOM - MORNING

           Back inside the room, Tabitha interviews Julie. 

                                 JULIE
                        Should I start with how we met?

                                 TABITHA
                        That would be great.

           Tabitha opens her notebook, drops her pen, then drops her 
           notebook when she goes to pick it up. Julie waits patiently 
           until she’s ready.  

                                 JULIE
                        I met Tom through Meg, my matron of 
                        honor. She works with my soon to be 
                        brother-in-law at Goldman Sachs. 
                        Dylan. The funny thing is, she 
                        actually set me up with Dylan 
                        first.

           Julie laughs, remembering it now. 

                                 TABITHA
                        No way. You dated your fiancé’s 
                        brother?!

                                 JULIE
                        It was just a drink, and he’s so 
                        good looking—well, obviously I have 
                        to say that.

           Julie laughs again. 

                                 TABITHA
                        But you didn’t click? 

           Julie’s smile disappears abruptly. 

                                 JULIE
                        At first we did. Really well, 
                        actually. Dylan is ambitious, 
                        intelligent, hard working....

           Julie trails off, realizing she’s raving about her fiancé’s 
           brother to a reporter at the New York Times.
                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        But then he had to stick his foot 
                        in his mouth. 

                                 TABITHA
                        What did he say?

                                 JULIE
                        I told him I was in the running to 
                        be the first woman to head the 
                        Genentech research lab at Roche. 
                        And he said—and I quote—it’s a good 
                        time for women to get ahead. 

                                 TABITHA
                        Fucking prick.

           Julie is briefly taken aback by Tabitha’s vicious tone. 

                                 JULIE
                        It’s been a few good centuries for 
                        fucking pricks to get ahead, hasn’t 
                        it?

           Tabitha laughs. 

                                 TABITHA
                        Please tell me you told him that.

                                 JULIE
                        In so many words, when I ran into 
                        him on the one a few days later.

                                 TABITHA
                        Which one?

                                 JULIE
                        No. The one. Like the subway line?

                                 TABITHA
                             (laughing)
                        My daughter’s two. Can I still 
                        blame pregnancy brain? 

                                 JULIE
                        Until she graduates college. 

           INT. THE MANSION - GROOM’S SUITE - MORNING

           The barber approaches the man with the hot towel on his face. 
           The conversation between Julie and Tabitha continues as the 
           barber removes the towel. The camera cuts away quickly, 
           tracking the barber’s movements, before we can see his face.   
                                 TABITHA O.C.
                        So you ran into him on the subway.

           The barber lathers Tom’s face in shaving cream. FLASHBACK.

           INT. NYC SUBWAY - DAY - FLASHBACK - TWO YEARS AGO

           Julie approaches Dylan on the subway. He’s reading his phone, 
           a Starbucks coffee cup between his knees. Julie’s V.O. plays 
           as she taps him on the shoulder and offers him some cash.

                                 JULIE O.C.
                        I told him I felt bad that he paid 
                        for our drinks, given that his time 
                        to get ahead as a man was rapidly 
                        running out. 

                                 TABITHA V.O.
                        What did he do?

                                 JULIE O.C.
                        He laughed. 

           See the man Julie thought was Dylan laughing. 

                                 TOM
                        I take it you’ve met my twin 
                        brother. My name is Tom. I’m the 
                        not asshole one. 

           INT. THE MANSION - GROOM WING - GUEST ROOM - PRESENT

           The barber shaves off the cream, revealing the face of the 
           man from the subway. This is TOM CUNNINGHAM, 37, Dylan’s 
           identical twin brother. He’s watching Jason read a text 
           message. 

           FOCUS on the text message to Jason from Becca: Pediatrician 
           on vacay. Tell babysitter to apply warm compress with squeeze 
           of lemon.

                                 MATT
                        Dude. Put your phone down. Relax.

                                 JASON
                        I’m trying to make sure my child is 
                        okay, Matt. I’m an involved dad. 

                                 MATT
                        Sounds contagious. Stay back.   

           Karen appears behind Jason.

                        We’re missing someone. Who are we 
                        missing?

           INT. THE MANSION - BRIDAL SUITE - MORNING

           The makeup artist finishes Julie’s makeup. Julie turns and 
           looks at herself in the mirror. She is shellacked to within 
           an inch of her life. 

                                 MAKEUP ARTIST
                        Let me know if you want more 
                        eyelashes. 

           Julie smiles, graciously. 

                                 JULIE
                        It’s perfect. Thank you so much. 
                        You are very talented. 

           The makeup artist beams and packs up her things. Just as she 
           leaves the room, Meg enters, wearing her bridesmaid “dress”—a 
           chic black pantsuit. 

                                 MEG
                        Oh my gawd. Ravishing. Stunning. 
                        Elle-ah-gant. 

           Julie laughs while Meg helps her wipe off the heavy lipstick.

                                 JULIE
                        She’s had a contract with The 
                        Mansion for fifteen years. It meant 
                        a lot to Tom’s mom that I give her 
                        my business.  

           Meg peels off a strip of fake eyelashes. They both look at 
           her face in the mirror: now she looks ravishing. Stunning. 
           Elle-ah-gant. 

                                 MEG
                        Not to rush you, but the trolley 
                        with the first wave of guests is 
                        here.

           Julie checks her phone. It’s 11:41.
                                 JULIE
                        Shit. We’re supposed to be out on 
                        the veranda at noon for pictures. 

           Julie gets up and opens the closet doors. Her wedding dress 
           hangs inside: a simple silk slip. No pouf; no bling; no 
           frills. It even has pockets. Meg zips her up.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        Has any one gotten a hold of Becca?

           Behind Julie’s back, Meg makes a face that clearly answers 
           the question: no. 

                                 MEG
                        So, yeah. Turns out she sprained 
                        her ankle in those Aquazzura shoes. 
                        She—

           Julie’s phone buzzes on the dresser. She picks it up and 
           reads a text from Becca, finishing Meg’s sentence.

                                 JULIE
                        ...was in the ER all night and her 
                        phone died. She’s so so sorry but 
                        she’s not going to make it today.

           Julie is clearly disappointed. She texts back, reading her 
           message to Becca out loud for Meg.  

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        Are you okay? Is there anything we 
                        can do?

           Beat. Then a buzz. Meg and Julie read the text on Julie’s 
           phone together: I’m fine. Just don’t mention anything to 
           Jason, okay? He knows I’m okay but he also knows I wasn’t 
           with him when it happened and he’s not happy. 

           Julie stares at her phone, mouth agape. 

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        I can’t believe this. I feel like 
                        we should do something. She is 
                        flailing. 

           Meg removes Julie’s phone from her hand. 

                                 MEG
                        We should do something. But not 
                        now. You’re getting married and 
                        it’s all about you today, okay?
           The sound of a voice, dripping with disdain. Both Meg and 
           Julie turn to see two women in their sixties in the doorway.

                                 DR. WHEELER
                        You forgot to add that it’s the 
                        most important day of her life. 

           RITA WHEELER, MD, is tall, lithe, and sophisticated, wearing 
           a gorgeous, custom black Pierre Balmain pantsuit, high, razor 
           thin heels, with just a single piece of expensive, statement 
           jewelry: The Cartier Panthére ring. Her grey hair is not 
           colored and is tied in a chignon at the nape of her neck.  

           MARILYN CUNNINGHAM looks like the sort of mother who had 
           freshly baked cookies waiting for her kids after school. 
           She’s short, plump, and wearing a pastel colored mother-of-
           the-groom dress and matching shrug. 

           It is Marilyn, upon seeing Julie, who wells up with tears. 

                                 MARILYN
                        Oh, my. You look so beautiful, 
                        sweetheart. 

           Marilyn steps toward Julie and envelops her in a hug. Their 
           bond is so undeniable that for a moment, we assume this is 
           Julie’s mother. But then Julie speaks, clarifying.

                                 JULIE
                        Thank you, Marilyn. The makeup 
                        artist you recommended did an 
                        incredible job. I’m so glad I went 
                        with her. 

           Julie addresses Dr. Wheeler over Marilyn’s shoulder. 

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        Hi, mom. You look terrifying as 
                        always. 

                                 MEG
                        You are forever fucking goals, Dr. 
                        Wheeler. 

           Dr. Wheeler barks out a laugh. Marilyn is just confused. 

                                 MEG (CONT’D)
                        And I love your dress, Mrs. 
                        Cunningham. And this place! It’s so 
                        regal! I wish I could have gotten 
                        married here!
                                 MARILYN
                        Thank you, Megan. It really means a 
                        lot to me that the kids chose to 
                        hold the nuptials here. 

                                 DR. WHEELER
                        Not exactly kids, are they 
                        though...

                                 MEG
                        I say act your bank balance, not 
                        your age. Prehistoric and proud.
                             (gives Dr. Wheeler a high 
                              five)
                        I’ll round up the other dinosaurs!

           Meg walks out. The camera follows her into one of the rooms 
           down the hall, where the bridesmaids huddle.

           INT. THE MANSION - BRIDESMAID ROOM - MORNING

           Sabrina looks up when Meg enters. 

                                 SABRINA
                        So?

           Meg gestures at the phone in Sabrina’s hand. 

                                 MEG
                        You read her texts. She bought it. 

           We look at the screen saver on the phone: Becca and her three 
           kids. We understand: Sabrina is holding Becca’s phone. Those 
           texts came from Sabrina, posing as Becca. Meg peers over 
           Sabrina’s shoulder to read the text exchange with Jason. 

                                 MEG (CONT’D)
                        What’s Jason saying?

                                 HEATHER
                        He’s not buying the sprained ankle 
                        story. Thinks she’s holed up at the 
                        Marriott riding some twenty-three 
                        year old pony.  

                                 MEG
                        Serves him right for telling her he 
                        just “sees her differently” after 
                        she had his children.  

                                 SABRINA
                        I’m freaking out. 
                                 MEG
                        Don’t. Okay? She’s fine. She’s 
                        somewhere. You know Becca. Let’s 
                        not ruin the day. 

                                 SABRINA
                        Then why was her phone just laying 
                        by the front door like that? We’re 
                        so lucky the caterer brought it to 
                        us and not Jason. 

           Karen pops her head into the room. 

                                 KAREN
                        Everyone ready?
                             (takes in the women; not 
                              all of them are dressed)
                        Ladies, please. You’ve all had your 
                        special moments and I’m sure Julie 
                        was dressed and ready in time and 
                        didn’t hold anything up for you on 
                        the day you dreamed about since you 
                        were a little girl.  

           Karen walks away with her nose in the air. 

                                 HEATHER
                        What is she, twelve? 

           Meg rolls her eyes. 

                                 MEG
                        Worse. Twenty-five. Just get ready. 
                        Everyone.

           The women disperse to do just that. 

           INT. THE MANSION - BRIDAL SUITE - MORNING

           We are back with Marilyn, Dr. Wheeler, and Julie. Marilyn 
           turns to Julie. 

                                 MARILYN
                        I brought you something.

           Marilyn produces a small velvet box. 

                                 MARILYN (CONT’D)
                        I know you’re not much for 
                        convention. I don’t expect you to 
                        wear it. I just want you to have 
                        it. Something blue. 
           Julie opens the box. It’s a blue garter belt. Dr. Wheeler 
           covers her mouth, half horrified, half trying not to laugh. 

                                 MARILYN (CONT’D)
                        It was my great grandmother’s. She 
                        was the first in our family to get 
                        married here and the strongest 
                        woman I know. And then her 
                        daughter, my grandmother, had the 
                        savvy to restore the upstairs 
                        bedrooms and offer them as luxury 
                        suites for the wedding party so 
                        everyone could be in one place for 
                        the weekend. I hope you’ll pass not 
                        only this, but our love for this 
                        property, down to your daughter if 
                        you have one. 

           Julie tucks the garter belt into the pocket of her dress, 
           lovingly. 

                                 JULIE
                        It will be right here with me the 
                        whole day, Marilyn. 

                                 MARILYN
                        It’s so neat they make wedding 
                        dresses with pockets these days!

                                 DR. WHEELER
                        It’s a lovely gesture, Marilyn. The 
                        history of this place is certainly 
                        something to celebrate. 

           Marilyn brushes away a tear.

                                 MARILYN
                        Oh, thank you for that, Rita. I 
                        know Julie and Tom have much 
                        simpler tastes. But doing this here 
                        sends a signal that the family 
                        believes in The Mansion, its 
                        history, and its future. No amount 
                        of money can change that. 

                                 DR. WHEELER
                             (tight smile)
                        Certainly some amount of money...

                                 MARILYN
                        For me, no. But it’s not up to me.

           Dr. Wheeler and Julie exchange a look, confused. 
                                 DR. WHEELER
                        I’m sorry. Who is it up to?

                                 MARILYN
                        The deed has been in the boys’ 
                        names ever since my parents passed 
                        away. I thought you knew...

           Dr. Wheeler turns to Julie, aghast. 

                                 DR. WHEELER 
                        Tom never told you, Julie?

           Julie hesitates.

                                 JULIE
                        He did. A while back. I just forgot 
                        the specifics. Anyway. It doesn’t 
                        matter. He doesn’t want to sell.

           Julie turns away from her mother to check her makeup one last 
           time, hiding her troubled expression. Karen appears. 

                                 KAREN
                        Ready, ladies? If we wait any 
                        longer we’ll risk running into the 
                        groom on the stairs and you know 
                        what they say about that!

           Marilyn scurries out. She knows what they say about that! Dr. 
           Wheeler narrows her eyes at Karen.

                                 DR. WHEELER
                        What do they say about that?

           Karen’s smile falters, a little. She thought everyone knew...

                                 KAREN
                        It’s bad luck!

           Dr. Wheeler shrugs.

                                 DR. WHEELER
                        I didn’t see my husband on my 
                        wedding day and cancer still ate 
                        two of his internal organs when 
                        Julie was seven years old. 

           Dr. Wheeler brushes past a stunned and silenced Karen. Julie 
           follows her out, smiling at Karen, apologetically. 

                                 JULIE
                        Thank you for helping everything to 
                        run so smoothly, Karen. 
           EXT. THE MANSION - VERANDA - MORNING

           The photographer, JEFFREY, poses the women in various 
           arrangements. 

           EXT. THE MANSION - ROSE GARDEN - MORNING

           The photographer’s assistant, MAURA, poses the men in various 
           arrangements. 

           EXT. THE MANSION - VERANDA - MORNING

           Jeffrey gestures for Julie and her bridesmaids to squeeze in 
           closer, to hold up their bouquets, to drop them, to smile and 
           to look at each other and laugh. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        Okay, just the bride and her 
                        parents. 

           The bridesmaids disperse. Dr. Wheeler steps forward. The 
           photographer looks around, confused.  

                                 DR. WHEELER
                        I am the father. Proceed. 

           The photographer clicks away. Julie and Dr. Wheeler hold 
           their smiles through their private conversation. 

                                 DR. WHEELER (CONT’D)
                        When was Tom going to tell you the 
                        deed to The Mansion is in his name?

                                 JULIE
                        Why does it matter?

                                 DR. WHEELER
                        Because he asked you to invest in 
                        his startup when it turns out he 
                        has another source of capital. 

                                 JEFFREY O.C.
                        Tilt your chin down for me, Julie. 

           Julie tilts her chin down and keeps smiling. 

                                 DR. WHEELER
                        That doesn’t bother you?

                                 JULIE
                        No. 
                                 DR. WHEELER
                        It bothers me. 

                                 JULIE
                        Everything men do bothers you.

           Dr. Wheeler drops her arm from around her daughter’s waist 
           and turns to her, ignoring the photographer’s instructions to 
           smile with their chins up. 

                                 DR. WHEELER
                        You’ve worked so hard. Just to let 
                        this slacker suck you dry.

                                 JULIE
                        You are out of line, mom—

                                 DR. WHEELER
                        What is it? Is it because you want 
                        a baby? You don’t need Tom to have 
                        a baby, Julie!

                                 JULIE
                        Are you seriously advocating single 
                        motherhood on my wedding day? You 
                        know who is a single mother right 
                        now? Becca. After her divorce. And 
                        she is drowning.  

                                 DR. WHEELER
                        You can afford help—

                                 JULIE
                        I don’t want to pay for a partner!

           Dr. Wheeler grabs Julie’s hand and holds it up. Her huge 
           diamond glints on her finger. 

                                 DR. WHEELER
                        He couldn’t even afford the band 
                        this diamond came on, Julie. You 
                        bought it for yourself! What do you 
                        need him for? 

                                 JULIE
                        I don’t need him for anything. I 
                        want him. That’s the difference, 
                        mom. Love isn’t some transaction. 

           Julie stalks off. Marilyn is the mother who hurries after 
           her. 
           EXT. THE MANSION - ROSE GARDEN - MORNING

           Focus on Tom, surrounded by Matt, Evan, Oliver, and Jason, 
           following Maura’s direction. 

                                 MAURA O.C.
                        That’s great, gentlemen. Just a few 
                        more...got it. 

           The guys disperse. Jason goes for his phone, instantly. 

                                 MAURA
                        Let’s do three generations of the 
                        Cunninghams.

           Tom, Chuck, and his grandfather all gather together.

                                 CHUCK
                        Where the hell is your brother, 
                        Tom?

           Tom’s smile falters. 

                                 TOM
                        He’s doing something for me.

           FOCUS on Jason, Matt, Oliver, and Evan on the sidelines. 

                                 OLIVER
                             (re: Jason’s phone)
                        I think it’s time for an 
                        intervention, man....

                                 JASON
                        Not until the whore I thought I was 
                        going to grow old with picks up her 
                        God damn phone. 

                                 MATT
                             (wincing)
                        Dude. That’s the mother of your 
                        children. 

           Jason silences him with a look. 

                                 EVAN
                        Had you been having problems?

                                 JASON
                        We have three kids under the age of 
                        six and two are late talkers. 
                                 EVAN
                        Becca told Heather you guys didn’t 
                        have sex for a year...how do 
                        you...I mean...Becca’s hot, man. 
                        Becca’s wild. 

           Jason sighs. 

                                 JASON
                        I just thought we would both be 
                        tired for a while. But then the 
                        kids would grow up and we’d go on 
                        cruises and drink martinis and 
                        sleep again and have the energy to 
                        put effort into our relationship. 

                                 MATT
                        Were you as tired as Becca?

           Jason turns on Matt, his eyes blazing. 

                                 JASON
                        Of course I was. Unlike some people 
                        I know, I don’t make my wife pull 
                        the whole cart. I don’t let myself 
                        go and expect her to wear the same 
                        size jeans as when we met in 
                        college. 

                                 MATT
                        Meg does Whole30 for herself!

                                 JASON
                        Fuck your lard ass. 

           Jason stalks off, into the woods, heading back to the 
           mansion. Matt pinches his potbelly, a little stung. He’s not 
           that fat, is he? Oliver shakes his head: definitely not. 

           EXT. THE MANSION - WOODS - DAY

           The camera follows Jason as he storms through the woods, 
           muttering to himself, trying to find a place where he gets 
           service so his calls to Becca go through. He stumbles into a 
           small square of service where a single bar appears. The 
           camera holds on her face, on the ringing on his end, then... 

           INT. THE MANSION - FIRST FLOOR BATHROOM - DAY

           Meg is standing outside the bathroom door, along with 
           Sabrina. Sabrina sneezes three times in a row. She digs 
           through her purse for a tissue when a phone starts to ring. 
                                 MEG
                        Jules, girl. You okay?

           Sabrina blows her nose with one hand, removing Becca’s 
           buzzing phone with the other. She sees Jason’s face and his 
           name, calling. Meg grabs it from her. 

                                 MEG (CONT’D)
                        I’m turning it off. 

           INT. THE MANSION - FIRST FLOOR BATHROOM

           Julie is sitting on the toilet, having long ago peed. She’s 
           staring straight ahead at nothing. Hold on her face as Meg 
           speaks to her from the other side of the door. 

                                 MEG O.C.
                        No rush, Jules. But I’m worried 
                        Karen might stress eat the entire 
                        raw bar if we don’t start lining up 
                        for the ceremony. 

           INT. THE MANSION - OUTSIDE BATHROOM 

           Meg stops knocking/talking as a few guests trickle in. She 
           smiles at them as if to say: nothing to see here!

                                 MEG
                        You look lovely, Mrs. Wasserman. I 
                        am mad for a silver fur bolero. 

           An older woman in a fur bolero Meg would never be caught dead 
           in shuffles by with a graceful nod of appreciation. 

           INT. THE MANSION - FIRST FLOOR BATHROOM

           Julie listens to this exchange from the bathroom. She flushes 
           the toilet with a sigh, knowing she needs to get out of there 
           before more guests arrive. She stands and slips on something. 

                                 JULIE
                        Woahhhh....

           Julie catches herself. She pulls up her dress and examines 
           her shoe. The sole, and some of the white leather strap, is 
           stained with a red substance. Julie crouches down and dips 
           her fingers in the spill, bringing them under her nose. She 
           sniffs and makes a face of pure disgust. Blood. 
           INT. THE MANSION - OUTSIDE FIRST FLOOR BATHROOM

           The door flies open, surprising Meg. 

                                 JULIE
                        Can you ask Karen to step away from 
                        the crab legs long enough to put a 
                        basket of tampons in here? Someone 
                        got her period on the floor. 

           Meg peers inside the bathroom, morbidly curious. 

           EXT. THE MANSION - BACKYARD CEREMONY - DAY

           From someone’s POV, we watch as a violinist saws her 
           instrument. An officiant stands under the archway. The guests 
           are seated, with champagne in their hands, chatting merrily. 
           Meg is the first in line, waiting at the far side door. She’s 
           standing with her weight on one hip, bouquet dangling at her 
           side, yawning and bored. Karen gestures as though she’s 
           holding a bouquet herself: up here, by your chest. 

           Meg brings the bouquet directly under her chin.

                                 MEG
                             (mouthing)
                        Like this?

           Karen lowers her clasped hands. 

                                 KAREN
                             (mouthing)
                        Lower.

           Meg drops the bouquet to her crotch, way too low. 

                                 MEG
                             (mouthing)
                        This?

           Karen shakes her head, growing frustrated. Meg moves her 
           hands: up, down, up, down. Fucking with Karen.  

           The camera pulls back, revealing that it is Tom observing 
           from a window in the sunroom on the first floor. The 
           groomsmen are sitting behind him, chatting and enjoying one 
           last beer before the ceremony. Dylan comes to stand next to 
           him at the window. It’s the first time we’ve seen the twins 
           together, and Tom’s relief is visible. 

                                 TOM
                        Did you find it?
           Dylan opens a post on Instagram from last night’s rehearsal 
           dinner. He zooms in on Becca, then specifically on her shoes. 

                                 DYLAN
                        These were it, right? 

           Tom glances around the room, making sure no one is watching, 
           before he nods. 

                                 DYLAN (CONT’D)
                        I looked everywhere, man. All over 
                        the property. I couldn’t find it.   

                                 TOM
                        It’s got to be somewhere in my 
                        room. If anyone finds it. If, God 
                        forbid, Julie finds it—

                                 KAREN
                        Let’s do this, gentlemen. 

           Tom and Dylan share a worried look. Tom glances out the 
           window, one last time. He takes it all in—not just the 
           ceremony below, but the acres and acres of dense, wooded 
           land. The camera tracks his line of vision...

           EXT. THE MANSION - WOODS - DAY

           Finding Jason, who is trekking through the woods, lost. He 
           frantically tries to send a text to Matt: I’m lost. Help. The 
           text doesn’t send. Jason growls in frustration. Faint music 
           trickles through the trees—the ceremony is about to begin. He 
           follows the sound of the violin and cello. The camera pulls 
           back to reveal: someone is following him. 

           INT. THE MANSION - DAY

           The groomsmen wait at the door for their cue from Karen. 
           Karen does a quick count, then counts again. They’re short 
           someone. Matt catches her eye and slices his hand under his 
           chin, as if to say don’t make a big deal of it. They both 
           look at Tom, oblivious that one of his groomsmen is missing. 
           Karen winks, thrilled to be in on the conspiracy.   

           EXT. THE MANSION - WOODS - DAY

           Jason continues to feel his way toward the music. Someone 
           else continues to follow him. He stumbles over a branch and 
           lands on his hands and knees with a curse. He falls silent as 
           he detects something in the brush. Is that a...?
           EXT. THE MANSION - BACKYARD CEREMONY - DAY

           The groomsmen file down the aisle, one by one. The guests 
           smile, fondly. 

           EXT. THE MANSION WOODS - DAY

           Jason holds up an object to the light. It’s the bartender’s 
           bloody finger. He panics and throws it into the trees. He 
           crab walks backwards, gasping and sputtering. 

                                 JASON
                        What the...what the?

           Jason is unwittingly crawling toward the person following 
           him. He slams into a pair of legs. He turns and screams. 

           EXT. THE MANSION - BACKYARD CEREMONY - DAY 

           The groomsmen turn left at the alter, lining one side of the 
           hilltop. Beneath them, a flock of birds alight from the 
           trees, as though something has scared them away. 

           EXT. THE MANSION - WOODS - DAY

           A woman stands above Jason, eerily nonreactive to his 
           terrified scream that sent the birds into flight. She’s in 
           her mid-thirties, wan looking, with dirty hair and dirty 
           clothes. One blue eye is cloudy; unfocused. 

                                 JASON
                        There...there was a finger. A human 
                        finger. 
                             (points)
                        Over there. 

           The woman glances in the general direction Jason points. 

                                 WOMAN
                             (still calm)
                        Should we call the police?

                                 JASON
                        Y-y-yes! But my phone. I have no 
                        service. Do you? 

           The woman turns.  

                                 WOMAN
                        We’ll have to use my landline. 
                                 JASON
                        Landline? 

           The woman answers without turning around.   

                                 WOMAN
                        In the service cottage. 

           The woman sets off through the woods. Jason doesn’t have a 
           better option other than to follow her. 

           EXT. THE MANSION - BACKYARD CEREMONY - DAY

           The bridesmaids file down the aisle now, all wearing black 
           pantsuits, holding simple green and white bouquets to their 
           chests. Meg smiles and murmurs thank you to the guests as she 
           passes, knowing she looks good. She clocks the groomsmen and 
           narrows her eyes, realizing Jason is missing. She glances at 
           Matt, who makes I’ll tell you later eyes at her.  

           There is a break in the music. Then the violinist begins to 
           play Canon in D. The guests stand. 

           Julie is escorted down the aisle—Marilyn on one side, Dr. 
           Wheeler on the other. The crowd takes a collective inhale. 
           She looks stunning. 

           Tom smiles as Julie reaches him, but it’s Dylan, right next 
           to his brother, whose eyes are bright with tears. Julie 
           kisses her mother on the cheek, then Marilyn. Tom does the 
           same. Then it’s just the two of them, facing each other, 
           hearts pounding as the officiant issues a greeting. The 
           camera tracks key players: Chuck, Marilyn, Dr. Wheeler, 
           Karen, Dylan, Meg, and Tabitha, taking notes for her story.  

                                 OFFICIANT

           Sabrina sneezes. Meg hands her a tissue. 

           EXT. THE MANSION - WOODS

           Jason follows the woman through the path. He can barely keep 
           up while she forges ahead, sure-footed. 

                                 JASON
                        This is rude, but, um, who are you?

           The woman still doesn’t turn around when she speaks. 

                                 WOMAN
                        My name is Edith. 

                                 JASON
                        Eddie the caretaker?

           Eddie smiles to herself. 

                                 EDDIE
                        You’ve heard of me. 

                                 JASON
                        I thought you were a dude, but 
                        yeah.

                        These are the days that must happen

           EXT. SERVICE COTTAGE - WOODS - DAY

           Meg’s reading continues as Jason and Eddie reach the service 
           cottage. Eddie heads inside. Jason pauses, taking in the 
           dilapidated cottage. The paint on the shutters is peeling, 
           the wood on the door is rotting. The windows are dark. 

                                 MEG O.C.
                        You shall not heap up what is 
                        called riches,
                        You shall scatter with lavish hand
                        all that you earn or achieve.
                        However sweet the laid up stores,
                        However convenient the dwelling,
                        you shall not remain there.

           Jason gulps and steps inside the uninviting cottage. 

           INT. SERVICE COTTAGE - WOODS - DAY

           It is sunny outside, but somehow so dark inside. Jason bumps 
           into a piece of furniture and lets out a soft curse. His eyes 
           haven’t adjusted yet. 

                                 MEG O.C.
                        However sheltered the port,

                        However welcome the hospitality 
                        that welcomes you,
                        you are permitted to receive it but 
                        a little while.
                        Afoot and lighthearted, take to the 
                        open road
                        Healthy, free, the world before you
                        The long brown path before you,
                        Leading wherever you choose.

           Jason squints, studying the family pictures hanging on the 
           wall, mixed in with a collection of hunting rifles. It’s 
           clearly Eddie when she was a little girl: toe-headed, same 
           sullen expression, dressed like a tomboy. In the next 
           picture, she’s actually laughing, playing with two little 
           boys her age. Jason does a double take: twin boys. Meg 
           finishes her reading while he moves on to a more recent 
           photo: Eddie, Tom, and Dylan as teens. 
           In the next picture, it’s Eddie and one of the twins, in 
           their early twenties, arms entangled around one another. 
           Eddie’s eyes are clear and undamaged. It’s impossible to tell 
           which twin she is with. 

                                 MEG O.C. (CONT’D)
                        Say only to one another:
                        Camerado, I give you my hand!
                        I give you my love more precious 
                        than money;
                        I give you myself before preaching 
                        and law—

                                 EDDIE
                        Snoopin’?

           Jason jumps. Eddie made no sound as she came up behind him. 

                                 JASON
                        What? No. They’re hanging on the 
                        wall. I’m not...snoopin. 

           Eddie steps next to Jason, looking at the picture of her 
           younger self and one of the twins. She presses the twin’s 
           face with her finger, aggressively smudging the glass.

                                 EDDIE
                        You’re wondering which one it was.

           EXT. THE MANSION - BACKYARD CEREMONY

           Meg pauses dramatically. The camera focusses on Julie and Tom 
           as she reads this last pivotal section. They’re smiling at 
           one another, but are their smiles strained?

                                 MEG
                        Will you give me yourself?
                        Will you come travel with me?
                        Shall we stick by each other as 
                        long as we live?

           Beat. Julie glances at Dylan as he wipes a tear from his eye. 
           Her expression fleetingly reveals something like regret.  

                                 MEG (CONT’D)
                        Thank you. 

           The crowd pauses, unsure. It’s such an odd ending. As Meg 
           hugs Julie, then Tom, they applaud, tentatively. 

           The officiant steps forward. 
                                 OFFICIANT
                        Julie and Tom, please join hands, 
                        look at one another now and 
                        remember this moment in
                        time.

           Julie and Tom join hands. 

           EXT. THE MANSION - BACK PATIO - HALF AN HOUR LATER

           A champagne cork pops. Music plays; guests mingle, drink, 
           eat. The camera tracks the scene in a horizontal path, 
           revealing a cocktail hour in full bloom. The camera cuts a 
           path into the rose garden, where Julie and Tom pose for 
           pictures together. Meg stands off to the side, holding 
           Julie’s bouquet. Dylan stands next to her.  

                                 DYLAN
                        I really liked your reading. It 
                        was...different. 

                                 MEG
                        Yes, Julie is nothing like the 
                        women you bag, Dylan. Starting with 
                        her fully developed adult brain. 

                                 DYLAN
                        You would sleep with twenty-three 
                        year olds too if you weren’t 
                        shackled with a balding baby—
                             (winks at Matt)
                        and two kids.   

                                 MEG
                             (wistful sigh)
                        Only every other night. 

           Dylan laughs. 

                                 MEG (CONT’D)
                        That where you were all morning? 
                        With some sophomore at NYU? 

                                 DYLAN
                        NYU girls are too smart to be 
                        attracted to men in 2018.
                             (beat)
                        I was running an errand for Tom. 

           Meg gives him a curious look. 
                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Okay! Best man and matron of honor. 
                        We need you. 

           Meg grumbles as she squeezes in for the photo. 

                                 MEG
                        Only in our fucked society do women 
                        become matrons after they get 
                        married but men still get to be the 
                        best! 

           Meg grins. The photographer snaps the picture. 

           INT. SERVICE COTTAGE - WOODS

           Jason and Eddie stare at the picture of Eddie and one twin.

                                 JASON
                        It looks like Tom, actually. 

                                 EDDIE
                        How can you tell?

                                 JASON
                        Tom’s left eye squints more than 
                        his right when he smiles.  

           Eddie nods, impressed. 

                                 EDDIE
                        Most people can’t tell them apart. 
                        Least I couldn’t. That is Tom with 
                        me there. 
                             (cryptic beat)
                        But it wasn’t always. 

                                 JASON
                        I don’t follow. 

                                 EDDIE
                        They never...?

                                 JASON
                        Never what?

                                 EDDIE
                        Pulled a switcheroo on you?

           Jason makes a face. 

                                 JASON
                        What? No. Never. 
                                 EDDIE
                        That you’ve known of. 

                                 JASON
                        Why would they do that?

           Eddie shrugs. 

                                 EDDIE
                        Dylan didn’t like to do it. He’d do 
                        it for Tom. 

                                 JASON
                        No. That can’t be right. Dylan is 
                        the womanizing one. If they did 
                        that, it would have been his idea. 
                        Not Tom’s. 

           Eddie smiles at Jason, a little too gleefully. 

                                 EDDIE
                        How long have you known them?

           Jason thinks, doing the math. 

                                 JASON
                        Ahh...I dunno. Six? Seven years? 
                        Dylan works with my buddy’s wife, 
                        Meg. 

           Eddie scoffs.

                                 EDDIE
                        I’ve known Tom and Dylan since we 
                        were babies. My parents were the 
                        caretakers of this place, and now I 
                        am. And what I know is this. Tom 
                        was the good one. A mama’s boy. He 
                        would do anything to please 
                        Marilyn. It got to be too much, so 
                        he would ask Dylan to switch places 
                        with him. So he could explore his 
                        dark side without any of the 
                        consequences. 

                                 JASON
                        What sort of...dark side?

           Eddie’s face goes hard. It’s so severe, Jason takes a step 
           back, afraid of her. 

                                 EDDIE
                        Julie should be careful around him. 
                                 JASON
                        How do you know her name?

           Eddie looks worried a moment. 

                                 EDDIE
                        I saw the program. 

           They stare at each other a long moment. Jason glances at the 
           rifles on the wall and starts to sweat.

                                 JASON
                        Can you...get me back to the 
                        wedding so I can warn Julie?

                                 EDDIE
                        I thought you wanted to call the 
                        police. 

                                 JASON
                        Oh...yeah.

           Eddie points. 

                                 EDDIE
                        Phone’s in the kitchen. I left the 
                        number for the sheriff’s office on 
                        a Post It. 

           Jason slinks past Eddie, checking over his shoulder, keeping 
           his eye on her and the guns. He dials the number on the wall. 

           EXT. THE MANSION - BACK PATIO - EARLY EVENING

           The cocktail hour continues. The camera tracks the scene, 
           settling on the bridesmaids: Meg, Sabrina, and Heather. 

                                 MEG
                        Matt said Jason took off when they 
                        were doing pictures in the rose 
                        garden and no one has seen or heard 
                        from him since. 

                                 HEATHER
                        What got his scrotum in a twist?

                                 MEG
                        He called Becca a whore.  

           An indignant beat. Then Sabrina and Heather laugh, evilly. 
                                 SABRINA
                        It’s sort of adorable that men 
                        still think that’s an insult.

                                 HEATHER
                        These dingbats live under a rock.

                                 MEG
                        That’s thirty percent bigger than 
                        everybody else’s rock.

                                 HEATHER
                        Do you know Evan had to pick up the 
                        kids from school the other week 
                        because I had to undergo a minor 
                        medical procedure? And he went to 
                        the wrong school?

           Sabrina and Meg howl. 

                                 HEATHER (CONT’D)
                        But he’s all, sorry. Would you know 
                        how to get to my office? Like the 
                        kindergarten is my office. 

                                 MEG
                        That’s a motherfucking insult. 

                                 HEATHER
                        I would kill to go into an office 
                        every day. We can only afford for 
                        one of us to work and Evan makes 
                        more than me even though I have 
                        more education and experience. The 
                        kids are almost in school full time 
                        and I was so looking forward to 
                        using my brain again but then—

           Heather rubs her very pregnant belly with a sad sigh. At that 
           moment, a six year old girl runs onto the patio. This is 
           Emily, Sabrina’s daughter.

                                 EMILY
                        Mommy!

           Emily throws her arms around her mother’s leg. Sabrina looks 
           up as a young babysitter, ASHLEY, approaches, carrying a 
           fussing, snot nosed baby. Sabrina meets her halfway, dragging 
           her daughter on her thigh.

                                 SABRINA
                        Ashley. What are you doing here?
                                 ASHLEY
                        Oliver said to bring them by for 
                        the reception. My day rate was too 
                        expensive. 

           Sabrina grabs a champagne flute from a passing waiter and 
           knocks it back before reaching for the baby. 

                                 SABRINA
                        I’ll Venmo you. 

           Ashley walks out. 

                                 MEG
                        You can afford her day rate. 

                                 SABRINA
                        Oliver’s ego can’t. He pretends 
                        like I never got that promotion. 

           The baby turns to Sabrina, smiles at her, adorably, before 
           sneezing a snot ball the size of a jawbreaker onto her blouse 
           and then promptly throwing up. An older woman stops to scold 
           Sabrina. 

                                 OLDER WOMAN
                        This is too much stimulation for a 
                        baby so young, mom. 

           Sabrina, Meg, and Heather take a threatening step toward the 
           older woman, but Dr. Wheeler steps in and saves the day with 
           a cool burn. 

                                 DR. WHEELER
                        I didn’t realize there was another 
                        doctor in the house. 

           The older woman scuttles away. Meg and Heather launch into 
           action: grabbing napkins and club soda. Meg takes the baby 
           from Sabrina’s arms and bounces him. These women are pros. 

                                 MEG
                        I brought an extra white shirt just 
                        in case. It’s hanging in my closet. 

           Sabrina glances at her baby, in Meg’s arms. Heather is 
           playing with Emily, keeping her occupied. Meg nods, it’s 
           okay. We’ve got this. Go. 

           INT. THE MANSION - FIRST FLOOR - DUSK

           As Sabrina approaches the stairs, she hears a man and a woman 
           arguing in the sunroom. She pauses, eavesdropping. 
                                 JULIE O.C.
                        You told me you stood to make money 
                        on the sale but you never told me 
                        you and Dylan were the property 
                        sellers. 

                                 TOM O.C.
                        This land is worth three times the 
                        amount the developers offered. I 
                        thought, with the press of our 
                        wedding, business would improve, 
                        and then we would be in a position 
                        to negotiate. 

                                 JULIE O.C.
                        You owed it to me to tell me that 
                        before you accepted my money. 
                        Before I turned down Roche for 
                        Claremont. 

                                 TOM O.C.
                        You know what, Jules? Let’s just 
                        forget the whole thing. We didn’t 
                        even sign the marriage license yet. 

           Sabrina holds her breath in the long beat that follows. 

                                 JULIE O.C.
                        Don’t be dramatic, Tom. 
                             (beat)
                        I’m sorry, okay? 

           Sabrina inhales, sharply, in reaction to her strong friend 
           apologizing to her deceitful husband. 

                                 CHUCK
                        Ironic, isn’t it?

           Sabrina jumps away from the door. 

                                 CHUCK (CONT’D)
                        Tom is the reason The Mansion went 
                        from being the most successful 
                        marriage destination in the 
                        northeast to a seeping money pit, 
                        and now it’s the single source of 
                        conflict in his hour-long marriage. 

           Chuck polishes off his whiskey with a mean chuckle. 

                                 CHUCK (CONT’D)
                        Who’s a guy gotta deport to get a 
                        drink ‘round here anymore? 
           Sabrina smiles, politely. Chuck is drunk and belligerent. She 
           gestures to the stain on her shirt/blazer.

                                 SABRINA
                        Excuse me. 

           Chuck steps closer, leering at Sabrina, pinching the lapel of 
           her blazer. 

                                 CHUCK
                        You think your husbands wanna fuck 
                        you dressed like men?

           Sabrina steps around Chuck, gingerly. He watches her climb 
           the stairs to the bridal wing, venom in his eyes. 

           INT. THE MANSION - MEG’S ROOM - DUSK

           The sun wanes, but it’s still light enough that Sabrina 
           doesn’t have to turn on a lamp. The music indicates that 
           danger lurks. She approaches Meg’s closet. We hold our breath 
           as she opens the door...

           She stops, hand on the knob, at an odd sound behind her.  

                                 SABRINA
                        Hello?

           The door to the bathroom is slightly ajar. Sabrina tip toes 
           toward it. She swings it open in one swift motion. The shower 
           curtain is pulled shut. The noise is coming from there. 

                                 SABRINA (CONT’D)
                        Someone in here?

           She holds her breath; pushes aside the curtain. The faucet is 
           leaking, plopping onto a plastic shampoo bottle that fell 
           into the drain. The source of the odd sound. 

           Sabrina laughs at herself as she returns to the closet. Just 
           being paranoid. She swings open the closet door to reveal... 

           The shirt. 

           Sabrina shrugs off her blazer. She tosses it onto the bed and 
           freezes. The bed is lumpy, strangely shaped...

           The killer throws off the covers. Sabrina doesn’t even have 
           time to scream. She narrowly dodges the axe, scrambling to 
           the far side of the room, by the bay window overlooking the 
           cocktail hour. The killer raises the axe, the blade catching 
           the last few strands of sunlight. We cut away from Sabrina’s 
           terrified face to... 
           EXT. THE MANSION - BACK PATIO - DUSK 

           Down below, the guests continue to sip champagne and chat, 
           oblivious to the blood that suddenly splatters the window 
           pane up above. Sabrina’s blood. 

           FOCUS on Karen in the crowd. She’s having a stern 
           conversation with one of the servers in a corner. 

                                 KAREN
                        What do you mean, he’s not here?

                                 SERVER
                        He was this morning. I saw him. 

                                 KAREN
                        Have you tried calling him?

                                 SERVER
                        So many times. 

           Karen looks at the bar, swarming with impatient guests. The 
           sole bartender is sweating profusely, trying to meet demand. 
           Karen takes out her hot spot, powers it on, and connects to 
           the WiFi. She opens up her YELP app, finding the listing for 
           MIX MASTER in Bedminster, New Jersey. She gives him a one 
           star review. 

                                 KAREN
                        Enjoy never working in this town 
                        again! 

           CUT TO Meg and Heather, entertaining Sabrina’s kids while 
           Oliver, Matt, and Evan play corn hole on the grass. Tabitha 
           is wandering the grounds, taking notes. Dr. Wheeler finishes 
           her latest martini. A single strand of grey hair is out of 
           place; her eyes glassy. The little girl starts to whimper. 

                                 EMILY
                        When’s mommy coming back? 

           Meg and Heather share a look of heartbreak. Dr. Wheeler is 
           unmoved.  

                                 HEATHER
                             (to Emily)
                        Can you keep a secret?

           Emily nods, her chin wobbling. Heather hands her an iPhone. 

                                 HEATHER (CONT’D)
                        I know mommy doesn’t like for you 
                        to play with these so—
                                 (MORE)
                                 HEATHER (CONT’D)
                             (holds a finger to her 
                              lips)

           Emily plays with the phone, her tears drying. 

                                 DR. WHEELER
                        Where is her father? Why are you 
                        stuck with them?

           Meg points to the group of guys playing cornhole. Dr. Wheeler 
           sneers. She snatches the phone away from the little girl. 

                                 DR. WHEELER (CONT’D)
                        These things give you cancer in 
                        your brain. I’m a doctor. Do you 
                        want to have cancer in your brain?

           On Meg’s hip, the baby starts to cry. 

                                 EMILY
                        What’s cansor?

                                 DR. WHEELER
                        It’s a terrible, painful disease.  

                                 MEG
                        Dr. Wheeler—

                                 DR. MORGAN
                        It eats you from the inside.  

                                 MEG
                        Dr. Wheeler!

           Emily starts to wail, in tandem with the baby. The collective 
           cry is loud enough that Oliver notices and breaks from the 
           game, jogging over. Emily runs toward him, hysterical. 

                                 EMILY
                        Daddyyyy!!!!

           Oliver scoops her up. 

                                 OLIVER
                        What the hell happened?

           Dr. Wheeler glares at Emily, as if daring her to tell on her. 

                                 MEG
                             (sarcastically)
                        Sorry to pull you out at overtime.

           Meg hands the baby off to Oliver. 
                                 OLIVER
                        If you had come over and asked me 
                        to babysit I would have done it. 

                                 MEG
                        Yo, not hot Don Draper! It’s not 
                        babysitting when they’re your kids. 

           Heather stands. 

                                 HEATHER
                        Let’s get a drink, Meg.

                                 OLIVER
                             (calling after her)
                        You’re pregnant!

           Heather and Meg retort at the same time. 

                                 HEATHER/MEG
                        It’s cooked!

           Oliver is left with a crying baby and a crying five year old. 
           Dr. Wheeler watches them like a funny movie. Chuck approaches 
           her, noting her empty martini glass.  

                                 CHUCK
                        I can’t get a damn drink either.

           Dr. Wheeler makes some sort of hand gesture to the lone 
           bartender. He drops everything to make her a martini. Dr. 
           Wheeler glances at Chuck’s glass.

                                 DR. WHEELER
                        And Bulleit neat. 

                                 CHUCK
                        Smart woman. Like her daughter.

           Dr. Wheeler can barely contain her contempt for Chuck. 

                                 CHUCK (CONT’D)
                        I just want you to know, the family 
                        has welcomed Julie with open arms. 
                        Hell, we’re hoping her work ethic 
                        rubs off on our Tom-boy. So. Put to 
                        bed any fears you have about giving 
                        away your only child. 

           Without turning her head, Dr. Wheeler holds out her hand, the 
           one sporting the big gold Cartier Panthére ring. A server 
           places a fresh martini in it; a perfectly coordinated dance.
                                 DR. WHEELER
                        I don’t give away daughters, Chuck. 
                        I take in sons. 

           Dr. Wheeler skates away, martini in hand. 

           CUT TO Meg and Heather, receiving their drink orders at long 
           last. They are just about to take a sip when Karen appears.  

                                 KAREN
                        Can you get all the bridesmaids and 
                        groomsmen lined up outside the 
                        door? The reception is about to 
                        start and we need everyone ready 
                        for the introductions. 

           Meg smiles at Karen, too brightly. 

                                 MEG
                        Your timing is uncanny, Karen.

           Her sarcasm is not missed by Karen. 

                                 KAREN
                        Julie is lucky to have a matron of 
                        honor like you. 

           Karen walks off, herding the guests inside. Meg has to raise 
           a glass to that. 

                                 MEG
                        Karen can cut a bitch after all. 

           INT. THE MANSION - OUTSIDE RECEPTION HALL - NIGHT

           Julie and Tom are last in line. Dylan, Matt, Evan, Meg, and 
           Heather are before them. Julie is distressed. 

                                 JULIE
                        Where is everyone?

                                 MEG
                        Becca sprained her ankle. Oliver is 
                        changing the baby’s diaper. I have 
                        a feeling Sabrina is hiding from 
                        Oliver changing the baby’s diaper. 

                                 JULIE
                        What about Jason?

           Meg and Heather exchange a glance. 
                                 MEG
                        According to Matt, he—

           At that moment, Jason walks in, brushing leaves off his tux. 

                                 JULIE
                        I was starting to worry no one 
                        would be left by the end of the 
                        night. 

           Jason joins Matt and the camera focuses on them.

                                 MATT
                        We were worried about you, brother!

                                 JASON
                        I can’t even begin to tell you 
                        where I’ve been— 

           From inside the reception hall, the lead singer of the band 
           starts to announce the names of the wedding party. Everyone 
           files out, until it’s just Tom and Julie left. Tom reaches 
           for Julie’s hand and squeezes, apologetically. Julie softens. 

                                 LEAD SINGER O.C.
                        And now, for the first time, please 
                        join me in welcoming Mr. and Mrs. 
                        Cunninghammmmm!

           Julie’s mouth drops. 

           INT. THE MANSION - RECEPTION HALL - NIGHT

           She makes eye contact with her mother as she approaches the 
           dance floor. 

                                 DR. WHEELER
                             (mouthing)
                        Mrs. Cunningham?

           She shakes her head, her disapproval palpable.  

           Tom and Julie make they way to the center of the dance floor. 
           The clapping and cheering cease. The band starts to play 
           their first song: You’re my Best Friend by Queen.  

           Julie is stiff as they dance. 

                                 TOM
                             (defensively)
                        I told them you were keeping your 
                        maiden name. 
                                 JULIE
                        Don’t worry about it. It is an 
                        unusual request. 

           Tom spins Julie. As she turns, she notices Dylan, watching 
           her, longingly. She looks away. The moment feels too intense 
           and frankly, inappropriate. 

           The band switches to Sweet Caroline. The guests join them on 
           the dance floor, swarming Julie and Tom. They lose each other 
           in the crowd. 

           CUT TO Oliver sitting in a corner, getting absolutely owned 
           by his children. The baby is crying, Emily is clobbering him 
           over the head with a lamb chop, repeatedly. The same older 
           woman who stopped to criticize Sabrina stops to offer Oliver 
           words of encouragement. 

                                 OLDER WOMAN
                        You’re doing great, dad.   

           Meg and Heather watch, endlessly amused, sipping champagne. 

                                 MEG
                        Dave Chappelle isn’t even this 
                        funny. 

                                 HEATHER
                        Is anyone else wondering where 
                        Sabrina is? 

           Meg offers her pregnant friend a fresh glass of champagne.

           As Emily threatens Oliver with a steak knife, FOCUS on Jason 
           and Matt, talking across the room. 

                                 MATT
                        Creepy caretaker girl?

                                 JASON
                        You know about her?

                                 MATT
                        Tom mentioned her once.  

           Jason takes a step closer to Matt.

                                 JASON
                        Let me ask you something, and 
                        answer me honestly. Have Tom and 
                        Dylan ever, you know, switched 
                        places since we’ve known them?

           Matt sips his drink and doesn’t answer. 
                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        That a yes?

                                 MATT
                        That’s a you don’t want to know. 

                                 JASON
                        Dude. What? Tell me. 

           Matt sighs. 

                                 MATT
                        It has to do with Becca. 

           Jason’s eyes widen. 

           CUT TO Julie and Marilyn, dancing together. Marilyn is so 
           happy and Julie does her best to match her mother-in-law’s 
           unbridled joy. Julie notices Tabitha standing by herself on 
           the perimeter of the dance floor. Julie grabs Marilyn’s hand. 

                                 JULIE
                        There’s someone I want you to meet!

           Julie leads Marilyn to Tabitha. 

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        Tabitha Hanover, please meet my 
                        mother-in-law, Marilyn Cunningham. 

           Tabitha extends her hand. 

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        Tabitha is writing the piece on 
                        me—on us—for the New York Times. 

           Marilyn’s eyes light up. 

                                 MARILYN
                        It is a pleasure, Tabitha. Thank 
                        you for coming all this way to 
                        profile our little family business. 

           Tabitha gazes at the expansive reception room.

                                 TABITHA
                        You call this little?

                                 JULIE
                        The Mansion has been in Marilyn’s 
                        family for three generations. I 
                        figured you might have some 
                        questions for her. 
                                 TABITHA
                        I certainly do! 

           Tabitha reaches for her notebook and pen. Julie leaves them 
           to it. She makes her rounds, stopping to make chit-chat with 
           her guests. She embraces a woman, ANNABELLE, 39. 

                                 ANNABELLE
                        Congratulations, you brilliant and 
                        gorgeous woman. 

                                 JULIE
                        Congratulations to you! Do you have 
                        pictures?

           Annabelle shows Julie a picture of her newborn baby on her 
           phone. Julie sighs in appreciation. 

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh, Annabelle. I’m so happy for 
                        you. 

           Annabelle admires the picture too. 

                                 ANNABELLE
                        I was afraid, you know? That the 
                        connection might not be there 
                        because he’s not biologically mine. 
                        But it’s almost like it’s stronger 
                        for what we had to go through to 
                        find each other. 

           Julie smiles at her. Over Annabelle’s shoulder, through the 
           glass windows, she detects a moving light. Julie squints. 

           EXT. THE MANSION - NIGHT

           It’s the butt of Tom’s cigarette. He’s stolen away for a 
           moment of peace. 

           He’s not alone. Someone is watching him. 

           Tom finishes his cigarette and drops it onto a cocktail plate 
           cum ashtray. It’s full of shrimp tails and cigarette butts 
           from other smokers who have used this corner alcove. He 
           starts to head inside, then stops when he hears a branch 
           snap. He turns around, slowly. No one is behind him, but the 
           cocktail plate has been emptied. Tom takes a breath and 
           speaks into the dense woods.  

                                 TOM
                             (nervous)
                        Eddie?
           No response. Long, long beat. 

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. 

           He waits. The camera pulls back to reveal the profiles of 
           Eddie and Tom, reflected in the glass of the reception hall. 
           Eddie is no more that six inches into the woods, gripping a 
           garbage bag tightly, a single tear running down her face. Her 
           other eye is incapable of producing tears anymore. 

           Hold on the reflection of her face as Tom gives up and heads 
           inside. Eddie turns to face the glass, watching the reception 
           from the outside corner. She sees Julie. She is not crying 
           now. She places her hands on the glass, smiling maniacally.    

           INT. THE MANSION - RECEPTION HALL - NIGHT

           Dylan holds court in the center of the dance floor, giving 
           his best man’s speech. 

                                 DYLAN
                        ....sure if everyone has ever heard 
                        us refer to Tom as The Skipper?

           A few hoots and laughs from the crowd. 

                                 DYLAN (CONT’D)
                        For those of you who are unfamiliar 
                        with the mores of the Cunningham 
                        family, we pride ourself on our 
                        work ethic, right dad? 

           In the crowd, Chuck Cunningham raises his glass. 

                                 DYLAN (CONT’D)
                        The summer we turned fourteen my 
                        dad sat us down and told us that we 
                        would not be permitted to use the 
                        beach house if we didn’t have a 
                        job. Now, me? I apply to the ice 
                        cream place. Doesn’t open until 11 
                        in the morning, free scoops. It’s a 
                        no brainer. 
                             (beat)
                        My brother?

           Dylan shakes his head, laughing. 

                                 DYLAN (CONT’D)
                        My brother, at fourteen years old, 
                        detected a “hole in the market.” 
           Some laughter. 

                                 DYLAN (CONT’D)
                        He noticed that families arrived at 
                        the beach with all this stuff, and 
                        all these kids, and it was 
                        pandemonium trying to haul their 
                        coolers and chairs and beach toys. 
                        So what does my brother do?

           A beat. Julie looks at Tom, uncertainly. She’s never heard 
           this before. Tom is smiling though. 

                                 DYLAN (CONT’D)
                        He sets up shop by the beach 
                        taggers. He’s got a laminated sign, 
                        a Steelmaker cash box, and 
                        complimentary lemonade. He’s got 
                        rates. Five bucks for the first 
                        haul, two bucks for any additional 
                        trips. In the first week he’s got 
                        so much business that he hires out. 
                        He calls himself The Skipper. His 
                        slogan was: Skip the trip!

           Howls of laughter. Julie laughs too. It’s a cute story. 

                                 DYLAN (CONT’D)
                        Unfortunately, Beach Patrol got 
                        wind of his under the table 
                        operation and shut the whole thing 
                        down. But for about three weeks 
                        there, my brother was the flushest 
                        fourteen year old you knew. Ice 
                        cream on him, every night. Double 
                        scoop in the waffle cone. 

           Everyone laughs. 

                                 DYLAN (CONT’D)
                        My brother never wanted to be run 
                        of the mill. That was true for him 
                        professionally, and perhaps that is 
                        why The Skipper stuck. Because he 
                        was always skipping around from one 
                        million dollar idea to the 
                        next—there was the coffee shop that 
                        was also a car wash, the car wash 
                        that was also an Internet cafe—and 
                        don’t forget the holiday 
                        decorations delivery service—
           Julie is no longer laughing, though everyone else is. She 
           makes eye contact with her mother. Dr. Wheeler is glaring at 
           Dylan, with pure contempt.

                                 DYLAN (CONT’D)
                        But what people forget is that it 
                        takes skill and the Cunningham work 
                        ethic to even get these ventures 
                        off the ground, let alone turn a 
                        profit, which many of them did. 
                        Elon Musk started seventeen 
                        businesses before launching Tesla. 
                        Richard Branson started twelve 
                        before founding the Virgin Group. 
                        And, as someone who went the 
                        traditional and safe way in life, 
                        I’m always in awe of my brother’s 
                        unconventional spirit, and the way 
                        he prioritizes passion in his life 
                        above all else. It’s why when he 
                        told me he’d met a girl, and he 
                        thought this may be it, I knew she 
                        had to be someone who wasn’t just 
                        special, but extraordinary.

           Tom wraps his arm around Julie. She smiles at him. 

                                 DYLAN (CONT’D)
                        Tom wouldn’t waste his time on 
                        anything less. And Julie is, wow. 

           A long beat. Almost too long. Dylan’s admiration for Julie 
           makes everyone uncomfortable. 

                                 DYLAN (CONT’D)
                        Julie is not just special. She’s 
                        not just extraordinary. She’s one 
                        of a kind.

           Dylan raises his glass of champagne. 

                                 DYLAN (CONT’D)
                        To The Skipper and his bride!

           Cheers. Glasses clinking. Dr. Wheeler gets up. It’s her turn. 

                                 DYLAN (CONT’D)
                        And now a word from the mother of 
                        the—

           Dr. Wheeler rips the microphone out of Dylan’s hand before he 
           can introduce her. She drains her martini and gives him the 
           glass, then shoos him away. CUT TO Meg, stifling a laugh. Dr. 
           Wheeler is savage. 
                                 DR. WHEELER
                        We don’t have an adorable nickname 
                        like The Skipper for my only 
                        daughter, so if it’s quite all 
                        right, I’ll just refer to her as 
                        Dr. Julie Wheeler for the duration 
                        of this speech.
                             (beat)
                        Dr. Julie Wheeler was accepted 
                        early decision to MIT, where she 
                        graduated with a joint degree in 
                        Science and Engineering. She went 
                        on to intern under Frances Arnold 
                        in the molecular biology lab at 
                        Caltech for two years. For those of 
                        you who are unfamiliar with the 
                        mores of the scientific community, 
                        Frances Arnold won the Nobel Prize 
                        in Chemistry while battling breast 
                        cancer. After a mentorship under 
                        the most brilliant mind of our 
                        time, Dr. Julie Wheeler was 
                        accepted for her masters in biology 
                        at Johns Hopkins, where she studied 
                        bioecological compounds and their 
                        inference on cancer cells. She 
                        graduated summa cum laude with high 
                        six figure offers from Goldman 
                        Sachs, Sloan Kettering, and Apple, 
                        but she took a pay cut to work in a 
                        small but cutting edge lab in White 
                        Plains, focusing on the stem cell 
                        theory of cancer in her father’s 
                        memory. While there, she developed 
                        a data platform for the sharing of 
                        medical equipment between hospitals 
                        and sold it to Church Lab for four 
                        million dollars. One million of 
                        that went into The Skipper’s latest 
                        passion project and the rest into 
                        their move to Silicon Valley, not 
                        Basel, where Dr. Julie Wheeler 
                        would have been the first woman to 
                        head the Genentech research lab at 
                        Roche. Silicon Valley offers more 
                        networking opportunities for The 
                        Skipper and of course, Dr. Julie 
                        Wheeler has her pick of tier two 
                        university teaching positions. 

           Dr. Wheeler returns the microphone to its cradle and walks 
           away to stunned silence. She suddenly turns back around. 
                                 DR. WHEELER (CONT’D)
                        I forgot to add that Dr. Julie 
                        Wheeler also volunteers for Mount 
                        Sinai’s Sexual Assault and Domestic 
                        Violence Intervention Program on 
                        her weekends. Congratulations to 
                        Mr. and Mrs. Cunningham. 

           Dr. Wheeler walks out. Chuck starts a slow, drunken clap. 

           EXT. THE MANSION - NIGHT

           Julie finds her mother, sitting in one of the seats from the 
           wedding ceremony, drinking a fresh martini. 

                                 DR. WHEELER
                        I won’t pretend he’s worthy of you, 
                        Julie. I just...I can’t.  

                                 JULIE
                        Then I’d call what you did in there 
                        a runaway success. 

           Dr. Wheeler rips into an olive with her two front teeth.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        Why did you even come, mom? If you 
                        were just going to get drunk and 
                        insult us?

                                 DR. WHEELER
                        Maybe I thought I could stop you 
                        before you made the biggest mistake 
                        of your life. 

           Julie shakes her head, tears in her eyes. 

                                 JULIE
                        I called you a cab. It’s waiting 
                        out front. I’d like for you to 
                        leave now. 

           Julie turns and walks away. Dr. Wheeler remains seated, her 
           back to Julie. In an unusual show of emotion, Dr. Wheeler 
           starts to cry. She turns in her seat. 

                                 DR. WHEELER
                        Julie, wait! Julie!

           Julie is gone. Dr. Wheeler sighs and turns back around, 
           wiping her eyes. She takes another sip of her martini. Behind 
           her, the killer approaches. Dr. Wheeler hears the footsteps 
           and mistakes them for Julie’s.
                                 DR. WHEELER (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, Julie. I really am. It’s 
                        just...your father was a great man 
                        but even he held me back. Men will 
                        always hold women like us back, 
                        even the good ones. 

           The killer places a hand on Dr. Wheeler’s shoulder and 
           squeezes. Dr. Wheeler continues talking, thinking it is her 
           daughter squeezing her shoulder.

                                 DR. WHEELER (CONT’D)
                        I’d venture to say it’s even harder 
                        for your generation. There was no 
                        such thing as having it all when I 
                        became a mother. I chose my career 
                        over you and accepted that I would 
                        be judged harshly because being a 
                        working mother and a good mother 
                        were incongruous back then. Now, 
                        it’s like...we expect women to work 
                        like they don’t have children and 
                        raise children as if they don’t 
                        work.  
                             (sighing; sips her 
                              martini)
                        Women like us. We need lesbians 
                        with dicks.  

           Dr. Wheeler reaches up and squeezes the killer’s hand. She is 
           surprised to feel gloves. 

                                 DR. WHEELER (CONT’D)
                        What...?

           Dr. Wheeler looks up, finally. She screams when she sees the 
           killer, raising an axe. She shields her face with one hand, 
           the one holding the martini. The axe comes down. The camera 
           follows Dr. Wheeler’s hand, still holding tight to her 
           martini, as it flies through the air and comes to a rest on 
           the grass. The music inside masks Dr. Wheeler’s dying cries.

           INT. THE MANSION - RECEPTION HALL - NIGHT

           Julie strides inside, still upset from her conversation with 
           her mother. She notices Meg and Tabitha, speaking intensely 
           in the corner. She interrupts them. 

                                 JULIE
                        I am so embarrassed about that, 
                        Tabitha. Please tell me—

           Meg waves her hand. 
                                 MEG
                        We’ve already discussed. There will 
                        be no mention of Mommy Dearest’s 
                        speech from feminist hell anywhere 
                        in the piece. 

           The band returns from a break right as Tabitha adds... 

                                 TABITHA
                        The New Yorker is better than that. 

           Julie gives Tabitha a strange look. Did she say The New 
           Yorker? It was difficult to tell over the music. 

                                 JULIE
                        The New York Times is better than 
                        that. 

                                 TABITHA
                        That’s what I just said. 

                                 JULIE
                        Right. Sorry. The music. Oh, Karen! 
                        Karen!

           Julie grabs Karen as she passes by with her clipboard. 

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        I was thinking you might help 
                        Tabitha with some color for the 
                        story? You planned it gorgeously, 
                        down to the smallest detail. 

           Karen flushes with pride and links her arm through Tabitha’s.  

                                 KAREN
                        Do I have a crazy story for you 
                        about the program paper stock...

           The two walk off, Karen regaling Tabitha with the drama of 
           the paper stock. Meg takes Julie by the shoulders, concerned. 

                                 MEG
                        Dude. Are you okay? That was some 
                        red wedding shit in there. 

                                 JULIE
                        Not really. Have you seen Marilyn? 
                        Please tell me she’s not crying in 
                        the bathroom. 

                                 MEG
                        Fuck Marilyn. Seriously, Jules. 
                        Fuck your mom. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MEG (CONT'D)
                        Fuck Chuck Limbaugh in there. 
                        You’ve done enough for everyone 
                        around you and it’s your wedding. 
                        Don’t become one of those women who 
                        worries about everyone but herself 
                        once she gets married. 

                                 JULIE
                        Fuck. Is that what’s happening?

                                 MEG
                        You used to be a bad bitch in 
                        bifocals. 

                                 JULIE
                        They’re lab safety goggles. 

           Meg sighs.

                                 MEG
                        Let me have it. 

           Cue the deep bass beats of Push It by Salt n’ Pepper. Meg and 
           Julie take one look at each other and without needing to 
           exchange a word, head for the dance floor. 

           INT. THE MANSION - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT 

           This dance is not for everyone; only the sexy people. The 
           blue hairs see themselves off the dance floor, clutching 
           their pearls at the explicit lyrics and Meg and Julie’s 
           stripper moves. A few brave Phyllises and Bernices remain, 
           and Meg graciously grinds against them, in the spirit of 
           inclusion. Julie is laughing and dancing and finally having a 
           blast at her own wedding. Not with her groom, but with her 
           best friend. 

           The music changes to a slow song. Tom appears behind Julie. 
           Reluctantly, she stops dancing with Meg to dance with him. 

                                 TOM
                        The stuff your mom said...wow. 

                                 JULIE
                        I am so sorry, Tom. I asked her to 
                        leave.

           They dance without speaking. CUT TO Meg and Matt, dancing. 

                                 MATT
                        Our wedding was way more fun than 
                        this. 
                                 MEG
                        We were living in a twenty-six year 
                        old’s paradise.

                                 MATT
                        Heyyy, now. You’re saying you don’t 
                        have fun with me anymore?

           Matt attempts a fancy dance move, stumbles, and tweaks a 
           muscle in his back. 

                                 MEG
                        I packed the ICY HOT. 

                                 MATT
                        I can’t live without you.   

           They kiss. Meg gets serious a moment. 

                                 MEG
                        But, seriously, Matt? 

           Matt spins her, gingerly supporting his back, not serious. 

                                 MATT
                        What is it?

                                 MEG
                        Maybe I would be having more fun if 
                        we brought on Elsa full time. 

           Matt groans. 

                                 MATT
                        That’s an extra, what? Thirty 
                        thousand a year?

                                 MEG
                        Forty. But if we give up the 
                        membership at the golf club... 

           Matt pretends he’s having a heart attack.

           CUT TO Heather and Evan, dancing. Heather’s seven month belly 
           means there is a good amount of space between them.  

                                 EVAN
                        I think it’s a boy. 

           Heather rolls her eyes. 

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Why do you get so annoyed when I 
                        say that?
                                 HEATHER
                        Because we already have two boys 
                        and you know I want a girl. 

                                 EVAN
                        I think it’s cute. You with three 
                        boys. They’re like, your team. 

                                 HEATHER
                        I’d rather a team of fully grown 
                        professionals in the global 
                        marketing communications industry.  

                                 EVAN
                        I know you’re desperate to get back 
                        to work. It will happen. 

                                 HEATHER
                        By the time this one is in school, 
                        I’ll have a nine year gap on my 
                        resumé. Who’s going to hire me?

                                 EVAN
                        I think you’re doing an incredible 
                        job right now. 

           Heather sighs. She grabs Evan’s hand and starts to drag him 
           away. They pass Chuck at the bar. 

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Where are we—

                                 HEATHER
                        I’m horny. 

           Chuck’s anttenna goes up at that. Dylan notices his father 
           follow Heather and Evan. He follows too.   

           INT. THE MANSION - GREAT ROOM - NIGHT

           Dylan gets distracted as he passes the sunroom. A fire is 
           burning inside. 

           INT. THE MANSION - SUNROOM - NIGHT

           Dylan pokes his head inside, wondering why there is a fire 
           going with no one to tend to it. He goes to put it out, then 
           notices something. A heap of fabric on a log. He uses a fire 
           poker to remove it from the fire. It’s a CVS employee’s 
           apron. The badge name reads BRITTANY. 
           INT. THE MANSION - GUEST ROOM - NIGHT

           Heather leads Evan into her room, wordlessly. She reaches 
           under her dress and removes her underwear, while Evan undoes 
           the buckle on his belt. Heather pushes him onto his back on 
           the bed, turning around and sitting on top of him.  

                                 EVAN
                        Do you not want to see me or 
                        something?

           Heather puts her hand on her belly.

                                 HEATHER
                        It’s easier this way. 

           HOLD on Heather as she starts to have sex with her husband. 
           Blue and red police lights suddenly light up her face. 

                                 HEATHER (CONT’D)
                        Why are the cops here?

                                 EVAN
                        Jason said...just a hunting 
                        accident...don’t stop. 

           Heather keeps going. 

           CUT TO outside the door. Chuck is standing there, whiskey in 
           hand, his ear pressed up against the door, listening. He 
           starts when he hears a voice. 

                                 KAREN
                        Excuse me, can I help you?

           Karen is standing there, clipboard in hand. Chuck clears his 
           throat, embarrassed. 

                                 CHUCK
                        I can’t find my phone anywhere, 
                        actually. 

                                 KAREN
                        I don’t think it’s in the bride’s 
                        wing. But maybe I can help you look 
                        downstairs?

           It’s a standoff. Finally, Chuck follows her. 

           INT. THE MANSION - SUNROOM - NIGHT

           Tom enters the room, finding his brother puzzling over the 
           CVS uniform. 
                                 TOM
                        Yo. Check my room one more time for 
                        Becca’s shoe?

                                 DYLAN
                        I looked everywhere—

                                 TOM
                        I’ll do it then. 

                                 DYLAN
                        No, I will. 

                                 TOM
                        I will!

           It is a little unclear which brother heads for the stairs.

           INT. THE MANSION - BRIDAL WING - HEATHER’S ROOM - NIGHT

           From their position on the bed, neither Evan nor Heather see 
           the way the police lights flash and reveal the killer, 
           standing in the doorway of the bathroom.

           The police lights go out, and the room goes dark. When the 
           lights flash again, the killer is one step closer to the 
           couple. The lights go out; the room goes dark. The lights 
           flash again. The killer is standing in front of Heather now, 
           the axe raised. Heather and Evan scream as the lights go out. 
           In the dark, we hear a grotesque gurgling noise. The lights 
           flash on. The axe is sticking out of Heather’s pregnant 
           belly. It’s like someone pricked a balloon full of blood with 
           a pin. Pop. Blood everywhere. 

           Evan howls as Heather goes down in the dark, grunting, dying. 
           When the lights flash on again, he is locked in a struggle 
           with the killer. On. Off. On. Off. On, and Evan is on his 
           back on the ground, moaning, a shattered lamp next to his 
           head. The killer struggles to remove the blade from Heather’s 
           stomach, but it’s stuck. The killer resorts to Plan B. 

           Leaving the blade in Heather’s stomach, the killer steps on 
           the axe’s long wooden handle, pinning Evan to the ground at 
           his throat.  

           The killer leans forward, putting more weight on the handle, 
           choking Evan, forcing Heather’s body to roll over and face 
           her husband with dead eyes. Evan is gasping and gurgling, 
           clawing at the handle as it crushes his windpipe. He reaches 
           for Heather’s hand...the lights flash off. On. Evan is limp. 
           EXT. THE WOODS - NIGHT

           FOLLOW the flashing lights of the police car through the 
           bedroom window, alighting on Eddie and the SHERIFF, 50s.  

                                 EDDIE
                        I bet if you checked hospital 
                        records, some jackass in a red hat 
                        showed up with a severed finger. 

                                 SHERIFF
                        You’re probably right. 

           The Sheriff looks up at the mansion, alight on the hill. 

                                 SHERIFF (CONT’D)
                        You been over there tonight?

                                 EDDIE
                        Just to make sure no lit cigarette 
                        butts were burning. 

                                 SHERIFF
                        You see Tom?

           Eddie looks away. 

                                 SHERIFF (CONT’D)
                        You’re better off, Eddie. Those 
                        guys make you do crazy things. 

           Eddie glares at the Sheriff as he tips his hat and climbs 
           into his vehicle. He backs up...and runs over some glass. He 
           puts the car in park and gets out again. 

           He shines his flashlight on the ground, discovering a trail 
           of broken liquor bottles. He follows it deeper into the 
           woods, happening upon the van. He examines the plates, the 
           damage to the cargo. He opens the back doors...

                                 SHERIFF (CONT’D)
                        Jesus, Mary, and...

           He reaches for his radio, his hand trembling uncontrollably. 
           Before he can speak a word, Eddie plunges a broken vodka 
           bottle into the side of his neck. 

           The Sheriff turns to Eddie, drooling blood. She gives him a 
           light push, and he timbers, landing half inside the van.

           Humming Here Comes the Bride, Eddie stuffs the Sheriff inside 
           the van. He joins the bartender and Becca, wearing her 
           rehearsal dinner dress, her stiletto stabbed through her 
           forehead. FOCUS on the shoe, then cut to...
           INT. THE MANSION - GROOM’S WING - TOM’S ROOM

           Its mate, perched on the window sill in plain sight. Someone 
           picks it up, his expression unreadable. It’s Dylan. We think.

           INT. THE MANSION - REHEARSAL HALL - NIGHT

           A SCREAM as Tom and Julie smash wedding cake into each 
           other’s faces. Tom kisses Julie, more passionately than he 
           has at any point in the evening. Julie is a little taken 
           aback, but Marilyn is overjoyed. Chuck is looking under the 
           tables for his phone. 

           The band plays the last song: Journey’s Don’t Stop Believin’. 
           Meg finds Julie in the crowd. She’s dancing, joyfully. 

                                 MEG
                        This song should die in a fire!

                                 JULIE
                        I hate it so much!

           They scream-sing it, anyway. 

           CUT TO the foyer. Julie and Tom bid their guests farewell at 
           the door. Buses are waiting for them. Karen is in the drive, 
           making sure everyone gets home safely. She sees Tabitha. 

                                 KAREN
                        Oh, Tabitha! Tabitha!

           Tabitha keeps walking. Karen has to run after her and grab 
           her by the arm. 

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        Tabitha. Didn’t you hear me calling 
                        your name?

                                 TABITHA
                        My ears are ringing from the music. 

                                 KAREN
                        I know you had trouble finding the 
                        place so I just wanted to make sure 
                        you can get out of here okay. 

                                 TABITHA
                        I was just going to Uber. 

           Karen looks past the buses. The Jeep is still parked there. 

                                 KAREN
                        That’s not your car?
           Tabitha shakes her head no. 

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        Huh. Well. If you’re Ubering, 
                        you’ll need this!

           Karen offers her the hotspot device. 

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        The Mansion’s little secret. We 
                        turn off the Wifi when the guests 
                        arrive, though it’s spotty at best 
                        to begin with. It’s better when 
                        everyone is in the moment, don’t 
                        you think? You should put that in 
                        your article. One of our special 
                        touches.

           Tabitha smiles and pulls out her phone, connecting. She opens 
           her Uber app. One of the caterers calls out for Karen. 

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        Duty always calls! Please let me 
                        know if there is anything I can 
                        help you with while you’re working 
                        on the piece. 

           Karen presses her business card into Tabitha’s hand. Tabitha 
           reads it: Karen Kulback, Wedding Planning and Management, 
           LLC. Her expression in her head shot is deadly serious. 

           CUT TO Julie and Tom, hugging the last of their guests 
           goodbye. Outside, Oliver hauls his kids onto the bus. Jason 
           helps him.

                                 OLIVER
                        Sabrina texted me to get a room at 
                        the Marriott with the kids. I’ve 
                        been with the kids all night but 
                        she needs adult time. 

                                 JASON
                        I’m going with you. I just have a 
                        feeling Becca’s at the hotel with 
                        someone.

           At the door, Marilyn is the last to go. 

                                 MARILYN
                        I am so, so happy my son has found 
                        someone like you. 

           Marilyn hugs Julie, a tear running down her plump cheek. 
                                 MARILYN (CONT’D)
                        Thank you for making him better. 

           FOCUS on Julie’s troubled expression. She didn’t marry Tom to 
           make him better, she married him because she loves him. 
           Marilyn hugs Tom next. 

                                 MARILYN (CONT’D)
                        You are one lucky fella. 

                                 TOM
                        I know, mom.

           Marilyn stops. She cocks her head at Tom. Her whole demeanor 
           changes: from warm and emotional to cold and reproachful. 

                                 MARILYN
                        Don’t screw this up, son. 

                                 TOM
                        Never, mom.

           Julie is taken aback. Tom puts his arm around her as Marilyn 
           boards the bus, casting worried glances back at them. 

                                 JULIE
                        What was that about?

                                 TOM
                        I think she likes you more than me. 

           Julie returns his smile, but hers is wobbly. Meg bounds into 
           the frame, Matt by her side.  

                                 MEG
                        I say, we put on our muumuus, break 
                        into the Veuve, and have ourselves 
                        a dance party in the great room. 

                                 TOM
                        Down. 

           CUT TO the kitchen. Karen is going through her checklist on 
           her clipboard, doing a head count of champagne glasses, when 
           she hears a car pull into the drive. She glances out the 
           window to see that it’s Tabitha’s Uber. She hurries out to 
           bid Tabitha goodbye. 

           EXT. THE MANSION - DRIVEWAY

           Karen runs outside just in time to overhear the Uber driver 
           speak to Tabitha through the window. 
                                 UBER DRIVER
                        Brittany?

           Karen stops cold in her tracks. 

                                 TABITHA
                        That’s me. 

           Tabitha opens the door.  

                                 KAREN
                        Brittany?

           Brittany turns at the sound of her real name. Karen is 
           stunned.

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        Then where is...

           Brittany quickly gets into the car and slams the door shut. 
           Karen runs after the car as it pulls out of the driveway, 
           knocking on the window. 

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        You have my hot spot! Hey! Hey!

           The car peels out. Karen is momentarily at a loss for what to 
           do. Then she sees the Jeep. 

           INT. THE JEEP - NIGHT

           The door is unlocked. Karen climbs into the driver’s seat. No 
           keys. No purse. She opens the glove compartment. Registration 
           papers! 

           Pull back to reveal: the killer’s eyes in the rearview 
           mirror, watching from the backseat. 

           Oblivious to the imminent danger she is in, Karen reads the 
           documents. The car is registered to Tabitha Hanover. 

                                 KAREN
                        What the heck is going—

           She breaks off at a loud thump from the back. Karen’s eyes 
           cut to the rearview mirror. The killer is gone. 

           Apprehensively, Karen climbs out of the Jeep and makes her 
           way around to the back of the car. She stares at the trunk, 
           unsure if she wants to know what’s making that sound.

           THUMP. 
           Karen jumps. She reaches for the hatch, uneasily. The trunk 
           opens slowly, beeping, each chirp fraying a new nerve.  

           Evan is inside, bloodied, bound and gagged. He’s struggling 
           to tell her something through the gag. It sounds like...

                                 EVAN
                        Eeee-hah-me. Eeee-hah-me!

                                 KAREN
                        Eeee—hah-me? Eee-hah...Behind?

           Evan’s eyes are bulging out of his head, trying to warn her. 

                                 EVAN
                        Eeee-hah-me!!!!

                                 KAREN
                        Behind me?!

           Karen spins around, spooked out of her mind. There is no one 
           behind her. Her back to Evan, she realizes something. 

                                 EVAN
                        Me! Me! Meeeee!

           Karen turns around slowly, immobilized by dread, 
           understanding too late. The backseat of the Jeep lowers flush 
           in one swift motion. The killer springs out.  

           Holding her trusty clipboard in both hands, Karen thwacks the 
           killer across the face. The killer stumbles, momentarily 
           stunned, and Karen dives under the Jeep for protection. 

           The killer recovers, dropping to the ground and swiping at 
           Karen with the axe. Karen rolls left. Right. Forward. 
           Backward. The killer can’t get leverage and grunts in 
           frustration. The blade withdraws. The attack stops. Somehow, 
           this long beat of reprieve is the most terrifying of all. 

           HISS. 

           Karen yelps at this new noise, rolling onto her side to see 
           the killer has hacked the back left tire of the Jeep. The air 
           escapes, and the cargo of the Jeep collapses in one corner, 
           nearly crushing Karen’s feet. She rolls away just in time. 

           HISS. 

           The killer punctures the back right tire. The back of the 
           Jeep collapses entirely. Karen tucks her knees into her 
           chest, making herself as small as can be. She has only the 
           front of the Jeep for cover now, and the killer is 
           approaching the front left tire. 
                                 KAREN
                        Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh.

           HISS. 

           There is but one corner of the Jeep left to protect Karen, 
           and the killer is coming for the last tire. She will be 
           crushed beneath the car if she doesn’t do something. NOW.  

           Karen scrambles out from under the Jeep and flees into the 
           woods. Branches slap her face. She stumbles in the dirt, 
           skinning her knee. She makes it to the back of the property, 
           alive. The ceremony set up has yet to be put away. She turns 
           to the back of the house and whimpers. The killer cut through 
           the house and now stands, blocking the back door. The killer 
           takes a step forward. Karen takes a step back.  

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        No. Please...

           There are rows of white Chiavari chairs between them. The 
           killer starts throwing them out of the way, advancing on 
           Karen. Karen throws them right back at the killer, but it’s 
           no use. The killer is winning, pushing Karen back, to the 
           edge of the cliff. 

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        Help—

           Inside, Cam’Ron’s Hey Ma starts to blast, drowning out the 
           rest of her shrill plea. 

           INT. THE MANSION - THE GREAT ROOM - NIGHT

           Meg put on the music. Matt has a tube of ICY HOT and he rubs 
           it over his body, gearing up to give Meg a lap dance. Meg 
           reclines in a chair, swigging a bottle of champagne. 

                                 MEG
                        Show me what you got, Magic Matt.

           EXT. THE MANSION - NIGHT

           The killer and Karen have run out of chairs to throw. Karen 
           stands at the edge, whimpering. She can see Matt and Meg 
           inside, but they have no idea she’s in a fight for her life. 

                                 KAREN
                        Please. I’m a good person. 
                        I...I...donate to the Red Cross 
                        whenever there is a hurricane. I 
                        just got a puppy! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 KAREN (CONT'D)
                        And not from a pet store even 
                        though it was so much cheaper!

           The killer swings the axe. Karen dodges it, nearly losing her 
           balance and tumbling off the edge of the cliff. She makes a 
           grab for something; anything. Time seems to slow down as she 
           looks at her hand and realizes, she’s holding the killer’s 
           mask. We do not see the killer, but we hear a voice. 

                                 KILLER
                        Shit. 

           It’s a woman’s voice. 

                                 KAREN
                             (squeaking)
                        Shit. 

           Karen pitches off the edge of the property, taking the mask 
           with her as she goes. 

           INT. THE MANSION - GROOM’S WING - TOM’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Tom and Julie are kissing, Meg’s late nineties playlist 
           penetrating the floor. Hey Ma ends, and SugarRay is next.

                                 JULIE
                        My vagina just sealed shut. 

           Downstairs, Meg hits skip. N’Sync’s Bye Bye Bye. Tom slips 
           his hands under Julie’s wedding dress. 

                                 TOM
                        She likes N’Sync though.  

           Julie tips her head back and sighs as Tom’s hand moves under 
           her dress. 

                                 JULIE
                        This is a great song. It’s 
                        scientific fact. 

           Tom starts pushing Julie closer to the bed. 

                                 TOM
                        Is that so?

           Julie is breathing harder. 

                                 JULIE
                        Higher...number of pitches...in the 
                        chorus hook...correlate....to...oh 
                        my God.
           Tom pushes her onto the bed, getting on his knees and raising 
           her dress above her hips. Julie runs her hands through his 
           hair as he goes down on her. FOCUS on her fingers tracing the 
           top of his head. It’s almost as though she’s....feeling for 
           something. Her thumb finds it—a mole on the top of his scalp. 
           She runs her finger over it, again and again. Satisfied, she 
           reclines back, instantly crying out. 

                                 TOM
                        That’s my one minute bride.

           Julie reaches behind her, searching under the covers. She 
           produces Becca’s stiletto. HOLD on the shoe, between Julie 
           and Tom’s equally shocked faces. 

                                 JULIE
                        This is Becca’s shoe. 

                                 TOM
                        Is it?

                                 JULIE
                        Yes, Tom. It is. 

                                 TOM
                        It looks like that other black 
                        strap and buckle thing you own. 

                                 JULIE
                        What is Becca’s shoe doing in your 
                        bed?

           Downstairs, a scream. 

           INT. THE MANSION - THE GREAT ROOM

           Julie and Tom rush into The Great Room. Matt has his arms 
           around Meg, consoling her. 

                                 JULIE
                        What happened? Are you okay?

           Meg glances over her shoulder at something, then looks away 
           with a shudder. Julie and Tom follow her line of sight.  

           A martini glass sits on the bar top, a bloody hand clutching 
           it. Tom spins around, unable to stand the gore. Julie 
           approaches it, her stomach stronger than the rest because of 
           her job. Meg’s blubbering plays in the background.
                                 MEG
                        I was going to make us drinks! I 
                        went behind the bar and grabbed a 
                        glass. And...and......that!

           Julie is inches from the glass now. She looks at the black 
           nail polish. The Cartier Panthére ring. She knows that hand. 
           She reaches for it, weaving her fingers through her mother’s 
           fingers, pressing her mother’s palm to her heart, not caring 
           that she’s bloodying her dress. Her back to the others, she 
           emits a silent sob for her mother, for their complicated but 
           fierce relationship. She gives herself a moment before 
           turning around. The others gasp when they see her white dress 
           covered in blood. She goes for Meg’s phone, playing music. 

                                 MATT
                        We’ve already tried. No service. Is 
                        there a landline?

           They look to Tom. 

                                 TOM
                        This way. 

           INT. THE MANSION - KAREN’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           They stare at the place on Karen’s desk where the phone was. 
           All that is left is the cut cord. Julie looks pale and in 
           shock, but suddenly, she takes stock of their foursome. 

                                 JULIE
                        Where is everyone?

           Matt and Meg furrow their brows. She’s right to ask.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        The wedding party is nine people, 
                        not including the bride and groom. 

                                 MATT
                             (counting)
                        Oliver and Jason went back to the 
                        hotel with the rest of the guests. 

                                 JULIE
                        Okay. And Sabrina? Heather? Evan? 
                        Where is Dylan? I can’t remember 
                        the last time I saw any of them. 

           Everyone looks at everyone. No one has an answer. 
                                 MEG
                        It’s your wedding. It’s normal to 
                        lose track of people. 

                                 JULIE
                        This is not normal. 

           She sets off, fearlessly. Meg follows her, a little less 
           fearless, but trying to match her friend’s courageous spirit. 
           Tom and Matt glance at each other and reluctantly follow. 

           INT. THE MANSION - UPSTAIRS - GROOM’S WING - NIGHT

           Julie starts in the groom’s suite, throwing open doors and 
           calling names. The others follow her lead, the guys more 
           tentative than the girls. 

                                 JULIE
                        Dylan?

                                 MEG
                        Evan?

           No one. 

           INT. THE MANSION - UPSTAIRS - BRIDE’S WING - NIGHT

           Everyone gasps when they open the door to Heather’s room and 
           find it soaked in blood. Matt’s eyes roll back into his head 
           and his knees buckle. Meg catches him before he falls. She 
           slaps his cheek until his eyes flutter open.

                                 MEG
                        Julie. Don’t.

           Julie takes a brave step into the room.

                                 JULIE
                        Heather?! Sabrina?!

                                 MEG
                             (whispered revelation)
                        Becca.

                                 JULIE
                        Becca is at the hospital with a 
                        sprained ankle. 

           Meg averts her eyes. 

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        No, Meg. She texted me. Remember?
           Meg sighs, guiltily. She props Matt upright and heads for her 
           room. Everyone follows, checking over their shoulders. 

           INT. THE MANSION - MEG’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Meg reaches into her clutch, producing Becca’s phone. 

                                 MEG
                        The caterer found it and gave it to 
                        us earlier this morning. It was 
                        right by the front door. 

                                 JULIE
                        You lied to me?

                                 MEG
                        I...I just thought Becca hooked up 
                        with someone and went to the hotel 
                        so Jason wouldn’t find out. I 
                        didn’t want to stress you out any 
                        more than you already were.

           Tom looks stung. 

                                 TOM
                        Than you already were?

           Julie meets his eye, boldly. 

                                 JULIE
                        Yes, Tom. Weddings are stressful 
                        and very expensive. 

           She doesn’t say anything more. She doesn’t need to. 

                                 TOM
                        Are you ever going to stop rubbing 
                        it in my face that you make more 
                        money than me?

                                 JULIE
                        I don’t know. Are you ever going to 
                        admit that you’re not too special 
                        for a regular job? 

           Meg gasps. Matt grimaces. Julie takes a shaky breath, 
           instantly remorseful she took it that far. 

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        That was...I don’t think that.  

                                 TOM
                        Now you’re a liar too. 
           Tom starts to walk out. 

                                 MATT
                        Where are you going, man?

           Tom calls out from the hallway. 

                                 TOM O.C.
                        Sometimes there’s reception by the 
                        windows in the sunroom. 

           Matt starts after him. Meg grabs his arm. 

                                 MATT
                        I can’t let him go alone. 

           Meg swallows. But she nods. Meg and Julie are left alone. 
           Julie covers her face and starts to cry. 

                                 MEG
                        Jules. Hey. It’s okay. I’ve said 
                        way worse things to Matt.

           Meg hugs her. 

                                 JULIE
                        On your wedding day though?

                                 MEG
                        I don’t remember eighteen ninety-
                        eight very well. 

           They both laugh, despite everything. Meg releases Julie. 
           Julie takes a shaky breath, her eyes filling with tears.

                                 JULIE
                        My mom is dead. 

                                 MEG
                        No, Jules. We don’t know—

                                 JULIE
                             (stoic)
                        And I found something. In Tom’s 
                        room. 

           Meg waits. 

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        It was Becca’s shoe. 

           Julie holds Meg’s eye. 
                                 MEG
                        Oh. I’m sure it just ended up there 
                        as a mistake. Housecleaning or 
                        something—

                                 JULIE
                        It was in his sheets. 

           Silence. Meg can’t really argue with that. 

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        You knew Becca wasn’t in the 
                        hospital with a sprained ankle. You 
                        thought she was with someone.
                             (apprehensive beat)
                        Who?

                                 MEG
                        Julie, I—

                                 JULIE
                        I just held my mother’s severed 
                        hand in my own. What could be 
                        worse?

           Meg sighs.

                                 MEG
                        I saw them kissing last night. But 
                        I thought it was Dylan! 

           Julie covers her face. 

                                 JULIE
                        Oh my God. 

                                 MEG
                        I didn’t tell anyone because I 
                        thought if Jason found out he’d 
                        flip out. It never even occurred to 
                        me it might have been Tom. You were 
                        with Tom. 

                                 JULIE
                        Was I though?

           Meg’s eyes widen. 

                                 MEG
                        You actually think—
                                 JULIE
                        There were times today. Where I 
                        wasn’t sure if I was with Tom or 
                        Dylan. 

                                 MEG
                        You can’t tell them apart? 

                                 JULIE
                        Tom has a mole. On the top of his 
                        head. That’s the only way. 

                                 MEG
                        Jesus. It’s like the homicidal 
                        sequel to The Parent Trap. Jules. 
                        We have to get out of—

                                 MATT AND TOM O.C.
                        Julie! Help!

           INT. THE MANSION - SUNROOM - NIGHT

           Meg and Julie enter the sunroom to find Matt and Tom removing 
           binds and a gag from Evan. He’s covered in blood. 

                                 TOM
                        We found him in here like this!

           Evan’s body is limp. Julie rushes to him and feels for a 
           pulse. Everyone waits, tensely. 

                                 JULIE
                        He’s alive. 

           She starts checking his body, looking for wounds.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        This isn’t...this isn’t his blood. 
                        There are no—

           Evan’s eyes fly open. His scream is bone-chilling. 

           FEW MINUTES LATER. They’ve gotten Evan into a chair and given 
           him a glass of water. He’s trembling, recounting his story. 

                                 EVAN
                        An axe. He had an axe. She was 
                        pregnant with my son!

           Evan moans. Matt, Tom, Meg, and Julie are some combination of 
           petrified and repulsed and devastated. 
                                 JULIE
                        We need to get out of here. Now. 

                                 TOM
                        How? You heard Evan. The only car 
                        on the property was destroyed. None 
                        of our phones work. It’s twenty 
                        miles to the nearest place that 
                        will have a landline and that’s the 
                        general store and it’s definitely 
                        closed. 

                                 JULIE
                        Then we’ll break a window!

                                 TOM
                        No. No way. It’s too dangerous. 
                        Twenty miles on foot? This guy 
                        could come for us, at any point. 
                        We’re better off sticking together, 
                        in this room, and waiting it out 
                        until everyone comes back for the 
                        farewell brunch. 

                                 MEG
                        That’s eleven hours from now!

                                 JULIE
                        What about that guy? The caretaker? 
                        Doesn’t he live on the property? He 
                        must have a phone. Or a car. 

                                 TOM
                        Eddie.

                                 JULIE
                        Eddie!

                                 TOM
                        Eddie’s a woman. 

                                 JULIE
                        Eddie’s a woman?

           Tom nods. 

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        Okay. So. What does it matter? She 
                        must have a phone or a car. 

           Tom chews his lip. 

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        What?
           Tom won’t answer.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        That was my mother’s hand back 
                        there. You know that, right? 
                        Whatever you are hiding from me, 
                        it’s the reason she’s dead.

                                 TOM
                        I don’t trust Eddie to help us.

           Matt looks away. Meg and Julie notice. Julie turns to Evan.

                                 JULIE
                        Evan. Are you sure the person who 
                        attacked Heather was a man?

                                 EVAN
                        It had to be a man. 

                                 JULIE
                        Did you see his face? Hear his 
                        voice?

                                 EVAN
                        A woman wouldn’t kill a pregnant 
                        woman!

           Julie is breathing, heavily. It’s Eddie. It has to be. Julie 
           turns to Tom. 

                                 JULIE
                        What reason would Eddie have to 
                        hurt the people we love, Tom?

                                 TOM
                        She’s not right in the head, Jules. 
                        Not after...

                                 MEG
                        Not after what?

           Tom looks pained. Meg addresses her husband. 

                                 MEG (CONT’D)
                        Stop protecting him, Matt. 

                                 MATT
                             (to Tom, pleadingly)
                        Dude. Don’t make me be the one... 

           Tom refuses to crack. Matt sighs. 
                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        He dated Eddie right after college.

           Tom squeezes his eyes shut, mortified. 

                                 JULIE
                        Tom did?

                                 MATT
                        They both did. 

           Everyone turns to Tom when he sobs, so ashamed of himself. 

                                 TOM
                        We were kids. 

                                 JULIE
                        What did you do to her?

           Meg comes to Julie’s side, rubbing her back as Tom confesses.

                                 TOM
                        Dylan and I...we switched places 
                        with her. Sometimes. When she found 
                        out...she tried to hang herself in 
                        the woods. She tore a tendon in her 
                        neck and burst an optic nerve, and 
                        she’s never fully recovered the 
                        sight in her left eye. 

                                 JULIE
                        What is wrong with you?

           Tom hangs his head. 

                                 TOM
                        My mom tried really hard to keep 
                        the story out of the press. My dad 
                        even convinced her to cut Eddie 
                        into the deed of the house as a 
                        sort of mea culpa—

                                 JULIE
                        Or to buy her silence. 

                                 TOM
                        Word spread around town. Business 
                        never recovered. 

                                 JULIE
                        Now I understand why no one wants 
                        to get married here anymore. 
                                 MEG
                        How much does Eddie get if the 
                        house sells?

                                 TOM
                        Ten percent.

                                 MEG
                        Some people would kill for ten 
                        percent on ten million. 

           Tom looks at Meg. How does she know how much the developers 
           offered them?

                                 JULIE
                        Yeah, Tom. I told Meg how much you 
                        turned down because you had my 
                        money as a cushion. 

                                 TOM
                        Well, you can relax Jules because 
                        we have to no choice but to accept 
                        their offer now. No way anyone will 
                        ever get married here again after 
                        our wedding ended in a bloodbath.  

           Everyone seems to realize something at the same time. 

                                 MEG
                        What if this isn’t about Eddie 
                        getting back at you though? What if 
                        it’s about the money? What if Dylan 
                        cooked this up with her? He has 
                        been gunning to sell but he 
                        couldn’t get you on board. 

           Julie catches on, her eyes alighting. 

                                 MATT
                        Stuff like this is always about the 
                        money. And where the fuck is Dylan?

                                 TOM
                        Dylan doesn’t need money, though. 
                        It’s my dad who...

           Tom realizes he’s about to implicate his father and stops.

                                 MATT
                        It’s your dad who what? I thought 
                        the house was on your mother’s 
                        side? What does he stand to gain?
                                 JULIE
                        If she sells, Chuck doesn’t have to 
                        pay alimony anymore. 

           Everyone is quiet a moment, turning this over. 

                                 MEG
                        I think Tom is right. We have a 
                        better shot at making it through 
                        the night if we all stick together 
                        in this room. We’re vulnerable out 
                        in the open. 

           She looks to Matt for backup. He shrugs.  

                                 MATT
                        Happy wife. Happy life. 

           Evan sobs into his hands. 

           AN HOUR LATER. Everyone sits, huddled, knees to their chest, 
           trying to stay warm. It’s drafty in the sunroom, with the 
           floor to ceiling windows. Meg starts a fire. Julie looks at 
           Tom, dozing. She wanders over to Meg and helps her. After all 
           this, she’s still in her wedding dress.  

           Meg looks up at her. She’s been sobbing, silently, and Julie 
           had no idea. 

                                 JULIE
                        Oh, Meg. We have to have hope. They 
                        could still be alive.   

           Julie drops to her knees and embraces her. 

                                 MEG
                        I can’t even think about our 
                        friends. I feel horrible but I 
                        can’t. I’m so scared for my kids! 
                        What if something happens to Matt 
                        or me or both of us! 

           Julie holds Meg while she cries in her arms. 

                                 JULIE
                        Your kids are not going to be 
                        orphaned, Meg. I will never let 
                        that happen. I promise.  

           They both stare into the fire. They see it at the same time: 
           the CVS uniform. Julie squints, reading the badge: Brittany. 

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        What is—
                                 MATT
                        Look!

           Matt is standing by the window, pointing, as the headlights 
           of a car appear in the woods. Everyone watches it near: a 
           white service van. The hope on their faces fades fast as the 
           van plows up the incline, mows down the ceremony set up in 
           the backyard, and barrels straight for the windows in the 
           sunroom. Tom grabs Julie and drags her away. 

                                 TOM
                        Run!

           Everyone runs away from the window, screaming, as the 
           bartender’s white van crashes through the sunroom windows.  

           Everything goes black for a while.

           Flashes of fire. The sound of people moaning. Someone crying 
           and repeating a name. Julie’s eyes flutter open. 

                                 VOICE
                        Tom. Oh my God. Tom. Tom! Wake up, 
                        Tom. Please!

           The van demolished the wall of the sunroom. Julie is lying on 
           her back in the Great Room. Flames lick the van. With effort, 
           Julie sits up and looks around. Matt and Evan are passed out 
           on the ground next to her. There is no sign of Meg. 

                                 VOICE (CONT’D)
                        Tom. Tom!

           Julie tries to focus. The room is filling with smoke, making 
           it hard to see. Who is calling out Tom’s name, and why? She 
           climbs to her feet, stumbling toward the voice. She comes 
           upon Tom, trying to free Dylan from behind the wheel of the 
           van. She can’t make sense of what is happening—if Tom is 
           trying to free Dylan, why is Tom calling Dylan Tom? 

                                 JULIE
                        Dylan.

           Tom turns. He’s not Tom. He’s Dylan. 

                                 DYLAN
                        Help me, Jules. He’s stuck. Someone 
                        duct taped his hands!

           Dazed, Julie goes to help. Tom is slumped over in the 
           driver’s seat, one hand duct taped to the wheel. To her 
           horror, she sees his other hand wrapped around the handle of 
           a bloody axe in passenger seat. She runs her fingers through 
           his hair. No mole. She is gobsmacked by a sudden realization.
                                 JULIE
                        Dylan. Oh my God. How long? How 
                        long have you been pretending to be 
                        Tom?

           Dylan is distraught, trying to free his brother. 

                                 DYLAN
                        Please. Just help me and I’ll tell 
                        you everything!

           Together, they free Tom and drag him away from the flames. 
           Julie checks his pulse. Tom coughs, coming to. 

                                 DYLAN (CONT’D)
                        Tom! What happened? Who is doing 
                        this? 

                                 TOM
                        I went to the room. For her shoe. I 
                        don’t remember...

           He rubs the back of his head. Julie’s patience runs out.   

                                 JULIE
                        One of you sick fucks tell me what 
                        the fuck is going on!

           Dylan appeals to Julie, tears running down his face. 

                                 DYLAN
                        I messed up. On our first date. And 
                        I was so mad at myself because I 
                        liked you so much and I never like 
                        women. So when you approached me on 
                        the subway, I pretended to be Tom. 
                        I would have done anything for a 
                        fresh start with you.

           FLASHBACK. Julie on the subway. Approaching Dylan. FOCUS on 
           the Starbucks cup between his knees. Written on the side is 
           the name Dylan. FOCUS on Dylan, smiling at Julie, passing 
           himself off as Tom.  

                                 DYLAN (CONT’D)
                        I take it you’ve met my twin 
                        brother. My name is Tom. I’m the 
                        not asshole one.

           PRESENT. Julie takes one small, cautious step back.

                                 JULIE
                        Oh my God. The whole time? It was 
                        never Tom? It was always you?
                                 DYLAN
                        I was sick of my job. Sick of the 
                        hours. The pressure. And Tom was 
                        sick of the failure. I told him 
                        what I did, how I pretended to be 
                        him, and, well, it’s crazy. I don’t 
                        even know whose idea it was, but 
                        we—

                                 JULIE
                        You switched lives.

           Dylan nods. Julie takes another step back, toward the van, 
           tears running down her face, utterly betrayed. 

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        You switched back today, didn’t 
                        you? Because Marilyn would have 
                        noticed. 

                                 DYLAN
                        And then Tom went missing at the 
                        end of the night. I didn’t know 
                        where he was. So I stepped back in. 
                        That’s why my mom...

           FLASHBACK. Marilyn’s judgmental face right before she got on 
           the bus to go back to the hotel. 

                                 JULIE
                             (to Tom)
                        Did you sleep with Becca?

                                 TOM
                        Yes, but. It was never me you were 
                        in love with... 

           Julie takes another step back. Dylan advances on her. 

                                 DYLAN
                        Julie. Please. Wait. I did it 
                        because I loved you. And I got in 
                        too deep, and I didn’t know how to 
                        tell you without scaring you—

                                 JULIE
                        You’re scaring me now!

           Julie grabs the axe out of the van and swings it at him. He 
           jumps back, allowing her to flee into the smoke.

                                 DYLAN
                        Julie!
           Julie runs into the reception hall, looking for another exit. 

           INT. THE MANSION - RECEPTION HALL - NIGHT

           Julie bursts inside, gripping the axe. There are people 
           sitting at one of the tables! Julie runs toward them, 
           desperate. 

                                 JULIE
                        Help me! Help!

           She slows down as she closes in, turning green. These 
           people...they’re dead. The Sheriff. The bartender. Becca in 
           her rehearsal dinner dress, her single stiletto stabbed 
           through her forehead, concealing her face. 

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        Becca? Oh my God. Becca. 

           Julie notices a place card has been set in front of her, Miss 
           Tabitha Hanover written in neat calligraphy. Her head spins 
           as she reads it. There is only one way to make sense of it. 

           Julie raises the axe, hacking off the shoe at its heel. Only 
           the spike remains in the woman’s forehead, revealing her face 
           in its entirety. She is not Becca. She is Tabitha Hanover. 

           There is an ominous tap on Julie’s shoulder. She spins 
           around, axe raised, ready to strike. 

                                 MATT
                        It’s me! 

           Julie sobs, lowering the axe. Matt reaches for it. No! Julie! 
           Don’t give it away! But she’s so crippled with fear that she 
           doesn’t think as Matt removes the weapon from her hands.  

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        We have to get out of here, Jules. 
                        We have to find Meg. 

           EXT. THE MANSION - NIGHT

           Matt and Julie emerge from the reception hall door. Evan, 
           Dylan, and Tom are standing in the driveway, watching the 
           mansion burn. They all turn at the sound of Meg’s scream from 
           deep within the woods. 

                                 MATT
                        Meg! 
           Matt takes off. Dylan runs toward Julie. Julie looks into the 
           woods, in the direction Matt went, then looks at Dylan, 
           coming for her. She chooses the woods. 

                                 DYLAN
                        Julie, no!

           Dylan chases after Julie. Tom and Evan chase after him.

           FOCUS on Julie as she hears Matt’s shrill scream. She follows 
           it, coming upon him holding a piece of Meg’s bloody t-shirt 
           in one hand, axe in the other. 

                                 MATT
                        Meg! Meg?! Hold on! 

           Dylan and the rest of the guys catch up. 

                                 DYLAN
                        Matt. Please. Just wait here. The 
                        fire department will be here soon. 

           Julie looks around—why doesn’t she hear sirens yet?

                                 JULIE
                        Where are they? Shouldn’t they be 
                        here by now?

                                 DYLAN
                        We’re so far out. It might take 
                        them a little while to even realize 
                        there is a fire.  

                                 JULIE
                        What a boon this is for you, Dylan. 
                        Fire insurance pay out on top of 
                        the developer’s offer.

                                 DYLAN
                        I didn’t plan this! Meg filled your 
                        head with her crazy shit. 

           Matt grabs Dylan by the lapels, threatening him with the axe. 

                                 MATT
                        If you so much as speak Meg’s name 
                        again I’ll chop your tongue off. 

                                 EVAN
                             (sobbing)
                        She’s dead, bro. Just like Heather. 
                        The girls are all dead. 

           Matt releases Dylan and turns toward Julie, menacingly. 
                                 MATT
                        Julie’s still here. Riddle me that.

           Julie eyes the axe is Matt’s hands, visibly nervous now. 

                                 JULIE
                        Are you accusing me of—

                                 MATT
                        Maybe you were in this for the 
                        money too. Start married life with 
                        a nice little nest egg. 

                                 JULIE
                        Maybe you killed them. 

                                 MATT
                        Why would I kill Meg? I would be 
                        lost as fuck without her!

                                 JULIE
                        It’s always the husband. 

           Matt steps in front of her, threateningly. In the reflection 
           of the axe’s blade, Julie sees the other guys behind her, 
           surrounding her. Her blood runs cold. She is alone in the 
           woods with four angry men, and one of them is holding an axe. 

                                 MATT 
                        You’ve got one of those now. So if 
                        I were you, Jules? I’d fucking run.

           Julie takes off, as fast as she can go. 

           She crashes through the woods. Branches slash her cheeks, her 
           neck, her hands. Her wedding dress is shredded, covered in 
           blood and soot and dirt. Behind her Dylan howls her name. 

                                 DYLAN O.C.
                        Jul-ieeee! Jules! Jul-ieee!

           Julie is petrified. She runs faster. She stumbles into a 
           clearing. There is a cottage before her. The shades are 
           drawn. The house is dark. It must be Eddie’s house. 

                                 DYLAN O.C. (CONT’D)
                        Jul-ieeee!

           Julie doesn’t hesitate. She runs for the house. 

           The door is locked. Julie tries a window, then another. Both 
           locked too. She’s about to throw a rock through the glass 
           when the front door opens. Eddie is standing there, a rifle 
           in her hand. Julie gasps. 
                                 EDDIE
                             (whisper)
                        Inside. Quick. 

                                 DYLAN O.C.
                        Jul-ieeee!

           Julie runs inside. 

           INT. EDDIE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The lights are off. The shades are drawn. Julie picks up the 
           phone—no dial tone. 

                                 EDDIE
                        Phone line’s been cut. Only thing 
                        we can do is hunker down ‘til 
                        someone reports the fire. 

           Julie sits down at the small table in the kitchen across from 
           Eddie. She’s incredibly uneasy in this dark house, with this 
           troubled woman Tom and Dylan once nearly drove to suicide. 

                                 JULIE
                        They did it to me too. 

           Eddie’s expression reveals nothing. 

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t even know who I married. 

                                 EDDIE
                        You married Tom, but you’re in love 
                        with Dylan. 
                             (sinister smile)
                        Same.   

           Julie goes white. Beneath the table, we see Julie slip her 
           hand into the pocket of her wedding dress.  

           Julie hears a sneeze, below her. Sabrina’s sneeze. She looks 
           at the door to the basement. She looks at Eddie. Eddie looks 
           at her. It’s on. 

           Julie slugs Eddie across the face, wearing her mother’s 
           Cartier ring that she tucked into the pocket of her dress, a 
           thirty thousand dollar brass knuckle. Eddie goes down. The 
           rifle skids across the laminated kitchen floors. Julie grabs 
           it and head butts Eddie: Once, twice, three times to be sure. 

           She opens the door to the basement and takes a deep breath. 
           INT. EDDIE’S HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Julie gets the shock of her life when she descends the stairs 
           to find Meg, Becca, Heather, and Sabrina clutching each 
           other, shaking and terrified. 

                                 MEG
                        Julie!

           Meg opens her arms. Julie runs to her, letting the rifle 
           drop. She hugs Meg hard, sobbing into her shoulder. 

                                 JULIE
                        I thought you were dead! 

           Over Julie’s shoulder, Meg’s eyes fill with tears too.  

           The sound of a rifle, reloading, causes Julie to release Meg 
           and step away from her. Becca is holding the rifle, pointing 
           it at Julie. Meg wipes away her tears. 

                                 MEG
                        Damnit, Julie. What did I tell you 
                        about worrying about everyone but 
                        yourself?

           Julie reassesses the room. Her friends are wounded and 
           bleeding. Sabrina appears to be missing some fingers. But 
           Heather’s condition is the most shocking: her stomach is 
           flat. All four women wear cold, unrecognizable expressions. 

                                 JULIE
                        What is this?

           The women exchange wry smiles. 

                                 BECCA
                        Call it a prison break. 

                                 SABRINA
                        I don’t know what you were thinking 
                        today. Have you not noticed how 
                        fucking miserable we all are?

                                 JULIE
                        You’re not...you’re not miserable—

                                 SABRINA
                        I’ve had a cold for three years. 
                                 HEATHER
                        Before I became permanently 
                        barefoot and pregnant, I worked 
                        twice as hard as Evan to make half 
                        as much. 

                                 MEG
                        I work twice as hard as Matt to 
                        make twice as much and that’s just 
                        the first shift. 

                                 BECCA
                        I gave my husband sons and also, 
                        erectile dysfunction! 
                             (wink at Julie)
                        New hubby dusted off those cobwebs.

                                 SABRINA
                        No, Becca, remember? You slept with 
                        Tom who was posing as Dylan who is 
                        the one Julie is really in love 
                        with. 

                                 BECCA
                        Geez, I take one time out to go on 
                        a ten hour killing spree and it 
                        turns into a fucking telenovela. 

           Julie brings her fingers to her temples, working it out. 

                                 JULIE
                        Becca. You killed my mother? 

                                 SABRINA
                        Actually, I did. Gave Becs a little 
                        break. She had been at it since 6am 
                        this morning, starting with that 
                        New York Times reporter. 

           FLASHBACK. We see what really happened in the downstairs 
           bathroom earlier this morning. Becca opened the door, to find 
           the real Tabitha Hanover pulling up her pants. Becca attacked 
           her with her stiletto, then switched out their clothes. 

           PRESENT. Sabrina rolls her eyes. 

                                 SABRINA (CONT’D)
                        That wasn’t part of the plan. So 
                        then Heather and I had to find 
                        someone in this one-horse town to 
                        play a member of the media elite.  
           FLASHBACK. CVS. Sabrina and Heather are talking to the 
           cashier, wearing a CVS apron, sporting the name tag, 
           Brittany. They slide a wad of cash across the table. 

                                 SABRINA (CONT’D)
                        She wasn’t too bright. But she did 
                        in a pinch. 

                                 JULIE
                        Heather. You were pregnant. 

                                 HEATHER
                        Up until my scheduled c-section 
                        last week, yes. 

                                 JULIE
                        Where is the baby?

                                 HEATHER
                        With his mother. Annabelle. 

           FLASHBACK to Annabelle showing Julie a picture of her new 
           adopted baby. Back in the present, Julie’s knees buckle. 

                                 SABRINA
                        We figured it would look suspicious 
                        if all the cops found of your 
                        bridesmaids were a few fingers and 
                        some blood splatter. We needed a 
                        witness. 

           FLASHBACK. Sabrina’s room at The Mansion. She’s holding her 
           hand out for Becca, grimacing. Becca looks apologetic as she 
           brings the axe down, spraying the window with blood.

                                 HEATHER
                        It wasn’t easy, hiding a silicone 
                        bump pad from Evan this week—

                                 MEG
                        Or appetizing, filling it with your 
                        actual placenta. 

                                 HEATHER
                        Thank you, Kourtney Kardashian, for 
                        normalizing the request to pocket 
                        that shit like hotel lotion. 

                                 BECCA
                        Gross but all for the cause. 

                                 JULIE
                        What cause?
                                 HEATHER
                        God, you make it sound so 
                        political. Think of it more as a...

                                 MEG
                        Lifestyle change. 

                                 SABRINA
                        We were preached the gospel of 
                        having it all. 

                                 MEG
                        An easier sell than hearing you can 
                        bring home the bacon, girls, but 
                        you will still be expected to 
                        remember when you are out milk, to 
                        fill out the sign up sheets and 
                        permission slips, to keep the 
                        calendar, to schedule the kids’ 
                        checkups and nag your husband to 
                        help and then praise him when he 
                        does even though, helping is not 
                        the same thing as sharing the work—

                                 SABRINA
                        You will never get through a meal 
                        uninterrupted which is fine, 
                        because you will still be expected 
                        to keep it tight even though you 
                        don’t even have thirty seconds to 
                        hold a plank.

                                 HEATHER
                        And if you fail to overcome 
                        systemic pay parity, guess you’re 
                        not a strong woman.  

                                 BECCA
                        I am so fucking tired of being a 
                        strong woman!

           Becca shoots the ceiling for emphasis, her eyes wild. Julie 
           cowers, but the others don’t even flinch. 

                                 MEG
                        Why do we have to be strong? While 
                        the dad bods we married are dicking 
                        around on the golf course and 
                        increasing their life expectancies.   

                                 SABRINA
                        There’s like, research, to back us 
                        up.
                                 JULIE
                             (shakily)
                        Some studies show married men are 
                        happier and healthier than married 
                        women, yes.

                                 BECCA
                             (turning the gun on Julie)
                        And what do some studies show about 
                        single women, Dr. Julie Wheeler?

                                 JULIE
                             (beat)
                        They fare better than married 
                        women. 

                                 HEATHER
                        And yet we are still made to feel 
                        like pathetic old maids if we fail 
                        to enter into an institution that’s 
                        about as good for us as smoking. I 
                        wonder, why might that be?  

                                 MEG
                        Because wives are kale for men.

                        Ding. Ding. Ding. Hetero marriage 
                        is one big fucking scam on women.

                                 JULIE
                        Your kids, though.

                                 SABRINA
                        Oh, our kids light up the room! 
                        It’s just...

                        me I am fond of that choade I

                        them dead. I just want them to 
                        think I’m dead.

                        on a random Tuesday. You, the last 
                        of our friends duped by Big

                        same place for the foreseeable 
                        future. I pushed for this day, even 
                        though it made my skin scrawl 
                        watching you subjugate yourself to

           Julie presses her lips together. They have her there.

                        That’s how freaked out they get you 
                        about being thirty-four and alone. 
                        I would fucking kill to be alone,

                        Chuck and Dylan take the fall. Tom

                        We thought we kidnapped Dylan and 
                        stole his phone, but that guy 
                        turned out to be his evil fucking 
                        twin.

           Becca is shot dead. She is spun around and accidentally 
           discharges the weapon, killing Sabrina. The rifle clatters to 
           the floor. Heather lunges for it, slips in her friends’ blood 
           and cracks her head open on the cold cement.

           Meg raises her hands in the air, surrendering. The killer is 
           standing behind Julie on the stairs, wearing the white mask, 
           holding one of the rifles mounted on Eddie’s gallery wall. 

           The killer removes the mask. It’s Karen.

                        asshole to you. 

           Karen hands Julie the gun. 

                                 KAREN
                        As much as I’d love to do the 
                        honors, Meg, it is Julie’s special 
                        day. 

           Julie aims the gun at Meg. Meg starts to cry. 

                                 MEG
                        Jules, wait.

                        guaranteed a private room with Dr. 
                        Oberlin. 

           Julie cocks the hammer.

                        And...and....you can have coffee. 
                        Don’t let anyone scare you off 
                        that. You cure cancer for a living 
                        and you aren’t selfish for needing 
                        a fucking cup of coffee. 

           Julie shuts one eye. 

                                 MEG (CONT’D)
                        If you hate breastfeeding, stop.

           Julie’s finger hovers on the trigger. Meg sobs.

                        Thanks, Meg.

                        I do, Meg. 

           Julie pulls the trigger. Meg slams against the wall and 
           slumps to the ground, super dead.  

           Behind her, on the stairs, Karen brings her hand to her 
           breast, moved to tears by their final goodbye. 

                                 KAREN
                        Oh. Em. Gee. 

           EXT. EDDIE’S HOUSE - DAWN 

           Karen and Julie find the road. They follow it, wordlessly, in 
           shock, for a long stretch. In the distance, an ambulance 
           appears, followed by two police cars. Julie and Karen cry out 
           with relief, waving their arms, jumping up and down. 

           The cavalcade stops. An EMT opens the back doors of the 
           ambulance. Julie gasps when she sees Dr. Wheeler, 
           micromanaging an EMT as he wraps her wrist in a tourniquet.    

                                 Dr. WHEELER
                        Pull the tail tighter. 

           The EMT officer pulls. 

                                 DR. WHEELER (CONT’D)
                        Tighter! Did you dig your medical 
                        license out of a dumpster?  

           Julie’s voice is strangled with emotion. 

                                 JULIE
                        Mom!

                                 DR. WHEELER
                        Oh, Julie! 

           Dr. Wheeler and Julie embrace. Dr. Wheeler cups her 
           daughter’s chin tenderly, her thumb stroking a gash on 
           Julie’s cheek. 

                                 DR. WHEELER (CONT’D)
                        Dr. State School here isn’t to 
                        touch your face. You’ll see my 
                        plastic surgeon in the city. 

           The police officers crowd around Karen and Julie. 
                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Can you describe the man who did 
                        this to you?

           Karen and Julie exchange a subtle glance. A silent pact is 
           made. They answer in unison.

                                 KAREN
                        Tom Cunningham.

                        Dylan Cunningham. 

           THE END.
