           The first thing we hear is low, heavy breathing. Panic, 
           barely suppressed. 

           A CHYRON OVER BLACK READS: Afghanistan - 2017

           And we FADE IN on --

           MEL HARRIS (early 30s, in full US Navy combat gear). She 
           moves forward slowly, holding a rifle in front of her. We 
           pull back and realize that we’re in -- 

           A BULLET RIDDLED HOUSE. Blood spattered on the walls. Bullet 
           shells clink as Mel walks over them, and past --

           CONNOR BRADLEY (30s, upright, authoritative). As she moves 
           beyond him, he radios --

                        vehicle for exfil --

           She seems to ease at the confidence in his voice. But it only 
           lasts for a moment. Palpable fear begins to creep back in as 
           she moves into a small sitting room. 

           She crosses the room, stepping over a bloodied CORPSE, and 
           arriving at the window. Crouching low, she peeks out through 
           the broken glass, rifle first. 

           It looks onto a stretch of deserted street. No movement.

                                 CONNOR (OVER COMMS)
                             (quiet)
                        Incoming...

           A long moment of nothing but silence. Mel watches, waiting. 
           Tension building. Suddenly --

           POP POP POP POP POP --

           The rapid spray of an AK erupts from down the block. Bullets 
           blow SHARDS of glass from the window into Mel’s face -- 

           The shards CUT her, but mercifully the bullets miss wide 
           left. 

           Mel ducks as another clip smashes through the stucco walls 
           where her head was a second before, showering her with dust. 

           We see her face. She’s shaken -- 

           But Mel’s a fighter. She scrambles back to her feet and 
           swings her rifle out the window, tracking an ISIS soldier who 
           dashes across the street --
           POP POP. 

           Mel sends a bullet through the soldier’s neck. He drops.

           Mel blinks. Wipes dust from her face. Realizes -- 

           Her hand is TREMBLING. 

           Sounds of a fight rage all around. Mel covers her small 
           vantage point, but no new attack comes towards her.  

           Her eyes linger on the man she shot. Lifeless eyes opened 
           towards the sky. Unmoving. 

           The sounds of the fight die down. Eventually they fade to 
           nothing. Mel takes a moment to steady herself. Slowly backs 
           away from the window. Stands up. Brushes off, when --

           CLINK, CLINK. The world goes silent for a second.

                                 CONNOR (O.S.)
                        Fuck --

           BOOM! Mel instinctively ducks, as the whole house SHAKES. 

           A grenade explosion.

           Mel stumbles back. She looks around for the source, 
           terrified. She hears footsteps dashing through the house --

           Then gunshots -- 

           POP POP --

           Then --

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Man down! 

           Mel takes off towards the sound of the voice as we CUT TO 
           BLACK. 

           The blackness is all encompassing. It stays that way for a 
           beat, silent and dark. 

           Then we hear a rhythmic pounding -- 

           THUMP THUMP. Beat. THUMP THUMP. Beat. THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP 
           THUMP THUMP --

           And it continues as we open on our title card --

           INT. BOXING GYM - DAY

           CHYRON: Three Years Later

           Mel (mid 30s now, hasn’t had a good night’s sleep in years, a 
           shadow of her former self) relentlessly laying into a speed 
           bag with a sort of deep fury --  

           THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP...

           She’s in an old-school boxing gym, ornamented with concrete 
           and brown leather. 

           As Mel hits, we see a YOUNG WOMAN (late 20s, similarly 
           fierce) work a bag of her own nearby. Mel clocks the woman. 

           After unleashing a powerful THUMP, Mel leaves her speedbag 
           behind, letting it spin out. She approaches the young woman. 

           But before Mel gets there, she’s intercepted by BRYANT MOSES 
           (30s, ex-Navy SEAL, the kind of guy you want on your side).

                                 BRYANT
                        Don’t do it. 

                                 MEL
                             (playing dumb)
                        Do what?

                                 BRYANT
                        I own the gym, Mel. I can keep you 
                        out --

                                 MEL
                        Yeah, but you won’t. 

           Mel breezes past Bryant. She reaches the Young Woman.

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                        Kim, right?

           Kim gives her a once-over. 

                                 KIM
                        Do I know you?

                                 MEL
                        Probably not. But I noticed -- 
                        you’ve been coming here for a few 
                        weeks. Barely breaking a sweat.
                             (nodding at Kim’s punching 
                              bag)
                        You should try something that can 
                        actually hit back. 
           Kim scowls. Mel walks towards the boxing ring. 

           In the background Bryant folds his hands behind his head, as 
           Kim follows Mel.

           INT. RING - BOXING GYM - MOMENTS LATER

           THUMP. THUMP THUMP.

           Mel is ripping into Kim. Bryant hangs off the side of the 
           ring. Mel’s skill and speed far exceed Kim’s. It’s not a fair 
           fight.

           As they retreat for a short water break in the corners, we 
           see: Kim’s angry now. 

           Bryant watches as Mel gets water. For some reason, he looks 
           worried. 

           Round two.

           As the second round begins, something changes in Mel. Whereas 
           in round one she was fast, purposeful, in control -- now, she 
           backs off. Slows down. Stays on her heels. Retreats. 

           Her guard sags. Her hands drop. Kim attacks. Now, Mel’s 
           getting her ass kicked. 

                                 BRYANT
                             (yells)
                        Keep your goddam gloves up. 

           As Kim presses her attacking advantage, Mel holds back. Kim 
           maneuvers Mel to the ropes. 

           She rains blows down on Mel, who just keeps taking them. 
           Gritting through the assault. It’s hard to watch. 

           Bryant turns away from the ring. He’s seen enough. 

           Off Mel grimacing, we cut to --

           INT. LOCKER AREA - BOXING GYM - LATER

           The aftermath. Mel’s slumped over on a bench. Unwrapping her 
           hands. Bryant sits next to her. Staring. Judgmental. 

           Kim swaggers by. 

                                 KIM
                        Seemed like you’d be better than 
                        that. All that talk...
           Mel doesn’t look up. She just keeps unwrapping. Kim walks 
           away. 

                                 BRYANT
                        Are you coming tonight?

           Mel throws him a look -- do you even have to ask? 

                                 BRYANT (CONT'D)
                        Just checking.

                                 MEL
                        I’ll be there. 

           Bryant stands, looks like he’s got more to say, but --

           A little ball of energy barrels into his leg in the form of 
           his 4-year old daughter, DEE. He scoops her up. 

                                 BRYANT
                        Well what do we have HERE!? 

                                 DEE
                        I sneak attacked you!

           She giggles excitedly, throws her arms around his neck. She 
           looks at Mel. Mel gives her a little wave. 

           Dee waves back at Mel as Bryant’s wife, PARISA (late 30s), 
           comes up to them. She gives Bryant a kiss. Hugs Mel, who 
           winces slightly from her bruises. 

                                 PARISA
                             (to Bryant)
                        Ready? She made me buy a pint of 
                        ice cream. It’s melting in the car. 

                                 DEE
                        Chocolate chip cookie dough! Like 
                        we had on the way home from 
                        camping! 

                                 BRYANT
                             (whisper)
                        Great work, Deedee. 

           He turns to Mel --

                                 BRYANT (CONT'D)
                        See you tonight. 

           Mel nods.
                                 MEL
                        Bye Parisa. 

                                 DEE
                             (indignant)
                        What about me? 

                                 MEL
                        Bye Dee. 

           Bryant and his family leave. We stay with Mel. 

           As soon as they’re gone, whatever brightness Mel may have 
           gotten from them fades. Her shoulders sink. She looks beat. 

           EXT. FORT ROSECRANS CEMETERY - EVENING

           The beginning of a beautiful sunset. The sun falls over the 
           Pacific Ocean, as Mel hobbles through the tombstones, clearly 
           still in pain from the fight. A bottle of LIQUOR in her hand. 

           Thousands and thousands of fallen soldiers here. Fort 
           Rosecrans stretches as far as we can see. 

           MOURNERS pepper the graveyard. Nobody takes notice of Mel. 
           All lost in their own worlds. 

           She catches sight of four silhouettes in the distance, 
           backlit against the sun. She heads towards them.

           EXT. HEADSTONE - CEMETERY - MOMENTS LATER

           Bryant stands in front of a headstone that says CONNOR 
           BRADLEY with --

           BEN ELLIS (30s, kind but constantly on edge), 

           JOHNNY DOMINGUEZ (30s, strung out as all hell), and 

           DANE PRICE (30s, hulking, caustic) --

           Sharing a six pack of BEER in front of Connor’s headstone. 
           They turn to see Mel coming towards them. 

           She opens the handle, takes a swig, and passes it to Ellis. 

                                 MEL
                        How’s our boy? 

           She nods to the headstone. 
                                 ELLIS
                        No different, really. 

                                 PRICE
                        Still can’t hold his liquor. 

           Price grabs a second beer from the pack. Pops the cap off. 
           Clinks it with his own and DUMPS out the newly opened beer 
           onto Connor’s grave. Everyone watches this ceremony.

                                 JOHNNY
                        He’d be laughing if he could see us 
                        now. Still putting up with the 
                        world’s bullshit while he gets a 
                        well-deserved rest.

           Johnny laughs alone. His snicker morphs into a sob. 

           Everyone just watches quietly, awkwardly. 

           Bryant puts a single comforting hand on Johnny’s shoulder.

           Mel stares at the grave, off in her memories. 

                                 JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                             (through his tears)
                        I’m sorry man. 

           He’s spiraling. Ellis shakes his head. 

                                 JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        I thought I took that guy out --

                                 ELLIS
                        Shut the fuck up, Johnny. 

                                 PRICE
                        Bro. 

           Ellis doesn’t have any more patience for Johnny. He walks off 
           to cool down as Johnny continues to flounder. 

           Mel looks at Johnny, she’s hurting as much as he is, but in 
           silence. 

                                 BRYANT
                        We don’t blame you. None of us do.

           Bryant takes the handle and tries to hand it to Johnny, who 
           doesn’t take it. So Bryant keeps it for himself. Raises it.

                                 BRYANT (CONT'D)
                        To Connor. Frogman’s frogman. 
           He slugs a drink. 

           Off Mel, still staring at the tombstone --

           INT. BAR - LATER

           Blue collar. Lots of beer and hard liquor, not a lotta wine 
           or cocktails. A decent amount of patrons. A BARTENDER (Lonzo) 
           serves A CUSTOMER. Next to him, also tending bar is -- 

           Mel. She’s in the process of pouring some beers when a 
           GOATEED CUSTOMER leans over the bar and SNAPS his fingers 
           obnoxiously at her. 

                                 GOATEE
                        Helloooo. Can I get a little help 
                        over here?

                                 MEL
                        Snap at me again, you fucking --

                                 LONZO
                             (sharp)
                        Mel! 

           Lonzo stares Mel down. She relents. Lonzo turns to Goatee --

                                 LONZO (CONT'D)
                        What do you want, man?

           Mel shakes off her irritation and brings the beers she was 
           pouring over to --

           Bryant, Price, Johnny, and Ellis. Huddled around a dart board 
           in the corner of the bar. Price flings darts with impressive 
           force and little accuracy. One clanks off the board. 

           As Mel comes over to distribute the drinks --

                                 PRICE
                        Fiver on a bullseye?

                                 ELLIS
                        You’re so dumb I almost feel bad 
                        about this...

           They shake. Price throws. Misses by a mile.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Gotta take a piss. 

           Johnny leaves to go to the bathroom.
                                 PRICE
                        Double or nothing?

                                 BRYANT
                        What’d the board ever do to you, 
                        Price?

           Bryant shakes his head and punches Ellis in the arm. Gets up. 
           Says goodbye to the guys. 

           When he gets to Mel he wraps her up in a warm hug. 
           Momentarily shielding his friend from the world. Then, 
           finally, he pulls away.

           Ellis busts into the small, dingy bathroom to see Johnny on 
           the floor, leaning up against a wall. Needle and rubber hose.  
           Johnny gives him a loopy grin.

           Mel drives fast, racing down blocks. Ellis riding shotgun and 
           Johnny in the back.

           She’s a little too drunk, and takes a couple turns with too 
           much swerve. Johnny puts his hands in the air.

           INT. JOHNNY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The door opens, Mel and Ellis have Johnny’s arms draped over 
           their shoulders. They stagger in with him. 

                                 JOHNNY

           Johnny’s eyes close. 

           Mel watches how Ellis takes care of Johnny and appreciates 
           it. Within seconds, Johnny’s snoring. Ellis relaxes a little, 
           then turns to Mel.

           Mel leaves. 

           INT. BACKYARD - MEL’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Mel is in a backyard. Her backyard. It’s very dark, but 
           there’s a faint outline of a ROPE lying on the ground in 
           front of her, leading somewhere. She follows it, compelled. 

           A loud CLINKING sound echoes all around her. Over and over. 
           Like some kind of aluminum heartbeat. We can’t tell where 
           it’s coming from. 

           But Mel doesn’t investigate the noise, she follows the rope. 

           Tension builds. The clinking grows louder as she follows the 
           rope towards a HOLE in the ground. She’s scared. 

           She walks up to the hole, but can’t see into it. The bottom 
           is shrouded in ABSOLUTE DARKNESS. The clinking is almost 
           deafening now. She suddenly turns around and sees --

           The far end of the rope is LIT, and it’s hurtling towards 
           her. She realizes --

           It’s a FUSE. She’s frozen, can’t move --

           The lit fuse rushes past where Mel stands, down into the 
           hole, and --

           A MASSIVE, FIERY EXPLOSION ERUPTS --

           But instead of a BOOM, we hear --
           AN ANNOYING HONK.

           INT. MEL’S CAR - NIGHT

           Mel startles awake with a violent jerk. Downtown San Diego. 
           Another HONK. 

           Mel’s sitting at a (green) light. The cars ahead of her have 
           already gone. 

           She tries to take a moment to gather herself, rattled by the 
           nightmare. 

           The light turns yellow. The BMW behind her ZOOMS around her, 
           and the guy driving FLIPS THE BIRD at Mel as he goes. It 
           triggers something in her. 

           She SLAMS the gas, running what is now a red light --

           Other cars in the intersection honk at her as she speeds 
           through, racing after the BMW. 

           Her face is contorted with uncontrollable rage. 

           The BMW slows down and stops at the next light. Mel, just 
           behind him, doesn’t slow. 

           She REAR ENDS him. The CRUNCH of crushed metal. It’s a 
           vicious hit. 

           Mel gets out, not even checking the damage to their cars, and 
           strides towards the driver’s side of the BMW. 

           The window rolls down --

                                 BMW DRIVER
                        What the hell? 

           Mel reaches the door, and without missing a beat, KICKS OFF 
           HIS SIDEVIEW MIRROR. 

                                 BMW DRIVER (CONT'D)
                        What’s your fucking problem??

           Mel doesn’t back down as the BMW Driver jumps out of his car. 
           He towers over her, 6’2 and hulking. We’re frightened for 
           Mel, though she seems like she’s hungry for this fight. 

                                 MEL
                        You’re my fucking problem. What was 
                        that back there!?
                                 BMW DRIVER
                        Are you crazy, lady? 

           Mel steps towards him. She’s fearless. Or she is crazy.

                                 MEL
                        Fuck you! 

           The guy looks like he might step to her, but instead takes 
           out his phone, and dials. 

           Off Mel, starting to realize what she’s done --

           INT. COURTROOM - SAN DIEGO COURTHOUSE - DAY

           Mel sits at the defendant’s table, dressed in a rumpled suit. 
           Her LAWYER (early 30s) next to her. JUDGE ROSA PEREZ (60s, 
           will not be rushed) presides. 

           In the pews, there’s a man dressed in a police uniform. This 
           is OWEN HARRIS, Mel’s husband. He’s in his 30s and looks like 
           he used to have a lot of energy. Right now, he’s stressed.

           Perez stares down at her papers. Mel’s jaw is clenched, 
           defiant. 

                                 JUDGE PEREZ
                        Driving your car into someone with 
                        the intent to cause harm is assault 
                        with a deadly weapon. 
                             (looks up at Mel)
                        You’re looking at ten years if 
                        convicted. 

           In the pews, Owen buries his head.

                                 MEL
                        I wasn’t trying to hurt anybody.  

           Perez studies her. Then --

                                 JUDGE PEREZ
                        The VICTOR program has openings.

                                 MEL
                        The what?

           She doesn’t like the sound of “program.” 

                                 JUDGE PEREZ
                        It’s a program the VA is using to 
                        treat PTSD with virtual reality. 
           Mel doesn’t respond. 

                                 JUDGE PEREZ (CONT'D)
                        It seems to me that, given your 
                        experiences, you may be a prime 
                        candidate. But it also seems to me 
                        that you might need a push. I went 
                        ahead and called the director and 
                        she agrees with my assessment -- 

                                 MEL
                        So you’re forcing me into it.

           Perez takes a breath.

                                 JUDGE PEREZ
                        I’m offering you a spot in this 
                        program. Or you can take the time.
                             (beat)
                        The choice is yours. 

           Mel’s quiet. Judge Perez waits for an answer. 

           Off Mel, the decision surprisingly hard for her... 

           EXT. COURTHOUSE - SAN DIEGO - LATER

           Mel exits through the double doors of the courthouse with 
           Owen. Mel is in her own head, but Owen is positive. They walk 
           towards the parking lot.

                                 OWEN

                        This is great, Mel. Really great. 
                        I’m so proud of you for doing this. 

                                 MEL
                        Alright, Dad. 

                                 OWEN
                        Come on. Maybe it’ll help you 
                        process --

                                 MEL
                        It’s not gonna fix anything. 

                                 OWEN
                        I didn’t say it would. I’m just 
                        asking you to keep an open mind. 
                             (beat)
                        I’m really glad you chose to do 
                        this.
                                 MEL
                             (exasperated)
                        I didn’t “choose” this, Owen. It 
                        was the program or jail.  

                                 OWEN
                             (upbeat)
                        Still, it could be a big step 
                        towards getting better.

           Mel whips on him --

                                 MEL
                        Fucking listen to me -- I’m not 
                        doing this because it will help. 
                        I’m doing it because I have to. Did 
                        you actually think there was a 
                        chance I was just gonna take jail 
                        time? 

           Mel keeps walking towards the car. 

                                 OWEN
                        You punish yourself, Mel. It’s what 
                        you do. This time, you didn’t. 

           Mel and Owen reach Owen’s POLICE CRUISER. Mel opens the door 
           and gets in.

                                 OWEN (CONT'D)
                        That’s a good thing. 

                                 MEL
                        Whatever you say. 

           Mel slams her door closed.

           INT. MEL’S BAR - NIGHT

           Mel clocks in. Gets behind the bar. She starts making drinks 
           as CUSTOMERS begin barking orders at her. 

           She keeps working, trying not to explode. 

           LATER --

           She sneaks off for a moment, drinks a shot for herself. Sits 
           down and rests. Tired of the world.
           INT. MEL’S BATHROOM - LATER

           Mel looks at herself in the mirror. Gathering herself and 
           getting ready for bed. 

           We DRIFT over to the window, which overlooks -- 

           Her backyard (from the nightmare). She scans it, looking for  
           something... but there’s no sign of a hole. 

           INT. MEL’S LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Mel passes Owen in the kitchen as she heads for the door, 
           fully dressed and in the simplest outfit of black shirt and 
           jeans. 

                                 OWEN
                        Good luck. Call me if you need 
                        anything. 

           She nods to him, grabs a Padres hat off the coat rack, and 
           leaves. 

           EXT. VICTOR CENTER - LATE MORNING

           Mel parks in the lot of an all-glass building. She steps out 
           of her car, checks out her surroundings, pulls down her hat, 
           and walks towards the building. 

           INT. VICTOR CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

           Mel looks around the lobby -- well-kept plants and white 
           furniture, nothing to make it distinct from any other modern 
           office building. A RECEPTIONIST (30s) is at the front desk. 

           Mel approaches slowly. Skeptical of this whole thing. 

                                 MEL
                        Mel Harris. Here for the... Virtual 
                        Immersion Combat Theater --

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        The VICTOR program, yes. Please 
                        wait while I check for you in the 
                        system --

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        It’s alright Beth, I’ve got her. 

           A woman comes out of a hallway behind the desk. 
           She’s in her 40s, has a warm motherly vibe to her for the 
           most part, except for the slight edge that says don’t fuck 
           with her. This is DR. SAMANTHA BERENSON. 

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        Mel Harris -- I’m Dr. Sam Berenson. 
                        I run the VICTOR program. 

           She offers a hand, Mel shakes it but doesn’t answer. 

                                 DR. BERENSON (CONT'D)
                        Padres fan, huh? 

                                 MEL
                        ...Not much these days. Team’s 
                        broken. 

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        I dunno. One or two big moves and 
                        you could be a playoff team. Walk 
                        with me? 

           Mel follows her, slightly more comfortable. 

           INT. DR. BERENSON’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           They step together into Berenson’s office, which looks more 
           like a library. It’s mostly wood, bookshelves line the walls, 
           and natural light streams in through the glass. 

           Dr. Berenson sits down in a big comfy chair, crossing her 
           legs and intertwining her hands. Mel moves to the couch. 

           For a minute, Berenson just observes her. Mel shifts 
           uncomfortably. 

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        You don’t like any of this. 

           Mel looks at her. 

                                 DR. BERENSON (CONT'D)
                        Feels like a power imbalance. 
                        You’re here by court mandate, you 
                        need my signatures so everyone 
                        knows you’re fulfilling your 
                        obligation. I have a file on you, 
                        you don’t know anything about me. I 
                        understand. I wouldn’t like it 
                        either.
                             (beat)
                        Do you want some sparkling water? 
           She gets up and goes to her mini-fridge. 

                                 MEL
                        No thanks. 

           Berenson takes out a can and cracks it open. 

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        I’m addicted. From my time in the 
                        tech industry. 

           Berenson walks back towards her desk, stops by a PHOTO of 
           herself hugging a similar age NICE-LOOKING MAN. 

                                 DR. BERENSON (CONT'D)
                        I was never in the military. All 
                        the soldiers I knew were through my 
                        husband Victor. 
                             (lingers on the photo)
                        He had the sweetest smile. 

           Mel feels her heart reach out for a second. 

                                 MEL
                        How’d he die?

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        Suicide. 

           A beat, then --

                                 DR. BERENSON (CONT'D)
                        I saw the struggles of PTSD through 
                        Victor, but at the time I wasn’t 
                        able to help. Now I can. 

           Mel nods. A little bit of respect for this woman forming. 

                                 DR. BERENSON  (CONT'D)
                        That’s all to say, I care about 
                        this, Mel. It isn’t just some 
                        anonymous program. I want to help 
                        you. 

           They share their first bit of meaningful eye contact. Mel 
           decides to open up, just a little. 

                                 MEL
                        So how exactly is this gonna work? 

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        I’ll take you through it. 

           As Mel listens, we cut to --
           INT. VR SPACE - VICTOR CENTER - A DIFFERENT DAY

                                 DR. BERENSON (V.O.)
                        Based on your After Action Reports, 
                        we have reconstructed your most 
                        traumatic mission in the field. 

           Mel stands in an ADAPTABLE ROOM (set up for elements like 
           vibrations and temperature to enhance the experience, as well 
           as some select PROPS). 

           There’s a CHAIR in the middle of the room. 

                                 DR. BERENSON (V.O.)
                        I want to stress -- the program is 
                        extremely real. Our technology has 
                        a binocular field of view of 220 
                        degrees. Full range of human sight. 
                        It won’t feel like you’re wearing 
                        anything, it’ll just feel like 
                        you’re back on that mission. 
                        Everything you see and everything 
                        you hear are designed to recreate 
                        that moment with as much accuracy 
                        as possible.

           ASSISTANTS help Mel put on a VR suit: 

           Hand sensors. Foot sensors. A weighted backpack. 

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        You can tell us to pull you out of 
                        the simulation whenever you want, 
                        but the goal is for you to stick it 
                        out as long as you can.

           INT. CONTROL ROOM - VICTOR CENTER - SAME TIME

           A small control center where Berenson stands with a few 
           ASSISTANT TECHNICIANS at computers. A SCREEN with what Mel is 
           seeing dominates the front of the room.

                                 DR. BERENSON 
                             (into a mic)
                        We want to get you to a place where 
                        memories of that day no longer 
                        trigger PTSD episodes. In order to 
                        do that, we need you to relive it. 
                        Over and over again. 
           INT. VR SPACE - VICTOR CENTER - SAME TIME

           An assistant brings a BIG, IMMERSIVE HEADSET to Mel. He looks 
           at Mel -- are you ready? 

           Mel nods. Sits down into the chair in the middle of the room.

                                 MEL
                        Let’s do this. 

           Mel takes a breath. The assistant lowers it onto her head.

           For a second, it’s only black. 

           Then we fade in on...

           INT. HELICOPTER - AFGHANISTAN - NIGHT

           A CHINOOK. Loaded up with a team of NAVY SEALS. Mel stands in 
           the middle, looking around. 

           [Note: when we are in the simulation, everything will be 
           written in bold.]

           The WHIRR of HELICOPTER BLADES is dominant. It very much 
           feels like we are on this chopper. It is nearly 
           indistinguishable from reality. 

           Mel is frozen. She’s staring at her team leader, CONNOR, who 
           sits in the middle of ELLIS and PRICE. She’s gone pale. 

                                 DR. BERENSON (V.O.)
                        Are you alright, Mel? 

           Berenson’s voice sounds omnipresent. Like the voice of God in 
           Mel’s head. 

                                 MEL
                             (no)
                        Yes. 

           She spots the SIMULATION VERSION OF HERSELF (her “Sim”) 
           sitting with the guys. Looks younger. Lighter. Happier. Her 
           sim speaks.

                                 MEL’S SIM
                        I looked her dead in the eye. I 
                        said, Sheila, god damn it I love 
                        you but if you don’t get in this 
                        car and drive with me to this 
                        concert right now, our friendship 
                        is over.

                                 (MORE)

                                 MEL’S SIM (CONT'D)
                             (beat)
                        She ended up fucking the drummer!

           Everyone laughs. Mel’s Sim grins. 

           [Note: The voices in the sim are RECORDINGS from the team’s 
           comms, so everyone looks as if they’re talking, but it will 
           always sound as if their voice is coming through a radio.]

                                 PRICE
                        Is anyone else still nursing a 
                        hangover? 

                                 ELLIS
                        Those are the four extra fingers of 
                        whiskey talkin’. You said they 
                        “needed a home.” 

                                 PRICE
                        Who better to adopt them than Papa 
                        Price? 

                                 CONNOR
                        Maybe take it easy tomorrow night, 
                        buddy. 

           Mel’s still staring at him. Watching him speak hurts her. 

                                 PRICE
                        They don’t pay me enough not to 
                        drink. 

                                 JOHNNY
                             (laughing)
                        Amen brotha. 

           JOHNNY sits across from them, next to BRYANT.

                                 BRYANT
                             (without opening his eyes)
                        Connor’s just lookin’ out for you. 
                        I can smell your breath from here.

           Even the casual banter is almost too much for Mel to bear. 
           She fixates on Bryant for a moment. Then --

                                 MEL
                        Bryant never wore his helmet on the 
                        chopper. Said he couldn’t nap. 

                                 DR. BERENSON (V.O.)
                        Okay. Mel -- just focus on trying 
                        to stay in the experience. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 DR. BERENSON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                                 DR. BERENSON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        There are going to be details that 
                        are off, it’s not a perfect system. 

           Mel doesn’t respond, but lets herself take in what’s 
           happening again. 

                                 CONNOR
                        You alright, Harris? 

           Mel flinches, jerks her head towards Connor. 

           But Connor’s talking to her Sim. She watches them. 

                                 MEL’S SIM
                        Four hours of sleep in the past two 
                        days? Never been better. 

                                 CONNOR
                             (mimes drinking)
                        You probably could’ve gotten one or 
                        two more with some better choices. 

                                 MEL’S SIM
                        Probably. 

           In this moment we see the real Mel start to spiral. We STAY 
           CLOSE on her as her JAW TWITCHES and she SWALLOWS 
           continuously -- Bryant’s voice plays over --

                                 BRYANT (O.S.)
                        You wanna talk about no sleep? Try 
                        having a newborn. I feel so bad 
                        Parisa’s alone with Dee. She ain’t 
                        sleepin’ one wink. 

           Mel’s eyes drift from Connor to Ellis. Fixes on him. Nearly 
           hyperventilating --

                                 MEL
                        And -- and Ellis didn’t sit next to 
                        Connor. They didn’t like each --

                                 DR. BERENSON (V.O.)
                        Mel, please. Focus --

                                 MEL
                        I’m done. Turn it off, or end it, 
                        or -- 

                                 DR. BERENSON (V.O.)
                        Alright, Mel, alright. 

           The scene fades out as Mel feels the headset being lifted off 
           of her. We can see her eyes are red, watery --
           Berenson comes out of a side room, as Mel rushes towards the 
           exit --

                                 DR. BERENSON 
                        Mel...

                                 MEL
                        I just -- I gotta go. 

           Berenson watches her leave. 

           EXT. VICTOR CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

           The doors swing open as Mel runs out of the building. She 
           sees a bench nearby. She collapses onto it, shaking a little. 
           She breathes in the fresh air. 

           EXT. MEL’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Mel gets home, sees Owen’s car in the driveway, then looks up   
           at the house --

           Which is eerily dark. 

           INT. KITCHEN - MEL’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Mel stalks through the kitchen. Wary. A dim light comes from 
           the living room.

                                 MEL
                        Hello...? 

                                 OWEN
                             (from the living room)
                        It’s just me. 

           Mel relaxes. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MEL’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           She enters the living room where there are some big CANDLES 
           lit and a BOTTLE OF WINE on the table. Owen sits on the 
           couch.

                                 OWEN
                        How’d it go today? 
                                 MEL
                             (ignores the question)
                        Why are all the lights out? You 
                        scared me shitless. 

                                 OWEN
                        My bad. Just wanted to surprise 
                        you. 

                                 MEL
                        With candles? 

                                 OWEN
                        You make it sound like a crime.

                                 MEL
                        It’s not really my thing. 
                             (then)
                        Right?

           What little energy Owen had seeps out. 

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                        Sorry. I’m just having a day.
                             (reconsiders)
                        You know what. This is nice. 

           She gestures at the wine.

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                        Pour me a glass. 

           Owen unscrews the bottle and starts pouring. He smiles 
           (almost timidly) at her. Then hands her the glass. 

                                 OWEN
                        It’s from New Zealand. 

           He does it in an endearing, mediocre Kiwi accent. Mel humors 
           him. 

                                 MEL
                             (in her own Kiwi accent)
                        Is it now? 

                                 OWEN
                        We should’ve gone there for our 
                        honeymoon. 

                                 MEL
                        I can’t argue with that. 
                                 OWEN
                        We had a lot of places we wanted to 
                        go. 

                                 MEL
                        Big dreams. 

           Owen lifts his glass up to cheers. They clink and drink. 

                                 OWEN
                        But Palm Springs was fun too.
                             (shrugs)
                        Things tend to work out the way 
                        they should. 

                                 MEL
                        Not always. 

           An awkward beat. 

                                 OWEN
                        I mean -- I sort of just meant -- 

                                 MEL
                        I know what you meant. 
                             (beat)
                        I just disagree.

                                 OWEN
                             (small)
                        You didn’t used to. 

                                 MEL
                        Great point. Once I was a beautiful 
                        happy princess, and now I’m an 
                        irredeemable, fucked up bitch.

                                 OWEN
                        That’s not what I’m saying. 

                                 MEL
                        Okay. 

                                 OWEN
                        I’m just -- trying. 
                             (beat, quietly)
                        Why does that annoy you?

           The chasm is wide, and neither knows how to cross it. Mel 
           puts down her glass. 
                                 MEL
                             (controlled)
                        I should go to bed. Um. Thanks for 
                        the wine. 

           She gets up and leaves the room. Owen watches her go, then 
           slowly starts blowing out the candles.

           EXT. MEL’S BACKYARD - DEAD OF NIGHT

           Mel’s dreaming. In the backyard again. 

           The hole is just feet in front of her. 

           Mel stares at it. The faint, familiar sound of CLINKING fades 
           in. A sense of TERROR overtakes us. An overpowering feeling 
           of don’t-go-near-that-hole again.

           But Mel steps towards it. And with each advancing step, the 
           clinking gets LOUDER. 

           The darkness of the hole draws her in. She’s almost there...

           Her breath catches. As she peers into it, this time she can 
           see --

           An unmoving figure. A body? Her breath catches. 

           The sound of the FUSE BEING LIT. She turns around, her eyes 
           go wide --

           INT. MEL’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Mel wakes up. She’s alone in bed. She takes a long blink.

           INT. VR SPACE - VICTOR CENTER - DAY

           The VR room. Same set up as before, only this time, instead 
           of any assistants around, it’s just Berenson with Mel. She 
           holds the headset. 

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        This time, I want you to try to be 
                        as present as possible. We have a 
                        lot more to get through.

                                 MEL
                        I’m here, aren’t I? 

           Berenson smiles at her. Lifts the headset. Mel nods in 
           approval. Berenson lowers it over her. 
           And as it goes black, we fade up on: 

           INT. HELICOPTER - AFGHANISTAN - NIGHT

           Same scene as before, but Bryant’s helmet is off, and Ellis 
           and Connor sit across from each other now. 

           Mel’s jaw immediately clenches, she’s still triggered. But at 
           least now it matches her memory. 

           We hear snippets of dialogue we’ve already heard, while --

           INT. CONTROL ROOM - VICTOR CENTER - SAME TIME

           We’re with Berenson in the control room. Mel’s POV up on the 
           screen.

           INT./EXT. HELICOPTER - AFGHANISTAN - NIGHT

           The helicopter starts its descent. Mel feels the SHAKE and 
           the WIND as it comes down. Her hand quivers. This is scary. 
           She’s back in a war zone. 

           The helicopter lands and everyone quickly steps off in a 
           line. They move smoothly and with precision. Mel follows her 
           Sim. A look of trepidation on her face. 

           They patrol towards a TOWN in the distance. 

           INT. CONTROL ROOM - VICTOR CENTER - SAME TIME

           Mel’s apprehension is mirrored on Berenson’s face. But 
           Berenson’s fear is for Mel. 

           EXT. JUST OUTSIDE OF TOWN - NIGHT

           The team approaches the nearest house, a brick one painted 
           white. Mel twitches a little, stares at it. 

                                 MEL
                        Can we pause it? That house wasn’t 
                        white. It was yellow. 

           The whole scene suddenly STANDS STILL. 

                                 DR. BERENSON (V.O.)
                        Mel -- 
                                 MEL
                        It was yellow. I’m sure of it. 

           INT. CONTROL ROOM - VICTOR CENTER - SAME TIME

           Berenson shakes her head, frustrated. She nods to an 
           Assistant. The Assistant goes to work at her computer. 

                                 BERENSON 
                        We’ll adjust this, Mel, but no 
                        more. We need you to stay in it.

           EXT. JUST OUTSIDE OF TOWN - AFGHANISTAN - NIGHT

           The scene UNFREEZES. Mel starts to follow the team again, 
           reluctantly. And as she passes the house, we see that it is 
           now YELLOW. 

                                 CONNOR
                        Let’s keep moving. Target house is 
                        third on the right. 

           They patrol until they reach the target house. Silent streets 
           inducing an oppressive feeling of being watched.

           INT. CONTROL ROOM - VICTOR CENTER - SAME TIME

           From the screen in the room, Berenson watches as Price sets a 
           SMALL EXPLOSIVE CHARGE on the door handle of the house. 

           INT. MID-SIZED AFGHANI HOUSE - NIGHT

           Mel covers her ears as the handle EXPLODES off. The door 
           swings open -- 

           Connor nods to Price, the breacher, and Price charges in 
           through the door --

           Mel frowns, pauses. Something bothering her about that. 

           Bryant bursts through after him, full speed.  

           Ellis is after Bryant. Mel frowns at this too.

           Once inside, the team chucks frag grenades into rooms in 
           front of them, and a series of BOOMS follow. 

           Enemy screams from within the house, as explosions shake them 
           from their positions.
           The team splits. Mel follows Johnny and Ellis. 

           POP! POP! She sees them take down TWO ENEMY FIGHTERS.

           In the next room, Ellis and Johnny split. Mel follows Johnny. 
           Johnny throws a smoke grenade into the next room. 

           ONE MORE ENEMY FIGHTER APPEARS OUT OF THE SMOKE. Johnny hits 
           him square in the chest. The Fighter goes down. 

           Mel stares at the Fighter’s body. A tremor runs through her. 
           For a moment, she’s stuck. Then --

           She takes off through the virtual SMOKE, crossing through 
           rooms that have already been swept through by the team. Mel 
           finally reaches --

                                 PRICE (OVER COMMS)
                        Booyah. 

           A central room where the team has gathered. Inside --

           TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH, and SEVERAL HUNDRED BRICKS OF 
           HEROIN. 

           Mel sees it all. The guys and her Sim stand there looking at 
           it in shock. Mel starts to hyperventilate. 

                                 MEL
                        Pull me out. 

                                 DR. BERENSON 
                        You’ve come so far --

                                 MEL
                        Out. 

           Silence.

           And the scene fades to black...

           INT. VR SPACE - VICTOR CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

           Mel comes out of the simulation, frazzled. Berenson and an 
           assistant enter the VR space.

                                 MEL
                        There’s still shit wrong with that 
                        simulation. 
                             (then, rapid fire)
                        Ellis went in first. Not Price. 
                        Breacher sets the charge, and ducks 
                        away from the door.

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                        Guys behind him are always the 
                        first ones in. That’s what we’re 
                        taught to do.

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        It’s been three years. Maybe you’re 
                        misremembering.

                                 MEL
                        I’m not.

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        That’s what was in the After Action 
                        Reports, Mel. 

                                 MEL
                        Well maybe the AARs are wrong. 

           Berenson tilts her head, as if considering the words she’s 
           about to say. 

                                 DR. BERENSON
                             (more gently)
                        Are you sure you aren’t just 
                        avoiding the part you really need 
                        to face?

           Mel ignores her. Gets up to go. 

                                 MEL
                        I’m not “misremembering.”

           EXT. DRIVEWAY - PRICE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Mel pulls up in front of a house in the city meant for one. 

           In the driveway, a REALLY NICE TRUCK. A pair of boots stick 
           out from under it. 

           Mel gets out of her car and walks up to them. 

           Price slides out from under the truck. Stays down. 

                                 PRICE
                        You really couldn’t wait until I 
                        was done fixing my truck, huh? 

                                 MEL
                        I didn’t know when there was gonna 
                        be some D-lister in need of your 
                        services later. 
                                 PRICE
                        Whaddya you want smartass? 

                                 MEL
                        I’ve been thinking about the day 
                        everything went down. 

           Price goes cold. She’s got his attention. 

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                        How well do you remember it.

                                 PRICE
                             (quiet)
                        What are you doing? 

                                 MEL
                        Come on, I’m not trying to get us 
                        in trouble.

           He looks down the street. Glances around. Then, firmly --

                                 PRICE
                        I don’t really remember much about 
                        it, sorry.

           He slides back under the truck without answering. Mel doesn’t 
           budge. 

                                 MEL
                        I’m in therapy now. 

                                 PRICE
                             (scoffs)
                        Fuckin’ shrinks. No wonder. 

                                 MEL
                        I’m trying to figure out if I’m 
                        going crazy or I remember it right. 

                                 PRICE
                        If it’s a question, must be going 
                        crazy. 

                                 MEL
                        Help me out.

                                 PRICE
                             (from under the truck)
                        No. 

                                 MEL
                        So you’d rather just be a dick?
                                 PRICE
                             (from under the truck)
                        Suits me.

                                 MEL
                        Okay, that’s cool.  
                             (then, seemingly random)
                        How exactly did you afford this 
                        truck again? 

           A loaded beat, and then Price slides back out. Angry. 

                                 PRICE
                        That was a shitty, shitty day. But 
                        I’ve moved on. I’m over it. If you 
                        wanna dive back into the past, 
                        kindly leave me the fuck out.

           Mel rolls her eyes, frustrated. Starts walking away. KICKS 
           his truck on the way. 

                                 PRICE (CONT'D)
                        Bitch!

                                 MEL
                        Fuck you too.

           INT. DIVE BAR - DAY

           Different than where Mel works. Dingy jukebox pool-table 
           vibe. Pretty empty. Mel hunches over a bar, nursing the end 
           of a whiskey neat and staring at the TV playing a soap opera. 

           Light pours in as another CUSTOMER enters, telling us it’s 
           still day. 

           The BARTENDER (30s, handsome in a grunge sort of way) comes 
           over to Mel. 

                                 GRUNGY BARTENDER
                        You want a third? 

                                 MEL
                        Yep. 

           The Bartender takes the JAMESON out with a flourish. Gives a 
           generous pour. 

                                 GRUNGY BARTENDER
                        Going through a break up? 

                                 MEL
                        Sure. 
                                 GRUNGY BARTENDER
                        This one’s on me. 

                                 MEL
                        Thanks. 

           Bartender casually leans on his elbows over the bar. 

                                 GRUNGY BARTENDER
                        Went through a break up myself a 
                        month ago. Sucks huh. 

                                 MEL
                        Sorry to hear that. 

                                 GRUNGY BARTENDER
                             (smiles flirtatiously)
                        If you ever wanna drown your 
                        sorrows... 

           Mel abruptly SLAMS her hands on the bar, scaring the two 
           other people in the place, but mostly the Bartender, who 
           jumps back. 

           Mel gives an abrasive false grin. 

                                 MEL
                        Yeah, come find me sometime. 

           The bartender looks freaked out. Mel shoots the whiskey in a 
           single shot and heads for the door.

           INT. KITCHEN - MEL’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           She walks into the kitchen. Owen appears in the doorway 
           between the kitchen and the living room. He looks at her, 
           silently asking how her day went. 

           She gives him a thumbs up. Then goes to the sink. He realizes 
           he’s not getting any more than that and retreats into the 
           living room. 

           She gets a glass. As she fills it with water, her gaze drifts 
           through the window and to her backyard. 

           She looks out onto the setting of her nightmare.

           She sips the water. Her mind no longer in the present. As she 
           stares out the window, the glass slips from her hand and 
           SHATTERS in the sink. 

           She picks up the shards, cutting herself slightly. Some blood 
           oozes out, but Mel doesn’t care. 
           She throws the bigger shards in the trash and sweeps the 
           smaller ones into the garbage disposal. Turns it on.

           The disturbing CLINK of glass being PULVERIZED.

           INT. BEDROOM - MEL’S HOUSE - LATER

           Mel collapses onto her bed. Her eyes drift closed...

           INT. MEL’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Mel lies face down, a pillow over her head. The sheets are 
           rumpled and strewn all over. 

           We stay with her a moment. Then her phone starts vibrating 
           from the bedside table. 

           Slowly, she unwraps herself from the pillow and the sheets. 

           Mel looks at the name and picks it up groggily. 

                                 MEL
                        Ellis? 

                                 ELLIS
                        Johnny OD’ed last night. 

           On Mel’s face -- fuck. 

                                 MEL
                        Is he alright? 

                                 ELLIS
                        Yeah. But it’s time to put this 
                        shit to bed. We’re gonna talk to 
                        him. You should be here. 

                                 MEL
                        Okay. I will. 

           She hangs up. 

           EXT. JOHNNY’S HOUSE - LATER

           Mel exits her car. Walks up to Johnny’s house, where Price 
           and Bryant are standing outside. 

                                 MEL
                        You didn’t have to wait for me. 
                                 BRYANT
                        Ellis figured we should all come in 
                        at the same time. 

                                 PRICE
                        Let’s do it. 

           He knocks on the door. They wait in silence, until --

           The door opens. Ellis stands there. 

                                 ELLIS
                        Come on in.  

           He ushers them inside. 

           INT. JOHNNY’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Johnny’s lying in bed. Half-awake. Perks up when everyone 
           else enters.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Wow. Whole gang’s here. This is 
                        better than my birthday. 

                                 PRICE
                        Jesus man, you look like shit. 

           Ellis throws Price a look. 

                                 PRICE (CONT'D)
                        What? He does. 

                                 JOHNNY
                        It’s cool. I feel even worse. 

           The rest of the team exchanges awkward glances with one 
           another. Johnny notices.

                                 JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        Why are you all acting weird? 

           No one steps up so Ellis starts. 

                                 ELLIS
                        Listen man, we’re worried about 
                        you. This is getting out of hand. 

           He gestures at the bedside table, where a series of pill 
           bottles lie open.  
                                 ELLIS (CONT'D)
                        We looked into it, and there’s a 
                        really great outpatient program at 
                        Betty Ford.

           Ellis pulls out a pamphlet for “Drug Treatment at the Betty 
           Ford Rehabilitation Center.” Drops it on the bedside table.

           Johnny stares back defiantly.

                                 JOHNNY
                        So what is this, some kind of 
                        intervention? You guys are fucking 
                        hilarious. 

                                 BRYANT
                        We’re just looking out for you, 
                        bro. 

                                 JOHNNY
                             (sarcastic)
                        Thanks for the concern, bro. But 
                        you four are more fucked up than I 
                        am. Maybe start fixing yourselves 
                        before you come at me.

                                 PRICE
                        We are.
                             (shrugs)
                        Or, at least, Mel’s seein’ a 
                        shrink. 

           Mel turns on him --

                                 MEL
                        The fuck, Price? 

                                 BRYANT
                        You are? 

                                 ELLIS
                        Wow. 

                                 JOHNNY
                        Seriously? 

           Mel puts a hand to her head. 

                                 MEL
                        Not really a shrink. It’s a 
                        different thing. Called the VICTOR 
                        program. 
                                 BRYANT
                        I don’t know what that is.

           But Ellis recognizes it. 

                                 ELLIS
                        It’s a virtual reality simulation.
                             (then, loaded)
                        They make you relive your worst day 
                        in the field. 

           A thick tension fills the room.

                                 MEL
                        You know it? 

                                 ELLIS
                        They offered me a spot in it a few 
                        months ago at my VA appointment.

           He stares Mel down. 

                                 ELLIS (CONT'D)
                             (low)
                        I said no fucking way.

           Mel holds his stare. But their silent conversation is 
           interrupted by Johnny.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Is it helping? 

           Mel looks back to him.

                                 MEL
                        I dunno.

           Johnny studies her. Then --

                                 JOHNNY
                        I don’t need therapy. I’m doing 
                        fine on my own. 

           A moment. The guys glance at one another. Finally --

                                 BRYANT
                        No you’re not. 
                             (Johnny looks at him)
                        Why do you think we’re here? 
                        Clearly you’re worse off than any 
                        of us. And give me a break with 
                        this “on my own” bullshit. He won’t 
                        say it, but Ellis has been carrying 
                        you. He’s tired.

                                 BRYANT (CONT'D)
                        Get help, if for no other reason 
                        than to give your friend a fucking 
                        break. 

           A long silence. Johnny looks at Ellis, who can’t meet his 
           eyes. He picks up the Betty Ford pamphlet from the bedside 
           table.

                                 JOHNNY
                             (quiet)
                        I guess I could give it a chance.

                                 BRYANT
                        Beats being in free fall.

           Off Mel, Bryant’s words landing on her as well, we cut to --

           EXT. JUST OUTSIDE OF TOWN - AFGHANISTAN - NIGHT

           Mel patrols in with the team. 

           We can tell she’s nervous. 

           Her eyes dart around as they get into town. 

           She stares at the first house. 

                                 MEL
                        I think that house was white, 
                        actually. 

           INT. CONTROL ROOM - VICTOR CENTER - SAME TIME

           Dr. Berenson stands in the middle of the room. A few of the 
           assistants look at her questioningly. One of them decides to 
           speak up --

                                 ASSISTANT
                        That was the one she changed... 

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        I know. Just change it back. 

           The assistant shrugs, executes Berenson’s order. 

           EXT./INT. AFGHANI HOUSE - NIGHT

           They’re at the main door. Breach charge is set. 

           The handle explodes off -- 
           Price PEELS in first, followed by Bryant --

                                 MEL
                        Pause. 

           The scene pauses -- a striking, chaotic image of SMOKE and 
           DEBRIS and DYNAMIC MOVEMENT. 

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                        Price is still going in first. You 
                        didn’t fix it. 

                                 DR. BERENSON (V.O.)
                             (carefully)
                        Correct. This is what the AAR said.  
                        It isn’t your job to focus on this. 
                        Your job is to confront what comes 
                        next. 

           Mel can see she’s not gonna get any further. 

                                 MEL
                        ...Unpause.

           The simulation unpauses.

           The rest of the team follows Price and Bryant inside the 
           house. Once everyone’s inside, they all chuck grenades into 
           the open doors leading into the rooms beyond when -- 

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                        Stop.

           The simulation stops again. 

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        Mel...

                                 MEL
                        It’s just -- the first two guys 
                        into the house have to hold 
                        positions. They don’t throw 
                        grenades. Only the later guys do 
                        that. Can we adjust? 

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        No. I’m sorry.

           INT. CONTROL ROOM - VICTOR CENTER - SAME TIME

           The simulation unpauses.
           As the grenades explode, Berenson sees Mel FLINCH. A tinge of 
           concern on Berenson’s face, but she believes in this process. 

           She watches Mel enter the house. 

           INT. AFGHANI HOUSE - NIGHT

           Mel follows Johnny -- we see her watch as he and Ellis kill 
           two ENEMY FIGHTERS. We’ve seen this before. 

           Johnny splits off, and again Mel follows him -- he throws a 
           smoke grenade. THE SAME ENEMY FIGHTER APPEARS OUT OF THE 
           SMOKE --

           POP. Johnny brings him down and moves past. Mel takes a beat, 
           and then follows Johnny into the room with the heroin. 

           Mel braces for whatever comes next... but the guys just stand 
           around. Mel looks confused.

           She walks between the static avatars. Eerie in their 
           stillness. It’s a strange moment of nothing.

           Only ambient city-noise can be heard when Berenson says --

                                 DR. BERENSON (V.O.)
                        We don’t have recordings from the 
                        next minute or so. 

           Mel nods, remembering... 

                                 MEL
                        We turned off our comms when we got 
                        into the room. 
                             (beat)
                        ISIS had been intercepting our 
                        communications, so we did our 
                        planning offline.

                                 DR. BERENSON (V.O.)
                        We can program their voices into 
                        the system. Would it help you for 
                        us to fill in the details? 

                                 MEL
                        No, it doesn’t matter.

           Something about the way Mel says this -- we can tell she’s 
           nervous about something. 
           INT. CONTROL ROOM - VICTOR CENTER - SAME TIME

           The same assistant looks to Berenson. 

                                 ASSISTANT
                             (under his breath)
                        Now the details don’t matter? 

           Berenson ignores him. Focuses on Mel. We can feel the 
           intensity in the room building. 

           INT. AFGHANI HOUSE - SAME TIME

           Mel watches Connor. 

           A long moment as he stands there. Mel moves closer to him. 
           Slowly approaching. But then --

           Connor’s voice crackles, breaking the silence --

                                 CONNOR
                        TOC, we’re gonna need an extra 
                        vehicle for exfil -- 

           And suddenly, the team snaps back to life. It startles Mel as 
           they split to guard different entrances. Mel follows her own 
           sim into THE ROOM FROM THE OPENING.

           Mel’s Sim looks out the window in ready position. For a beat, 
           it’s just Mel watching herself. 

           Sounds of the team getting into their various positions 
           elsewhere in the house. Then silence. We stay on Mel as --

                                 CONNOR (OVER COMMS) (CONT'D)
                             (quiet)
                        Incoming. 

           We start to hear sounds in the distance. Voices. Getting 
           close to the house. Then --

           Gunfire lashes through the window. Mel’s Sim ducks. Barely 
           avoiding it. More shots. Through the wall. Just above her 
           Sim’s head. Her Sim pops back up in the window. 

           POP POP.

           Brains the fighter running down the street.

           Eventually, the fighting subsides. It was short-lived. Mel 
           watches her Sim. This fight seemed so much longer in her 
           memory... 
           But Mel knows it isn’t over. She shuts her eyes tight as --

           CLINK CLINK. 

                                 CONNOR (OVER COMMS) (CONT'D)
                        Fuck --

           BOOM. The grenade explosion from the other room. 

           Followed by footsteps. 

           Gunshots.

           And finally --

                                 BRYANT (OVER COMMS)
                        Man down!

           Mel’s Sim finally shakes herself off and runs past Mel, who 
           stands, paralyzed. 

                                 DR. BERENSON (V.O.)
                             (gently)
                        Mel? 

           Mel, still frozen in the same room, doesn’t respond. 

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        Mel, I’m going to rewind the 
                        simulation now. 

           Still nothing. 

                                 DR. BERENSON (CONT'D)
                        In order to take the next step in 
                        your therapy, I think it would be 
                        important for you to actually see 
                        Connor die this time.

           A moment. Mel takes a deep breath. Then --

                                 MEL
                        I -- I can’t do that alone. 

           And she exits the simulation. 

           EXT. BACKYARD - BRYANT’S HOUSE - DAY

           Mel opens the wooden side gate to a beautiful family home. 
           She walks the well-kept pathway to the very green backyard, 
           where Bryant is at work building a fire. 
                                 BRYANT
                        Hey, bring me some of those logs?

           Mel picks some up from a LOG PILE and carries them over to 
           him. He chops one in half with an ax. 

                                 DEE
                        Hi Mel! 

           Dee appears from behind Bryant’s leg. 

                                 DEE (CONT'D)
                        I’m helping Daddy make a fire!

                                 BRYANT
                        “Helping” is generous. You almost 
                        burned the house down five minutes 
                        ago.  

                                 DEE
                        Did not!
                             (to Mel)
                        We’re going camping again. 

           Dee gives her an adorable thumbs up.

                                 MEL
                        Great. 

                                 BRYANT
                        Only if you learn how to make a 
                        fire. If you don’t, I’m leaving you 
                        at home this time. 
                             (then, to Mel)
                        What’s up? 

                                 MEL
                        I need your help. 

           Bryant looks at her. Sees the fear in her eyes.  

                                 BRYANT
                        Dee, five minute break from work. 

           Dee skips away. 

                                 BRYANT (CONT'D)
                        Of course. What do you need?  

                                 MEL
                        ...I want you to go through the 
                        Victor program with me.  

           A pause. Bryant doesn’t respond. 
                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                        In order for me to get better, I 
                        need to watch Connor die... but I 
                        can’t. Not alone. Every time I’m 
                        supposed to see what happened -- I 
                        just freeze.

           Still nothing. 

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                        Are you listening to me? 

                                 BRYANT
                        Yes. 

           But he offers nothing more.

                                 MEL
                        And?

                                 BRYANT
                        And I think... what’s done is done. 
                             (pointed)
                        I don’t want to fuck up any lives. 

           Mel looks at her friend. Bryant simmers with... fear? Anger? 
           She can’t quite tell. 

                                 DEE
                             (from afar)
                        Daddy, what does “fuck up” mean?

                                 BRYANT
                             (still looking at Mel)
                        Go help your Mom make lunch. 

           Dee runs off, and they hear from inside the house --

                                 DEE (O.S.)
                        Mom, what does “fuck up” mean?

           Just Bryant and Mel now. 

                                 BRYANT
                        I want to help you, but this is not 
                        the way to get better, Mel.

                                 MEL
                        Please. 
                             (begging)
                        I promise, they don’t know 
                        anything. 
                                 BRYANT
                        But they could.

           A long moment. Bryant studies her. Mel can’t meet his eyes.

                                 PARISA (O.S.)
                        Babe, did you say “fuck up?” 

           Parisa stands on the porch of the house. 

                                 PARISA (CONT'D)
                        You staying for food, Mel?

                                 BRYANT
                        No, she’s on her way out. 

           Mel looks at him, sees he’s serious. 

                                 MEL
                        Yeah, sorry about that Parisa. Wish  
                        I could.

           Mel walks out, defeated. 

           Bryant watches her go.

           EXT. BACKYARD - MEL’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           It’s the backyard, but the nightmare version again -- a sort 
           of ENDLESS DARKSCAPE. Mel’s running from the ALREADY-LIT 
           FUSE. 

           The CLINKING pounds against her ears. 

           She’s sprinting for her life. Stumbles for a moment --

           The fuse is gonna reach her --

           She regains her feet, keeps running, even more scared --

           Then suddenly TRIPS and FALLS into --

           THE HOLE. 

           And in that hole is -- CONNOR’S DEAD BODY. Right next to her. 

           She SCREAMS and SCREAMS and --
           INT. MEL’S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING

           Jolts up, screaming, into Owen’s arms, who’s sitting beside 
           the bed. It’s dark but for the light coming from the hallway 
           through her open door. 

                                 OWEN
                        Mel! Mel. Calm down. 

           She sees him, but she’s still in the nightmare. He holds her 
           for a beat as she comes back to reality. 

           She pushes him away. 

                                 MEL
                        I’m fine. 

                                 OWEN
                        You were screaming. 

           They sit apart now. 

           Owen watches her trying to control her breathing. 

                                 OWEN (CONT'D)
                        What do you dream about? 

                                 MEL
                        I don’t. 

           Owen rises, hurt. 

           He goes to the door. Mel watches him, feeling disappointed 
           with herself. She decides to open up. 

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                        Connor. 

           Owen nods. A long silence. Then --

                                 OWEN
                        You would talk in your sleep when 
                        your nightmares were at their 
                        worst. While we were still sharing 
                        a bed. 

                                 MEL
                        What would I say?

                                 OWEN
                        “We shouldn’t.” Over and over, the 
                        same thing.

           Mel’s quiet. 
                                 OWEN (CONT'D)
                        What does that mean? 

           Then, putting up her shield again --

                                 MEL
                        That it was a good idea we stopped 
                        sleeping in the same bed. 

           He shakes his head and goes to exit. Turns before he can get 
           to the door, and --

                                 OWEN
                        Do you even want to get better?

           Off Mel, withdrawing deeper into herself --

           INT. SHED - BACKYARD - LATER

           Mel enters a grimy, wooden shed at the end of her backyard. 
           Inside, she grabs the hanging string and yanks -- 

           Turning on the LIGHT. 

           Cobwebs hang from the ceiling, insects scurry as Mel enters.

           Mel approaches a wall covered in shelves, on which sit large 
           boxes. Her de facto attic.

           She gingerly takes one of those boxes from its resting place 
           and sits it on an old stool in the middle of the room. 
           Removes the top. We follow her gaze inside and see --

           PARAPHERNALIA from her time with the teams. Old PHOTOS 
           featuring faces we’ve come to know -- Johnny, Bryant, Price, 
           Ellis, Mel, and Connor. 

           Mel pauses over them, riffling through old memories.

           She stops at one: a picture of her and Connor, arms over 
           shoulders, smiling for the camera. 

           We see her go back in time to that moment. It’s incredibly 
           painful. 

           But she doesn’t look away from the photo. 

           Off Mel, in her grief, we cut to --
           INT. DR. BERENSON'S OFFICE - VICTOR CENTER - DAY

           Mel waits on the couch. Berenson walks in, sipping a can of 
           sparkling water. She’s surprised to see Mel.

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        Hello...? Did we have a session 
                        today? I’m so sorry, I don’t have 
                        you scheduled until --

                                 MEL
                        I wanted to talk to you. 

           Berenson sits down. All ears. 

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                        I haven’t been completely honest. 

           Berenson frowns. 

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        ...How do you mean?

           Mel sits there. No response. Eyes on the floor. Struggling 
           immensely with something. Fighting for the courage to speak. 
           Finally --

                                 MEL
                        Everyone says deployment doesn’t 
                        really count because you’re 5000 
                        miles away from home and it never 
                        means anything real, but Connor was 
                        special. 
                             (it’s getting harder)
                        I was married. He was too. Wife’s 
                        name was Andrea. He had pictures of 
                        her above his bed, like he was 
                        trying to act the part of doting 
                        husband even though his 
                        relationship was done for. Connor 
                        and I... we found each other and 
                        something about it just worked. So 
                        that day was... harder for me... 
                        because...  

           Mel trails off. Looks like she won’t be able to finish. But --

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                        Because I loved him.

           Berenson nods.

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        That explains a lot. 
           Mel looks up, sees an understanding in Berenson’s eyes. Non-
           judgmental. 

                                 DR. BERENSON  (CONT'D)
                        Thank you for telling me. 
                             (beat)
                        I think that’s the first real step 
                        you’ve taken to getting better. 

           She gives Mel a look of affirmation. 

                                 DR. BERENSON (CONT'D)
                        Are you ready now?

           Off Mel, taking a deep breath as we cut to --

           EXT./INT. AFGHANI HOUSE - NIGHT

           The team is about to breach the door. The handle explodes. 
           Price darts through the doorway. Bryant, next in. The rest of 
           the team follows. 

           The team uncorks their grenades -- Mel watches as they toss 
           them into the adjacent rooms. 

           BOOM -- smoke and debris bounce around -- and in the chaos, 
           the team charges forward.

           Mel follows Johnny and Ellis. They do their thing. Dispatch 
           TWO GUYS, split up. 

           Again Mel follows Johnny -- smoke grenade -- enemy fighter 
           out of the smoke --

           POP. The fighter goes down. 

                                 JOHNNY
                        Clear!

           Johnny leaves, but Mel stays with the downed Fighter. We 
           notice --

           The Fighter moves slightly.

           Mel sees the guys in the heroin room silently standing there, 
           and then turns her eyes back to the Fighter, who remains 
           still. A GRENADE clipped to his belt --

           Mel studies him. His eyes blink. 

                                 CONNOR (OVER COMMS)
                        TOC, we’re gonna need an extra 
                        vehicle for exfil --
           The team spreads out to cover the entry points, and Connor 
           comes into sight of the Fighter. The second wave arrives. 

           SHOUTS -- GUNSHOTS -- CHAOS --

           We see Connor fire a couple shots --

           And then the Fighter starts crawling towards him.

           The battle dies down. Mel watches as the fighter takes the 
           pin out of his grenade and tosses it --

           Even though she knows what’s about to happen, Mel 
           instinctively tries to reach out and stop it --

                                 MEL
                        No --

           The grenade bounces across the floor, lands next to Connor, 
           and  --

                                 CONNOR
                        Fuck --

           BOOM. 

           Connor is tossed into the air as shrapnel rips into him. The 
           realism of the simulation is stark here. We’ve never seen 
           anything quite like this before.

           His torn up body is slumped against a wall. Mel’s frozen in 
           horror. 

           Footsteps in the distance. Growing closer. Then --

           Bryant’s Sim rushes in. Sees the Fighter on the ground. 
           Shoots twice --

           POP POP.

           The Fighter’s body spasms and expires. 

                                 BRYANT (OVER COMMS)
                        Man down! 

           Ellis arrives right as Bryant does. He rushes to check 
           Connor’s body as Bryant radios back to TOC. 

           As the rest of the team piles in, Mel shrinks back as a wave 
           of emotion crashes over her.
           EXT. PORCH - DR. BERENSON’S OFFICE - LATER

           A small outdoor porch just outside of Berenson’s office. Mel 
           leans over the railing. She looks sick. 

           Berenson comes through the glass door with two cans of 
           seltzer. She offers one to Mel. Mel takes it. 

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        You okay? 

           Mel doesn’t respond. 

                                 DR. BERENSON (CONT'D)
                        I know it’s hard. 
                             (nods to the can)
                        Trust me, it’ll help settle you. 

           Mel opens the seltzer up and drinks.

                                 DR. BERENSON (CONT'D)
                        When I found Vic, I didn’t scream. 
                        I didn’t cry. I just... handled it. 
                        The second time -- that was when I 
                        broke down. That’s when I felt it. 

                                 MEL
                        Second time? 
                             (realizing)
                        You’ve done this. 

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        What kind of doctor would I be if I 
                        hadn’t given it a test run? 

           Mel takes a beat, then --

                                 MEL
                        Let me you ask a question in your 
                        capacity as a doctor. Do you think 
                        that fighter could’ve crawled after 
                        being shot twice in the chest? 

           Berenson sighs. 

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        Mel, why are you asking that? 

                                 MEL
                        Because seeing it now, it looks 
                        pretty unlikely.
                                 DR. BERENSON
                             (gently, but firmly)
                        You’re making progress. Don’t throw 
                        that away now. 

                                 MEL
                        I’m not throwing anything away. I’m 
                        just asking a question. 

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        I used to ask myself if I could 
                        have done anything different. Every 
                        day. You can’t move on until you 
                        accept that you did your best. 

           Off Mel, grappling with herself --

           EXT. BOXING GYM - NIGHT

           Mel gets out of her car.

           INT. BOXING GYM - NIGHT

           Mel enters the boxing gym. A LARGE FIGHTER (JORGE) is in the 
           ring pounding on some poor OPPONENT. 

           She sees Bryant in the corner talking to a PATRON. Ignores 
           him and goes straight to the locker room. We see him glance 
           at her from afar. 

           When Mel comes back out she’s dressed to punch. She makes a 
           bee-line for Jorge, a fight on her mind. 

           Before she can get there --

           Bryant steps in front of her. 

                                 BRYANT
                        Hey. 

                                 MEL
                        Later, I’m about to get in the 
                        ring. 

                                 BRYANT
                        Not with him you’re not. 

           His tone is strong, forceful. But Mel doesn’t care. 

                                 MEL
                        I need to fight. 
                                 BRYANT
                        You’re not just looking to fight.

                                 MEL
                        Yes I am. 

                                 BRYANT
                        Then I’ll spar with you. 

           Called her bluff. She nods. 

           They approach the ring.

                                 BRYANT (CONT'D)
                        Alright Jorge. We’re taking over. 

           Jorge gives him a fist bump and exits the ring. 

                                 MEL
                             (aside to Jorge)
                        You get a free pass today. 

                                 JORGE
                        Fuckin’ love to see you try, puta. 

           Bryant and Mel enter. Mel hops up and down. Bryant looks at 
           her as he puts on his gloves.  

                                 BRYANT
                        Y’alright? 

                                 MEL
                        Yeah. Fine. 

                                 BRYANT
                        Gloves up. 

           They approach each other. Mel throws a few punches. Bryant 
           ducks and weaves. 

                                 MEL
                        Hit back. 

                                 BRYANT
                        You still mad at me? 

                                 MEL
                        Cause I asked you to step up and 
                        you didn’t? No, I’m great. 

           She swings and misses again, then executes a quick follow up 
           which lands.
                                 BRYANT
                        Nice hit. Maybe that thing is 
                        helping. 

                                 MEL
                        I don’t need your sarcasm. 

           She throws A FLURRY OF PUNCHES. 

           But Bryant won’t hit back. 

           INT. LOCKER ROOM, BOXING GYM - LATER

           They’re both sweating and taking off their gloves. Gym’s more 
           or less empty by now. 

           On Mel -- struggling with something, she just need to gets it 
           out --

                                 MEL
                        I did it. I watched it happen.

           Bryant looks at her. An awkwardly long silence, then --

                                 BRYANT
                        I told you I don’t wanna talk about 
                        that day, Mel. 

                                 MEL
                        I don’t want to keep running from 
                        it. Do you? 

           Bryant gets up. Puts a hand on her shoulder. Then leaves.

           Mel shakes her head. Down but not out. 

           INT. BETTY FORD CENTER - DAY

           A large welcoming room. Ellis and Mel stand at a window, 
           looking out onto a lawn where --

           Johnny is practicing Tai Chi with a small class of all ages 
           and sizes, led by a young Asian woman. He’s the most into it 
           out of all of them. 

                                 ELLIS
                        Fuckin’ Zen master over here. 

                                 MEL
                        He looks good. 
                                 ELLIS
                        Yeah. As good as you can for a week 
                        in. Let’s see if he can keep it up. 

                                 MEL
                        Baby steps, asshole. 

                                 ELLIS
                        Why’d you wanna come today by the 
                        way? 

                                 MEL
                             (evasive)
                        Just wanted to see how he was 
                        doing. 

           Ellis looks at her questioningly, but accepts it. 

           INT. OUTSIDE THE LOCKER ROOM - BETTY FORD CENTER - LATER

           Johnny comes out of the locker room still in his shorts and 
           with a towel around his neck. 

                                 JOHNNY
                        S’up nerds. 

           They do some quick hugs. 

                                 JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        Just gonna grab some water.

           They walk over to a nearby water dispenser and all pour 
           themselves a small cup. 

                                 ELLIS
                        Hot teacher.

                                 MEL
                        Jesus, Ellis. 

                                 JOHNNY
                        Don’t you dare bro. 

                                 ELLIS
                        Wouldn’t dream of it. 

           He winks at Johnny. 

                                 JOHNNY
                        I’ll kill you. 

                                 MEL
                        How you doin’? 
                                 JOHNNY
                        I’m alright. Sometimes everyone 
                        talks so fuckin’ calm around here I 
                        wanna run screaming for the hills. 
                        But yeah, apparently alright. You? 

                                 MEL
                        Yeah... 
                             (glances at Ellis)
                        I’m good. Program’s okay. I’ve been 
                        thinking I could use another set of 
                        eyes on it. 

                                 ELLIS
                        That’s why you’re here? To try and 
                        get us to join you?

           It’s an accusation.

                                 MEL
                        Hear me out -- 

                                 ELLIS
                        No. Stop asking.

                                 MEL
                        Johnny? 

                                 ELLIS
                        Fuck off Mel, he’s got his own shit 
                        going on. 

           But Johnny’s listening to Mel. 

                                 JOHNNY
                             (slowly)
                        Connor’s death never made sense. 

                                 ELLIS
                        Doesn’t have to make sense. People 
                        get mowed down in the streets of 
                        America every day. We were in 
                        Afghanistan. 

           A pregnant silence. Broken by --

                                 JOHNNY
                        I’m not so sure.  

                                 ELLIS
                             (aggravated)
                        Come on man --
                                 JOHNNY
                             (picking up steam)
                        No. That’s what I’ve been saying 
                        from the start, bro. I killed that 
                        dude. He was dead. How could he 
                        have killed Connor? 

                                 MEL
                        I hear you, Johnny. Go through the 
                        simulation with me. Let’s look at 
                        it.

                                 ELLIS
                             (furious)
                        What the fuck?! He just started 
                        rehab! He doesn’t need you to drag 
                        him off to virtual war --

                                 JOHNNY
                        Stop answering for me! Christ!

           The outburst stops everyone. Johnny looks crazed. Manic. But 
           as quickly as it came, it subsides. 

                                 JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        I’m not your fuckin’ kid. So don’t 
                        treat me like one. 
                             (then)
                        Maybe it’ll help, you know? If I 
                        see it again, maybe I’ll get some 
                        kind of closure. 

                                 ELLIS
                        You’re risking everything. 

                                 JOHNNY
                             (to Mel)
                        Send me the info. 

           He throws a look at Ellis before standing to leave.

                                 ELLIS
                        This is so fucked. 

                                 JOHNNY
                        I’m gonna check out and head home. 
                        Thanks for coming, Mel.  

                                 ELLIS
                        Johnny --

           Johnny leaves. Just Mel and Ellis now. 
                                 ELLIS (CONT'D)
                        You are so fucking selfish. 

                                 MEL
                        He can make his own decisions. 

           Ellis shakes his head and leaves, still furious. 

           INT. BERENSON'S OFFICE - VICTOR CENTER - DAY

           Mel sits in front of Berenson, who shakes her head.

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        You already went through it once. I 
                        don’t see why we you want to add 
                        extra support now.

                                 MEL
                        Why is that an issue?

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        Because it feels like backpedaling. 
                        You are doing so well --

                                 MEL
                        You keep saying that. 

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        It’s true. 

                                 MEL
                        Well it doesn’t feel like I am to 
                        me. And I’m the patient here. I 
                        think this will help, so who are 
                        you to tell me otherwise?

           Berenson sighs.

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        You and the surviving members of 
                        the team left the Navy shortly 
                        after this mission, correct?

                                 MEL
                        Yes... 

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        Why was that? 

                                 MEL
                        That day was a hard thing to come 
                        back from. 
                                 DR. BERENSON
                        And were your lives better after 
                        you left the service? 

           It’s not an attack, but Mel takes it as one. 

                                 MEL
                             (getting aggressive)
                        You’re starting to sound like a 
                        shrink. 

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        I’m just trying to reconcile a 
                        group of people deciding that 
                        distancing was the best method of 
                        coping with a trauma, while at the 
                        same time looking to accept help 
                        from and find solace with those 
                        who, ostensibly, are the most 
                        triggering. 

                                 MEL
                        They’re the only ones who get it. 

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        Or, for some reason, you aren’t 
                        letting each other rebuild. 
                             (then)
                        Mel, you’re doing so well. It is my 
                        professional opinion that having 
                        one of your teammates here won’t 
                        help you. If you do this it might 
                        cause you to revert. You are strong 
                        enough to do this alone.

                                 MEL
                             (resolute)
                        I’m strong enough to do it with 
                        someone else, too. 

           Berenson looks at her. Sizing Mel up. Finally --

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        Okay. 

           INT. BACKYARD - MEL’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON: Mel’s face, smushed in dirt. She gets up. She’s IN 
           THE HOLE.

           Next to her, Connor’s dead body, lying face down. She 
           struggles to keep calm, looks around for an exit. 
           There’s nothing in sight. She goes to feel the walls of the 
           hole. Runs her hands over the dirt. 

           Her hand catches on something --

           The ROPE. She pulls it out of the dirt wall. 

           She tugs on it, it holds tight. 

           She looks up into the darkness, rope in hand --

           INT. MEL’S BEDROOM - LATE

           Middle of the night. Mel’s awake again. A beat as she 
           collects herself. Then lies back down for another restless 
           night. 

           INT. VICTOR CENTER - DAY

           Mel sits in the lobby, leg bouncing. She’s clearly been 
           waiting there for a while. 

           She pulls out her phone, checks it. Nothing. 

           The receptionist manning the front desk calls out to her --

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Are you sure he’s coming?

                                 MEL
                        I texted him the info. He’ll be 
                        here. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Maybe try calling. We have a tight 
                        schedule today. 

           Mel picks up her phone. Calls Johnny’s number. No response. 
           Straight to voicemail. 

           Mel looks to the young woman, who’s staring at her 
           expectantly. Mel shakes her head. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)
                        A lot of people get cold feet. It’s 
                        not uncommon when it’s going to be 
                        their first time. 
                             (then, helpfully)
                        I’ll reschedule you. 

                                 MEL
                        Yeah, thanks. 
           Off Mel, concern building, we cut to --

           EXT. JOHNNY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Mel gets out of her car. Looks up at the house in front of 
           her. 

           It’s completely dark inside. Mel’s brow furrows. 

           EXT. FRONT PORCH - JOHNNY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Mel walks up to the front door and knocks. No answer. She 
           frowns. 

           Peers in through the window, but can’t see anything. 

           She cups her mouth and puts it up to the mail slot --

                                 MEL
                        Johnny?

           Nothing. 

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                        You home?

           Still nothing. 

           Mel circles the house. 

           EXT. BACK OF JOHNNY’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Mel approaches the back door. Tries it. 

           It’s unlocked. 

           She hesitates for a moment. Then opens the door and enters --

           INT. JOHNNY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Mel walks into the living room. Still doesn’t see anything. 

                                 MEL
                        Hello?

           She moves to the kitchen, where --

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                        FUCK!
           It’s Johnny. Slumped over. A rubber hose tie-off on his arm. 
           A spent needle on the floor next to him. 

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                        Johnny --

           She unties his arm and checks his pulse.

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                        Fuck. Fuck. FUCK! 

           Johnny is dead. Mel processes this. Sprints towards the 
           landline next to the fridge. Dials. 

           INT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

           Mel sits across the table from OFFICER PRITZKER (50s, large, 
           sympathetic). Her shoulders are slumped. 

                                 OFFICER PRITZKER
                        Do you know the last time Mr. 
                        Dominguez OD’ed? 

                                 MEL
                             (monotone)
                        A few weeks ago. 

           Officer Pritzker writes that down. 

                                 OFFICER PRITZKER
                        And what were you doing when you 
                        found the body? 

                                 MEL
                        I hadn’t heard from him. He missed 
                        an appointment we had.

                                 OFFICER PRITZKER
                        You walked around the house to the 
                        back door, which was open. You 
                        decided to enter the house? 

                                 MEL
                        Correct. 

                                 OFFICER PRITZKER
                        I’m sorry that I even have to ask 
                        it, but given the circumstances... 
                             (beat)
                        The nature of your relationship was 
                        what exactly?
                                 MEL
                        Just friends. 
                             (defensive)
                        Why? 

           She casts a glance over to the two-way mirror, where Owen 
           might be watching. 

                                 OFFICER PRITZKER
                        Not accusing. Doing my due 
                        diligence. 

           He keeps writing. Then closes his notebook. 

                                 MEL
                        He was doing better. 

                                 OFFICER PRITZKER
                        Mr. Dominguez was?
                             (Mel nods)
                        You said he OD’ed a few weeks ago. 

                                 MEL
                        He did. 

                                 OFFICER PRITZKER
                        Then this case is closed. 

                                 MEL
                        You’re not going to investigate? 

           Officer Pritzker looks at her, surprised. 

                                 OFFICER PRITZKER
                             (obvious)
                        Your friend was a heroin addict, 
                        Mel. 

           He stands. Looks down at her, compassion in his eyes.

                                 OFFICER PRITZKER (CONT'D)
                        I’m sorry. 

           He leaves, as Mel just sits there. Reeling.

           INT. OWEN’S OFFICE - POLICE STATION - LATER

           Mel’s in Owen’s office. Mid-argument. 

                                 MEL
                        I’m telling you, he was fine when I 
                        saw him a few days ago. If you’d 
                        open a case --
                                 OWEN
                        We’re not doing that --

                                 MEL
                        -- maybe you could actually find 
                        out what happened instead of just 
                        guessing --

                                 OWEN
                        -- You found him -- and I’m sorry 
                        to be so blunt, but -- with a 
                        needle sticking out of his arm. 

           This silences Mel. 

                                 OWEN (CONT'D)
                        It sucks, but that’s a hazard of 
                        being an addict.

                                 MEL
                             (quiet)
                        That doesn’t necessarily mean he 
                        OD’d. 

                                 OWEN
                        No, just every other time.

           Mel gives him an angry stare. Then --

                                 MEL
                        What if he was killed.

                                 OWEN
                        I think you know that’s not what 
                        happened here. 

           Mel nods slowly. We can tell she’s holding back. 

                                 OWEN (CONT'D)
                        You should get home, Mel. 

                                 MEL
                        I’m fine. 

           Owen moves towards her.

                                 OWEN
                        It’s hard to save people from 
                        themselves.

           Something about the way he says it...

                                 MEL
                        You mean like me. 
           A long moment passes. Owen doesn’t refute her. Mel brushes 
           past him and exits. The stale air of an unsatisfying ending 
           hangs. 

           INT. MEL’S BAR - NIGHT

           Mel rinses a glass behind the bar. Dunks it in the 
           antibacterial soak. Grabs a towel. Dries it. Flips it back 
           upright. 

           Places it below the keg tap, and pours until it overflows. 
           Suds are still running down the side as she slides it across 
           the bar to --

           Bryant.

           He nods thanks at her. Takes a long swig. Then puts the glass  
           down. 

           He looks like he’s going to say something, but can’t make the 
           words come out. The two of them share a look -- bonded, 
           again, by tragedy.

           They live in silence for a while. Until, finally -- 

                                 MEL
                        Fuck. 

                                 BRYANT
                        Yeah. 
                             (then, studying her)
                        You alright? 

                                 MEL
                        I...

           Considers how far to go. 

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                        He was gonna go through the Victor 
                        program with me. 

           Bryant stares at her. 

                                 BRYANT
                        Is this a guilt trip? 

                                 MEL
                        No. Just trying to figure out if 
                        that had anything to do with what 
                        happened...

           Bryant looks at her with pity.
                                 BRYANT
                        It’s not your fault. 
                             (then)
                        When we got back, and he started 
                        using... I figured it would stop 
                        eventually. We all had our ways of 
                        coping and that was just Johnny’s. 
                        He’d do it until he didn’t need to 
                        anymore. But when it kept dragging 
                        on, no sign of stopping, I just... 

           He trails off. It’s hard to say. 

                                 BRYANT (CONT'D)
                        I expected this, Mel. It’s fucked, 
                        but it’s true. And when I got the 
                        call you wanna know what I felt? It 
                        wasn’t sadness, or anger, or pain. 
                             (ashamed)
                        I felt relief. That he didn’t have 
                        to struggle anymore. 

           Mel doesn’t know how to respond. It’s clear she doesn’t 
           agree, but she can’t argue with her friend. Not now.

                                 MEL
                             (carefully)
                        Don’t you feel like he was getting 
                        better? 

                                 BRYANT
                        He went to rehab. That was a step, 
                        not a recovery. 
                             (pointedly)
                        You know that as well as anyone. 

           Coming from someone else, that could’ve made Mel mad. Not 
           Bryant. From him, it’s just rings true. 

                                 BRYANT (CONT'D)
                        We should do something for him 
                        tomorrow. I’ll get the guys there. 

           Mel nods. Bryant stands. 

                                 BRYANT (CONT'D)
                        Sorry I have to go so soon. Gotta 
                        get Dee up for school tomorrow. 

                                 MEL
                        It’s okay. 

           He leaves Mel there. Washing glasses. More unsure of herself 
           than before. 
           EXT. FORT ROSECRANS CEMETERY - DAY

           It’s a beautiful sunny morning. Mel, Ellis, Price and Bryant 
           all crowd the top of a small hill, as the soft roar of the 
           Pacific Ocean provides background white noise.

                                 BRYANT
                        To our boy. 

           Ellis, Price, and Mel watch as Bryant takes a homemade marker 
           (two small sticks taped together in the shape of a cross), 
           and drives it into the ground next to Connor’s headstone. 

           Price hands a beer to each of them, cracks open two others, 
           places one in front of Connor’s tombstone and another in 
           front of Johnny’s cross. 

           They sink into lawn chairs, arrayed in a semi-circle at the 
           foot of the shrine. 

                                 BRYANT (CONT'D)
                        Anyone wanna say a few words?

                                 PRICE
                        Johnny had something every little 
                        boy dreams of growing up. 
                             (dramatic pause)
                        He had a hell of a dick -- 

           Ellis laughs derisively, sadly. 

                                 PRICE (CONT'D)
                        -- A serious hog. A real “third 
                        leg.” For that, and that alone, he 
                        will be missed.

           Ellis’ laughter fades out. And then there’s silence. Just the 
           waves lapping at the shore in the distance. Everyone goes 
           into their own world. 

           When Mel finally looks up she sees Ellis, gazing off. 

                                 MEL
                        You alright?

           Ellis looks at her, some hostility in his voice. 

                                 ELLIS
                        Just always thought he had more 
                        fight. 

                                 MEL
                        You don’t think he was getting 
                        better? 
                                 ELLIS
                        Are you kidding me?

                                 MEL
                        You were with me. You saw. He 
                        looked good.

                                 ELLIS
                        I saw him agree to do that fucking 
                        program with you. If that’s not 
                        evidence he was still unwell, I 
                        don’t know what is.

                                 BRYANT
                        Guys, come on. 

           He gestures towards the makeshift memorial. 

                                 BRYANT (CONT'D)
                        Some respect. Please. 

                                 ELLIS
                        You know what? Maybe you getting 
                        him thinking about that day again 
                        is what sent him back. That’s what 
                        I think.

           Mel throws the rest of her half-drunk beer at Ellis’ head. He 
           ducks it and snarls at her.

                                 ELLIS (CONT'D)
                        Price said the same thing. 
                             (to Price)
                        Right?

                                 BRYANT
                        Guys --

                                 MEL
                             (to Bryant)
                        Oh now you’re stepping up for me --

                                 PRICE
                        Why’d you ask him to do it, Mel? He 
                        clearly wasn’t right.

                                 MEL
                             (angry now)
                        I needed someone to help me and 
                        Johnny was the only one who would. 

                                 ELLIS
                             (vitriolic)
                        It’s your fault. 
                                 BRYANT
                             (standing)
                        That’s out of line, Ellis --

                                 MEL
                        Fuck you all. I’m out.

           Mel rises, trying to remain calm. 

                                 BRYANT
                        Mel...

           He gets up to follow her. 

                                 MEL
                        Don’t. 

           Bryant freezes. Mel walks away. 

           EXT. MEL’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Mel stands next to her car, shaking. She looks like she’s 
           being mentally pulled apart. 

           INT. BOXING GYM - LATER

           Mel whips into the gym in a frenzy. 

           INT. HEAVY BAG CORNER - BOXING GYM - MOMENTS LATER

           Mel approaches a hanging bag. 

           Grimaces. Takes a step back and starts getting into it 
           without GLOVES. 

           She goes until her knuckles are raw and starting to bleed. 
           She sinks into the pain. Then looks around, looking for 
           something worse, spots --

           JORGE. He’s working combinations with A PARTNER (20s) while 
           his TRAINER (FRANK) watches from the sidelines.   

                                 FRANK 
                        That’s it Jorge, lay into his right 
                        side --

                                 MEL
                        Let me spar with him. 

           Mel approaches Frank. He doesn’t look her way.
                                 FRANK
                             (ignoring her)
                        Jorge! Stop going easy, give him 
                        the goods!

           Mel brushes past Frank, and swings herself into the ring, as 
           Jorge and his sparring partner keep at it.

                                 FRANK (CONT'D)
                        Jesus, Mel!

           Jorge and his sparring partner stop. Jorge grins. 

                                 JORGE
                        This’ll be good. 

           Jorge nods to Frank, then gestures at his sparring partner to 
           leave the ring.

           Mel squares up at Jorge, who looks down at her hands. Then 
           back up at Mel.

                                 JORGE (CONT'D)
                        You want gloves first? 

           Mel nods. Frank throws her a pair.

           Mel suits up as Jorge’s sparring partner exits. 

           It’s just her and Jorge now. He dances, light feet, across 
           from her. Mel mirrors. Cracks her neck. Then --

           She SWINGS at him. Twice --

           Pfft. Pfft. He absorbs both on the gloves. Doesn’t hit back. 

           She steps back, but he doesn’t advance. Just keeps dancing. 
           He’s enjoying this. Mel charges, frustrated --

           Whhp. She swings a haymaker and completely misses as he ducks 
           under it and retreats.

           He offers an easy left-handed jab --

           Pfft. Mel meets it with her left and then SWINGS her right. 
           Connects with his head --

           THUMP.

           He steps back. Shakes it off, completely unfazed. She isn’t 
           big enough to do real damage. 

           He sets back on the balls of his feet. Swaying. Not moving 
           closer. Mel baits him --
                                 MEL
                        Just as soft as I thought. 

           Jorge doesn't respond. Takes a step forward. Then offers a 
           lighting quick series of jabs --

           Pfft, pfft, pfft. Mel catches all three on her gloves. 

           He starts unloading on her. She’s taking body blow after body 
           blow but she’s still standing. 

           Then she KNEES him in the nuts. 

                                 JORGE
                        The fuck!

           That does it. Jorge is pissed now. 

           Thump. Pfft. Thump. Mel blocks some. Takes others. She’s 
           getting beat up, but she doesn’t seem to care. This pain is 
           what she wants.

           She lands some punches back on him after the onslaught, and 
           then moves a little too close to him --

           He rears back for a haymaker --

           She’s tired, her guard’s low, and his punch goes right into --

           The side of her head.

           EVERYTHING GOES BLACK. 

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER

           Beep. Beep. Beep. 

           Mel slowly opens her eyes. 

           Comes to. Takes in her surroundings. 

           She’s in a hospital room. Hooked up to a heart rate monitor. 
           A black eye where she took the punch. She turns towards the 
           door to see --

           Bryant sitting in the chair next to her. 

                                 MEL
                             (groans)
                        How long was I out. 
                                 BRYANT
                        Couple of hours. Frank called me 
                        when you went down. 

                                 MEL
                        That snitch. 

                                 BRYANT
                        Mel...

           She looks away. Can’t meet his eyes.

                                 BRYANT (CONT'D)
                        I know what you were doing. Don’t 
                        treat me like I’m someone else.  

           She stands. Begins taking the IV out of her arm. 

                                 BRYANT (CONT'D)
                        Mel, stop. You have a concussion. 

                                 MEL
                        It ain’t my first. 

           Bryant gently pushes her back down. She lets him. 

                                 BRYANT
                        You need to stop hurting yourself.

           Mel takes a deep breath. Then --

                                 MEL
                        I know. 

           She reaches into her pocket. Pulls out her phone. Scans 
           through her texts. Only message is from Owen. She doesn’t 
           even bother opening it. 

           She puts the phone down. Takes a breath, and --

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                        Help me up. 

           Bryant does. 

           INT. LOBBY - HOSPITAL - MINUTES LATER

           Mel checks out of the hospital as Bryant stands nearby. The 
           NURSE looks at her with concern. 

                                 NURSE
                        Are you sure you’re okay? 
           Mel gives her a halfhearted shrug and then walks over to 
           Bryant. 

           She looks demolished. Bryant watches her, searching for 
           something to say. Finally --

                                 BRYANT
                        I’ll do it. 

           Mel looks up. 

                                 MEL
                        What?

                                 BRYANT
                        The program. I’ll do it with you. 

                                 MEL
                        ...You will? 
                             (gratefully)
                        You’ll see -- the simulation is 
                        off. You can help back me up. 

           Bryant shakes his head.

                                 BRYANT
                        That’s not why I’m doing it. 
                             (then)
                        You need to get better. If this is 
                        what you want, what you think you 
                        need -- maybe if I -- maybe this 
                        can make a difference. After what 
                        happened to Johnny...

           A long pregnant pauses before Bryant admits --

                                 BRYANT (CONT'D)
                        I’m worried about you.

           Mel gives him a hug. 

                                 MEL
                        Thanks. 

           INT. VR SPACE - VICTOR CENTER - DAY

           Mel and Bryant are standing across from each other, getting 
           outfitted by ASSISTANTS. Bryant looks suspiciously at the 
           equipment as they look to put it over his head. 

                                 MEL
                        It doesn’t hurt. 
                                 BRYANT
                        Great. 

           But it’s clear he’s still apprehensive. 

           EXT. THE HOUSE - AFGHANISTAN - NIGHT

           Mel stands outside the house like usual, only now she’s 
           flanked by Bryant. 

           Bryant looks around, getting his bearings. He bounces 
           nervously, this is clearly triggering him. Mel watches. 
           Studies him. 

                                 MEL
                             (reassuringly)
                        It’s gonna be okay. 

                                 BRYANT
                             (gruff)
                        I’m fine. I’m here for you, 
                        remember? 

           The team arrives at the front door. Bryant’s eyes go wide at 
           the sight of Connor. So real. 

           The team lines up outside the house. They set a breaching 
           charge on the door. Connor gives the signal and the handle 
           explodes. Price’s Sim darts through the doorway. 

                                 MEL
                             (to Bryant)
                        Ellis was first in, right? I’ve 
                        been saying that --

                                 BRYANT
                        Looks right to me.

                                 MEL
                        What? Are you sure? 

                                 BRYANT
                        I was behind him. 

           Mel shakes it off. She and Bryant follow Price’s Sim into the 
           house. 

           The team tosses grenades in. Mel watches Bryant.

                                 MEL
                        Did we really toss that many right 
                        on breach?
                                 BRYANT
                        I -- I think so? 

                                 MEL
                        We didn’t save any --

                                 BRYANT
                        No -- no, this seems right. 

           Mel’s frowning now. Wrong again. 

           The team finishes clearing the house. They all enter the 
           heroin/money room. 

           Bryant and Mel glance at each other --

           Then quickly drop eye contact. 

           They walk into the room where the guys wait silently. For a 
           beat Bryant stands there, scanning. Almost as if he’s 
           analyzing the room.

           Then Mel calls out --

                                 MEL
                        Over here.

           Bryant follows her to a side room. She points at the ISIS 
           fighter on the ground. 

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                        Watch this. 

                                 CONNOR (OVER COMMS)
                        TOC, we’re gonna need an extra 
                        vehicle for exfil --

           The team spreads out to cover the entry points. After a 
           moment of waiting, the action begins --

           THE SHOUTS -- THE GUNSHOTS -- THE CHAOS --

           We see Connor fire a couple shots, and the ISIS fighter 
           starts to crawl towards him. 

                                 MEL
                        Watch!

                                 BRYANT
                        I am.

           Mel and Bryant watch the fighter as he inches forward. 
           Crawling. Finally reaches the doorway to Connor as the 
           fighting subsides, pulls the pin, and --
           CLINK CLINK. 

                                 CONNOR
                        Fuck --

           BOOM.

           Connor’s ripped apart. Bryant turns away. 

                                 BRYANT
                        Jesus. 

           Mel seizes her moment. Gets in front of Bryant.

                                 MEL
                        I told you this shit looked weird. 
                        Is it even possible that no one 
                        noticed he was alive? How many of 
                        those ISIS guys even have grenades 
                        anyway --

                                 BRYANT
                        Why does this matter, Mel? 

           Mel looks at him in disbelief. 

                                 MEL
                        Bryant. Because if it wasn’t the 
                        ISIS guy...   

                                 BRYANT
                        Don’t. 

                                 MEL
                        He wouldn’t have had a grenade. We 
                        would have --

                                 BRYANT
                             (quiet)
                        This isn’t helping you. I’m 
                        leaving. 

                                 MEL
                        It doesn’t make sense!

                                 BRYANT
                             (furious)
                        It doesn’t have to. It was WAR. 
                        That fighter was alive. I should 
                        know -- I’m the one who had to 
                        shoot him. Maybe if you weren’t 
                        fucking Connor, you’d be able to 
                        see this clearly --
           Mel takes a SWING at Bryant -- but in the simulation, her 
           fist passes THROUGH him, and his avatar rearranges itself 
           afterwards. Bryant gives an angry snort. 

                                 BRYANT (CONT'D)
                        Try that in real life.

           Suddenly everything disappears as the sim shuts down. 

           INT. VR SPACE - VICTOR CENTER - CONTINUOUS

           Mel comes out of the simulation as Bryant makes his way 
           towards the door. 

                                 MEL
                        You fucking idiot! Why can’t you 
                        admit that I’m right --

           She charges after him as Berenson and a couple of assistants 
           rush into the VR space. The assistants get between Mel and 
           Bryant. 

                                 BRYANT
                             (gestures around)
                        This is making you crazy.

           Mel’s anger is replaced by desperation.

                                 MEL
                        Let me show you again. If you see 
                        it another time, you’ll realize --

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        STOP.
                             (to Bryant)
                        I’m so sorry.

           Berenson wheels on Mel in a fury.

                                 DR. BERENSON (CONT'D)
                        This was a terrible idea. I should 
                        have trusted myself.
                             (back to Bryant)
                        Please go. 

           Bryant exits, leaving Mel alone with the assistants and a 
           furious Berenson.

                                 DR. BERENSON (CONT'D)
                        We need to talk. 

           Berenson signals the assistants out of the room. They leave. 
           Then Berenson gestures for Mel to take a seat.
                                 DR. BERENSON (CONT'D)
                        Sit.

                                 MEL
                        No. 

           They stare daggers at each other.

                                 BERENSON
                        You know what...

           Berenson takes a beat, rubs her temples. Then looks back up 
           at Mel. 

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        The point of this program is for 
                        you to overcome trauma by 
                        understanding it. By breaking it’s 
                        power over your life.

                                 MEL
                        That’s what I’m trying to do.

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        No, you keep trying to “solve” your 
                        experience... as though you’ll be 
                        able to undo what happened. 
                             (then)
                        But you can’t. Connor will always 
                        have died that day. You fail to see 
                        that.
                             (swallows, then)
                        You’ve had ample chances to take 
                        this process seriously, but you 
                        continue to ignore them. To flout 
                        the spirit of the program. I can’t 
                        have that anymore. 

                                 MEL
                        So what now? 

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        It’s clear that your inability to 
                        fully participate is hurting you. 
                        You’re trying to rewrite the past -- 

                                 MEL
                        I’m not trying to rewrite the past, 
                        I’m trying to get to the truth --

                                 DR. BERENSON
                             (ignoring her)
                        -- And I have no reason to believe 
                        that’s going to change. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 DR. BERENSON (CONT'D)
                                 DR. BERENSON (CONT'D)
                        I’m sending a report to the judge 
                        this week, recommending you do the 
                        time. I’m sorry.

           Mel’s taken aback.

                                 MEL
                        But I’m still in the program.

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        Not anymore. 

           It hits Mel like a ton of bricks. But she doesn’t have time 
           to waste. She rushes out. 

           EXT. PARKING LOT - VICTOR CENTER - LATER

           Mel runs after Bryant. Reaches him before he makes it to his 
           car --

                                 MEL
                        Hey!

                                 BRYANT
                        Fuck off. 

                                 MEL
                        It was Ellis. 

           Bryant stops. Slowly turns. 

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                        You know it didn’t happen like they 
                        just showed us in there. 

                                 BRYANT
                        So you’re accusing Ellis of killing 
                        our brother.

                                 MEL
                        Ellis and Connor hated each other. 
                        When Connor died, Ellis was first 
                        one in the room. He was making sure 
                        Connor was dead --

                                 BRYANT
                             (you’re crazy)
                        He was checking on his friend. 

                                 MEL
                        I don’t think so --
                                 BRYANT
                        Besides. Ellis used his grenades 
                        during the breach. We all did. You 
                        saw what they just showed --

                                 MEL
                        Fuck what they showed. If Ellis was 
                        first in, he’d be setting 
                        perimeter, not throwing frags. You 
                        know that.
                             (then, desperate)
                        Bryant, you have to hear me.

                                 BRYANT
                        I hear you. That’s the problem.

           Bryant opens his car door. 

                                 BRYANT (CONT'D)
                        I knew you were fucked up. I didn’t 
                        realize you were a lost cause. 

           He slams the door and drives off. Mel stands there, 
           destroyed. 

           INT. MEL’S HOUSE - LATER

           Mel lies in bed. On her bedside table we see her phone. 

           It’s buzzing (Owen) but she doesn’t even look at it. Just 
           ignores it and turns the other way. 

           INT. BEDROOM - MEL’S HOUSE - LATER

           Mel’s lying there. It’s dark. She hasn’t moved in forever. 
           From downstairs, we hear the front door open. 

           The sound of footsteps coming up the stairs. Mel doesn’t 
           react. The person comes to a stop right outside of her door. 
           A moment of pause -- 

           Then the door opens. Light from the hallway floods in. 

           Owen stands alone. Looking at Mel’s back. He doesn’t speak. 
           Just waits. Eventually Mel speaks.

                                 MEL
                        Guess you heard. 

                                 OWEN
                        Yup. 
           Nothing else. Both waiting for the other one to offer 
           something. Owen breaks first --

                                 OWEN (CONT'D)
                        I shouldn’t be surprised. But 
                        somehow I am. 
                             (then)
                        I always thought you’d get better. 

                                 MEL
                             (small)
                        No fixing crazy. 

           Owen doesn’t argue.

                                 OWEN
                        They need you at the courthouse by 
                        Saturday. I told them you’d turn 
                        yourself in. 

           He backs out of the room. 

                                 OWEN (CONT'D)
                        Open or closed?

                                 MEL
                        I don’t care.

           He closes the door and Mel is once again bathed in darkness.

           INT. BACKYARD - MEL’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The backyard of her nightmares. Mel stands over the edge of 
           the hole, sweating. She’s just climbed out. 

           She breathes for a moment. But then hears the SOUND OF THE 
           FUSE.

           She looks in the distance, and, as before, the rope is on 
           fire. Lit. Moving her way.

           But she doesn’t run. She just sits there. She’s tired. It’s 
           almost reached her. 

           She faces it, closes her eyes, and -- everything goes WHITE. 

           INT. DINING ROOM - MEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The next day. Mel sits at the table. Owen brings her a plate 
           of chicken parm that he cooked. 
           He quietly sits next to her with his own plate. Their phones 
           on the table. They start eating. Silence as they chew. 
           Finally --

                                 OWEN
                        You’re going away for a long time. 
                        Where does that leave us? 

                                 MEL
                        I don’t know. 

                                 OWEN
                        What do you want? 

                                 MEL
                        What do you want? 

           Neither of them knows what to say. They keep eating.

           His phone BUZZES. Mel glances at it. Her eyes go wide --

           ON THE SCREEN: JOHNNY DOMINGUEZ / AUTOPSY... 

           Owen quickly clicks off the phone and pockets it. 

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                        What was that? 

                                 OWEN
                        Nothing. 

           His tone is firm. She doesn’t press. But when Owen tucks back 
           into his food, Mel’s eyes linger on his pocket.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MEL’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Owen lies passed out on the couch. Mel enters the room. 

           She sneaks silently to where Owen’s pants lie on the ground. 
           Riffles through his pockets. Finds nothing. She looks around 
           the room, searching for --

           His phone. She spots it lying on the coffee table in front of 
           the couch. 

           She approaches. Grabs it. Glances at Owen before typing in 
           his passcode. She searches through his texts for a moment. 
           Scanning. Finally she zeroes in on something. 

           She starts reading. For a moment, she’s in shock, but then --

           She KICKS the couch. Owen groggily wakes -- 
                                 OWEN
                        What...?

                                 MEL
                             (reading)
                        “Slight contusion on the lower 
                        mandible, likely sustained within 
                        24 hours of death --”

                                 OWEN
                        What are you doing with my phone?

                                 MEL
                        This is Johnny’s fucking autopsy 
                        report --

                                 OWEN
                        It’s not your business -- 

                                 MEL
                        Of course it is! Owen, this shows 
                        that Johnny didn’t OD --

                                 OWEN
                        No it doesn’t.

           He sits up slowly. 

                                 OWEN (CONT'D)
                        This is why I didn’t tell you -- 
                        this report doesn’t prove shit, but 
                        I knew you’d treat it like it did. 

                                 MEL
                        It’s pretty fucking convincing. 

                                 OWEN
                        Only for someone who’s already 
                        convinced. 

           Owen stands.

                                 MEL
                        Owen, you gotta trust me --

                                 OWEN
                             (re: phone)
                        Oh yeah? Like you trust me?

           He RIPS his phone out of her hands. 

                                 MEL
                        That’s not fair --
                                 OWEN
                        Fair?!

           Owen explodes --

                                 OWEN (CONT'D)
                        Fuck you, fair! I’ve been patient 
                        with you. Ever since you got back I 
                        really have. But your affair --

                                 MEL
                        This isn’t about Connor.

                                 OWEN
                        Of course it is.
                             (then)
                        You can’t let him go. 

           Mel doesn’t argue. Owen’s right. Then again, quieter --

                                 OWEN (CONT'D)
                        You can’t let him go. 
                             (beat)
                        That’s exactly what got you here in 
                        the first place. It’s why you’re 
                        going to jail for ten years.
                             (almost breaks down, then)
                        Just go to bed.

           Owen lies back down on the couch. Closes his eyes. We stay 
           with Mel. Her eyes stare at his phone. Something’s been 
           awakened inside of her. 

           The determination in her eyes is the last thing we see before 
           we cut to --

           EXT. MEL’S BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Mel’s on the phone as she crosses her backyard --

                                 MEL
                             (into the phone)
                        Hey. I don’t care if you believe me 
                        or not. I’m going to prove I was 
                        right. Stay away from Ellis 
                        until... just stay away from him. 

           She hangs up as she approaches her shed. Opens it. Grabs a 
           shovel from the back wall, never pausing to look at the 
           memories of her time with the team. 
           She heads straight back to the middle of the yard. To the 
           spot of her nightmares. With the shovel in hand she steps to 
           the spot and begins to dig. 

           Methodically, unrelentingly, she goes. She digs and digs and 
           digs until finally --

           Her shovel connects with something. 

           She gets down on her knees. Starts clearing dirt by hand. 
           Digging like a dog so as not to wreck what she’s unearthing.  

           Finally she’s fully excavated it. Pulls it out, revealing -- 

           A DUFFEL BAG. 

           Large. Standard Navy issue. Camouflage colors. 

           Filled with something. 

           Mel picks it up. It’s heavy. She slings the strap over her 
           shoulder and stands there for a beat. Feeling the weight. 

           Then she heads towards her house, leaving a massive open hole 
           in her backyard.  

           INT. MEL’S CAR - VICTOR CENTER PARKING LOT - MORNING

           A PHONE ALARM GOES OFF. Mel jolts awake in her car in the 
           middle of the VICTOR Center parking lot. She takes her phone, 
           shuts off the alarm, and takes a moment to get her bearings. 

           She grabs the duffel from the passenger side seat and exits 
           the car, walking in the direction of the building. 

           INT. DR. BERENSON'S OFFICE - VICTOR CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

           Mel is led into Berenson’s office by an assistant. Berenson 
           doesn’t look up from her computer screen.

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        Last stop before you report?

           The aide leaves. Mel places the duffel bag on the table. 
           Berenson looks at the duffel -- covered in dirt.  

                                 DR. BERENSON (CONT'D)
                             (wary)
                        What’s that.
                                 MEL
                        You didn’t believe our AARs could 
                        be wrong but I know they are.

           The two of them square off. 

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                        I’m going to tell you what happened 
                        in that house. 

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        I know what happened. We’ve shown 
                        it to you over and over again.

                                 MEL
                        I mean what really happened.

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        I’m not doing this again, Mel. 
                        Leave.

                                 MEL
                        You don’t have the whole story.

           Mel looks to the bag.

                                 DR. BERENSON
                             (exasperated)
                        Then enlighten me.

           Mel grabs the zipper, rips the bag open and reveals --

           A SHITLOAD OF HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS. 

           Berenson’s eyes scan the bag in shock --

                                 DR. BERENSON (CONT'D)
                        How much --

                                 MEL
                        2.6 million exactly.

           Berenson is confused. 

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                        I know our AARs aren’t true because 
                        I lied in mine.

           Berenson looks up to her.

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                        All of us said we found 2 million 
                        dollars in that house. That’s not 
                        true. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                             (beat)
                        We found 15 million. 

           Berenson’s eyebrows raise -- holy shit.

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                        Everyone wanted to split it, except 
                        for Connor. He said he’d turn us in 
                        as soon as we got back to base if 
                        we did. No one was happy about it, 
                        but he won out...

           She trails off. 

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                        I don’t think some random ISIS 
                        fighter killed Connor. 

           She exhales deeply. 

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                        Ellis did it. So that we could take 
                        that money. 
                             (convinced)
                        He must have.

           A huge moment of catharsis. 

                                 DR. BERENSON
                             (slowly)
                        What happened after Connor went 
                        down?

                                 MEL
                        I ran into the room. Ellis was 
                        already there, checking on him. 
                        Price, Bryant and Johnny were 
                        standing next to the ISIS fighter.
                             (struggles to admit...)
                        I’m not sure any of us believed 
                        that fighter killed Connor, but --
                             (steadies herself)
                        But everyone agreed that if he was 
                        already dead, no one was going to 
                        report us. 

           Berenson processes. 

           She sees something in Mel’s eyes -- the beginnings of 
           acceptance.

           Berenson stands. A poignant beat, then --
                                 DR. BERENSON
                        What do you want me to do? 

                                 MEL
                        Let me go through the simulation 
                        again. One last time. I’ll tell you 
                        what to change. 

           Berenson nods.

           Off Mel, scared but determined --

           INT. HOUSE - AFGHANISTAN - LATER

           Mel is back in the simulation. 

           The door flies open and the guys’s avatars charge in. They 
           clear the house in the exact way as always --

           POP POP.

           Ellis is first in. Then Bryant. 

           Johnny, Price and Connor are last in. They’re the only ones 
           who toss their grenades into the next room.

           A couple of explosions (not the same cacophony without Ellis 
           and Bryant’s grenades) and the guys continue.

           Mel follows Johnny. He SHOOTS the ISIS Fighter. This time, 
           the fighter drops and stays there. Dead.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Clear!

           Mel looks at the dead body on the ground. No grenade clipped 
           to his belt.

           Mel continues to follow her Sim into the main room where 
           there’s now --

           Mountains of cash. 15 million dollars worth.

           A sharp intake of breath. This is matching Mel’s memory.

           The Sims stand around, wordlessly arguing. 

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        Since we don’t have the audio, this 
                        is the best I can do --

                                 MEL
                        It’s fine. I remember...
           CLOSE ON: Mel stares at them, going back --

           And as we slowly pan back to the scene --

           We’re back on the day. Her memory.

           A FURIOUS CONNOR, center of the room --

                                 CONNOR
                        We’re not keeping any of it. 

                                 ELLIS
                        Do you know how much we get paid 
                        man? 

           Bryant pulls Connor aside. Almost pleading. 

                                 BRYANT
                        I have a one year old. Parisa needs 
                        me at home. I need this. We need 
                        this. 

                                 JOHNNY
                        The government don’t need this.

           Ellis steps in front of Connor.

                                 ELLIS
                        No one’s ever gonna know.

           And we pan back to Mel --

           BACK IN THE SIMULATION. 

           The Sims’ argument ends. Connor’s familiar line breaks the 
           silence -- 

                                 CONNOR (OVER COMMS)
                        TOC, we’re gonna need an extra 
                        vehicle for exfil --

           All the Sims go to their respective rooms to set a perimeter. 
           Mel’s own Sim is about to leave the room. Unaware that her 
           life is about to fracture. 

           Mel wants to warn her Sim -- to comfort her Sim -- but 
           instead --

           Mel follows Ellis -- 

           Who heads straight after Connor, in silent pursuit. 

           Suddenly Mel cocks her eyebrows --
                                 MEL
                        That’s not right.

           The simulation pauses.

                                 DR. BERENSON (V.O.)
                        How?

                                 MEL
                        Ellis didn’t follow Connor. At 
                        least... not at first. I saw him 
                        leave the money room in the other 
                        direction. Run it again.

           The simulation resets to the argument in the money room. 
           Pauses. 

           A moment as Berenson codes a new simulation, and then --

           It resumes. All the guys finish arguing and go off to their 
           respective rooms. Mel again follows Ellis, who leaves in his 
           original direction. 

           Ellis sets up by a back window of the house. The second wave 
           of enemies arrive and the fighting starts. -- 

           POP POP --

           Ellis repels a few oncoming fighters. As soon as the assault 
           slows down, Ellis TAKES OFF -- sprinting through the room 
           next to his, taking a shortcut to Connor’s room, but -- 

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                        Pause!

           Ellis stops, mid sprint, and we realize --

           He’s running through the room where MEL’S SIM is.

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                        He couldn’t have gone this way. I 
                        would have seen him.

                                 DR. BERENSON (V.O.)
                        Well then something’s wrong with 
                        your theory. The only way he can 
                        get from his position to Connor’s 
                        fast enough to toss that grenade is 
                        if he takes a shortcut through your 
                        room.

                                 MEL
                        That doesn’t make sense... 
                                 DR. BERENSON (V.O.)
                        I’m sorry, that’s what the reality 
                        is based on where Connor died. 
                        Either Ellis was behind him when he 
                        left the money room, or you’re 
                        wrong. 

           “Behind him.” The words echo in Mel’s mind as she stares at 
           the grenade clipped to Ellis’ belt. Suddenly --

           She jumps up. 

                                 MEL
                        Go back to the breach. 

                                 DR. BERENSON (V.O.)
                        What?

                                 MEL
                        The start. Rewind.  

           Berenson does. 

           Mel’s back at the entrance. And --

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                        Play it.

           Berenson obliges. The door flies off its hinges. Ellis storms 
           in, followed by Bryant.

           As Mel looks at him, she realizes --

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                        Bryant was second in.

                                 DR. BERENSON 
                        So?

                                 MEL
                        So he didn’t toss his grenade 
                        either. 

           The simulation continues as Mel stays close to Bryant. 

           After the argument in the money room, Mel follows Bryant to 
           his room. It’s right next to Connor’s.

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                        Berenson?

                                 DR. BERENSON (V.O.)
                        I’m doing it. 
           The world pauses. Berenson tinkers. Finally --

                                 DR. BERENSON (V.O.)
                        Ready.

                                 MEL
                        Show me. 

           Mel waits with Bryant as --

                                 CONNOR (OVER COMMS)
                        TOC, we’re gonna need an extra 
                        vehicle for exfil --

           Bryant stands at the window. The second wave arrives. The 
           fighting starts. Mel watches as Bryant rebuffs the enemy’s 
           advance, and then, as the fighting ends --

           He takes a look at Connor through an open door. Stares at 
           him, as if deliberating. Weighing something heavy.  

           Then Bryant takes out a grenade from his belt. Takes a step 
           towards the door. Sets the grenade. And finally, lobs it 
           towards Connor --

           Clink. Clink.

           Connor’s Sim has time to turn around at the sound.

                                 CONNOR (CONT'D)
                        Fuck --

           BOOM.

           The timing is perfect. 

           Mel inhales sharply. 

           It was Bryant. 

           INT. VR SPACE - VICTOR CENTER - CONTINUOUS

           Mel’s comes out of the simulation. Takes off the equipment as 
           Berenson enters.

           They stare at each other for a beat.

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        What are you going to do?

                                 MEL
                        Go to the cops. 
                                 DR. BERENSON
                        If you turn him in, you’ll have to 
                        admit what you did. 
                             (beat)
                        You’ll be confessing to a war 
                        crime.

           Mel starts moving towards the door. 

                                 MEL
                        I know. 

           EXT. PARKING LOT - LATER

           Mel walks out of the VICTOR center with the duffel bag in 
           tow. She gets to her car, pops the trunk. Deposits the bag in 
           it. Closes the trunk. 

           And suddenly freezes. 

                                 MEL
                        Bryant?

           She turns around slowly to see Bryant, gun pointed right at 
           her stomach. 

                                 BRYANT
                        Get in the car.

           INT. MEL’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Mel gets in the front seat. Bryant gets in the back. He 
           levels his gun at her head. 

                                 BRYANT
                        Drive.

           Mel does as she’s told. In silence, they exit the parking 
           lot. 

                                 MEL
                        What happened to Johnny? 

           He doesn’t answer, just says --

                                 BRYANT
                        Left up here. 

           Mel takes the left. They drive for a long while until --
                                 BRYANT (CONT'D)
                        Right at that light. Then in about 
                        six miles, you’ll pull off. I’ll 
                        let you know where. 

           Mel looks at the surroundings. Heading towards the National 
           Forest. 

                                 MEL
                        This is where you guys go camping.

                                 BRYANT
                        You can’t make me feel guilty about 
                        this. 

           Mel keeps driving. But something’s clearly eating at Bryant. 
           He needs her to understand...

                                 BRYANT (CONT'D)
                        I did it for all of us. 

                                 MEL
                        Don’t lump us in with you. We’re 
                        not the same. 

                                 BRYANT
                        Yeah we are. 

                                 MEL
                        We never knew you killed him. 

                                 BRYANT
                        But once he was dead, you all took 
                        advantage of it just like me.
                             (beat)
                        I gave you the opportunity. Not my 
                        fault if guilt got in the way of 
                        you living a good life. 

           Mel grips the steering wheel tight. Bryant isn’t looking at 
           her. 

                                 MEL
                        You have a family.

                                 BRYANT
                        Because of this. That money saved 
                        my family. 
                             (pained)
                        We were on the ropes. When I was 
                        away, Parisa was too scared to pick 
                        up the phone. Always waiting for 
                        that call. Then when I was home she 
                        blamed me for leaving.

                        For going back. And I get it. 
                             (beat)
                        This money allowed me to get out. 
                        It’s the only reason my life is 
                        worth living right now. 

           Mel looks at Bryant in the rearview mirror. He still can’t 
           meet her gaze.

                                 MEL
                        So you’re just gonna kill me?

                                 BRYANT
                        I’ll do anything to protect the 
                        life I’ve built. 

           Mel sees a massive pine tree up ahead. Glances back at Bryant 
           in the rearview --

           He’s not looking. Suddenly --

           MEL RUNS OFF THE ROAD AND STRAIGHT INTO THE FUCKING TREE. 

           THUMP. CRASH.

           Her seatbelt holds her in place, but Bryant lurches past her, 
           smashing his head on the dashboard. 

           A moment of silence. Mel looks dead. But finally --

           She jolts up. She sits upright. Then starts frantically 
           undoing her seatbelt. She sees Bryant next to her. Unmoving. 

           She scrambles out the door and onto --

           EXT. SIDE OF THE ROAD - FOREST - CONTINUOUS

           Mel falls out of the car. 

           Starts crawling away from the wreck. But then, from behind 
           her, she hears -- 

           The passenger door open. Bryant falls out. She looks at him 
           through the gap between the car and the ground. 

           She sees blood drip from his head onto his face, as she MEETS 
           HIS EYES. 

           Mel starts to scramble away, but Bryant follows. Gives chase. 
           He reaches her. Grabs her foot. Pulls her towards him. 

           Both of them are panting. Unable to fully move, but fighting 
           for their lives. 
           Bryant pulls back and CLOCKS Mel in the face. TEETH FLY OUT. 
           He keeps hitting her, somehow she’s still conscious and 
           trying to fight back --

           He could kill her, one or two more punches might do it --

           But she grabs a SHARP ROCK next to her and HOOKS it across 
           his face. 

           Bryant reels back. Mel rolls away and spots --

           HIS GUN. 

           It lies on the forest floor beside Bryant. He hasn’t noticed 
           it yet. 

           She makes a quick decision. Charges straight at him. He’s on 
           his back on the ground. 

           He follows her gaze -- behind him -- spots the gun --

           And wriggles his body towards it, but --

           Mel summons all of her remaining strength and -- 

           DIVES OVER HIM. 

           Lands on the gun. Bryant quickly falls on top of her. A major 
           struggle, but finally she turns over and --

                                 MEL
                             (coughing)
                        Stop! 

           Bryant feels it. He looks down. Sees the gun pressing into 
           his chest. 

           He limply rolls off Mel. Lies next to her. She crawls away 
           and levels the gun at him.  

           His head is bleeding bad.

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                        I’m turning us in.

                        No!

           He struggles to sit up. 

                                 BRYANT (CONT'D)
                        You can’t tell anyone we took that 
                        money. They’ll take it back.

                        They don’t deserve that.

           She looks into his eyes. Conflicted. 

                                 BRYANT (CONT'D)
                             (heavy beat)
                        I’d rather die. 

                                 MEL
                        I’m not killing you. 

           Mel’s eyes swirl with pain, anger, torment. 

                                 BRYANT
                        Then I’ll do it. 

           He extends a hand -- asking for the gun.

                                 MEL
                        That’s insane. 

           She stares at him -- it’s impossible to tell if it’s a trap 
           or not. He breathes heavily. She’s frozen. 

           Bryant makes a sudden GRAB and wrenches the gun from her. 

                                 BRYANT
                        Gotta keep your gloves up. 

           She looks at him, thinking she’s about to die. But then --

           Bryant turns the gun on himself and pulls the trigger. 

           POP.

           Mel goes over to him. His body is limp, lifeless.

           A beat, then, she collapses on him. Starts to cry. 

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           We come in on --

           MEL, sitting at the edge of her hospital bed. Ugly bruises 
           all over. Helped to standing by a NURSE. She collapses back 
           down. The car crash and the fight did a number on her. 

                                 MEL
                        Again. 
                                 NURSE
                        Let’s just take it slow --

           Mel silences her with a glare. 

                                 DR. BERENSON (O.S.)
                        Guess the crash didn’t knock the 
                        stubborn out of you. 

           Mel looks up to see Berenson standing in the doorway.

                                 MEL
                             (glances at a clock)
                        Right when you said you’d be here. 

           The Nurse quietly exits. Berenson moves forward. Sits in the 
           chair across from Mel. Inspects her. A poignant silence. 
           Then. 

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                        I was a bitch to work with, huh?

           Berenson laughs. 

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        Yes. You were. Definitely the worst 
                        of my patients. 
                             (beat)
                        And probably the strongest. 

           Mel appreciates it, but doesn’t respond. Berenson crosses her 
           legs. 

                                 DR. BERENSON (CONT'D)
                        I had a talk with Judge Perez. 

           Mel nods, resigned to her fate. 

                                 DR. BERENSON (CONT'D)
                        I wanted you to face your demons, 
                        and you’ve done that. I told the 
                        judge that you successfully 
                        completed our program. 
                             (beat)
                        That’s all I told the judge.

           Mel’s eyes widen. Berenson, pointedly --

                                 DR. BERENSON (CONT'D)
                        Patient-Therapist confidentiality. 

           Mel’s reeling from the news. 
                                 DR. BERENSON (CONT'D)
                        I think you’ve suffered enough. 

                                 MEL
                             (speechless)
                        I...

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        You don’t need to say anything. 

           She gets up, reaches out a hand. They shake. 

                                 DR. BERENSON (CONT'D)
                        But don’t blow it. 

           Mel nods. As Berenson turns to leave --

                                 MEL
                        Wait. I got you something. 

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        Hmm? 

           Mel gestures to the corner of the room. 

                                 MEL
                        Feels less like a bribe now. 

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        Is that a 30 rack? I don’t drink 
                        beer. 

           It is, indeed, a THIRTY RACK. Berenson inspects it. 

                                 MEL
                        It’s seltzer. Owen picked it up.

           Berenson shakes her head, and gives Mel a smile. Then pulls 
           out a can and cracks it open. Sips. Lets out a big sigh of 
           happiness.

                                 DR. BERENSON
                        This might even last me the week. 

           She raises the can to Mel, and leaves.

           EXT. MEL'S BACKYARD - NIGHT

           Mel stands in her backyard next to a metal trash can. 
           Bandaged up. An EMPTY CAN OF LIGHTER FLUID next to her. 

           Then she --
           Lights a match. Tosses it into the trash can. 

           As the contents of the can catch on fire, we rise up to see --

           THE DUFFEL BAG. Ablaze. Still full of the money.

           Owen comes out the back door. Sees her and the fire. 

                                 OWEN
                        What’s going on? 

                                 MEL
                        Fresh start. 

           He doesn’t press her. Just joins her at the flames. They 
           watch together for a beat before --

                                 MEL (CONT'D)
                        We’ve been together for a long 
                        time. 

                                 OWEN
                        Twenty years. A whole life. 

           Mel turns to look at him. 

                                 MEL
                        There’s a lot left. 
                             (then, painfully)
                        We don’t have to hold each other 
                        back anymore. 

           Owen’s crushed. But he doesn’t disagree. 

           Mel takes his hands gently. Owen lets her. A beat, then --

           Owen sighs. Like a weight’s been lifted. From both of them. 

                                 OWEN
                             (sincere)
                        I really hope you get better.

                                 MEL
                        I’m trying.

           He turns and goes back into the house. 

           We stay with Mel and watch as the flames dance in her eyes. 

           EXT. FORT ROSECRANS CEMETERY - LATER

           A clear day overlooking the ocean. Sweet chirping in the 
           background. Price and Ellis stand next to Connor’s grave.
           Mel places A HOMEMADE MARKER (taped sticks in the shape of a 
           cross, same as Johnny’s) into the ground for Bryant.

           Price cracks open six beers. Keeps one, one to Mel, one to 
           Ellis, one in front of Connor’s grave, and one each in front 
           of Johnny and Bryant’s markers. 

           Mel stands there for a moment, then puts her beer on the 
           ground next to Connor’s, squeezes Price and Ellis on their 
           shoulders, and leaves.

           INT. BOXING GYM - DAY

           Weeks later now. Mel’s mostly healed. She sits next to the 
           ring. Wraps her hands. We see the heavyweight from before, 
           Jorge, eye her with fascination as he heads towards the ring. 

                                 JORGE
                        Trying to get back in with me loca?

           Mel SMILES. Genuine. First time in forever. Shakes her head. 

                                 MEL
                        I’m good. Think I’ll stick to the 
                        bags for a while. 

           Jorge grins back. Hops into the ring and starts practicing. 
           Mel heads over to the heavy bags, hands wrapped. 

           THUMP. Mel throws a punch. But instead of continuing to hit 
           with abandon, she relaxes. Takes it easy. 

           THUMP. Starts rocking. Getting back into a rhythm. 

           THUMP. Feeling good. Keeping her gloves up. And we --

           CUT TO BLACK as the sounds continue. 

           THUMP. 

           Beat. 

           THUMP.

           Beat. 

           THUMP.

           Not frantic. Not wild. Just steady.

           THE END
