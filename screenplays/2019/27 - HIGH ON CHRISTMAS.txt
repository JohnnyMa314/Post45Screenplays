           Do us a favor and Google MAJOR LAZER’s “Christmas Trees”. 
           Because that’s what plays over...

           INT. MERCER HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT

           BEGIN CREDITS:

           This is suburbia at its bougie-est. The halls are decked with 
           A LOT of shit. This is a family that takes Christmas 
           seriously. 

           We track with TOM MERCER (40s, a little winter scruff, hint 
           of a college tattoo that’s been lasered away) through a 
           living room that’s like a showroom designed by elves. 
           Meticulous lights strung. Not a tinsel out of place. No 
           expense spared. He hangs a final STOCKING: “Lily”.

           In walks LEAH MERCER (40’s, maiden name Mandelbaum, type A 
           and not hiding it). Eyes glued to her phone, she is 
           POSTMATING a Christmas Eve Feast. She gives Tom a kiss. He 
           smiles and walks out. 

           Once the room is clear, Leah “fixes” the stocking. He didn’t 
           do it her way. And her way is the right way. 

           Back with Tom, he passes through the TV room where their 
           youngest daughter LILY (7, mean girl in the making) roasts 
           marshmallows over a high-end electric fireplace. Kardashian 
           Christmas special in the background. 

           Tom continues past a flawless tree with a mountain of 
           perfectly-wrapped presents beneath, down a hallway with 
           framed family photos of past matching-sweater Christmases and 
           outside to--

           EXT. MERCER HOUSEHOLD - CONTINUOUS

           A guy in a TASKRABBIT t-shirt laughs hard at his own joke- 
           it’s a carrot sticking out of the “crotch” of an expertly-
           constructed SNOWMAN. Taskrabbit clocks Tom and reassigns the 
           carrot to its face.

           Tom grins. Looks up at the house. Bright Christmas lights 
           shine onto their faces.

                                 TOM
                        Thanks, man. Fixing our lights on 
                        Christmas Eve. Sure you got better 
                        things to do. 
           WIDE on the outside of the Mercer house. With the amount of 
           electricity they’re pumping, they could run NYC’s power grid 
           for a year. Animatronic elves hammer toys. A suspended sleigh-
           in-flight rainbows the roof. MERRY CHRISTMAS is displayed in 
           nine languages. Task Rabbit eyes the display. 

                                 TASK RABBIT 
                        You guys sure are “woke”, huh?

                                 TOM
                        What? Yeah, I don’t think anyone’s 
                        sleeping yet.

           Task Rabbit shakes his head. Tom further examines the 
           handiwork.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Novalink 8 millimeter?

           Task Rabbit looks impressed. 

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        With the Dewenwils waterproof light 
                        timer?

                                 TASK RABBIT
                           (surprised)
                        Wow- you know more about this than 
                        I did. Honestly, I just watched a 
                        YouTube video. 

           He packs up his toolbox. 

                                 TASK RABBIT (CONT’D)
                        Seems like you didn’t need me. 

           Tom shrugs.

                                 TOM
                        Well, obviously I got it wrong the 
                        first time so-- the wife thought I 
                        did. And you know what they say, 
                        happy wife... get laid on 
                        Christmas. 

           Task Rabbit looks uncomfortable. Too much information.

           Tom opens the Task Rabbit APP. Adds a handsome tip.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        All set! Merry Christmas.
           INT. MERCER HOUSEHOLD - KITCHEN

           Tom walks in, wrapping an apron around himself. It says 
           “HAPPY HOLLANDAISE.” 

           Leah enters. Before she can start, Tom--

                                 TOM
                        Listen-- you can Saucey the 
                        booze... And Task Rabbit the 
                        lights... And Amazon Prime the 
                        presents... But come on, it’s 
                        Christmas. I can bake cookies. 
                        Right?

           He waits for her approval. After a beat of consternation, she 
           smiles. 

                                 LEAH
                        Okay. 

           She slaps his butt. He smiles and pops open the flour. 

                                 LEAH (CONT’D)
                        But picture time in 10.

           Tom seductively slides the apron aside to reveal an ugly 
           reindeer sweater- this one says VIXEN.

           Leah flashes her own: BLITZEN. The BASS of that Major Lazer 
           song is cranking. Leah glances to the ceiling. 

           INT. MERCER HOUSEHOLD - HARPER’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           HARPER (17, hippie in the making, definitely has plans that 
           involve Burning Man) jams out to this song we’ve been 
           enjoying. She’s with her boyfriend HAWK (17, hair like young 
           Jared Leto, has already built their portable shower for 
           Burning Man) who takes a long hit off of a VAPE PEN. 

           With a small rake, Harper designs a spiral in a mini desk ZEN 
           GARDEN. It’s basically a fancy box of sand. 

           Little hippies in training. 

           Outside the door, Leah starts calling:

                                 LEAH
                        Harper, time for the family ph--

           She opens the door just as the BASS DROPS, rattling a jewelry 
           box off a nightstand. It cracks open, spilling ethical, 
           vegan, fair trade condoms across the floor. 
           Beat. Hawk turns off the Major Lazer. Slyly pockets the vape.

           END CREDITS

                                 LEAH (CONT’D)
                        You’re not in this one. 

           Leah checks her watch.

                                 LEAH (CONT’D)
                        Time to go home. I’m SURE we’ll see 
                        you tomorrow. 

           Harper huffs.

                                 HARPER
                        It’s time you accept that Hawk is 
                        part of this flock. 

                                 LEAH
                        So we’re all about Jesus now?

                                 HARPER
                        You’re being too literal. When I 
                        say flock, I mean family. Hawk-- 
                        bird-- it’s figurative. Get it?

                                 LEAH
                        I get that I’ve known Harold since 
                        he was five and into doing the 
                        Soulja Boy.

           Leah flaps her arms wildly, attempting the dance. 

           From the hall-- Tom, with flour on his face and the camera 
           around his neck, watches Leah dance, unbeknownst to her. 

                                 TOM
                        And what do we have here?

           Leah freezes, arms drop to her sides. 

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        I was just about to join in. It 
                        looked good.

           Hawk stands, gathering his hemp backpack. 

                                 HAWK
                        It’s ok, Sparrow. 

           He pecks her cheek.
                                 HAWK (CONT’D)
                        I’m not taking photos anymore.

           Nods to her parents.

                                 HAWK (CONT’D)
                           (in parting)
                        Steals your soul.

           Beat.

                                 TOM
                           (steamrolling that)
                        So.. ok, picture time.

           A FLASH OF WHITE takes us to...

           INT. MERCER HOUSEHOLD - LIVING ROOM 

           The family (Tom, Leah, Lily and Harper) huddles around the 
           small viewscreen of a DSLR. Lily snatches it, pumping the 
           buttons to ZOOM in.

                                 LILY
                        Oh my god, no no no no.

                                 LEAH
                        What is it this time? Didn’t hit 
                        your angles?

                                 LILY
                        Yeah, exactly. Can you say muffin 
                        top?

           Lily grabs at her non-existent side fat.

                                 LEAH
                        Not to a seven-year-old, I can’t.

           Before Lily throws another inevitable fit, Tom distracts.

                                 TOM
                        Time for presents! 

           Lily scrambles toward the tree. 

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Just one this year!

           Harper picks up a box then immediately drops it. Heavy.
           A loud RESOUNDING GONG emanates from within. Her face 
           explodes into a grin: she may be a hippie, but she still 
           loves things. Especially expensive ones.

           Tearing into the box confirms her suspicion: A SHINY SET OF 
           BRASS SINGING BOWLS. 

                                 HARPER
                        I can’t believe you got these! 

           She flips over the bowl. ANGLE ON: Made in Taiwan sticker.

           Harper eyes her mom with disappointment.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        What have I told you about child 
                        labor practices? Your iPhone isn’t 
                        worth their mangled fingers.

           A family tiff is interrupted by A LOUD BIRD SQUAWK emanating 
           from Harper’s iPhone. She answers, heads out of the room.

                                 HARPER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                           (obviously to Hawk)
                        Yeah, but they’re from Taiwan. I 
                        know, right...

           Tom shrugs to Leah. 

                                 TOM
                        Up next.

           He drumrolls on the coffee table with his fingers.

                                 LEAH
                           (interrupting his 
                           announcement)
                        You!

           Tom is giddy. Jeez, he loves Christmas. 

           He paces back and forth. Shaking presents. Leah hands one to 
           him.

                                 LEAH (CONT’D)
                        This one.

           He rips open the paper and tosses it.

           Leah gathers it from the floor. Tom doesn’t notice, because 
           in the box is a BRAND-NEW CAMERA. 
                                 LEAH (CONT’D)
                        I called in a favor. We did their 
                        ad campaign last year. My pitch, no 
                        big deal. Anyway, nobody in the 
                        States has one of these yet. I 
                        don’t even think the instruction 
                        booklet’s in English, so... good 
                        luck, honey!

           But a frustrated ball of energy named Lily is tired of 
           waiting.

                                 LILY
                        Good, good. He got a camera. You 
                        know iPhone has portrait mode, 
                        right? 

           Lily shakes her head. 

           Tom and Leah share a look: she’ll grow out of it. Hopefully.

                                 LILY (CONT’D)
                        Alright.

           Lily heads for the largest box under the tree.

                                 TOM
                        You sure you want that one?

           Lily about faces, whipping around. 

                                 LILY
                        No.

           Leah, having snuck out of the room, appears behind Lily, a 
           long Burberry plaid leash in her hand...

                                 LEAH
                           (quietly)
                        Lily.

           Lily warily peeks over her shoulder. Spots the leash.

           Faster than physics allows, she’s now cuddling...

           A BENGAL CAT

                                 LEAH (CONT’D)
                        She was hard to find, but we knew 
                        this is what you really wanted. 

           Lily lifts the tail, picks up a paw up, inspecting it like a 
           Westminster judge. 
           Leah and Tom share an uneasy glance: will she blow?

                                 LILY
                           (trying to be calm)
                        She’s not a “blue,” is she?

           Tom leaps to his feet, quickly covering.

                                 TOM
                        No, but she’s a “snow” which is--

                                 LILY
                        Not a “blue”. Might as well be a 
                        stinky gerbil. 

           Tom hangs his head in shame: snarked by a 7-year-old.

           The CAT purrs, headbutting Lily’s hand. Pet me. 

           Lily exhales and relents, scratching the cat’s ear.

                                 LILY (CONT’D)
                           (still a little 
                           disappointed)
                        I guess she’ll do. You said a 
                        “snow”, right?

           Leah and Tom vigorously shakes their heads “yes”.

           She lifts the cat, staring it in the eyes.

                                 LILY (CONT’D)
                        I’ll call her Gucci.

           Harper pops her head into the room.

                                 HARPER
                        Perfect for a thing that came from 
                        a sweat shop.

           Another round of bickering is blessedly cut short by a PHONE: 
           Mariah Carey’s ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS YOU ringtone.

           Leah stares down at the ringing phone. The ID reads: SASHA.

           The phone keeps ringing. Tom joins, staring down.

                                 TOM
                        You gotta jump on that grenade. It 
                        is Christmas Eve.

           With one more YOUUUUUU, Leah hits the green button.
                                 LEAH
                        Hey sis. Merry Christmas.

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. JFK CUSTOMS - SECURITY CORDON - LEO ROOM 

           SASHA ROCKEFELLER (also previously Mandelbaum, 35, bleached-
           blonde dreads, a batik jumpsuit, a cacophony of bracelets on 
           her arms and a definite disdain for authority) is flanked by 
           the things she hates the most...

                                 SASHA
                        The fuzz. They got me. On a stupid 
                        goathide drum. I was--

           INTERCUT PHONE CALL

                                 LEAH
                        Where are you? 

                                 SASHA
                        At the airport. 

                                 LEAH
                           (dreading)
                        So when you say “fuzz”, you mean 
                        TSA.
                           (sigh)
                        Which airport?

                                 SASHA
                        The man’s the man. In a blue hat. A 
                        red hat. A black hat. Doesn’t 
                        matter. It’s all the same man. 
                        Trying to keep us down. Trying to 
                        keep this goat from fulfilling its 
                        destiny--

                                 LEAH
                        As a drum? 

                                 SASHA
                        Yes, Leah. As a drum for a family 
                        in Scarsdale. You didn’t know this 
                        goat. I did. We went into a sweat 
                        lodge and our spirits--

                                 LEAH
                           (nervous)
                        Sasha, which airport?

           Beat.
                                 SASHA
                        Surpriiiiiiii---

           Her vocalization continues...

           EXT. JFK INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL - NIGHT

                                 SASHA
                        ---iiise!

           Outside the terminal, Sasha and Leah share a big hug. Sasha 
           far more invested.

           INT. VOLVO SUV - NIGHT

           Leah stares dead ahead as she grips the wheel. It’s not a 
           night to be on the road: snow piles along the highway. 

                                 SASHA
                        --and then they all got sick. They 
                        said it was my fault. Honestly I 
                        don’t know what they were talking 
                        about. What am I supposed to clean 
                        a Wahoo in? The toilet? 

                                 LEAH
                        A Wahoo? Where were you?

                                 SASHA
                        I told you. Haiti. We-Aid were in-
                        country for the third time.  

                                 LEAH
                        There’s got to be a better name 
                        than We Aid.

                                 SASHA
                        But that’s what we do. We Aid. 

                                 LEAH
                        Haiti? Aids? C’mon, I’m offering my 
                        firm’s services for free. I wish 
                        you would just listen to me more.

                                 SASHA
                        A Wahoo is a fish.

           Outside the windows, it’s a lot less highway and a lot more 
           suburban Scarsdale. 

           After a long silence--
                                 LEAH
                        So, what are you really doing here? 
                        Did you burn through the 
                        Vanderbilt’s alimony?

                                 SASHA
                        Rockefeller. And no. I was just 
                        going to surprise you. 

           Beat.

                                 SASHA (CONT’D)
                        Guess I forgot how much you hate 
                        surprises. 

           Leah sighs.

                                 LEAH
                        No, I’m glad you’re here. Just 
                        didn’t plan for it. The girls will 
                        be really happy to see you. 

           Leah slows the car as if somehow she can stop the inevitable. 
           With a deep breath, she launches into--

                                 LEAH (CONT’D)
                        Speaking of... ground rules. No 
                        weird men.

                                 SASHA
                        How do you define--

                                 LEAH
                        No men. No sweat lodges in the 
                        garage. No sound baths. No improptu 
                        tribal piercings. How about no 
                        fires? And... definitely NO DRUGS.

           With that, the Volvo slowly rumbles into the driveway. 

                                 LEAH (CONT’D)
                        You hear me, right?

                                 SASHA
                        Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

           INT. MERCER HOUSEHOLD - KITCHEN 

           Sasha makes a double-rum egg nog for herself. Leah clocks it.

                                 SASHA
                        What? This wasn’t on your “naughty 
                        list”. 
           Tom’s voice comes into the room before he does.

                                 TOM (O.S.)
                        What’d you break this time?

           She takes another sip.

                                 SASHA
                           (yelling back)
                        It wasn’t broken. It just made 
                        everyone violently ill.

           Tom enters and throws an arm around his sister-in-law.

                                 TOM
                        That’s our Sasha. 

           Sasha’s trying to cover but we can see she’s not happy with 
           what went down in Haiti. Not her finest moment. 

                                 SASHA
                           (sotto, ashamed)
                        Yep, that’s me.

           Her hidden sadness is snapped by the arrival of the girls.

                                 LILY AND HARPER
                        AUNT SASHA! 

           They pile into one group hug. Lily backs away, crinkling her 
           nose.

                                 LILY
                        You smell. Like bad.

           Sasha eyes Lily.

                                 SASHA
                        Well, I was going to wait until 
                        tomorrow--

                                 LILY
                        No-- you should take one NOW.

                                 SASHA
                        ...but I think you need this gift 
                        as soon as possible.

           She reaches into her hobo sling bag-- digs around. Leah and 
           Tom look nervous.

           She takes out a SMOKEY QUARTZ - a translucent sand-colored 
           crystal.
                                 LILY
                        A rock?

                                 SASHA
                        It’s a Smokey Quartz. Clears 
                        blocked energy. It helps people... 
                        just be. 

                                 LILY
                        What?

                                 SASHA
                        Just try meditating with it. I 
                        sense you could use a spiritual 
                        bath.

                                 LILY
                        And you need a real one.

           Leah looks toward Lily.

                                 LEAH
                        Lily... What do we say?

           Lily isn’t paying attention at all anymore. She’s just 
           playing with Gucci again.

                                 LILY
                           (to the cat)
                        I think I’ll name you SKITTLES 
                        instead. Candy names are trending 
                        right now.

                                 LEAH AND TOM
                        LILY.

                                 LILY
                           (to Sasha)
                        Thanks for the rock.

           Sasha turns to Harper. 

                                 SASHA
                        Sorry, Harp. The ass-hat goons at 
                        the TSA took your big gift. But 
                        I’ve got something else for you...

           Sasha takes out a drawstring bag and hands it to Harper.

           Harper loosens the puckered knot and takes out a beautiful 
           deck of TAROT CARDS. A torrent of images fall into her hand.
                                 SASHA (CONT’D)
                        I got them from a very powerful SHE-
                        man in Palo Alto. 

                                 TOM
                        A what?

                                 SASHA
                        A She-man. Like a shaman. But a 
                        self-realized woman. 

                                 TOM
                        Of course. 

                                 SASHA
                           (to Harper)
                        I’ll teach you how to use these. 
                        But only you can touch them. 
                        They’ll only talk to you.

                                 LILY
                        But they’re just cards. Mom says 
                        that’s what life coaches are for.

           Leah looks embarrassed.

                                 SASHA
                           (to Leah)
                        Really? A life coach for a seven 
                        year old?

                                 TOM
                        Well, Sasha, thank you so much for 
                        all these chakra-opening gifts. But 
                        girls, I think it’s getting to be 
                        bedtime. 

                                 LEAH
                           (to Lily)
                        Santa will be by soon but only if 
                        you’re sleeping!

                                 LILY
                        Oh joy, I hope I get more ROCKS.

           Lily scoops up SKITTLES and trundles off to bed. For such a 
           bitchy little girl, she and that cat look pretty cute.

           Harper follows up the stairs, on her phone again. 

           INT. MERCER HOUSEHOLD - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Tom, Leah and Sasha toast 3 glasses of EGG NOG. Extra nog.
                                 SASHA
                        So after all the camels came down 
                        with dysentery, I had to skedaddle. 
                        You’ve never seen anyone more angry 
                        than Bedouins who have lost their 
                        camels. So I called Porter--

           Tom tries to catch up.

                                 TOM
                        The Rothschild?

                                 SASHA
                        Rockefeller. Anyway, getting out of 
                        Israel was a diplomatic nightmare, 
                        but then the alimony finally 
                        dropped, so-- that’s when I founded 
                        We-Aid. 

                                 LEAH
                           (under her breath)
                        Please. New name.

                                 SASHA
                        But all I really want to do right 
                        now is thank you guys. I mean, you 
                        must be exhausted. This place looks 
                        incredible. 

           Leah beams. 

                                 TOM
                        Thanks, Sash.

                                 SASHA
                        Ok. So kids are tucked in. Santa’s 
                        on his way.

           DING!

                                 TOM
                        My cookies!

                                 SASHA
                        No, you guys sit and relax. I got 
                        it. Need a refill anyway.

           She swirls a last sip of nog and heads into the kitchen where 
           she...

           INT. MERCER HOUSEHOLD - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Reaches into her pants. What?
           She digs around.

           What??

           Finally she plucks out-- a little vial. What?!?!

           Cue George Strait’s CHRISTMAS COOKIES, as Sasha:

           - Uncorks the vial

           - Sprinkles the liquid onto the freshly baked cookies

           - Plates them

           ...What the fuck was in that vial?

           INT. MERCER HOUSEHOLD - LIVING ROOM

           On the screen plays the opening of A CHRISTMAS CAROL.

           Tom and Leah snuggle under a cashmere blanket. Sasha enters 
           with a plate full of these mystery cookies.

                                 SASHA
                        Alright, you guys enjoy these. I’m 
                        off to catch up with the Bauml’s. 

                                 LEAH
                        The Bauml’s? When’s the last time 
                        you talked to Sara? Or Jacob? 

                                 SASHA
                        They watch my livestream. 

                                 TOM
                        Livestream?

                                 SASHA
                        Men in China really like to watch 
                        me cook.

           Tom shakes his head quickly back and forth.

                         TOM
                                                      LEAH
           Nevermind-nevermind-
           nevermind. 
                                          Ok. Give them my best, I 
                                          guess.

                                 SASHA
                        Will do. 

                                 TOM
                           (mouth full of cookie)
                        At least take one for the road. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        If I do say so myself, they are 
                        GOOD. Quite herbaceous. 

           He shrugs.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Thanks, Pinterest. 

           Tom holds one out for Sasha to take. She just smiles slyly.

                                 SASHA
                        Nah, I’m good. I’m Keto right now. 
                        Enjoy the movie.

           Sasha leaves as Tom and Leah settle in for a night of 
           Christmas movies. Smiling, they toast eggnog, dunk a cookie, 
           and chomp down. 

           LATER

           Quick cuts show Tom and Leah’s disproportionate reactions to 
           the scenes from A CHRISTMAS CAROL.

           - Tom laughing hysterically at Tiny Tim and mocking his limp 
           across the room.

           - Scared of Marley’s ghost chains and wails. 

           - Weeping at Scrooge buying a Christmas goose for a poor 
           family. 

           Then a hard cut to--

           CREDITS ON THE SCREEN. 

           Reverse on Tom and Leah-- PASSED OUT.

           Drool from Leah. Snores from Tom. 

           A long thread of Leah’s drool perilously nears Tom’s eyelid 
           as--

           BANG BANG BANG.

           Some absurdly loud commotion from the kitchen. 

           The spit lands on his eye. Still not awake.

           CRASH!!

           That does it. Tom and Leah jolt awake. Leah grabs onto Tom’s 
           arm, frightened. They talk in hushed tones. 
                                 LEAH
                        Did you hear that??

                                 TOM
                        Yeah, did you??

                                 LEAH
                        ...Yes. That’s why I asked you.

                                 TOM
                        So you DID hear?

                                 LEAH
                        YES!

           CLATTER-CRASH. More sounds of shit breaking in the kitchen.

                                 LEAH (CONT’D)
                        Are you gonna go look??

                                 TOM
                        Do I have to?

                                 LEAH
                        Tom!

                                 TOM
                        Ok, ok. Fine. But you’re my backup. 

           Leah snags the fire poker. Tom grabs a NUTCRACKER.

           Leah throws a judgmental look at Tom for his weapon of 
           choice. Tom shrugs. Cranks the jaw a couple times.

           They creep in the dark, listening intently. 

           CRUNCH CRUNCH. The sounds of something snacking. A raccoon? 
           Sasha? Skittles?

           Tom takes point into--

           INT. MERCER HOUSEHOLD - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Tom’s toe bumps the kitchen island, startling him. He 
           reflexively tries to wield the nutcracker, but instead the 
           MOUTH OPENS-- spilling nut shells loudly onto the tile 
           floor...

           Spooking...

           MOTHER FUCKING SANTA CLAUS.
           Tom and Santa lock eyes. Like animals in the wild, full of 
           fear and confusion, both are frozen. 

           Leah, hearing the nut-spill from the next room, comes ROARING 
           IN-- brandishing the fire poker.

           She turns into the kitchen to see SANTA and unleashes a wild 
           swing into his body. He crumples to the ground. An outsized 
           CANDY CANE clatters from his pocket. 

           Beat.

           Tom and Leah look to each other. To their own hands. To the 
           fire poker. To the Santa on their floor. 

           Stunned, she drops the poker.

                                 LEAH
                        Who the fuck is this??

                                 TOM
                        Why do you think I know?

                                 LEAH
                           (proud)
                        I really hit him hard.

                                 TOM
                        Yeah I’m pretty sure he’s 
                        unconscious. I almost had him.

                                 LEAH
                        Not the time, Tom. You already 
                        spilled your nuts.

           Tom looks down at the spilled nuts, and his own, ashamed.

                                 TOM
                        Maybe it’s some drunken Santa who 
                        broke into the wrong house.

                                 LEAH
                        Yeah- like some sex thing?

                                 TOM
                        No... like a Christmas thing. Does 
                        he have presents?

                                 LEAH
                        I’m not touching him. I already did 
                        my part as “back up”. Your turn.

           Tom sighs and picks up the fire poker. Pokes at Santa.
           A LETTER flits from within his coat, does a MAGICAL loopedy-
           loop and lands UP on the kitchen island. 

           Beat. Tom ponders for a second. 

                                 TOM
                        Do you feel a little off?

                                 LEAH
                        Yeah... Kinda like I took an 
                        Ambien. Or kinda... you know...

                                 TOM AND LEAH
                           (realizing at the same 
                           time)
                        Stoned??

                                 LEAH
                           (mind racing)
                        The cookies! Sasha! 

                                 TOM
                        Nooooo. She wouldn’t taint my 
                        cookies.

                                 LEAH
                        She would. 
                           (beat)
                        She did.

                                 TOM
                        Wait wait, weed doesn’t make you 
                        hallucinate. It’s not like we 
                        dropped LSD.

                                 LEAH
                        So then, this guy is really here. 

           Leah pokes him again.

                                 LEAH (CONT’D)
                        On our kitchen floor. Dressed as 
                        Santa. But that letter... just 
                        floated up to the counter top. We 
                        both saw that, right?

                                 TOM
                        Yeah. Maybe it’s some weird Haitian 
                        pot that makes things float. 

                                 LEAH
                        That doesn’t make any sense.
                                 TOM
                        Does any of this??

                                 LEAH
                        Ok, I’ll grab the letter. You keep 
                        an eye on that asshole.

           Tom holds the poker at Santa’s chin. Leah opens the letter.

                                 LEAH (CONT’D)
                           (reading)
                        HOLY SHIT. This has LILY’S NAME ON 
                        IT. And it has all this personal 
                        information about our family. This 
                        guy’s a stalker!!

                                 TOM
                           (disgusted, agreeing)
                        A kiddy diddler. 

                                 LEAH
                        I’m calling the cops. 

                                 TOM
                        No no no no no-- the weed. Plus 
                        this guy might be dead-- because of 
                        you. No cops.

           A small COUGH from the floor. A poof of GLITTER from his 
           mouth. Eyes still closed.

                                 SANTA
                           (softly)
                        No cops. Please. No cops.

           Leah jumps.

                                 LEAH
                        HOLY SHIT!

                                 TOM
                           (brave)
                        Explain yourself, sir! Why do you 
                        have this letter? What are you 
                        doing in our house?

           Santa drags himself upward. Leans his back against the pantry 
           doorway.

           Now, we finally see SANTA CLAUS (50s) full on. He’s got all 
           the trimmings you’d expect: White beard. Red suit with 
           matching hat. Rosy cheeks. But one thing is definitely off-- 
           his eyes. They are severely bloodshot with heavy lids.
                                 SANTA
                        Well, my drone’s cookie detector 
                        went off, but then it didn’t come 
                        back, so I came down here to find 
                        out what was going on, and happened 
                        upon the cookies--

           He gestures to a half-eaten plate of leftover Sasha cookies.

                                 SANTA (CONT’D)
                        And then I just really wanted 
                        something sour, you know? Like...

           He make makes little sounds- smacking his tongue against the 
           roof of his mouth. 

                                 SANTA (CONT’D)
                        Tart? And then I saw you had these 
                        salt and vin--

           The pantry door behind him gives way. He tumbles backwards.

           Seconds later, a shower of snacks avalanche. He’s buried.

           Beat.

           CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH.

           Tom and Leah have a quick aside--

                                 TOM
                        Oh my god.

                                 LEAH
                        I know, I’m calling the cops now.

                                 TOM
                        No! I think that’s really Santa!

                                 LEAH
                        Tom, you know we’re HIGH right? And 
                        that Santa isn’t real. Right??

           She forces Tom to look at her.

                                 LEAH (CONT’D)
                        Please, for the love of god, tell 
                        me you know these things. 

           Tom and Leah turn back around to see Santa, now dug out of 
           the pile. He is holding a Cookie Monster-shaped COOKIE JAR.
                                 SANTA
                        I’m right here, guys. Don’t be 
                        rude. 

           He casually opens the jar and begins to lick the interior. 
           He’s really going at it. Leah makes an “eww” face. 

           Tom’s in awe. Leah holds up a finger: give us a moment. Drags 
           Tom into the corner.

                                 LEAH
                        Tom, I need you to get on my level. 
                        That degenerate licking the cookie 
                        jar is not Santa.

                                 TOM
                        But---
                           (holds up finger unsteady)
                        What if he is? He coughed up 
                        glitter.

                                 LEAH
                        So did I at that Bowie concert -- 
                        and I’m not Santa. 

                                 TOM
                        But the letter. We saw--

                                 LEAH
                        A gust of fucking wind, Tom. 
                        Seriously--

                                 LILY (O.C.)
                        Santa!?!

           Tom and Leah whirl to find their youngest in footie pajamas, 
           jaw dropped and eyes a’twinkle. Even little Miss Mean Girl 
           melts at the sight of Mr. Christmas himself.

           Santa, meantime...

                                 SANTA
                        Goddamit.

           He pats his suit like a drunk trying to find his wallet at 
           last call.

                                 SANTA (CONT’D)
                           (mumbling)
                        Where’s that damn--

           He notices Lily.
                                 SANTA (CONT’D)
                        Darn candy cane. 

           Lily makes her way toward Santa who shuffles back, trying to 
           stay out of her reach.

           Leah brandishes the poker once more - a Mama Bear protecting 
           her cub -- but Tom wants to believe.

           In SLO MO, he tosses the oversized candy cane toward Santa. 
           After it hits his face, Santa fumbles it a couple more times 
           and then -- 

           TWISTS the hook... a hiss of condensed energy and then--

           RED AND WHITE LIGHTS ERUPT LIKE THE SECOND COMING FROM WITHIN 
           THE CANDY CANE

                                 SANTA (CONT’D)
                        Frost-a-la-vista, baby!

           He slams down the HOOK. Wait for it...

           Nothing. 

                                 SANTA (CONT’D)
                           (grumbles)
                        What a waste of a line.

           He rapidly rejiggers the HOOK. RED WHITE LIGHT AGAIN. CLICK.

           This time it worked. A Bay-level lens flare of GREEN LIGHT 
           pulses, blinding Lily -- who immediately wipes her eyes, 
           turns around, ENTRANCED, and heads back to bed. 

           Tom does a very shitty impression of the Snoopy Dance.

                                                      TOM
                                          I told you! I told you!
                         LEAH
           Did you just Men In Black our 
           daughter?

           Tom stops dancing.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Huh? Yeah-- What did you just do to 
                        Lily? 

                                 SANTA
                        Nothing I haven’t done to thousands 
                        of children before. 

           This fact doesn’t comfort either of them. 
                                 SANTA (CONT’D)
                        It’s a harmless beam of light that 
                        erases her memory of me. Keeps her 
                        out of therapy. Saves you 
                        thousands. Now, Tom and Leah, I 
                        need to be on my way.

           He stands and begins collecting odds and ends from the 
           kitchen as if they were his own belongings: a blender, a 
           spatula, an onion.

                                 SANTA (CONT’D)
                        Now for my gloves.

           Over his own gloves, he slides on oven mitts.

                                 SANTA (CONT’D)
                        And my magic sack.

           He slings a stinky Hefty bag of trash over his shoulder.

           Beat.

           The bottom of the bag gives out: it’s a putrescent waterfall. 

                                 SANTA (CONT’D)
                           (to self, sad)
                        These are horrible presents.

                           (realizing)
                        Oooohhhhhhhh...

           Leah’s not following yet.

           Tom runs over and holds up the giant empty plate. Only 
           crumbs.

                                 LEAH
                        Ooooohhhhhhh....

           Santa is climbing onto the counter trying to whisk his way up 
           the ventilation hood above the stove. Not going well. 

                                 SANTA

                        Santa’s high. I’m pretty high. I 
                        know you are. We need some help.

           In a run-down New England pub, Christmas lights somehow make 
           everything even sadder. A tiny tree in the corner. An 80s 
           power ballad on the jukebox. Exact opposite of the Mercer’s.

           Sasha, though, is belly to the bar slamming shots of Fireball 
           with the bartender, JACOB BAUML (30), and others avoiding 
           Christmas relatives. 

           She’s playing some weird game. Dice, a bingo mat and an 
           advent calendar. She rolls the dice, takes a chocolate from 
           the calendar and finishes it off with a shot --

                        You missed eight maids a milking!

                        What makes you think this game has 
                        rules--

           Their drunken exchange is interrupted by - BLOOP BLOOP.

           Sasha’s phone lights up with a text from LEAH.

           ANGLE ON:

           A string of EMOJIs: SANTA/COOKIE/LEAF/CIGARETTE/FREAK OUT CAT

           Sasha looks at it and laughs to herself.

           Leah and Tom are huddled around her phone.

                        I’m telling you, this will make

                        explain it with words. Words are

           Behind them, Santa is wedged into the vent. Legs splayed.

           His pontification is once again interrupted by a VERY LOUD 
           SCREAMING ANIMOJI FOX. You know animojis: that creepy feature  
           that records your voice and facial movements and turns you 
           into a digital animal.

           It’s something that Sasha clearly accidentally recorded at 
           the bar but is now freaking the shit out of Tom and Leah.

           The fox with Sasha’s voice plays on a loop: “I’LL SHOVE YOU 
           BACK UP YOUR MOMMA’S BABY MAKER!” 

           Tom and Leah are horrified.

                        Not so --
           He spies Santa with two wooden spoons pretending to be in

           INT. MERCER HOUSEHOLD - KITCHEN

           Tom is focused on figuring out Santa’s magic letter. He keeps 
           FLICKING it in the air. Then he and Leah watch it fall. 

           Sasha bursts in, clearly quite inebriated. She wears a Toilet 
           Paper sash declaring her “Elf Queen.”

           Sasha clocks Santa.

                        Whoa whoa whoa, who’s the strange

                        I’m ALMOST positive we told you it 
                        was Santa.

                        Yeah, but I just thought you were

                        Actually, I don’t feel so good. 

           Sasha sobers up immediately at the sight of this stranger in 
           the house. She marches right up to Santa and grabs him by his 
           nuts. 

                                 SASHA
                        Listen. I don’t know who you are, 
                        but these are nice people. And you 
                        are clearly in the wrong house. So 
                        why don’t you pack up your merry 
                        band of shit and get the fuck out 
                        of here.

           Santa looks deep into Sasha’s eyes. She is momentarily 
           hypnotized by his gaze. A TWINKLE.

                                 SANTA
                        Sasha Mandelbaum. 

           Beat. He strains for more TWINKLE. Wheels turning...

                                 SANTA (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, I don’t get a lot of 
                        Mandelbaums on my list. So, I’m 
                        out. 

                                 SASHA
                           (to Leah)
                        How the fuck does this guy know my 
                        name??

           Sasha spies a RED VELVET SACK slumped in the corner of the 
           kitchen. It’s next to the ripped trash bag Santa mistook for 
           it. 

                                 SASHA (CONT’D)
                        He’s stealing! 

           She’s stomps over to the sack, still ranting.

                                 SASHA (CONT’D)
                        What kind of asshole dresses up 
                        like Santa on Christmas to ste--

           She yanks open the sack and is cut off by-- 

           A RED AND GREEN DRONE

           It shoots out of the bag, zipping around the kitchen. 
           The drone locks onto the CHRISTMAS TREE in the next room.

           Within seconds it drops off a series of PRESENTS and returns 
           to Santa’s magical bag. 

           Beat. 

           Sasha races to the living room and examines the IMMACULATELY 
           WRAPPED presents, each with a cursive “to” label for each 
           Mercer child.  

           She picks one up. Shakes it. 

                                 SASHA (CONT’D)
                        Alright, what’s your game? You get 
                        off on stalking families? Is this 
                        anthrax? Nanny cams, you sicko? 
                        What’s with the drone? Did Amazon 
                        send you?

           Santa looks sad and confused.

           Then a-la Jurassic Park, the EGG NOG on the table starts to 
           VIBRATE as a THUD THUD THUD emanates from above. 

                                 SANTA
                        Ah, Rudy is getting antsy. 

                                 SASHA
                        That your code name for your buddy 
                        up there? What’s the plan? A ‘lil 
                        chloroform, a ‘lil...
                           (thinking, definitely 
                           still drunk)
                         “deck the halls with bloody 
                        bodies?”

                                                      LEAH
                                          What does that even mean?
                         TOM
                (so fucked up)
           Fa-la-la-la-la...

           Leah shoots Tom a glare. 

           Sasha pops open a living room window. Sticks her head out and 
           looks up. Who is up there?

                                 SASHA
                        Rudy? We got your friend down here.

           Then her eyes adjust. And focus on--

           RUDY. Not Santa’s “buddy.” A real live fucking REINDEER aka 
           RUDOLPH. His nose GLOWS a magical red. 
           Sasha double-takes. Still there. She slams the window shut. 

           Sasha re-examines everything in rapid succession in a new 
           light: Santa, drone, trash, empty plate of cookies, stoned 
           sister.

                                 SASHA (CONT’D)
                        Ok. We need a plan.

           INT. MERCER HOUSEHOLD - BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           A remodeled basement complete with movie couch, projector and 
           a pinball machine. Even a mini kitchen.

           Sasha, Leah and Tom sit across from Santa, who mans a single 
           chair. 

           He’s mid-story.

                                 SANTA
                        ...So I’d just finished China, and 
                        the opium had really kicked in. I 
                        thought it would be hilarious for 
                        Giuseppe over in Pisa to get a dead 
                        rat that year instead of a stick 
                        and a hoop. 

           Tom has a stoner pensive look.

                                 SANTA (CONT’D)
                        Anyway, needless to say, that 
                        didn’t end so well. Bunch of people 
                        wound up sick.

                                 TOM
                        Do you mean the Plague???

                                 SANTA
                        Plague Shmague. It wasn’t a good 
                        year. The missus left me for a few 
                        decades. Had to get my act 
                        together. So yeah. Sober for 680 
                        years. Except now, I guess I’m back 
                        at square one.

           He pulls out a SOLID GOLD “SIX HUNDRED YEAR SOBER CHIP.” It 
           clatters to the floor. 

                                 SANTA (CONT’D)
                        My sponsor’s not gonna be happy 
                        about this.
                                 LEAH
                        Sponsor?

                                 SANTA
                        Ozzie.

                                 LEAH
                        Who?

                                 SANTA
                        Uh, oh yeah. You probably know him 
                        as Osterhase. 

                                 SASHA, TOM, LEAH
                        Who?

                                 SANTA
                        You know, big ears, fluffy tail, 
                        tells the best dirty jokes you’ve 
                        ever heard...

           Puzzlement across their faces.

                                 SANTA (CONT’D)
                        ...Uh.... Carries a basket... lays 
                        eggs... I think you guys paint them 
                        for some reason.

                                 LEAH
                        The Easter Bunny?!? None of this is 
                        happening right now.

                                 SANTA
                        Holy Shit, he hatesssss that name.

           Santa starts cracking up. Pulls a cookie he secreted away 
           under his beard. Snacks on it.

                     SANTA (CONT’D)
                                                      TOM
                (to self)
                                          Jesus.
           In for a penny, in for a 
           pound...

                                 SANTA
                           (still laughing)
                        Really NAILED that one!

           Beat.

           Santa taps at his wrists.

                                 SANTA (CONT’D)
                        Get it?!?! NAILED.
           Wiping a tear from a hard laugh, Santa sighs deeply. 

                                 SANTA (CONT’D)
                        Alright. Enough fun. Time to get 
                        going. 

           Santa pushes himself to his feet. Stands. Slowly wobbles from 
           side to side, then TOPPLES.

           Face first. Into the pinball machine.

           DING DA-DING DING.

                                 TOM
                        Well. Looks like Christmas is 
                        cancelled this year.

           EXT. THE NORTH POLE - NIGHT

           Unholy gusts of wind buffet the landscape. It’s blinding 
           white. Except for--

           A SIMPLE POLE

           It’s not jolly and bright like you may have thought. It’s 
           actually kind of rusted and austere. 

           The only thing that sets it apart is a barely visible red 
           emergency light that BLINKS a staccato rhythm. 

           We PAN below, watching the layers of the earth unfold--

           A FORMER RESEARCH FACILITY

           A UFO

           SKELETONS OF EARLY MAN

           And then...

           INT. SANTA’S WORKSHOP - WAR ROOM - NIGHT

           A group of ELVES sit around a Strangelove-style table facing 
           a GIANT ELECTRONIC MAP OF THE WORLD.

           On the map, a white light blinks over America’s Northeast.

           The lead elf-- ESTELLE-- is not happy.
                                 ESTELLE
                        He should be tracking over Denver 
                        by now. Anyone have eyes on Big 
                        Red?

           We see the other elves. Equally nervous. One punches up a 
           sleigh-cam.

           The live feed materializes where the map was. 

           In GREEN NIGHT VISION, we see two squirrels humping in the 
           snow. 

           The elf frantically jams buttons to switch the feed. Instead, 
           CHESTNUTS ROASTING ON AN OPEN FIRE by Nat King Cole blares. 

                                 ESTELLE (CONT’D)
                        Dammit, George.

           INT. MERCER HOUSEHOLD - BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Sasha drags a blanket over a knocked-out Santa, curled up on 
           the couch.

           Leah and Tom have a serious sidebar by the mini-kitchen. They 
           chug bottled water from the fridge. 

                                 LEAH
                        We need a fact check. Fact: we’ve 
                        seen some crazy shit tonight. But, 
                        also fact: we’ve eaten some Haitian 
                        hash. I don’t know what that does 
                        to you. But this could all be some 
                        big collective hallucination. If we 
                        just go to bed, we’ll wake up with 
                        a hangover, but no Santa.

                                 TOM
                        Or we’ll wake up and every kid in 
                        the world will be present-less.

                                 LEAH
                        Tom. What are you saying?

                                 TOM
                        I’m just saying. Santa’s not going 
                        anywhere--

           ANGLE ON: Santa. His FAT GUT spills out of his suit. Yeah. 
           He’s not going anywhere.
                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        --And he’s got a lot of gifts, or 
                        drones with gifts, that need to be 
                        delivered. Why don’t we just try 
                        this block?

                                 LEAH
                        You wanna play Santa Claus?

                                 SASHA
                           (overhearing)
                        I’m sure you guys need to spice 
                        things up, but now’s not the time.

                        Pro/con?

           Tom nods and they scrounge up a piece of paper and pen. 

           Tom writes PRO and CON at the top. They fill in the columns 
           as they go. 

                                 TOM
                        Pro: It’s a good story.

                        lose our friends. Maybe our

           Leah points again at “get arrested.”

                        Con: Or, that’s NOT Santa and it’s 
                        some drunk dude that we’ve left at 
                        home with our children.

                        I can stay and watch him. And the 
                        kids. Leah, if there’s anyone who 
                        needs this, it’s you.

           Tom is writing: “Pro: Free babysitter.”

                                 LEAH
                        You mean the one who brought the 
                        drugs into the house?

                                 SANTA
                           (from the couch)
                        I’m COMING WITH YOU!! You neeeeed 
                        me. The reindeer don’t like 
                        strangers. STRANGER DANGER!!

                        Come on... Please. Not even the 
                        neighborhood, just one house. Look, 
                        you know that on the commune we 
                        didn’t have Christmas. But what I 
                        never told you is what we did do. 
                        We stood outside the Macy’s and 
                        handed out pamphlets about how 
                        Christmas was “the Red Scare.” 
                        “Santa the Capitalist.” All about 
                        materialism and morality based on 
                        some mystical “nice and naughty 
                        list.” IT SUCKED. So, I deserve 
                        this. And so do you. Neither of us 
                        got to have real Christmases. Come 
                        on-- stinky whitefish and bratty 
                        New York girls comparing presents. 
                        Not festive. So, here it is. Right 
                        in front of us. Real magic.

           She looks at Tom, thinking.

           Then Santa VOMITS milk and cookies all over the basement 
           carpet. 

                                 LEAH
                        Real magic there, Tom.

           Leah thinks. Holds up a finger.

                                 LEAH (CONT’D)
                        One.

                                                           CUT TO:
           STAIRWELL

           Leah, Tom and Sasha lead Santa up the stairs via a trail of 
           Salt and Vinegar chips.

           Every few steps is punctuated with a “CRUNCH CRUNCH.”

           Santa’s licking them straight off the steps.

           After a few pratfalls and broken lamps, they finally make it 
           to the top.

           EXT. MERCER HOUSEHOLD - FRONT YARD - NIGHT

           Sasha, Leah and Tom continue to lead Santa.

           Leah looks up at the roof-- sees the sleigh.

                                 LEAH
                        Alright, how are we doing this?

                                 TOM
                        The gutters!

                                 LEAH
                           (excited)
                        You finished them?

                                 TOM
                        No... but I left the ladder out.

           Tom races around the side of the house, returning seconds 
           later with a BIG LADDER.

           Sasha crouches down to get on Santa’s level-- he’s currently 
           sitting in the snow, going to town on the chips.

                                 SASHA
                        Okay Santa, we’re gonna play a 
                        game. It’s called ‘climb the ladder 
                        and don’t fall off.’ Your prize--

           Sasha snatches the chips. Santa frowns.

                                 SASHA (CONT’D)
                        These.

           Santa smiles. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           Tom yells from atop the roof.
                                 TOM
                        Okay! Send him up!

           Sasha and Leah cajole Santa up the ladder. It’s wobbly, but 
           he’s making progress. About halfway up, a CAR approaches. 

           Leah and Sasha exchange a panicked glance.

                                 LEAH
                        Oh shit. What are we gonna do?

           The car passes, and a ROWDY TEENAGER leans out the window.

                                 ROWDY TEEN
                        Fuck yeah Santa!!! Merry Fucking 
                        Christmas!!!

           Santa turns, excited. Throws up a ROCKER HORN, releasing one 
           hand from the ladder.

           The car peels off. 

                                 SASHA
                        Nothing. Santas doing dumb shit 
                        aren’t exactly a rarity this time 
                        of year. 

           Uh oh, Santa has lost his balance. At the top, Tom tries to 
           grab back the teetering ladder, which has now gone VERTICAL. 
           No longer leaning on the roof. 

                                 TOM
                        LEAN. FORWARD. 

           Not wanting to chance it, Leah pushes the ladder back against 
           the roof. Problem solved.

           EXT. MERCER HOUSEHOLD - ROOF

           Right next to their top-of-the-line satellite dish that picks 
           up game shows all the way in Japan--

           A LINE OF BE-BELLED REINDEER. Harnessed and ready to fly.

           Antsy, they pull against reins leading to the...

           Ultra-modern and sleek LAPLANDER 3000.

           Mag-lev sleigh rails hover inches above the roof.

           The sleigh’s engineering, body and aerodynamics are of a 
           technology not even dreamt of by Tesla. 
           If we weren’t inches away, we might not even see it. The 
           paint coat is GHETTO-CHROME. Which yeah, is tacky, but also 
           is the magic cloaking mechanism that keeps Santa incognito. 
           The reflection is so crisp, it camouflages all.

           Tom GASPS with joy. 

                                 TOM
                        They’re so cute!!!

                                 LEAH
                           (whisper-yell)
                        Shh!!! The kids!

                                 TOM
                           (whisper-yell)
                        Look at its FACE!!!

           Tom nuzzles into VIXEN and strokes her mane.

           He points to his own VIXEN sweater, then at the actual 
           reindeer. Back and forth- in awe.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                           (yelling)
                        Take a photo!!

           He smiles for too long.

           Sasha is trying to keep Santa on his feet-- he’s exhausted 
           from the climb and the cookies have REALLY kicked in now. 
           Leah pushes a button near what appears to be a door hatch. It 
           slides up like a wing on a brand-new Lambo. Looks like Santa 
           went through a middle-aged crisis.

           In the COCKPIT, Leah fiddles with the sleigh’s controls.

           It’s actually just a giant iPad like in a Tesla. She tries to 
           swipe but it is LOCKED. Requires FACIAL RECOGNITION.

           Ah, shit.

                                 LEAH
                        Sasha, we need him over here.

           Leah turns. Tom and Sasha have apparently given up on the 
           plan and are now just snapping selfies with Vixen. 

           Vixen in a kiss sandwich. Peace Sign. You know, adults 
           pretending to be young again.

           But in his stupor, Tom has neglected to flip it into selfie 
           mode and is just taking pictures of the night sky.
                                 LEAH (CONT’D)
                        You two, quit fucking around! I 
                        need help.

           She is trying to deadlift Santa by herself toward the facial 
           recognition. Puke on her sweater.

           Sasha whips around.

                                 SASHA
                        Oh -- and who do we have here? Ah 
                        yes, it’s... Lumpy Leah...

           Leah is immediately angered at the mention of this nickname.

                                 LEAH
                        That name never made sense.

                                 SASHA
                        Yeah, it does. You’re just a lump. 
                        A lump of no fun.

           Tom sniggers, his hand immediately covering his mouth.

                                 LEAH
                        Seriously, Tom? You’re gonna stick 
                        with Requiem for a Dream over 
                        there?

                                 TOM
                        Sorry. But right now, it’s kind of 
                        true. 

           He and Sasha high-five. 

                                 LEAH
                        I could be listening to a sleepcast 
                        right now with a moisturizing mask, 
                        but instead, because you wanted to, 
                        we’re up here. So if you want to do 
                        this, then let’s do it.

                                 SASHA
                        Chill, Lumpy. 

           Tom playfully swats at Sasha.

                                 TOM
                        C’mon, knock it off. She’s right.
                           (sotto, stoned laugh)
                        And lumpy.
           Finally as one, Sasha and Leah have managed to get Santa’s 
           torso in the sleigh. His face is inches away from a RECOG 
           cam.

           With a massive UMPH, Tom linebacker pushes Santa into the 
           sleigh. But a little too much UMPH. They both tumble in.

           Santa somersaults, now in an awkward handstand. But...

           The iPad reads his upside-down face. BEEEP. Claus Confirmed. 

           Simultaneously, the sleigh’s mag-lev deactivates. A THUD and 
           a burst of snow as it lands square on the roof.

           INT. SANTA'S WORKSHOP - WAR ROOM

           On screen, a photo of LEAH slides into place. A corporate 
           headshot.

           Another elf, BUCK-- buck teeth and glasses-- paces in front 
           of the screen.

                                 BUCK
                        This is Leah Mandelbaum. Raised in 
                        Manhattan. Jewish. Upper West Side.

           The elves shrug as to say “sounds about right.”

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        Currently working as a high powered 
                        ad exec for Dayton Smith Perlin 
                        Hansen Carrico Hoppey Smith...

           His eyes continue to trail down the list-- 

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        --etc. Her last campaign was for 
                        Little Birdie’s Baby Boots-- “Don’t 
                        leave the nest without them” was a 
                        massive success. 

           Buck KICKS UP his feet. He’s wearing them. Little knit baby 
           socks.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        Like walking on air. Wait - that 
                        should have been the slogan. 

           Estelle clears her throat-- get on with it.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        She only became ‘Yule’ when in 1994 
                        she met--
           Another photo joins Leah on the screen. It’s TOM. But he 
           doesn’t have a corporate headshot. So it’s his FACEBOOK 
           profile picture. He’s laying down in front of the Washington 
           Monument. From this angle, it looks like his dong. 

           A sigh at his immaturity from Estelle.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        Tom Mercer. Raised on a socialist 
                        commune outside Brattleboro, 
                        Vermont. Had a-- weird relationship 
                        with Christmas most of his life.

           On the screen, a surveillance photo of Tom and other KIDS 
           FROM THE COMMUNE handing out tracts with slogans like “The 
           real man in red: Why you should love Marx.”

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        He and Leah met at NYU. A Kurt 
                        Cobain memorial.

                                 ESTELLE
                        How do you have all this 
                        information?

                                 BUCK
                        Facebook, ma’am. It knows all. 
                        Plus, Zuckerberg is half elf. 

           They all nod knowingly. 

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        So, what you’re looking at here, 
                        are the potential captors of Big 
                        Red. 

           Off Estelle, thinking....

           EXT. MERCER HOUSEHOLD - ROOF - NIGHT

           On the sleigh’s iPad, there is a shockingly pedestrian array 
           of APPS: MAPS, FACEBOOK, AMAZON PRIME, INSTAGRAM, NETFLIX, 
           YOUTUBE, MY FITNESS PAL and MISTLETOE.

           Leah shrugs and clicks MISTLETOE, the most X-mas of all the 
           apps. 

           Immediately, she regrets it. A selection of live-stream 
           Christmas-themed PORN appears. Then a PRIVATE MESSAGE: “Can’t 
           wait to see you and the Mrs. again. I miss your North 
           Pole...”
           She frantically clicks it off, but Tom has seen it all and 
           it’s like a child walking in on their parents. 

           Innocence tarnished.

                                 SANTA
                           (grumbling)
                        Stuffed her stocking good.

           Tom looks broken. Innocence destroyed.

                                 LEAH
                        I don’t even want to touch this 
                        now. 

           She pulls up her sweater sleeve so it covers her hand.

                                 TOM
                           (a new wave of stoned)
                        Leah, look at Dancer. Look at 
                        Prancer. Look at Donner.

           As their names are called, the reindeer stand at attention, 
           starting to paw at the roof below. 

           Leah kisses Tom’s cheek.

                                 LEAH
                        Keep going, you stoned genius.

                                 TOM
                        Look at Sleepy and Grumpy and Doc.

                                 LEAH
                        No, no, no.

           Sasha is now outside the sleigh. Reading the reindeer names 
           from their tags.

                                 SASHA
                           (coaching Tom from afar)
                        Dasher. Comet. Cupid. Rudolph.

           Tom repeats each one. Ending with.... VIXEN.

           Nothing happens.

           Leah looks down at her own sweater and...

                                 LEAH
                           (yelling)
                        BLITZEN!
           In a great explosion of hooves and a burst of snow, the door 
           wings seal shut and they finally take off --- 

                                 LEAH & TOM
                           (like kids)
                        WWWHHHEEEEE!!!

           INT. SANTA’S SLEIGH

           Tom, Leah and a still-upside-down Santa all brace for...

           THUD. They look outside. 

           It’s the neighbor’s roof. They can still see Sasha just 
           across.

           Everyone looks, frankly, disappointed. 

                                 TOM
                        How do you do this in one night? 
                        This goes against physics.

                                 LEAH
                        Yeah, you’ve been doing this 1,000 
                        years and...

                                 SANTA
                           (still fucked)
                        There’s the thing with the button --
                        click-- and it makes the things go-- 
                        buzzzzzzzzz--

           Santa, follows the trails of his hands, mesmerized. 

                                 TOM
                        I think we’re on our own here. 

           From the sleigh’s “rear view mirror” dangles a GOLDEN GLOBE 
           ORNAMENT. Santa- again, still upside down, stares into his 
           reflection. 

                                 SANTA
                        To be nice, Or not to be nice. That 
                        is to be...
                           (thinking)
                        Naughty? Is there any such thing as 
                        a truly good deed? Or is everyone 
                        good for the presents?

                                 TOM
                        Yeah. He’s gone Freshman philosophy 
                        on us. 
                                 LEAH
                        Chimney?

           POV: Red brick encircles a bottomless black pit. 

           The passage is narrow. A basketball would wedge here. 
           Certainly not big enough for an adult.

           EXT. NEIGHBOR'S ROOF - NIGHT

           But that’s not stopping Tom. He’s got one leg jammed into the 
           crevice. 

                                 LEAH
                        You really think that’s gonna end 
                        well?

                                 TOM
                        I’m not an IDIOT. I’m testing for 
                        the magic.

                                 LEAH
                        The magic?

                                 TOM
                           (gesturing to the sleigh)
                        Santa-- flying reindeer-- hello!

                                 LEAH
                        Ok. Even using that logic, what 
                        magic do you bring to that chimney?

           Tom swirls his hands like an old mystic and makes an 
           “ooooOOOooo” sound, like he’s making something magical 
           happen. 

           Beat. Leah stands back, arms crossed, waiting. 

                                 TOM
                           (stuck in the chimney)
                        Ok yeah, this isn’t gonna work.

           INT. SANTA'S WORKSHOP - WAR ROOM

           It’s like a NASA launch, as the elves all stare breathlessly 
           at the world monitor. The map shows Santa is now on the move!

           The elves shout and pat each other on the back in 
           celebration. 
                                 ESTELLE
                        We’re a go, people. Christmas is 
                        back on track.

           EXT. NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Tom and Leah are now outside the front door, presents in 
           hand. All lights are off, save for a glittering Christmas 
           tree inside.

           They tip-toe around like cartoon burglars, casing the joint. 
           Without consulting his wife, Tom reaches for a large ROCK and 
           approaches a ground floor window. He rears back--

           SLAP. His arm is stopped mid-throw by Leah. She gives a sharp 
           head nod.

                                 LEAH
                           (mouthing)
                        No.

           He gently puts down the rock. Leah opens her own hand: it’s 
           obviously one of those faux-rocks that hides keys.

           Tom nods in understanding. Grabs the faux rock from her and 
           rears back--

           Leah grabs his arm again.

                                 LEAH (CONT’D)
                        No! 

           She pries the bottom off, revealing some keys.

                                 LEAH (CONT’D)
                        Remember when I had to watch Daniel 
                        for a week while they were in Bali?

           He nods, pretending he remembers. He doesn’t. 

           INT. NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           ANGLE ON A GOLD NAME PLATE READING “DANIEL.”

                                                          RACK TO:

           A PARROT

           A touch of the Amazon in the suburbs. Painted like a sunset. 
           Black beak and sharp tongue. 
           Daniel squawks gently. Asleep.

           The bird cage sits in the LIVING ROOM. The darkness is now 
           pierced by TWO IPHONE FLASHLIGHTS SCANNING THE ROOM.

           Leah and Tom pad their way in. They lock eyes with a now-
           awake Daniel.

           Beat.

           They keep moving- headed toward the Christmas tree in the 
           next room. 

                                 DANIEL
                        Stop it.

           Leah and Tom whip their heads back.

                                 TOM
                           (whispering)
                        It talks??

                                 LEAH
                        Yeah, repeats whatever it hears the 
                        most. 

           Beat.

                                 TOM
                        That’s not good then...

                                 DANIEL
                        Stop it! Stop it!

                                 TOM
                        I’m just saying, “stop it” isn’t 
                        something one hears in a loving 
                        househo-

                         LEAH
                                                     DANIEL
           Stop it! 
                                          Stop it!

           She realizes she sounds just like the bird. Rolls her eyes.

                                 LEAH
                           (whispering)
                        Shut up. You know what I mean. We 
                        have to drop these and get out of 
                        here.

           They finally make it to the tree and drop the presents. 

           Leah steps back, contemplating their placement. Remember, 
           she’s an ad exec-- all about optics.
           She rearranges the gifts. Steps back again. 

                                 TOM
                        Seriously?

                                 DANIEL
                        Little bitch! Little bitch!

           Tom whips around- shocked at Daniel’s potty beak.

           Leah steps back and looks at the presents again. Still not 
           right!

           Eyes glued to the tree, she steps around, not looking where 
           she is going and--

           Her foot snags on the Christmas Tree light cord. It all seems 
           okay until--

           ANGLE ON THE CROWN MOLDING

           The LIGHTS strung around the house start to SNAP OFF. One by 
           one. Beat by beat. 

           Tom and Leah watch helplessly as the lights continue to 
           dismantle, all the way into Daniel’s room.

                                 DANIEL
                           (louder)
                        Little bitch! Stop it! Little 
                        bitch! Stop it!

           The cord WHIPS off and CLOTHESLINES the base of Daniel’s cage-
           stand. Fuck.

           The cage crashes to the floor. His little door opens. And 
           Daniel is free.

           You can hear the bird’s echoes through the house as he 
           flutters around frantically.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        Leah’s-a-bitch! Leah’s-a-bitch!

           Leah’s jaw drops to the floor. 

                                 TOM
                        I thought it was saying LITTLE 
                        BITCH.

                                 DANIEL
                        Leah’s-a-bitch!
                                 TOM
                        Nope, it’s definitely --

                     TOM (CONT’D)
                                                     DANIEL
           Leah’s a bitch!
                                          Leah’s a bitch!

                                 LEAH
                        I watched that bird for Becky for a 
                        week! 

           He’s on his tiptoes, struggling to catch it.

                                 LEAH (CONT’D)
                        But no, no. I get “Leah’s a bitch!” 

           She swats at it angrily - spooking it more.

           But Tom’s got a solution: he snatches a large WOODEN FRUIT 
           BOWL from the table. 

           Daniel’s backed into a corner. Terrified.

           Tom raises the bowl. He lowers it--

                                 TOM
                        GOTCHA!

           Daniel jukes to the left, past an arched window. But Tom’s 
           reflexes are all stoned dad --

           And the bowl SAILS through the window. A blissful moment of 
           silence as Daniel flaps into the night.

                                 DANIEL
                           (echoing)
                        Leah’s a bitch!

           Then -- the ADT ALARM goes like hell venting steam. 

                         TOM
                                                      LEAH
           Shit.
                                          Shit.

                                 TOM
                        Let’s go.

                                 LEAH
                        Hold on.

           Tom dumbfounded. 

           Leah makes a run for the presents she so carefully placed. 
           Takes them back.
                                 LEAH (CONT’D)
                        No presents.

                                 TOM
                        What?

                                 LEAH
                        No presents for the Cooper’s. 
                        Santa’s revenge.  

           INT. SANTA’S SLEIGH - ROOF - NIGHT

           Tom and Leah, out of breath, slide back into the sleigh.

                                 SANTA
                        Ergo, naughtiness is niceness -- 
                        and the world has no meaning.

           Tom’s hunting the dash.

                                 TOM
                        Does it have a reverse?

                                 SANTA
                        Does time?

                                 LEAH
                        Not TIME, Santa. The sleigh. 

           Tom and Leah share a simultaneous in-over-our-heads knowing 
           glance.

                                 LEAH (CONT’D)
                        We’re going to have to sober him 
                        up. 

           INT. MERCER HOUSEHOLD - BASEMENT - BATHROOM

           Sasha, Tom and Leah all stare down at a passed out Santa in a 
           clawfoot tub. 

           Leah tries to nudge a COCONUT WATER into his mouth. No 
           response.

           Leah steps back. CRACKS her knuckles. Alright-- let’s do 
           this.

           - A HALF-NAKED SANTA IS BLASTED FULL FORCE BY A SPRAY OF 
           WATER.

           - NOW AWAKE, SANTA SWATS A CUP OF COFFEE BACK AT TOM.
           - A COFFEE-SOAKED TOM DUMPS MORE SUGAR INTO THE NEXT CUP. OUT 
           THE WINDOW, WE SEE AN ADT VAN SCREECH. FAT SECURITY PILES 
           OUT. AN OBLIVIOUS TOM SNEAKS ANOTHER BITE OF POT COOKIE.

           - SASHA FORCE-FEEDS BREAD DOWN SANTA’S THROAT.

           - LEAH ANSWERS THE DOOR- IT’S MRS. COOPER IN PJS. 

                                 LEAH
                           (feigning concern)
                        No, I’m so sorry Becky, I haven’t 
                        seen Daniel.

           - SANTA ATTEMPTING FIELD SOBRIETY TESTS: KIND OF PASSING. 

           EXT. MERCER HOUSEHOLD - ROOF

           Tom, Leah and Sasha all wave a fair-well to Santa as he rides 
           off into the night. 

           And straight into a telephone pole. The reindeer are snagged 
           on wires. Prancer whimpers. Beat. 

           The wing slides up. Santa tumbles out into the snow. SPLAT.

           Not good. At. All.  

           Tom looks at Leah.

                                 TOM
                        Please please please please please 
                        please please--

           Ignoring her adolescent husband, Leah is doing a damage 
           assessment. Ever the adult in charge. 

           Then the LIGHT from a BEDROOM BELOW flips on. Reflecting on 
           the snow in the backyard. Luckily none of the kids’ rooms 
           face the street and the mayhem occurring on it. Lily’s up.

                                 SASHA
                        I got it. You guys deal with Willie 
                        Nelson over there. 

           INT. MERCER HOUSEHOLD - LILY’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Not a typical little girl’s bedroom. A vanity - no toys. 

           Sasha sits on Lily’s bed nursing a bottle of Christmas 
           merlot. Lily holds Skittles. 
                                 SASHA
                        ...And that’s why peppermint 
                        Schnapps and driving don’t mix on 
                        Christmas. Or ever. 

                                 LILY
                        Does peppermint Schnapps just taste 
                        like peppermint?

                                 SASHA
                        Yes. And if you mix it with chocol-- 
                        I mean. It tastes like poop. Never 
                        drink it. K?

           Lily side-eyes Sasha, not buying any of it.

                                 LILY
                        I’m having my first drink at age 10 
                        anyway, so I’ll find out then. I’m 
                        thinking gin.

           Off of Sasha’s concerned expression...

           EXT. MERCER HOUSEHOLD - ROOF

           Leah and Tom continue a debate.

                                 TOM
                        Just go with me on this...

           He takes half a Haitian cookie out of his pocket.

                                 LEAH
                        Tom!

                                 TOM
                        What?

                                 LEAH
                        What are you doing?

                                 TOM
                        Ok, remember that time we drank all 
                        that vodka and broke into the NYU 
                        aquatic center? 

           A small smile from Leah- she remembers.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        And it was when I first said I love 
                        you. In hindsight, the drinking and 
                        swimming together was probably not 
                        the brightest idea. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        But what was great was you and me. 
                        On an adventure. A little fucked 
                        up. Ok, A LOT fucked up. And this 
                        just fell into our lap.

           RACK to the street where Santa’s taking a piss in the snow.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Come on... Taste the magic!

           Leah finally relents. Shrugs and takes the cookie. A small 
           bite

                                 LEAH
                           (chewing)
                        Pretty sure none of this is real 
                        anyway.

           INT. MERCER HOUSEHOLD - LILY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Sasha digs the hole a little deeper.

                                 SASHA
                        Statistically, between Thanksgiving 
                        and New Years there are the most 
                        drunk driving accidents. And that’s 
                        not even counting suicides. Do you 
                        know most suicide victims have 
                        alcohol in their systems?

           Thankfully she’s interrupted by--

           HARPER

           She stomps into Lily’s room, holding her zen garden. A fresh 
           CAT TURD laid out.

                                 HARPER
                        We need to have a talk, Lily--

           Harper sees Sasha.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        What are you guys doing?

                                 SASHA
                        Bedtime stories. Need to work on 
                        mine. Speaking of, let’s all go 
                        back there.
                                 LILY
                        I can’t. I’m not tired anymore. All 
                        I’m thinking about is schnapps and 
                        suicide. 

           Harper looks at Sasha-- an eyebrow raised.

           Sasha thinks for a moment.

                                 SASHA
                        Alright, I’m calling an audible. 
                        Sleepover. We can go to my room 
                        downstairs. S’mores. Movies. Sound 
                        good? Great.

           Skittles, meantime, is still learning what a litter box is. 
           She PISSES all over Lily’s floor.

                                 SASHA (CONT’D)
                        Skittles better keep it in her 
                        pants.

           INT. MERCER HOUSEHOLD - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Sasha leads the girls through the hall and down the stairs. 
           The girls carry pillows, blankets, etc. Sasha speaks loudly 
           as to warn Leah or Tom that they are on their way.

                                 SASHA
                           (loud)
                        Okay! Here we go! Down the stairs!

                                 LILY
                        We don’t need a narrator, aunt 
                        Sasha.

                                 SASHA
                           (ignoring, louder)
                        So much fun going to the BASEMENT! 
                        Now just ignore the mess in the 
                        kitchen there, just down these 
                        stairs. Gooooood. Be there in a 
                        minute! Just making sure the door 
                        is locked! And Saint... Nick.. 
                        Has... Cookies. 

           From the basement stairs, Harper flashes back a “what’s the 
           deal” look at Sasha.

           Sasha points to the wine in her hand.
                                 SASHA (CONT’D)
                           (whispering)
                        I’m a little drunk.

           Harper nods. Makes sense. 

           Sasha closes the basement door behind her, and races to the 
           front door.

           EXT. MERCER HOUSEHOLD - FRONT DOOR

           In the BG, Santa and the now untangled reindeer await Tom and 
           Leah, who are saying farewell to Sasha.

                                 LEAH
                        If they ask, just say we’re helping 
                        Becky look for Daniel. No mentions 
                        of Anta-Say Aus-Clay.

                                 SASHA
                        What?

                                 LEAH
                        Santa Claus. Just-- Remember the 
                        rules. 

                                 TOM
                           (dragging Leah away)
                        She’s got it under control. 

           Tom and Leah start toward the sleigh--

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Hang on.

           He darts quickly back into the house-- returning with a 
           ZIPLOCK BAG of broken pot cookies.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        For the road.

           Sasha smiles. Leah doesn’t. 

           INT. SANTA'S SLEIGH - SCARSDALE STREET

                                 LEAH
                        Ok, Santa. Let’s get to sleighing.

           Santa is now truly Willie Nelson high. 
                                 SANTA
                        Just chillllll, guys. Hey Tom, toss 
                        me one of those.

           Tom reaches for a cookie. Leah lowers his hand. Scolds him 
           with her eyes: “You should know better.”

                                 SANTA (CONT’D)
                        Don’t be a buzz kill, Leah. I’m 
                        soooo hungry. 

           Leah deploys years of parenting experience.

                                 LEAH
                        Ok, Santa. I’ll tell you what. You 
                        finish allllll of Scarsdale, and 
                        you can have a cookie. Deal?

                                 SANTA
                        Deal! 

           Santa rapid-slurs:

                                 SANTA (CONT’D)
                        Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, 
                        Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen, 
                        Rudolph!!!!

           And they are off. 

           Christmas in 2019 works a little differently then you may 
           have previously imagined. Remember that drone from the 
           Mercer’s kitchen? Well that’s the magical system which 
           delivers presents in our day and age.

           So, Santa’s sleigh hovers high above the Scarsdale suburbs. 

           In the sleigh, Santa removes a glove. He presses his index 
           finger onto the iPad. SCANNED.

           The app display is replaced by a SPEEDOMETER, ALTIMETER, ETC.

           Tom and Leah share a look. Then the sleigh RATTLES. 

           A hatch in the front glides open. SANTA’S SACK O’ PRESENTS is 
           inside. Beat.

           From within it, HUNDREDS of those red and green DRONES 
           scatter into the night. Each hauling various wrapped gifts.

                                 TOM
                        I was wondering...

           Santa turns to Leah.
                                 SANTA
                        Alrighty. Now about that cookie. 

           He licks his lips. The DRONES return hauling cookies from all 
           the neighborhood homes.

                                 LEAH
                        Plenty of cookies now.

                                 SANTA
                        Not those. Yours. 

           Leah shrugs. A promise is a promise. She hands him his 
           reward. A tiny piece.

                                 TOM
                        Come on, the man deserves more than 
                        that! A real piece!

           When her back is turned, Tom gives Santa a WHOLE cookie.

           Tom then fiddles with the interactive MAP on the sleigh’s 
           iPad. ALBANY is lit up. Clearly the next stop.

                                 SANTA
                        That was pretty good. But you know, 
                        it didn’t hit the spot. What I 
                        really want is...

                         TOM
                                                 SANTA (CONT'D)
           Looks like Albany’s next...
                                          A CUBANO!

           And with that-- the sleigh ROCKETS at warp speed into the 
           atmosphere. Drones trail behind, trying to catch up. 

                                 SANTA (CONT’D)
                        MIAMI BITCHES!!!!

           Tom and Leah share an uneasy look.

                                 TOM
                           (softly)
                        But, Albany. Those boys and girls 
                        are gonna be so sad.

                                 SANTA
                        Screw Albany.

           INT. SANTA'S WORKSHOP - WAR ROOM

           Estelle and the other elves drink cocoa. The MAP shows Santa 
           has just taken a sharp turn south. Completely skipping the 
           rest of the North East. 
           Estelle does a cocoa SPIT TAKE.

                                 ESTELLE
                        No. No. No no no. Not again.

           She covertly nods to another ELF-- DO IT.

           He CRANKS a Jack-in-the-Box that emerges from within his 
           console. After some tense jangly music, the Jack POPS- 
           sounding an alarm.

           Moments later, ELF TEAM 6 lock steps into the war room. They 
           are basically Jason Bourne elves-- Kevlar, night vision 
           goggles, and well-trained in Krav Maga. Not a smile among 
           them. Their leader SCULLY (the sternest of them all) steps 
           forward.  

                                 SCULLY
                        Reporting.

                                 ESTELLE
                        Men, we’ve got a problem. By our 
                        computations, Big Red’s last scan 
                        and known drop was Scarsdale, NY. 
                        We believe the Mercer family may 
                        have compromised the sleigh which 
                        is headed south at 2000 klicks per 
                        hour. I want two teams. I’ll be 
                        leading A team to Scarsdale. 
                        Scully, you take B team and 
                        retrieve the Swoose Goose.

           Beat.

                                 ESTELLE (CONT’D)
                        Ugh, what a dumb fuckin’ name. 

                                 SCULLY
                        Affirmative. B team. Wheels up in 

                                 ESTELLE
                        We don’t need wheels where we’re 
                        going.

           Estelle looks to the WALL opposite the MAP.

           SEVEN GIANT STOCKINGS. Each with a placard above indicating a 
           continent. Her eyes narrow in on NORTH AMERICA.

                                                           CUT TO:
           EXT. MERCER HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT

           Above the Mercer’s home, in a sky filled with stars, appears 
           a BRAND NEW ONE. Brighter than the rest. And tinted a slight 
           EVERGREEN.

           INT. MERCER HOUSEHOLD - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Much smaller stockings are hung by the chimney with care. We 
           hold on them.

           Then--

           The top of ESTELLE’S HEAD POPS out from a stocking. Then two 
           others on either side. Peeking above the fur trim. 

           ALL THREE. They slip down NIGHT VISION GOGGLES. 

           POV: Night vision: Harper’s room - EMPTY.

           POV: Night vision: Lily’s room - EMPTY.

           POV: Night vision: Tom and Leah’s room - EMPTY.

           The elves exchange tactical hand signals.

           One ELF runs up to Estelle with a stern look on his face. 

           ANGLE ON HIS FIST.

           The fingers WHIP open to reveal--!

           COOKIE CRUMBS. 

           Estelle sniffs it. Shakes her head. 

                                 ESTELLE
                        Mrs. Claus isn’t gonna be happy.

           SANTA, in slo-mo, strides out of a TOURIST KIOSK as SEXY AND 
           I KNOW IT by LMFAO plays from a nearby rooftop club.

           He’s gone full MIAMI. Tommy Bahama shorts. Pink neon plastic 
           wayfarers with FLASHING LED lights shaped like PALM TREES. 
           He’s sipping on a PINA COLADA from a PLASTIC CUP with a Krazy 
           Straw. And his shirt proudly reads, in blinding rainbow:

           I’M IN MIAMI, BITCH!
           He definitely is. On Collins Ave, no less. Art deco and neon 
           war with the tremendous displays of Christmas lights. Also 
           behind him: a hard put Leah. Tom shrugs.

                                 TOM
                           (silver lining)
                        At least he blends in. 

                                 LEAH
                        Yeah, but does that?

           She points to the SLEIGH and REINDEER hovering above. All now 
           don the same WAYFARERS. 

           Santa pulls on a Cohiba and--

                                 SANTA
                        Now who wants a FUCKIN’ Cubano?

           INT. MERCER HOUSEHOLD - KITCHEN

           Estelle and her team are finishing a forensic examination on 
           the kitchen- complete with a test tube for the cookie crumbs 
           and evidence baggies filled with Santa’s candy canes.

           Buck races in from outside. He holds a baggie filled with 
           reindeer shit. 

                                 BUCK
                        Ma’am. It’s Blitzen’s. I can tell 
                        from the...

           INT. NIGHTCLUB - MIAMI - NIGHT

           Scully and his team pop out of Christmas stockings. Their 
           eyes go wide when they realize they are not in someone’s 
           home, but rather a VERY LOUD NIGHT CLUB.

           Strobe lights. Bass thumping. Snow machines. And a lot of 
           drunk people with nothing better to do on Christmas eve. 

           Scantily clad women stumble in heels- one SLOSHES a drink 
           into a stocking, nearly drowning Scully. 

           He spits it out. Taps his COMM.

                                 SCULLY

                        gone terribly wrong. 

           He eyes the club’s BARTENDERS. They are LITTLE PEOPLE dressed 
           as ELVES. They carry trays of booze-- nearly getting 
           trampled.

           EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - SOUTH BEACH - NIGHT

           Midnight surf washes onto the bare feet of--

           SANTA. He’s still wearing his Miami get-up, but now in 
           addition to his drink and cigar, he is also cradling a CUBANO 
           sandwich. Inhaling it. 

           Tom is also enjoying a sandwich. Leah still hasn’t fully 
           embraced this weirdness. She has a bottle of water. 

                                 SANTA
                           (mouth full)
                        It’s got ham AND pork. What IS the 
                        difference between pork and ham 
                        anyway? Is it the cut? What part of 
                        the animal? Should I be a 
                        vegetarian? Vegan? Paleo? 
                        Ayurvedic? Goop?

           He shoots back a look at Tom and Leah.

                                 SANTA (CONT’D)
                        That’s right. We have wifi at the 
                        North Pole. Gwyneth is my guru.

                        I mean not the Jade eggs. But like, 
                        her recipes are really good.

                                 LEAH
                        Wait, the North Pole. Does that 
                        mean there are like, elves? Staff? 
                        People we can reach out to for

                           (more frenzied)
                        The elves were a lie told by the 
                        Church because no one wants to 
                        believe in miracles other than 
                        Jesus. Feed a crowd with a single 
                        fish - cool. But deliver every kid 
                        on the planet a gift in a single 
                        night.
                           (looks to the sky)
                        Do that one, Joshua!

                                 LEAH
                        Alright. Well, if we want to hit 
                        Samoa by sunrise, we need to get a 
                        move on. No more “but I haven’t 
                        felt the Atlantic in 30,000 years.”

           Santa looks back at the city. Over the strip he sees a 
           familiar EVERGREEN STAR POP into the sky. 

           And where there’s that star, ELVES are sure to follow-

                                 SANTA
                           (covering again)
                        Ok, yeah yeah. You’re right. Uh, we 
                        should get going. Let’s light this 
                        candle.

           But Santa instead takes another ANNOYINGLY LONG drink out of 
           his Colada. Like really long. Then SLURPING.

           Beat. BELCH. Off they go--

           INT. MERCER HOUSEHOLD - BASEMENT

           Sasha, Lily and Harper are assembled for their sleepover. 
           Blankets and hot cocoa abound. 

                                 HARPER
                        And he says that I’m his 
                        “Shingleback Skink” which at first 
                        I thought was like, some sort of 
                        insult. But it turns out it’s 
                        actually this lizard that mates for 
                        life. So, does that mean it’s real?

           Beat.

                                 SASHA
                        Wait, just back up for a sec. Is 
                        his REAL name Hawk?
                                 LILY
                        NO. He just wants everyone to THINK 
                        it is. His real name is HAROLD. He 
                        just wants to be different like 
                        everyone else. 

           Lily is lost in her Cocoa. No longer the center of attention, 
           Skittles has started sniffing around the basement. 

                                 SASHA
                        Ok, ok. Harold, Hawk-- he sounds 
                        like he really cares about you. 

                                 LILY
                        Not as much as he likes MARY JANE. 
                        I hear him talking about her all 
                        the time. Harper, no offense but 
                        it’s kind of stupid that you 
                        haven’t noticed yet.

                        Okay then... time for bed. Or else 
                        Santa won’t come!

                                 LILY
                        I’m so sick of everyone talking 
                        about Santa. Like hi, I know he’s 
                        not real and that mom and dad buy 
                        our presents.

           An ELF HAND reaches for the knob.

           Now out of the stockings, Scully and his team make their way

                                 SASHA (CONT’D)
                        Everyone calm down. We’ll find him.

                                 LILY
                        HER!

           Harper spies a window-- cracked open wide enough for a cat to 
           slip out.

                                 HARPER
                           (to Sasha)
                        Psst.

           Sasha looks-- sees the open window.

                                 SASHA
                        Who wants to go on an adventure?!

           Off her uneasy smile we cut to--

                                                            BLACK

           We stay in the BLACK. 

           The sounds of a SWEET ANIMAL SNORING. Little snorts and 
           purrs. Skittles?

           The SCRAPE of a match FLARES.

           It’s lit by ESTELLE. Who, now that we can see her, looks VERY 
           NERVOUS. Not Skittles.

           She creeps into an even darker place. It’s some sort of--

           INT. CAVE - NIGHT

           The snoring grows LOUDER.

           Estelle creeps closer. Suspense building. Then her COMM 
           crackles. 

           INT. NIGHTCLUB - MIAMI 

           Scully is DRAGGED through the club by the Manager.

           He’s disheveled by the end of his ride to--
           INT. NIGHTCLUB - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

                                 MANAGER
                        You know, I’m no discriminator, 
                        okay. I don’t judge people by their 
                        color, age, or height. You know 
                        what I do judge them on?

           Scully stares blankly.

                                 MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        Work ethic. 

                                 SCULLY
                        Excuse me?

                                 MANAGER
                        I saw you out there on the patio- 
                        flirting. You think this is some 
                        joke, kid?

           Just outside the kitchen door, BINOCULARS spies this 
           interaction. 

                                 BINOCULARS
                           (whispering, into COMM)
                        We’ve got a problem.

           The Manager shoves a tray at Scully.

                                 MANAGER
                        Get your ass back out there. And 
                        bring the jolly.

           Scully is shoved out of the kitchen and promptly DUMPS the 
           tray on the ground. Pissed. But before he can rejoin his 
           team, he is SCOOPED up by a drunk MODEL. 

           She and her MODEL friends ooo and aww over how ADORABLE 
           Scully is. INSTAGRAMMING him. Scully is not happy.

                                 BLONDE MODEL
                        OMG. I luvvvvv himmm.

           INT. CAVE - CONTINUOUS

                                 ESTELLE
                           (whispering, into COMM)
                        I’m a little busy.

           Without waiting for a response, Estelle TURNS OFF her Comm. 
           But it’s too late.
           The sweet snoring turns to an ANGRY GROWL. 

           A muscular and furry MASS shifts in the dark.

           INT. NIGHTCLUB - MIAMI

           All hell is breaking loose, as Scully is bounced between 
           TWERKING ASSES. His COMM flies off.

           Binoculars is tapping on his COMM.

                                 BINOCULARS
                           (yelling)
                        Hello?! Hello?! This fucking 
                        thing...

           Binoculars rips it out of his ear. Reads the LABEL: MADE 
           PROUDLY IN SANTA’S WORKSHOP.

           He throws it to the ground.

                                 BINOCULARS (CONT’D)
                        Piece of crap!

           Binoculars does a NECK CRACK. He’s gonna have to do this on 
           his own.

           EXT. NIGHT SKY 

           Santa’s sleigh hovers over an extremely WEALTHY ISLAND off 
           the coast of Miami. Palatial mansions have plenty of 
           breathing room here. 

           From the sleigh, the DRONES release. We watch as they 
           descend, delivering their joyful payloads.

           Beat. Then a loud BOOM of a SHOTGUN. 

           ECU: A DRONE EXPLODES and twirls to its demise on a manicured 
           LAWN. 

           INT. SLEIGH - CONTINUOUS

           Santa looks very worried. He throws the Sleigh into NEUTRAL. 

                                 SANTA
                        Brb.

           He lifts out of his seat. Freezes.
                                 SANTA (CONT’D)
                        If you see a green star-- actually, 
                        nevermind.

                                 TOM
                        Where are you going??

           Santa does a few AGILITY STRETCHES.

                                 SANTA
                        One of my boys went down. 

           Santa THROWS on his FAMOUS RED COAT over the “I’m in Miami 
           Bitch” tank he still dons. 

                                 SANTA (CONT’D)
                        Gonna have to do this one the old 
                        fashioned way. 

           And with that, he’s GONE!

           Tom and Leah press their faces against the glass window.

           Tom and Leah POV: SANTA. He soars through the night. Halo 
           jumping like Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible: Fall Out.

           Soon he’s just a red dot on a massive rooftop. 

           INT. MIAMI MANSION - NIGHT

           Holy Scarface, Batman - everything in here is lacquered, 
           glossy and white. White marble meets white rugs meet white 
           walls meet white paintings. 

           But there in the middle is a big Red man. 

           He pats his pockets. Oh shit! No presents. 

           He stares out a massive floor-to-ceiling window: there, just 
           outside, is the busted drone with a few presents scattered 
           nearby. 

           EXT. MIAMI MANSION - NIGHT

           From the shadows, Santa pops his head. Looks clear.

           But we see what he’s doesn’t: two burly and well-armed 
           security guards pacing the perimeter.

           Santa’s off, rushing across the lawn --

           He’s got a present in one hand, reaching for the second. 
           But he freezes when he hears the blood-thirsty SNARL of a 
           rapidly-approaching GUARD DOG--

           It’s inches away. He swipes the second gift and books it back 
           to the house.

           BIRDSEYE POV: A dot of red is chased by a vicious dog. 

           INT. SLEIGH - CONTINUOUS

                                 LEAH
                           (looking down)
                        He’s got this, right?

                                 TOM
                        Yeah, plenty of people have dogs. 
                        It’s like mailmen. Part of the job, 
                        right?

                                 LEAH
                        Yeah, totally. 

           INT. MIAMI MANSION - NIGHT

           In that same room, we look out the window. It must be sound-
           proof because it’s silent but we see:

           -Santa splat against the window like an ACME cartoon.

           -Santa dodging back and forth, dog at his heels.

           -The dog satisfied, rips into Santa’s coat.

           Santa strolls calmly, sans coat, back across the glass.

           Moments later, he’s with us, kneeling by a white-tinsel, 
           white-globed, white-light, white Christmas tree.

           He shakes off the dirt and re-bends a toy back into shape. 
           Places them delicately just as--

           In his periphery, his eye snags a perfect WHITE MOUND of what 
           you can only imagine is grade-A Columbian marching powder. 

           It’s like the softest snow Santa’s ever seen.

           His nose overrides his sense of duty - he haphazardly tosses 
           the presents behind him and beelines for the coke. 

           Through the window behind him, again we see what he’s 
           missing: a guard approaches the dog. Picks up the red coat. 
           Looks around. 
           Somehow within seconds, Santa has scraped the drugs into a 
           PERFECTLY SYMMETRICAL SNOWFLAKE. He’s an artist. 

           And within moments, he’s a VERY HIGH artist. 

           So high and so artistic, he doesn’t notice on the landing 
           above: 

           IN WHITE DESIGNER LINGERIE AND A FLOWING WHITE SILK ROBE: a 
           Goddess of the Underworld-- CRISTINA.

           She towers in her furry white kitten heels. 

                                 CRISTINA
                        What the fuck is this?

           Santa, nose fully white, turns his head just as the guards 
           and more dogs flood in, blocking all exits.

                                 SANTA
                        I know what this looks like. But 
                        here’s the thing. I’m Santa. 
                           (beat)
                        Papa Noel?

           He puts his hands up. 

                                 SANTA (CONT’D)
                        Now that I’m looking around, I 
                        don’t know how Jaime or Elena got 
                        on the nice list. 

                                 CRISTINA
                           (furious)
                        You stalk my family? Who are you - 
                        with the Zetas?
                           (to guards)
                        Get him now.

           The guards approach, guns cocked, cornering Santa. The tree 
           at his back.

                                 SANTA
                           (to self)
                        Oh -- this is some Sicario 
                        bullshit.

           Miraculously, he snatches his coat from the nearest guard, 
           reaches behind and squirrel-scales the Christmas tree, 
           launching off the Jesus at the top--

           And onto the landing beside her. 
                                 SANTA (CONT’D)
                           (doubletakes her shoes)
                        Christmas ‘85, right?

           She’s caught off-guard: who is this -- as she clocks her 
           shoes.

           Looking back up, he’s vanished.

           EXT. MIAMI MANSION - LOWER ROOF - NIGHT

           Twenty feet of custom glass that serves as a gorgeous sliding 
           door. 

           Over the Sex Pistols rendition of JINGLE BELLS, and in slow 
           motion, CRASH --

           Santa hurls through the window, somehow sticking his landing.

           He looks up to see-

           The SLEIGH awaiting. Tom and Leah are standing just outside 
           of it, in mid-debate.

                         SANTA
                (yelling)
           Good thinking, guys!
                                                      TOM
                                          ...think he knows what he’s 
                                          do--

           All their eyes meet.

                                 SANTA
                        Blitzen. Vixen. Comet--

           The reindeer all start to paw the roof. It’s on again.

           He continues naming names as he charges toward the sleigh.

                                 SANTA (CONT’D)
                           (slo-mo voice)
                        Get in the fu--

           He eats total shit, his belly slamming into the roof.

           POOOOOOF

           A growing cloud of white powder billows from his dog-torn 
           coat. 

                                 LEAH
                        Is that cocaine--

           Guards and dogs start to assemble. 
           Tom grabs Santa and they all tumble into the sleigh, just 
           escaping. 

           Barely in the air, bullets whiz past the careening sleigh.

                                 SANTA
                           (warp speed)
                        You guys wouldn’t believe. They had 
                        a white tree. I always wonder about 
                        white trees. Do they paint em 
                        white? Are they grown? Are they 
                        plastic? Or some sort of 
                        polycarbonate? I mean white tree 
                        right. Game of Thrones? You guys 
                        watch it? Want to know my favorite 
                        episode...

           Tom leans over to Leah.

                                 TOM
                           (re: if it was cocaine)
                        Yeah. 

           INT. CAVE - NIGHT

           The large furry creature from before is now fully lit by a 
           lantern.

           ECU: A pair of SHAKING PAWS grip a mug of HOT COFFEE. The fur 
           on these paws isn’t real, it’s not CG, it’s synthetic costume 
           fur. He speaks with a THICK NEW YORK ACCENT. 

                                 EASTER BUNNY (O.C.)
                        What could be so important...

           On her tinsel-trimmed iPad, Estelle timidly summons CCTV 
           footage of Santa in Miami, CLEARLY FUCKED UP-- 

           - Stealing that CUBANO from a food truck.

           - Dropping an ALLIGATOR down a CHIMNEY.

           - Harassing a MALL SANTA.

           - Openly brandishing a bottle of JACK DANIELS as he stumbles 
           down the street.

           The Easter Bunny has been watching this with his head still 
           down. He FLINGS the iPad across the cave. It lands, screen 
           CRACKED.

           Estelle flashes a “what gives” face. 
           His head slowly rises and we see his FACE for the first time.

           This bunny is no bullshit, even if he IS wearing a full on 
           BUNNY COSTUME- think Chandler in Friends. 

           Around his neck hangs a black SLEEPING EYE MASK with letters 
           that read: “FUCK OFF.”

                                 EASTER BUNNY (CONT’D)
                        Christmas is gefickt. 

           He LIGHTS UP a CAMEL CIGARETTE.

                                 EASTER BUNNY (CONT’D)
                        When this guy gets high, he’s 
                        useless. 

           EXT. TRAILER PARK - ARKANSAS - NIGHT

           Actually, not at all. That cocaine has Santa working 
           MIRACLES. 

           The sleigh hovers over a bevy of trailers, each strung with 
           Christmas lights.

           The drones descend onto one section, but Santa’s doubling his 
           efficiency by handling the neighboring town at the same time.

           Through a combination of parkour, jump shots and Cirque du 
           Soleil acrobatics, Santa is getting it DONE. 

           INT. SLEIGH - CONTINUOUS

           Tom and Leah marvel at the sleigh’s dash-- it is a MAP of the 
           United States. Each state is either lit up (still to be done) 
           or dark (completed). The entire Northeast is DARK and the 
           southeast is RAPIDLY becoming that way. 

                                 LEAH
                        This just might work. 

           Like a COWBOY, Santa RIDES up to the sleigh on a flying 
           BLITZEN. Swoops past Tom and Leah for a HIGH FIVE. 

                                 SANTA
                           (southern accent)
                        Get ‘er dun!

           Santa zips off like a falling star.

                                 TOM
                        What happens when Santa comes down?
                                 LEAH
                        Hopefully not another plague. 

                                 SANTA
                        Done!

           Whoa-- Santa is already back in the sleigh.

                                 SANTA (CONT’D)
                        Crash? This thing has sensor-
                        assist. Can’t crash. You guys, at 
                        this rate, I may even beat my all 
                        time record. 1918.

                                 TOM
                        What happened then?

                                 SANTA
                        Spanish Flu.

           Santa suddenly looks really sad.

                                 SANTA (CONT’D)
                        Killed off a hundred million 
                        people. So... less presents to 
                        deliver. 

           Leah starts clapping her hands to shake him out of it.

                                 LEAH
                           (hyping up the energy)
                        Good vibes, good vibes. Where to 
                        next?

                                 SANTA
                        I think it’s time we put a bow on 
                        the States. I’m feeling a little 
                        international...

           INT. SANTA'S WORKSHOP - WAR ROOM

           Easter Bunny, Estelle and the rest of her team stare at the 
           world map. There are now several hazard lights dotting the 
           US. Some flashing yellow, some blinking red-- various alarms 
           sound. 
                                 ESTELLE
                           (to the room)
                        We’ve got misdelivered presents in 
                        Sector A, children who need memory 
                        wipes in Sector B, literal fires to 
                        put out in --well, multiple places-- 
                        and most importantly, we need an 
                        extraction of Scully and his team 
                        from that hellhole in Miami. 

           Elves begin to scatter into various stockings, off to save 
           the holiday. 

           Easter Bunny stares into the middle-distance, trying to wrap 
           his head around a problem that’s only getting bigger.

                                 EASTER BUNNY
                           (to Estelle)
                        How did this happen? He’s been 
                        sober 680 years. Everything ok with 
                        the missus? 

                                 MRS. CLAUS (O.C.)
                        No. It’s not. 

           They all spin around and we see:

           MRS. CLAUS. White hair in braids. Red dress. Pissed off. 

                                 EASTER BUNNY
                        Mrs. Claus! Didn’t see you there.

                                 MRS. CLAUS
                        Clearly.

                                 EASTER BUNNY
                        So this was all caused by some sort 
                        of fight? 

                                 MRS. CLAUS
                           (mocking, sniveling voice)
                        “So this was all caused by some 
                        sort of--” No! You think this is my 
                        first rodeo, Bugs? 

           Easter grimaces at the nickname, clearly not a fan.

                                 MRS. CLAUS (CONT’D)
                        Things were great when he left. 
                        Gave him his Christmas Eve massage--

                                 EASTER BUNNY
                        Ok, I don’t need any more details.
                                 MRS. CLAUS
                        But that man made a promise to me 
                        680 years ago. To be sober. He 
                        carried the weight of the world on 
                        his shoulders - he never took care 
                        of himself. So he had to lose 
                        himself in booze. And pills. And 
                        heroin. And ayahuasca. And cloves. 
                        I thought he’d figured it all out. 
                        But, no, tonight he broke that 
                        promise. So, no. Everything’s 
                        definitely NOT okay.

           A tiny hand tugs on her dress. Mrs. Claus looks down.

           It’s Buck, the elf we met earlier. 

                                 BUCK
                        ‘Scuse me, ma’am. He may have 
                        broken that promise, but I don’t 
                        think he meant to...

           Mrs. Claus assesses Buck.

                                 MRS. CLAUS
                        Oh get your head out of Kris’ ass, 
                        Buck. Covering him won’t get you a 
                        raise.

                                 ESTELLE
                        Ma’am- he’s new. Doesn’t know his 
                        place yet.

           Mrs. Claus turns to her, readying a venomous volley.

                                 EASTER BUNNY
                           (cutting in)
                        Whoa, whoa, whoa. Everybody take 
                        one in. 
                           (beat while breathing)
                        Alright, let’s hear what the little 
                        guy has to say.

           All the elves look at the Bunny with a “screw you” glance.

           As Buck speaks, the screen behind him displays a CSI-like 
           analysis of the cookie, the location, etc.

                                 BUCK
                           (shivering)
                        Ok. We found distinct traces of THC 
                        in the cookies left at the 
                        Scarsdale location. 
           On screen, the cookie: beside it are all the component 
           chemical formulas present within. THC is at 99%

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        From initial testing, we believe 
                        the sample to be of Haitian origin. 
                        Highly potent. Traditionally used 
                        in shamanic trance.

           He’s nerding out. A blank stare from Mrs. Claus--

           He chills, finally reading the room.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        The man was simply doing his job, 
                        delivering presents and eating 
                        cookies, when BAM! he was dosed. 
                        You remember the Mercers?

           They all nod knowingly. 

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        I suspect they are at the root of 
                        this. Not only have they gotten Big 
                        Red FUCKED out of his mind, but 
                        they also commandeered the Swoose 
                        Goose and are taking him on a drug-
                        fueled boondoggle across hell’s 
                        half acre.

                                 EASTER BUNNY
                           (disgusted)
                        Filthy animals. 

           EXT. NIGHTCLUB - MIAMI - NIGHT

           Buck and the rest of Estelle’s extraction team peer in 
           through the WINDOWS.

           POV: Inside, Scully, Binoculars and the rest of his team are 
           ALL carrying drink trays. Clearly loosing this battle. 

           INT. NIGHTCLUB - MIAMI - CONTINUOUS

           A BODY BUILDING DOUCHE slams a glass on Binoculars’ tray. The 
           force topples him, shot glasses SMASHING on the floor.

                                 DOUCHE
                        C’mon, Leprechaun. Show me that pot 
                        of gold. 
           EXT. NIGHTCLUB - MIAMI

           Estelle covers the eyes of one of her extraction team.

                                 ESTELLE
                        Don’t look. 

           PISSED, Buck rolls a SMOKE CANISTER in through the window. 

           Seconds later, the entire club is filled with fog.

           INT. NIGHTCLUB - MIAMI

           Models, douches and sad people all race OUTSIDE.

           Buck and his team hoist their enslaved waiter compadres and 
           fire-carry them through the fog.

           EXT. NIGHTCLUB - MIAMI

           Clubgoers continue to cough in the street. Rolling around, 
           thongs a-gleaming.

           Bad Boys style, Estelle, Scully, Buck, Binoculars and the 
           rest slo-mo stroll away from the club. When--

           BOOM!!!

           It goes up in flames. Nobody looks back.

           Scully hit his new COMM. Slams a lone shot.

                                 SCULLY
                        Get me Zuck. We need a favor.

           INT. MARK ZUCKERBERG’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           A sleepy Zuck answers his cell. Ok - we cop that we might not 
           get Zuckerberg to be in this film, but maybe Eisenberg is 
           available? Zit cream dots his face.

                                 ZUCK
                        I can’t do that. Controlling the 
                        user’s content goes against 
                        everything I, Facebook, and 
                        Instagram stand for. 

                                 SCULLY
                        We’ll give you the drone contract 
                        next year.
                                 ZUCK
                        But Bezos--

                                 SCULLY
                        Fuck Bezos.

                                 ZUCK
                        Fine. 

           EXT. NIGHTCLUB - MIAMI

           The burnt husk of the club fades into the far distance now.

                                 SCULLY
                        Let’s go get our man. 

           The team looks at their iPad MAP.

                                 BINOCULARS
                        Nearest extraction point--

           On the iPad a green tactical outline of a CHRISTMAS STOCKING 
           POPS UP--

                                 BINOCULARS (CONT’D)
                        --Two blocks due east. 

           They slip down their night vision goggles and head off. 

           EXT. SCARSDALE STREET - NIGHT

           Bundled in winter wear, Sasha and the girls wave flashlights, 
           searching for the lost cat. 

           Unbeknownst to all, Daniel swoops overhead. 

           A “LEAH’S A BITCH” echoes in the night.

                                 HARPER
                        So tell us more about the time you 
                        married a Rockefeller. 

                                 SASHA
                        No. In fact, let’s not tell your 
                        mom I shared any of that with you 
                        guys. Especially the part about 
                        Elon’s yacht. 
                           (change)
                        You know, you guys should spend 
                        more time communing with nature. 
                        The trees. The wind. The moon. 
           Sasha takes another swig from her trusty wine. 

                                 SASHA (CONT’D)
                        I mean, maybe you do, but it can 
                        never be too much.

                                 LILY
                        Do you live in a tent, Aunt Sasha?

                                 SASHA
                        At times.

                                 HARPER
                        See, that’s cool. Why can’t Mom be 
                        a little bit more like you? Was she 
                        ever cool? She’s such a hardass 
                        now.

                                 SASHA
                        Harper-- your mom is not a hardass. 
                        Well, actually I have no idea if 
                        she is. But, she’s worked that hard 
                        ass off to give you all a good life 
                        - including a rare Bengal cat - 
                           (daggers at Lily)
                        so-- cut her some slack.

                                 HARPER
                        I just don’t get it. How did you 
                        guys end up so different?

           Sasha thinks for a moment.

                                 SASHA
                        Well how did you two end up so 
                        different?

           Harper is at a loss. Sasha looks at Lily.

                                 SASHA (CONT’D)
                        Honestly, I don’t even know that 
                        much about you, Lily. The last time 
                        I met you, you were still in 
                        diapers. I can see you grew out of 
                        those. So, Ms. Fancy Pants, tell me 
                        about Lily.

           Lily stops, staring up at Sasha. Shines her light directly in 
           Sasha’s eyes. 

                                 LILY
                        Well, first of all, I have a 
                        missing cat. 
                                 SASHA
                        I’m hearing a lot of negativity 
                        right now. Where’s that coming 
                        from?

           Lily looks at the ground, shut down. 

           Harper leans in. 

                                 LILY
                        I just realized that if I wanted to 
                        be heard, I had to be loud. 
                           (beat, admission to self)
                        And I never wanted to get picked on 
                        again.

                                 HARPER
                        Again, Lil?

                                 LILY
                        It’s whatever. Some kids were mean 
                        to me last year. So I did what I 
                        had to do to fit in. 

                                 HARPER
                        Why didn’t you come to me?

                                 LILY
                        You were busy and happy with drum 
                        circles and whatever a “Skink bike” 
                        is--

                                 HARPER
                           (quick to her own defense)
                        It’s a bike Hawk is making for 
                        Burning Man! It’s a lizard bike!

                                 SASHA
                        Oh cool! You guys are doing Burning 
                        Ma-- wait, no. 

           She refocuses. 

                                 SASHA (CONT’D)
                        Lily, the deepest people I’ve ever 
                        met were the outsiders. There’s 
                        power in that. Don’t discount who 
                        you are just because it’s not 
                        “cool”. If this isn’t who you are, 
                        then don’t be this person. 

           Sasha gives Harper a look as to say “this is for you too.”
                                 SASHA (CONT’D)
                        Honestly, nobody is happy growing 
                        up. And the people who you think 
                        ARE- are probably the most deeply 
                        fuc-- unhappy ones of all. 

                                 LILY
                        That doesn’t make me feel better 
                        really.
                           (Beat)
                        I only wanted the Bengal because 
                        Jackie got one. 

                                 SASHA
                        Well, Jackie’s probably got ADHD 
                        and a broken home. You’ve got two 
                        amazing parents and a sister and 
                           (she smiles)
                        An aunt -- who all love you very 
                        much.

                                 LILY
                        Even if I’m not popular?

                                 SASHA
                        Being popular doesn’t matter. Take 
                        it from someone who was invited to 
                        Gigi Hadid’s llama’s quinceañera-- 
                        being “in” isn’t always fun.

                                 HARPER
                        How was that not fun?

                                 SASHA
                        The llama got food poisoning-- 
                        don’t ask for more details. It gets 
                        dark. Anyway-- the point is--

           She’s interrupted by a BENGAL SCREAMING out of a tree, 
           feathers fluttering down into the snow. 

                                 SASHA (CONT’D)
                        I think we found Skittles.

           Glances down at the bloody rainbow of feathers.

                                 SASHA (CONT’D)
                        And perhaps Daniel.

           A WOUNDED SQUAWK OF “STOP IT” trails into the distance.

           Beat.
                                 LILY
                        I think I’m done “communing with 
                        nature.”

           EXT. GLOBE

           Over a spinning globe a-la films from the 1920’s and with 
           CHUCK BERRY’S RUN RUDOLPH RUN at full blast, we punch-in on 
           Santa delivering gifts in Italy, England, Japan, Australia, 
           Madagascar – it’s a whirlwind.

           On their tail, not far behind is ELF TEAM 6.

           We swoop down on--

           EXT. SLEIGH - OVER CAIRO EGYPT - NIGHT

           Santa is off delivering the last of the Coptic presents. Just 
           Tom and Leah in the sleigh. Then Tom spots in the distance--

           One of the last remaining Ancient Wonders of the World. 

           THE PYRAMIDS OF GIZA. Sandy bricks layered into perfect 
           points. Under a sky somehow even more ancient. 

                                 TOM
                        Leah! 

           He points at the pyramids. 

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        We NEED to take a photo. I mean, 
                        come on.

           Leah checks her watch. 

                                 LEAH
                        We already blew most of the night 
                        in Miami-- we’re still way behind 
                        schedule--

                                 TOM
                        It’s the pyramids!!

           He pulls out the crumpled bag of cookies- basically like 
           Dorito dust now.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        A little wonder-dust perhaps?

           Santa plops back into the driver’s seat. Licks a finger and 
           DIPS it into the bag.
                                 SANTA
                        Don’t mind if I do!

                                 LEAH
                        Have you been feeding him cookies? 

           Tom’s sheepish glance says everything.

                                 LEAH (CONT’D)
                        Typical. If it weren’t for me, I’d 
                        come home and find the girls 
                        missing, the house robbed and you 
                        baking fucking Christmas cookies in  
                        your underwear.

                                 TOM
                        I knew you didn’t want me to bake 
                        those cookies.

                                 LEAH
                        Because of your cookies, we’re in 
                        this mess.

           She takes a big breath- calming herself.

                                 LEAH (CONT’D)
                        Look-- I’m just starting to feel 
                        like myself again. Don’t need to go 
                        back down that road. Besides-- kids 
                        at home-- WITH SASHA. We gotta keep 
                        moving. Come on.

           Leah’s so busy being her type A self that she completely 
           misses Tom’s utter disappointment.

           He SNAPS a photo on his phone as the sleigh rockets off into 
           the night. 

           ANGLE ON THE PHONE

           The photo is just a sad blur. A lost moment.

           Even more sad, he dips a finger of wonder-dust.

           We PULL OUT from the sleigh. As it moves through the sky, it 
           looks just like a SHOOTING STAR. Sparkling in the night.

           We SLOWLY track down from that light-- miles of DARKNESS. 
           Then the soft fuzz of LIGHT POLLUTION enters the frame.

           Now, nearing the ground, a MANGER DISPLAY. There’s a quaint, 
           almost holy aura emanating from the scene. 
           Then upon closer inspection, we notice that two of the 
           animals - TWO DONKEYS - are HUMPING. One mounting the other. 

           Then the SNICKER of TWO TEENS laughing. We see them scatter 
           off into the distance. Clearly this was their doing. 

           We hold on the manger-- then disembodied, we continue to 
           TRACK DOWN--

           Deep into the earth.

           Layers of 

           -- DIRT --

           -- STONE --

           -- CAVEMAN & ALIEN SKELETONS --

           -- DINO FOSSILS --

           Then finally, we come to a--

           INT. HOLLOW SPACE - EASTER BUNNY’S TUNNEL - NIGHT

           It’s a TUNNEL lit by GREEN, PINK, YELLOW and BLUE lightbulbs 
           strung atop the narrow ceiling.

           Assembled in formation are ALL our elves: Estelle, Buck, 
           Scully, Binoculars and others. Giving them their marching 
           orders is--

                                 EASTER BUNNY
                        Back at headquarters, we assessed 
                        his trajectory. It’s grim. He’s all 
                        over the place. Europe one minute, 
                        Africa the next. Apparently he even 
                        delivered gifts to some PENGUINS--

           Estelle shakes her head.

                                 ESTELLE
                        Fucking penguins. Belly sliding 
                        rats.

           Buck starts to breath heavy. Claustrophobic. 

                                 EASTER BUNNY
                        At this point, our best bet is this 
                        underground system. I’ve been 
                        digging it for the last 9 
                        centuries. 
           Bunny pats the wall hard. 

                                 EASTER BUNNY (CONT’D)
                        Perfect. Well lit, efficient, and 
                        flawlessly constructed to withstand 
                        natural disasters. Those 
                        billionaires with their Doomsday 
                        Bunkers have nothing on this shit.

           Binoculars spins his finger-- wrap it up.

           Buck is now hyperventilating. 

                                 EASTER BUNNY (CONT’D)
                        Alright--

           Estelle consults her tinsel-trimmed IPAD.

                                 ESTELLE
                        He’s somewhere over the Atlantic. 
                        Bearing down on Argentina. 

           Easter Bunny has a knowing look. 

                                 EASTER BUNNY
                        He could never resist a--

           EXT. SLEIGH - ABOVE BUENOS AIRES - NIGHT

           ECU: a row of perfect teeth sinking into the flaky crust of

                                 SANTA
                        EMPANADA!

           Crumbs scatter from his mouth. At this point, his beard looks 
           like a sad buffet: residue from every food he’s eaten. Gravy 
           on his torn-up jacket, shell of an escargot peeking out of 
           his white chest hair and now EMPANADA beef spilling over his 
           Miami shirt. 

           He offers a bite to Tom who exaggeratedly chomps at the 
           pastry. Santa feeds him as Leah is busy launching drones. 

           Tight on SANTA- the joy from the empanada starts to fade. He 
           breathes heavy. Lets out a big BELCH. Then looks REALLY 
           UNHAPPY.

                                 SANTA (CONT’D)
                        I don’t feel so good.
                                 TOM
                           (still psyched)
                        What do you mean? This shit is 
                        delicious! 

                                 LEAH
                           (mocking)
                        Ohhh! Is someone’s DOPAMINE finally 
                        drained?? Serotonin depleted?? 

           Santa pays her no attention.

                                 SANTA
                        It’s like my skin is crawling and 
                        my stomach feels dirty. I feel 
                        dirty. It’s like... like all the 
                        Christmas Spirit in the world is 
                        gone.

                                 LEAH
                        Yup! Sounds like a come down.

                         SANTA
                                                      TOM
           Mrs. Claus...
                                          Leah, chill. Clearly he 
                                          doesn’t feel good. 

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Maybe some more wonder dust...

                                 LEAH
                        That’s his PROBLEM, Tom! He needs 
                        to get this out of his system! And 
                        if we want to finish by dawn, wake 
                        up back in our beds, and forget 
                        this nightmare, then we need to 
                        move!

                                 TOM
                        A mess?? A nightmare?? What are you 
                        talking about?? This has been one 
                        of the most amazing nights I’ve 
                        ever had! And I thought you were 
                        having it with me.

           In the BG, Santa is crying softly. Hunched into a ball. Torn 
           coat draped over him. 

                                 LEAH
                        Amazing? I’ve been babysitting BOTH 
                        of you all night! It’s not like 
                        we’re in COLLEGE anymore. 
                                 TOM
                        Yeah, you’re right. Because in 
                        college I fell in love with someone 
                        totally different. You were fun. 
                        Goofy. Curious. Now you’re just... 
                        LUMPY.

           Leah’s jaw drops.

                                 LEAH
                        Are you fucking kidding? I take 
                        care of this family- working- while 
                        you “chill at home with the kids” - 
                        who are LEARNING at school. So I 
                        don’t even know what that means. 

                                 TOM
                        I may not have a high powered 
                        career, but all you do is package 
                        the world and sell it to others. 
                        Like the world needs more iPod 
                        toilet paper docks. Shit while you 
                        sing. 
                           (clapping)
                        Great stuff, Leah. Real brilliant. 
                        You know what? No wonder they took 
                        the Christmas account away. 

                                 LEAH
                        Low blow, Tom.

                                 TOM
                        No, it’s true. You don’t get that 
                        it doesn’t matter what’s in the 
                        box. It matters who gave it to you. 
                        And we were given this incredible 
                        gift tonight – and you’re fucking 
                        it up.

                                 LEAH
                        Cool, Tom. I had my stoner epiphany 
                        phase, too, but glad you’re getting 
                        here now. Just remember, that 
                        doesn’t make you an expert in 
                        psychology, me or the fucking 
                        meaning of Christmas. Speaking of, 
                        all this Christmas ‘wisdom’ is 
                        coming from the man who demands 
                        gift receipts for every present. So 
                        very Christmas of you.

           Cricket. Cricket. 
           We pull out to see Santa now standing, just STARING at them. 
           He puts his hands up defensively and tip-toes backwards.

                                 SANTA
                        Awwwwkward. I’ll let you have a 
                        minute...

                                 LEAH
                        No, not awkward. Done. Santa, let’s 
                        put her down. I’m getting out.

                                 SANTA
                        This is so not Christmas, you guys. 
                        Not a cool yule.

                                 TOM
                        No, if she wants out. Let her out. 
                        She can walk back to Scarsdale.

                                 LEAH
                        OR I’ll just use MY money that I 
                        make at MY “high-powered” -- what 
                        was it? -- package the world and 
                        sell it to others -- CAREER? Yeah, 
                        I’ll use that money. 

                                 TOM
                        LET THE WOMAN OFF.

           Santa has the face of an Uber driver with a couple fighting 
           in the back seat.

                                 SANTA
                        Alright, alright...

           Santa puts the sleigh in gear and sets it down on the ROOF of 
           an apartment complex. 

           EXT. BUENOS AIRES - APARTMENT ROOFTOP - NIGHT

           Santa hops out of the sleigh and onto the roof. Does some 
           agility stretches. CRACKS his back.

                                 SANTA
                        I’ll give you guys some privacy. 

           Still in the sleigh, Tom and Leah stand off-- staring daggers 
           at each other. Finally Tom breaks.

                                 TOM
                        Ok, come on. This is stupid.

           Before Leah can respond, Santa starts YELLING--
                                 SANTA
                        INCOMINGGGGG!!

                                 LEAH
                        What the--

           Tom and Leah turn to see Santa SPRINTING to the edge of the 
           roof. As he runs, he (SLO MO, of course) removes his SANTA 
           JACKET (remember, the one the dog tore up). 

           Tom and Leah look to see what has Santa freaking the fuck 
           out. Of course, it’s:

           THE EASTER BUNNY

           With a team of elves in Kevlar. 

           They stand like the cast of Fast and Furious posing for a 
           promo shot. All attitude. Fur and hair blowing in the wind. 
           Ready to kick some ass. 

                                 TOM
                           (to Santa)
                        I thought there were no elves.

           But Santa hasn’t missed a beat.

                                 SANTA
                        On Dancer on Prancer on...

           He’s starting the engine. But he’s not getting onboard.

           Leah and Tom are off into the night sky. But below--

           He takes his Suit Jacket and wraps it over a utility line 
           leading to a lower ROOF.

           Santa LOOKS back at his pursuers and TOUCHES HIS NOSE. WINKS. 
           Signature Santa move.

                                 SCULLY
                        Did he just say what I THINK he 
                        just said? 

                                 ESTELLE
                        Yep, that son of a bitch flipped us 
                        the Arctic bird.

           With another wink, Santa ALIAS-SLIDES down the power line and 
           into the night. 

           Well, except that jacket has A LOT of holes in it. And with 
           the friction from the slide, it isn’t holding up well. 
           ECU: The fibers fray and snap.

           ECU: Santa looks worried.

           ECU: The fibers snap more.

           And then--

           RRRRRRIP

           The jacket finally gives way and he PLUMMETS into an open 
           dumpster.

                                 SANTA (O.C.)
                           (from the dumpster)
                        This was not my intention.

           HIGH ABOVE, Leah and Tom watch as the Bunny and Elves 
           apprehend Saint Nick. 

           Or almost - 

                                 TOM
                        I think he’s free--

           Santa jukes and is on the run, covered in foul trash. But not 
           for long. 

           His pants sink to his knees and the Bunny body-tackles him.

                                 TOM & LEAH
                           (canned reaction)
                        Oooohhhhh...

           ON THE STREET, the Easter Bunny looks his old friend dead in 
           the eye.

                                 EASTER BUNNY
                        It’s over, man. 

           Santa collapses into a hug.

                                 EASTER BUNNY (CONT’D)
                        I got you.
                           (to Estelle, re: the 
                           sleigh)
                        Bring it down.

           But the sleigh is long gone.

           EXT. NIGHT SKY - NIGHT

           The sleigh zips through heavenly climes. 
           INT. SLEIGH - NIGHT

           Tom and Leah sit in silence, avoiding the real conversation.

           Heavy beat.

                                 TOM
                           (throws hands up)
                        So how about that Seal Team of 
                        Elves?

                                 LEAH
                        I guess they came to rescue him? Or 
                        put him in jail? Definitely one of 
                        those two.

           A moment while they both let the guilt of abandoning a friend 
           sink in.

                                 TOM
                        I mean, he wasn’t doing so hot. 
                        It’s probably good that he gets 
                        some help.

                                 LEAH
                        Plus he was slowing us down anyway.

           He smiles at the acknowledgement of “us”.

                                 TOM 
                        You ready to do this, Leah? You 
                        ready to save Christmas with me?

                                 LEAH
                        Let’s just go. This is for the 
                        kids. Not you.

           INT. MERCER HOUSEHOLD - BASEMENT

           Back from their mission, the girls reassemble in the 
           basement. Skittles wrapped in a Pendleton blanket.

                                 SASHA
                        I’m sure Daniel’s fine. 
                           (diverting)
                        Hey Harper, pass me those cards.

           Harper hands Sasha the TAROT CARDS.

           After a quick shuffle, Sasha fans out the cards.

                                 SASHA (CONT’D)
                        Pick one.
           Harper draws a card-- It’s THE WORLD card. A woman holding 
           two wands inside a laurel wreath.

                                 SASHA (CONT’D)
                        This is a great card. The World. 
                        Completion, integration, 
                        accomplishment, travel. For you, I 
                        think this about coming to terms 
                        with where you come from. And where 
                        you’re going.

                                 HARPER
                        What do you mean?

                                 SASHA
                        Well, it’s about integrating those 
                        two things. So you’ve got your 
                        spirituality on lock, but you need 
                        to be true to the rest of it. You 
                        know, your drive to be great. Not 
                        just to have fun, but to accomplish 
                        something. Your mom is great at 
                        that. I think you should look to 
                        her for that strength. 

           Sasha realizes this is a message she could learn from as 
           well. 

                                 SASHA (CONT’D)
                        And, yes- your mom and I are REALLY 
                        different. But we’re always there 
                        for each other when it matters. 
                           (to both of them)
                        I know you guys will do the same 
                        for each other.

                                 LILY
                        You mean like, lend her my soap?

           Harper gives Lily a big hug.

           EXT. GLOBE - NIGHT

           The sleigh zips between the remaining countries and cities. 
           On the dash, lights go out in record time.

           INT. SLEIGH

           Tom and Leah are now a well-oiled machine. He’s flying, she’s 
           controlling the drones. 
           It’s a beautiful display of teamwork and patience. A skill 
           well honed by those who’ve been married this long: putting 
           bullshit aside for the sake of a greater cause. 

                                 LEAH
                        This is it.

                                 TOM
                        Last stop. Couldn’t have done it 
                        without you.

           Leah’s not ready to kiss and make up just yet.

                                 LEAH
                        I know you couldn’t have.

           EXT. SLEIGH - HIGH ABOVE NEW ZEALAND COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT

           Carols echo through the sky. Leah’s ears perk up. Tom clocks 
           this.

           They look out the window to see they are directly above a 
           small candlelit CHURCH. 

           Tom knows what this means to Leah, even though we don’t yet.

                                 TOM
                        The drones are doing the work. 
                        They’ll be back in--

           He pulls her wrist over - reads her watch.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        2 minutes and 35 seconds. 

           Leah lets on a slight smile but still yanks her hand back. 
           Still not there yet.

           Tom lands the sleigh. 

           EXT. PENTECOSTAL CHURCH - NIGHT

           Tom and Leah stand outside the wooden double doors of this 
           chapel in the middle of nowhere. Taking it in.

           The CAROLS are louder, along with a couple assorted HOOTS. 

           The flickering light just makes it all so damn serene.

                                 TOM
                        It’s your time. Screw your Jewish 
                        upbringing!
           Leah: what?

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        No, no. Not SCREW your Jewish 
                        upbringing-- I mean, so what that 
                        you were raised to be Jewish? That 
                        day at the 82nd Street Cathedral.

           Leah is impressed at Tom’s ability to recall such details.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        That’s right, I remember. The 
                        important things. You went in 
                        because the singing was so 
                        beautiful, and your nanny ripped 
                        you out of there and sent you on 
                        your way to yet another Bar 
                        Mitzvah. I listen. And you know 
                        what, you deserve to get your carol 
                        on- Moses be damned.

           Leah looks at him again.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        I know -- I know, just-- 

           Tom pushes the door open to--

           INT. PENTECOSTAL CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

           Tom and Leah sidle into the back pew of the church.

           Leah beams as she joins a rousing rendition of O HOLY NIGHT. 
           Tom mumbles along. 

           It’s a redemptive moment... their hands almost touch but are--

           Interrupted by A HISSING, COILED POISONOUS SNAKE --

           Being passed by A LOCAL. Who is VERY intent on Tom proving 
           his worth. 

                                 LOCAL
                        Prove yourself in the eyes of the 
                        Lord. 

           Tom is dead sober now.

                                 TOM
                           (as calm as possible)
                        I’m allergic.

           Tom and Leah share a glance-- time to get the hell out.
           Especially as another SNAKE is passed to Leah. 

           They’re surrounded by venom and old time religion. 

                                 LEAH
                           (to other churchgoer)
                        Oh, I had one earlier.

           Meanwhile, on the other side, Local is not kind to a no.

           Tom reels back, knocking over the candelabra. 

           The church falls to a hush. Then FLAMES lick a curtain.

           ECU: serpentine eyes flicker with orange and yellow. Primal.

           Local’s snake is now terrified. It whips back and strikes 
           him, teeth sinking into his jugular. 

                                 LOCAL
                           (blood spurting)
                        I’m not worthy!

           Like a horrific domino effect, one by one, snakes turn on the 
           holy, while Tom and Leah leap a python to escape. 

           NOW ABOVE THE FRAY

           EXT. SLEIGH - HIGH ABOVE NEW ZEALAND COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT

           Leah and Tom watch as the church becomes a funeral pyre. 
           Snakes slither off into the night.

           INT. SLEIGH - HIGH ABOVE NEW ZEALAND COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT

           Tom looks to Leah.

                                 TOM
                        I think that’s enough caroling for 
                        one lifetime.

                                 LEAH
                        I don’t know- I think Scarsdale 
                        could use a Pentecostal church.  

           She sneaks her hand around his shoulder, pretends her hand is 
           a snake and STRIKES at his neck.

                                 LEAH (CONT’D)
                        SSSSSSSSSS!

           He playfully SNAKES back with his hand.
                                 TOM
                        SSSSSSSSSS!

           His snake “eats” hers and they both pause-- he is now HOLDING 
           HER HAND.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. Everything I said 
                        before. I was a dick. No excuses- 
                        drugs or not, you deserve better 
                        than that. Without you there 
                        wouldn’t be a Christmas this year. 

           She softens. 

                                 LEAH
                        I was maybe a little harsh too. 
                        This isn’t a nightmare. Maybe a 
                        little mess. Maybe a really really 
                        really weird pot dream-- but it has 
                        been fun. 

                                 TOM
                        You know it sort of reminds me of? 

                                 LEAH
                        The time you stayed up after you 
                        took Ambien? And made sock puppets 
                        out of my West Elm dish towels?

           Tom thinks.

                                 TOM
                        Well kinda, yeah. But I was 
                        thinking about that Christmas at 
                        school. We ordered Chinese from Wo 
                        Hop and drank Natty Lite on the 
                        roof of your dorm.

                                 LEAH
                           (remembering)
                        Ah yes, the night I realized you 
                        cheat at cards.

                                 TOM
                        Go Fish champ-- undefeated since 

           They laugh. 

                                 LEAH
                        God, we were BROKE.
                                 TOM
                        Yeah I never told you, but I did a 
                        psych experiment that month -- 
                        that’s how I paid for the Chinese 
                        food. Now I smell colors at times 
                        but it was worth it. 

                                 LEAH
                           (laughing)
                        Rough times.

                                 TOM
                        But it was fun. Amazing what you 
                        can do with just a deck of cards 
                        and great company. 

                                 LEAH
                        Yeah, I guess the holidays really 
                        aren’t about the best tree or 
                        lights or most presents or pasture-
                        raised organic egg nog. Or 
                        procuring an endangered cat for our 
                        7 year old daughter.

           They both are a little ashamed at the realization that this 
           is who they’ve become. 

                                 TOM
                        All that matters is our family. I 
                        love you.

           He seductively (for a dad) does the “faux-yawn” arm reach 
           around Leah’s shoulder.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                           (fake smarmy)
                        So... you think this thing has 
                        cruise control for the ride home?

                                                           CUT TO:

           EXT. SLEIGH - HIGH ABOVE NEW ZEALAND COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT

           The sleigh’s a-rockin. Windows fogged up. A-la TITANIC:

           LEAH’S HAND

           Streaks the steam.

           Then a miniature fist--
           KNOCK KNOCK

           The sleigh stops rocking. Muffled voices from within.

           ZSSSSST

           The window rolls down. Tom and Leah try to look innocent like 
           everyone does when they’ve just been pulled over. 

           They are looking straight at:

           A CLASSIC SANTA SLEIGH

           Like the ones from the Coca-Cola ad. Not modern like the one 
           they’re in. 

           At the ready is THE FULL MARTIAL MIGHT OF ELF TEAM 6. Led by 
           ESTELLE. They all aim rifles and sneers at the couple. 

                                 ESTELLE

                           (beat)
                        THE SLEIGH.

           Beat.

                                 TOM
                        Uhhh-- we can’t. 

           He mimes flying- batting his arms like wings and shaking his 
           head no: “We can’t fly.”

                                 ESTELLE
                        Fine. Land the vehicle. 

           Beat.

                        And put some clothes on for Pete’s 
                        sake. It’s CHRISTMAS.

           EXT. MERCER HOUSEHOLD - ROOF - NIGHT

           Both sleighs are parked on the roof. Estelle and her team 
           reprimand Tom and Leah. Buck feeds very hungry reindeer. 
           Binoculars is disinfecting the sleigh’s interior. Spraying 
           new car smell.

                                 ESTELLE

                        What can I say-- this hasn’t 
                        happened since Tim Allen stole the 
                        sleigh, pretended to be Santa and 
                        made a shitty Christmas movie for 
                        Disney. 

           Tom and Leah nod, remembering the movie.

                                 ESTELLE (CONT’D)
                        The punishment is usually death by 
                        polar bear, though-- we are running 
                        low on those these days... 

           A moment of sadness for climate change. 

                                 ESTELLE (CONT’D)
                        Anyway, even though there’s quite a 
                        bit of collateral damage -- we’ve 
                        dispatched the entire workshop to 
                        clean up your mess-- you DID 
                        complete the run on time. You saved 
                        Christmas, even if Santa’s gonna be 
                        spending the New Year at Passages. 
                        So-- we’ll let you live. 

           Tom and Leah nod vociferously. Scared shitless.

                                 ESTELLE (CONT’D)
                        Alright. Well uh, Merry Christmas. 
                        Oh, almost forgot.

           She removes THE MIB CANDY CANE to wipe their memories.

           She’s futzing with it when... from behind, Binoculars CLEARS 
           HIS THROAT. 

                                 BINOCULARS
                        Ma’am. 

           Estelle looks back at Binoculars who holds up an iPHONE-- 
           it’s a FaceTime call. On the screen is--

           SANTA!

           For the first time, he looks sheepish and innocent. A big 
           BUNNY PAW on his shoulder. 

           Estelle nods reluctantly, approving the call. 

           Binoculars brings the iPhone to Tom and Leah so they can talk 
           to their friend. 

                                 SANTA
                        Estelle - put that down.
           Estelle re-seals the Candy Cane.

                                 SANTA (CONT’D)
                        These guys are real champs. Tom, 
                        Leah - you’re on the all-time nice 
                        list. I’m sorry if I wasn’t the 
                        Santa you expected. I’m sorry about 
                        the Mistletoe App... the drug 
                        lord...the-- You know what, just 
                        all of it. I really just want to 
                        thank you guys. I couldn’t have 
                        done it without you. Don’t forget - 
                        you make each other better. And 
                        without either of you, Christmas 
                        would have been a dumpster fire of 
                        a holiday. A real flaming pile. So 
                        anyway- thanks. 

           Tom and Leah nod -- “you’re welcome.”

                                 SANTA (CONT’D)
                        One more thing. WE NEVER SPEAK OF 
                        THIS AGAIN.

           With that, the call disconnects. 

           Tom and Leah share a quizzical look. 

                                 LEAH
                        Again?

           EXT. MERCER HOUSEHOLD - DAY

           The first time we’ve seen daylight in this movie. 

           And it’s beautiful-- like we are trapped inside of the best 
           snow-globe ever made. A perfect Faberge Christmas morning. 

           INT. MERCER HOUSEHOLD - KITCHEN - DAY

           Leah, over the stove, finishes up a hearty helping of bacon, 
           eggs and pancakes. No Haitian miracle this time. 

           Without a word, Tom seamlessly plates the food. It’s that 
           thing married couples do -- teamwork without the need for 
           verbal communication. 

           As Tom delivers the first plate to the kitchen table-- 

           Lily, Harper and Sasha sleepily trudge up from the basement. 

           Full of yawns and eye rubs. 
           Leah gives a knowing smile to her sister-- “thanks.”

           Sasha nods back. More familial semaphore. 

           The kids all take their plates and the family settles in for 
           breakfast. 

           Otis Redding’s “Merry Christmas Baby” plays over as: 

           - Lily gives a piece of bacon to Tom.

           - Sasha and Harper share a laugh.

           - Tom and Leah sneak a quick kiss. 

           As the song drops into the background, Leah looks at her 
           watch.

                                 LEAH
                           (to Harper)
                        Is my watch broken? Where’s Hawk?

                                 HARPER
                        I told him I wanted to spend 
                        Christmas with my family. 

                                 LEAH
                        I thought he was part of the flock?

                                 HARPER
                        I’m over the bird metaphors. And 
                        maybe Hawk. 

           Leah looks proud.

           And across the table...

                                 TOM
                        You guys ready to open some more 
                        presents?

           But nobody jumps at the opportunity. In fact--

                                 LILY
                        Eh, I just wanna be here with you 
                        guys. I like family time.

           So warm and fuzzy!

                                 TOM
                        So do I. 

                                 LEAH
                        How about a group shot?
           Tom sets up the camera and starts a timer. 

           The family poses for the photo. 

           The timer: 3 - 2 - 

                                 SASHA
                        Everybody say “pot cookies”!

           FLASH!

           As the photo is taken, DANIEL the parrot slams into the 
           window behind them. Skittles, mid-air behind, teeth bared.

           In the photo, Leah looks dumbfounded at Sasha. 

           Tom laughs.

           Harper, aghast, at the rainbow streak on the window.

           Lily looks confused.

           Sasha is laughing with her hand over her mouth.

           Then in CURSIVE over the photo:

           Merry Christmas!

           It’s the card they’ll send out next year. 

                                                         THE END. 

           ROLL CREDITS

           Then intercut...

           - Lily, now learning humility and the value of 
           responsibility, quickly scoops up a fresh Skittle “present” 
           from Harper’s Zen garden.

           - At the airport, Leah sees Harper off on a semester in 
           India. Leah’s proud of her daughter despite the budding 
           dreadlocks. 

           - Leah delivers a heartwarming pitch for the next Christmas 
           campaign; for once, she nails it. Her colleagues APPLAUD her 
           presentation.

           - In a chic boho apartment (clearly Sasha’s), Leah and her 
           sister share a joint – on purpose this time, lots of giggles.

           POST CREDITS:
           EXT. RV - GRAND CANYON - DAY

           A Winnebago is parked alongside the North Rim. 

           INT. RV - DAY

           A card game. It’s the whole family, Sasha included. 

           The adults sip Natty Lite and everyone passes around takeout 
           containers. 

           A string of colored bulbs line the interior. It’s cheery but 
           not over the top. 

           As they play cards...

                                 SASHA
                           (to Harper)
                        So... how’s Vassar?

                                 HARPER
                        Pretty sure I just aced my 
                        Marketing final. AND booked a yoga 
                        retreat in Tulum for spring break.

           Leah smiles. Puts a card down. Sasha throws a glance at Leah-- 
           really?

                                 LEAH
                           (shrugs)
                        Well she did ace her final... Sash, 
                        how’s the mentoring going? What was 
                        it? Tarot for Tots? Kind of like a 
                        life coach for a seven year old. 

           Leah smirks.

                                 SASHA
                        Hey, it’s better than We Aid. And 
                        it’s going really well. Realized 
                        there’s some truth in that saying 
                        “think globally, act locally.” 
                        Especially in LA. In fact, I’m 
                        gonna try out my new program on 
                        Lily tonight. 

                                 TOM
                        Just don’t turn her into a Ghost 
                        Hunter.

                                 LEAH
                        Tom, you have to stop watching that 
                        show.
                                 HARPER
                        Sasha, you should have seen him. In 
                        the attic. With a Ouija board. 

                                 LILY
                        The house was built in the 1970s. 
                        Who’s haunting it? Cher?

           Tom grunts and throws down a card. 

                                 LILY (CONT’D)
                           (to Sasha)
                        Try whatever woo-woo you want on 
                        me, I’m gonna be a particle 
                        physicist.

           Then a KNOCK at the door. 

           Leah opens it - the canyon echos back. Nobody around. 

           Tom clocks her confusion and joins. 

           As he’s about to close the door, he looks down:

           ECU: on a small plate, there are exactly seven cookies 
           accompanied by a note.

           We read along as Tom munches.

           Even closer: “Missed you this year. Wasn’t the same. Promise 
           these won’t cause any trouble.”

           As he picks up the note, a ONE YEAR CHIP clatters to the 
           ground.

           THE REAL END
