                              THE SWELLS

        ASSEMBLE MEDIA
           EXT. LAKE GERARD, NEW JERSEY - EARLY MORNING

           A quiet lake extending as far a the eye can see, surrounded 
           by thick woods. 

           Low hanging mist creeps along the glassy surface of the 
           water.

           A WAR CRY ECHOES in the distance. It sounds distinctly 
           animal, yet there’s something eerily human about it.

           As if activated by the cry -- a SWELL SURGES to the surface 
           of the water. Quickly begins to travel across the lake. 

           We rush to follow its charging path--

           EXT. LAKE HOUSE - MORNING

           A small, square house stands on stilts along the edge of a 
           steep surface of rocks. The lake beside it. 

           It looks like the sort of place a few hippies haphazardly 
           built and then forgot. Cracks in the foundation, a slope to 
           the entire structure. Moss growing all around it... 
           Surrounded by trees. Easily lost.

           Two FIGURES walk alongside the house. One of them speaks:

                                 DON
                        Gimme a hand with this, will ya?

                                 LOLA
                        No, actually I was planning to just 
                        sit here and watch.

           PRELAP: A creaky door OPENS. Feet POUND ACROSS strained 
           wooden floorboards.

           EXT. LAKE HOUSE - BASEMENT LEVEL - CONTINUOUS

           Light streams through the slats of the home’s wooden deck. It 
           flickers -- interrupted by the heavy FOOTSTEPS of our 
           characters overhead.

                                 DON (O.S.)
                        Ew. “TMI.”

                                 LOLA (O.S.)
                        That ship sailed, Pop, kids don’t 
                        say “TMI” nowadays.

           The front door opens overhead. SLAMS SHUT.
           INT. LAKE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           An open area layout that somehow feels like a small, dark 
           cave. The air doesn’t move around much in here.

           We catch a glimpse of our characters as they pick up 
           something heavy, and head back out onto the deck in tandem.

           Our gaze is fixed, we can’t manage to follow them as we push 
           in further, towards a juncture of doors in the hallway--

                                 DON
                        These pieces of shit haven’t fallen 
                        apart yet?

                                 LOLA
                        Nope.

           INT. LAKE HOUSE - NEXT

           Our view reversed. We continue to move back towards those two 
           doorways... 

           Through the front windows we can finally see the two clearly 
           as they set up furniture and continue their banter:

                                 DON
                        You girls hate change, or what?

           DON (50s) white, handsome face swollen from years of 
           substance abuse. He’s got the mean look of a guy who’d fight 
           you just for making a face at him.

                                 LOLA
                        (deliberately ignoring 
                        him)
                        How was L.A.?

           LOLA (early 30s) a mane of wild red hair made even more 
           striking by her bright red lipstick, has the same meanness in 
           her eyes as Don, but much softer features. 

                                 DON
                        Great, man. 
                        (laughs to himself)
                        Did I tell you what Coop did?

                                 LOLA
                        Not yet.

                                 DON
                        We’re at the Dan Tana’s, you 
                        ‘member that place? 
                                 DON (CONT'D)
                        So we’re sitting, smoking cigars, 
                        having a few laughs, you know the 
                        usual.

                                 LOLA
                        Uhuh.

           They’re setting up furniture on the deck for the season: a 
           table, chairs, loungers, faded shade umbrella...

                                 DON
                        All of a sudden the fucker turns 
                        and says to me, “How much you wanna 
                        bet I can’t get someone in this 
                        restaurant to think I’m Tom 
                        Cruise?”

                                 LOLA
                        Tom Cruise?

                                 DON
                        That’s what I said. ‘No fucking way 
                        anyone’s gonna see you as Tom 
                        Cruise, Coop. Maybe Howard Dean if 
                        you’re lucky.’

                                 LOLA
                        Uhuh. So then what happened?

                                 DON
                        That sonofabitch convinced some 
                        little old Thai lady that he’s 
                        motherfucking Tom Cruise!

                                 LOLA
                        Nice. Real nice.

                                 DON
                        What? It wasn’t me! It was Cooper!

                                 LOLA
                        Yeah and then?

                                 DON
                        Well I got to be Mel Gibson.

                                 LOLA
                        Mel Gibson? Actually, that’s 
                        appropriate.

                                 DON
                        (as Braveheart)
                        “...But they cannot take our 
                        freedom!”
                                 LOLA
                        (as Mel Gibson)
                        ...to hit our wives!

                                 DON
                        Yeah! Well. No.

           Lola cackles. She enters the house. Don follows her.

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        Come on be nice to your old man!

                                 LOLA
                        Maybe I would be if I didn’t know 
                        you so well.

                                 DON
                        Ouch! Low blow.

                                 LOLA
                        Oh yeah we’re keeping things 
                        strictly class here, Don.

           INT. LAKE HOUSE - BASEMENT - NEXT

           It’s dark. A crack of light from an old wooden door. 
           FOOTSTEPS approach outside.

                                 DON (O.S.)
                        So what happened with that fool you 
                        were dating? Whatshisface weird guy 
                        or somethin’.

           The stiff wooden door is FORCED OPEN. Lola at the helm. Don 
           beside her.

           Don bats at the dust flying around his face.

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        Wow, it’s a fucking mess down here.

                                 LOLA
                        Don’t be such a wuss. 

           EXT. LAKE HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY

           We can see his point: the basement is filled to the low 
           ceiling with a giant mound of dirt. Forgotten objects shoved 
           all around it, covered in cobwebs.

                                 LOLA
                        Well after you, Braveheart.
           INT. LAKE HOUSE - BASEMENT - NEXT

           Lola and Don crouch and crawl as they make their way around 
           the dirt.

           They maneuver past a newer pile of clutter: a walker, a bed 
           pan, paraphernalia of a terminal illness lived out in the 
           home.

                                 DON
                        Don’t you wanna get rid of that 
                        shit already?

           Lola brushes past him, pointed.

                                 LOLA
                        You’re such a fucking asshole.

                                 DON
                        Meow. So sensitive...

           They find what they were looking for: a big, rusted Plexiglas 
           and metal rowboat. 

           Don and Lola each take one end--

           A FLICKER of light as they bend and lift -- a gruesome, 
           mauled carcass FLASHES before our eyes--

           Lola SCREAMS. Drops her end of the boat. Dust flies into the 
           air. 

           A large, brown SPIDER ambles away from the boat, shaken.

           Don laughs, beside himself.

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        That tiny lil’ thing?!

                                 LOLA
                        Fuck you. Get your own boat.

           She moves to exit the dark, cramped basement.

                                 DON
                        Hey! Where you going? You can’t 
                        just leave an old man to move his 
                        own boat!

           Don waits for Lola to entertain his joke. 

           The light on his face disappears, then returns as she passes 
           through the doorway.
                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        (feigning desperation)
                        Loooooolaaaaaaaa!!!!!

                                                    CUT TO:

           EXT. LAKE HOUSE - SHORELINE - DAY

           A steep, stone stairwell leads to a small dirt landing that 
           drops into the lake.

           Don and Lola carefully carry the rowboat down the stairs, 
           Lola taking them backwards. 

           Don moves slightly faster than Lola, plays his control of the 
           boat against her. She’s agitated. 

           Her steps are uncertain. It seems like she could fall at any 
           moment.

                                 LOLA
                        Stop!

           Lola digs her heel into the stair and puts the brakes on Don.

                                 DON
                        Calm down.

                                 LOLA
                        And then what, break my neck?

                                 DON
                        You’re not falling on my watch. 
                        Trust me. Your dad knows what he’s 
                        doing.

                                 LOLA
                        That’s almost the dumbest shit 
                        you’ve said today.

                                 DON
                        Okay just chill out, will ya?

           They finally get to the bottom of the stairs. 

           They carry the boat over to the edge of the dirt. Rest it on 
           the ground. 

           Lola exhales a sigh of relief. Don pats her on the back. 

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        Congratulations, you’ve made it 
                        down the stairs.
           Lola shoves his hand off, brushing past him. She heads back 
           up the steps -- STOMPING, her feet threatening violence.

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        When did you get to be such a 
                        sourpuss? 
                        (pointed)
                        You're turning into your mother, 
                        for christsakes.

                                 LOLA
                        Nice, Don. Real nice.

                                 DON
                        Come on. I was just kidding.

                                 LOLA
                        Can't imagine why all your wives 
                        left you, you big sweetheart.

           Don’s smile snaps into a violent glare.

                                 DON
                        Hey, Lo?

           Lola reaches the top step. She turns around to face Don - 
           still standing at the dirt patch below. 

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        Don't you ever fucking talk to me 
                        like that again, you hear me?

           Lola stares down at him, straight-faced. She says nothing.

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        (threatening)
                        You hear me?

                                 LOLA
                        Yeah, I hear you.

           Lola walks away.

           INT. BATHROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

           It’s tiny -- fixtures decorated in cheap pink plastic. 

           A TALK RADIO PROGRAM filters in from outside the room.

                                 RADIO HOST (O.S.)
                        The question isn’t whether or not 
                        this witness is a plant from the 
                        democrats. Of course she is. 
                                 RADIO HOST (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        But why? What’s a night of high 
                        school partying got to do with the 
                        supreme court?

           Lola stands in front of the medicine cabinet, her face 
           absurdly close to the dingy mirror. 

           She inspects and extracts each pore on her face.

           As she continues, she turns on the FAUCET -- washes away the 
           offending matter.

           EXT. LAKE HOUSE - SIMULTANEOUS

           The chipped blade of an axe comes down on a piece of wood, 
           SPLITTING it. The pieces go flying.

           Don wrenches the axe out of the block. He has a look to him 
           that’s scheming, violent. Now that we’re alone with him, we 
           don’t feel safe.

           The TALK RADIO PROGRAM continues, a dusty boombox on the 
           porch its source.

           Don places another chunk of wood. 

           Heaves, swings.

           THWACK -- the severed lumber goes flying. 

           Don inhales. Wipes his brow. Clearly out of shape but 
           ignoring it, his shirt soaked with sweat.

           Don takes out a pack of cigarettes. Lights one. Puffs -- 
           Exhales -- that’s the ticket.

           He sets another piece of wood on the chopping block.

           EXT. LAKE HOUSE - EVENING

           Each CHOP of the axe PULSES--  

           ECHOES over the stillness of the lake... 

           Its reverberations push a flock of birds out of the trees and 
           into the air.

           The sound seems to get LOUDER...  

           SHARPER with each swing--

                                                    CUT TO:
           EXT. LAKE HOUSE - NIGHT

           A roaring fire CRACKLES and SPITS in a hand-laid brick fire 
           pit.

           Lola sits beside the fire, legs propped up, beer in hand. She 
           stares at the flames licking the freshly cut firewood -- 
           entranced.

           On the other side of the fire sits Don, relatively in the 
           same position, but a domineering presence. His eye on the 
           steaks he has grilling over the fire.

                                 DON
                        It’s all about the heat. Coals have 
                        to be just right to get you that 
                        sear. Flames are no good. But 
                        tonight I’m showing you the ancient 
                        way. Straight up burial.

                                 LOLA
                        I can cook a pretty mean steak.

                                 DON
                        Yeah but there’s only one right 
                        way.

                                 LOLA
                        Uhuh.

                                 DON
                        My dad always used to like ‘em well 
                        done. That’s how we all knew he had 
                        the gut of an ox.

                                 LOLA
                        Pop, I’ve been meaning to ask you 
                        something.

                                 DON
                        Oh boy, here we go.

                                 LOLA
                        No I just -- can’t remember... If 
                        you could fill in the gaps for me.

                                 DON
                        You know, Lo, the past is in the 
                        past. If you live there you’ll 
                        always be miserable.

           Lola goes through a number of reactions before settling on:
                                 LOLA
                        What makes you think I’m miserable?

                                 DON
                        I dunno.

           Don drinks his beer.

                                 LOLA
                        I’m not nearly as miserable as you.

           Lola drinks her beer.

           Don narrows his eyes. Nods to himself. He’s having an 
           internal conversation about what a real bitch Lola’s turned 
           out to be.

           Lola watches Don as he does this. She smiles -- he’s 
           pathetic.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        Do you remember Uncle Mike?

                                 DON
                        (mocking)
                        Uncle Mike?

                                 LOLA
                        He wasn’t an uncle, he was your 
                        friend.

                                 DON
                        Mike Hartigan, from New York?

                                 LOLA
                        No, a different Mike.

                                 DON
                        Can’t say that I do.

                                 LOLA
                        And his wife’s name was Trishell 
                        and he was tall and skinny and 
                        blonde, with a mustache. And they 
                        had a kid, a baby boy.

                                 DON
                        Nah. No. No.

                                 LOLA
                        And they used to baby-sit me.

                                 DON
                        Really? When?
                                 LOLA
                        You and mom used to party with them 
                        all the time and sometimes they’d 
                        baby-sit me and there were times 
                        I’d spend the night there and I 
                        remember crying in the back room of 
                        his father’s house and they were 
                        old and they had all these glass 
                        cases full of fancy plates and 
                        shit...

                                 DON
                        What are you going on about, kid?

                                 LOLA
                        Why was I there?

                                 DON
                        This is your story.

                                 LOLA
                        They baby-sat me.

                                 DON
                        Nobody baby-sat you, Lo. You’re 
                        making that up.

                                 LOLA
                        Why would I make that up?

                                 DON
                        Because you’re inventing things. 
                        Inventing from your little 
                        imagination all these scenarios 
                        that never happened, so you can 
                        feel good about yourself because 
                        you had a “fucked up life.” But I’m 
                        telling you, you had it good.

                                 LOLA
                        He was your best friend. I called 
                        him Uncle Mike. He baby-sat me.

                                 DON
                        Drop it.

           Lola inhales--

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        I said. Drop it.

           A low SAWING sound begins to enter the scene -- it seems to 
           be coming from the fire. Lola is suddenly calm. She smiles, 
           almost as if she’d just won. 
                                 LOLA
                        (quiet, to herself)
                        Pathetic.

           She drinks her beer. The SAWING SOUND gaining momentum.

                                 DON
                        What did you say?

                                 LOLA
                        I didn’t say anything.

                                 DON
                        (threatening)
                        What the fuck did you just say?

           Lola leans forward. The reflection of the fire dances wildly 
           in her eyes.

                                 LOLA
                        (meeting his threat)
                        I didn’t say anything to you, Old 
                        Man, so stop inventing things.

           Lola takes a moment to make sure her point came across. 

           She leans back into her chair. Gestures to the fire. The 
           SAWING sound now deafening, though no one seems to notice.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        Watch your steaks.

                                                    CUT TO:

           EXT. THE LAKE - DAWN

           Lola is alone. 

           She takes her time, calm and expert, in driving the rowboat 
           across the smooth surface of the water -- it ripples and 
           swells behind her, the lake moves with her.

           She HUMS a sweet, UPLIFTING TUNE. 

           Around her a row of trees. A gradually brightening sky.

           She checks over her shoulder to judge her direction -- if 
           we’re paying attention, we can catch glimpses of blood on her 
           clothing. Her knees are caked with mud. A BRIGHT ORANGE 
           gallon bucket rests unassuming at her feet.
           Lola adjusts her angle toward the lake house, presently a 
           small grey square amongst the green trees on the distant 
           horizon.

           Lola turns to us, smiling to herself. 

           At moments her HUM breaks into soft SINGING of a certain 
           refrain or a piece of the chorus -- too soft to make out the 
           words, she never rises above the delicate precision of her 
           oars SLICING into the WATER.

           Lola continues to ROW... 

           And HUM... 

           And SING... 

           The sky brightens further -- is that blood splatter on her 
           skin?

           EXT. LAKE HOUSE - SHORELINE - NEXT

           Lola glides out of the boat and into the shallow water. 

           She climbs onto the dirt shore. 

           Lola pulls the boat up, out of the water and onto land.

           She sets her bucket to the side. Disengages the oars. PLANTS 
           them into the ground one at a time. It’s violent. Like the 
           driving of STAKES.

           The sound of high-pressure water HITTING aluminum surface. 
           Lola washes out the boat.

           She holds onto the bow, dips it gingerly--

           Water DUMPS itself out, filters down into the lake... The 
           water ripples in reaction, lapping it up.

           INT. BATHROOM - NEXT

           Lola stands in front of the sink, water RUNNING. Still 
           SINGING her song. 

                                 LOLA
                        (singing)
                        Now I feel the hope/ the faith to 
                        go another day/ the rain cannot 
                        wash away...

           She washes the blood off her arms. Off her neck.
           She SCRUBS the blood and whatever else off her hiking boots. 
           HUMMING all along.

           She disrobes. Places each item of clothing into a large 
           bucket of liquid set inside the tub.

           Blood lifts off the clothing and disintegrates. The clothes 
           turn pale, then yellow.

           EXT. LAKE HOUSE - DECK - MORNING

           Lola nestles into a lounge chair on the wooden deck -- one of 
           the items set up by her and Don the day before.

           She pulls out a pack of cigarettes -- Don’s pack of 
           cigarettes -- lights one.

           Lola reclines as she inhales the smoke. Savors it like a 
           return to an old friend after many years apart.

           Lola smokes... 

           She looks up at the trees... 

           A light breeze causes the leaves to RUSTLE and SHIMMER in the 
           sunlight. The branches sway. 

           For a moment all of nature seems to be swaying in this 
           lounging, sensual way. A small current in the LAKE, right 
           along with it. All in unison with Lola...

           Lola smokes... Lost in a moment of divine peace. And we right 
           along with her--

           A cellphone RINGS, shrill, from inside the house.

           Lola tries to stay in her moment. 

           It RINGS again.

           She gets up.

           INT. LAKE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Lola enters and immediately disappears into the dark cavern 
           of the home’s interior.

           The phone GRATES ON -- but there is nothing save for deep... 

           Dark, empty, space...

                                                    CUT TO:
           EXT. LAKE HOUSE - DAY

           CRACKLING fire -- flames lick over dry branches thrown on top 
           of firewood.

                                 LOLA (O.S.)
                        Yep.

           Lola stands, cell phone at her ear. She watches the progress 
           of the flames.

                                 ART (O.S.)
                        (over phone)
                        ...it turns out there’s a bus every 
                        hour so I hopped on the next one. I 
                        hope it’s okay if I’m early...

                                 LOLA
                        Haha. No worries...

           The BRIGHT ORANGE BUCKET -- we almost forgot about it. Lola 
           reaches in, pulls out something dark, COAGULATED, slimy. 

           Throws it onto the fire. It SPITS and HISSES under the 
           flames. Black and sick looking -- it’s DON’S HEART. 

           Lola stares, intense, as the lifeless organ roasts in the 
           flames. 

                                 ART (O.S.)
                        (over phone)
                        I think I’ll be there in an hour.

           She pours LIGHTER FLUID. The fire BLAZES and engulfs it.

                                 ART (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        (over phone)
                        Should I take a cab or--

                                 LOLA
                        No. I’ll pick you up.

                        (over phone)
                        Perfect. I’ll see you soon.

           DOOTDOOT -- the call ends. 

           Lola looks out at the lake. She smiles, disconnected. 

                                 LOLA
                        Perfect.

           PRELAP: The sound of TIRES rolling over dirt road.
           INT. LOLA’S CAR - AFTERNOON

           A mess of tassels, mementos, and tags swings from the rear 
           view mirror. Lola makes a turn, drives toward a bus stop 
           standing solitary along the wooded road-- 

           Through the car windows we can see its lone occupant come 
           into view: ART (30s) tall, dark, and handsome with a boyish 
           charm that’s getting less convincing as he ages. He grins and 
           waves shyly as the car approaches.

           EXT. ISOLATED BUS STOP - CONTINUOUS

           Lola’s car pulls to a stop. The window ROLLS DOWN. 

                                 LOLA
                        You lost, young man?

           Art laughs. Takes off his backpack. Reaches for the passenger 
           side door, tries -- it’s locked.

                                 ART
                        Hey.

           Lola waves her finger at him.

                                 LOLA
                        Ah, ah, aaah... You didn’t say 
                        please.

           He stands up straight, makes a face that could convince 
           anyone. He’s one of those ‘fall in love with me instantly’ 
           kinda fuckboys and now we can definitely see it.

                                 ART
                        Please.

           CLICK. The doors UNLOCK--

           INT. LAKE HOUSE - LOLA’S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

           Lola sits in the corner. Light pours into the room at a steep 
           angle -- it slices her in half with deep shadow.

           Lola’s gaze bores a hole into a point just beyond us...

           She does not blink.

           Lola slowly leans back... 

           Her chair CREAKS -- her face is lost to the shadow.
           INT. KITCHEN - EVENING

           Lola cooks dinner. There’s a frying pan SIMMERING over the 
           heat, threatening. The quarters are close, cramped, 
           especially since Art insists on being there, confronting the 
           inevitable with Lola--

                                 ART
                        So what’s new?

                                 LOLA
                        With me? Not much.
                        (beat)
                        Just started getting the best sleep 
                        of my life.

                                 ART
                        Really. What changed?

           He sips his wine. Studies the movements of her body closely--

                                 LOLA
                        You know how people talk about a 
                        weight being lifted? I feel like 
                        I’m finally full of weight. Like 
                        I’m whole.

           Lola turns away from him. Pushes items around in the pan.

                                 ART
                        That makes sense to me...

           Art approaches her. Gets close. She stiffens.

                                 LOLA
                        No. Not this time.

                                 ART
                        Come on...

           He sidles up behind her. Softly kisses the nape of her neck. 
           Once, twice.

           Lola closes her eyes, bites her lip. This is apparently a 
           weak spot, and he knows it.

                                 LOLA
                        Fuck it.

           She turns around, furious, meets his mouth with hers.

           They tear clothes off as though tearing each other apart. 
           It’s frantic, desperate. 
           Lola’s hands shake as she unbuttons Art’s jeans and pushes 
           them down--

           Art pushes Lola against the counter. Lifts her up -- right 
           next to the sizzling pan--

           Her legs around his waist. They thrust in unison -- a furious 
           fuck.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        Yes-- Yes--

                                 ART
                        You like that? You miss me, baby?

           Lola shoves her hand over his mouth. Digs her fingers into 
           his cheek as she WAILS--

           INT. LAKE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Lola’s in the bathroom, washing up. The door open just a 
           crack-- we can see her moving around within the space.

           A low SAWING noise creeps into the room, as if coming from 
           the water, the sink...

           Art sits reclined on the sofa. Red marks on his face from 
           lipstick? Scratches? It’s hard to know. He looks satisfied 
           and unsettled at the same time...

           Art places his hand over his heart. Taps his fingers. Twists 
           his chest hair, thinking... He calls out:

                                 ART
                        Lola?

                                 LOLA (O.S.)
                        Hmm?

                                 ART
                        Why’d you invite me here?

           Lola pushes open the bathroom door. The SAWING sound now 
           louder, faster. Lola stands, looking down at him, at us.

                                 LOLA
                        Why do you think?

           She advances toward him-- blocking out our view of the two of 
           them completely--
           INT. LAKE HOUSE - MIDNIGHT

           The house is quiet. Still. Tidy.

           No sign that anyone was cooking in the kitchen, or doing 
           anything anywhere at all. 

           No evidence of Art ever having existed.

           We catch a glimpse of flame licking upwards from outside...

           We creep forward to the window...

           Outside is Lola, she feeds a growing fire. 

           INT. LOLA’S ROOM - DAWN

           Lola sits by a small table in her room. Removes a DAY PLANNER 
           from a drawer.

           She flips it open--

           We can see her upcoming month is BOOKED. Names and ideas 
           scrawled in for almost every weekend.

           Lola crosses out the previous day. The name ‘Art’ written 
           inside the small square.

           She adds something to today’s entry, and tomorrow’s:

           Michelle. She circles the days, slow and deliberate.

           Lola smiles to herself.

           EXT. LAKE HOUSE - DAY

           A black TESLA PULLS UP to the house, parks.

           Lola appears on the side deck, phone at her ear. She smiles, 
           waves. 

           The car’s driver side door opens. MICHELLE (early 30s) exits 
           the vehicle. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Hey!

           Michelle has a certain similarity to Lola, but she’s just a 
           bit younger, thinner, prettier. Her whole look is minimal but 
           immaculate. She’s perfectly put together.
           The two women hug - it’s genuine, with the awkwardness of 
           rarity. Lola’s flannel looks frumpy next to Michelle’s 
           ensemble. Her RED LIP tacky next to Michelle’s NEUTRAL PINK.

                                 LOLA
                        It’s so good to see you.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Aw, you too.

           They break their embrace. Smile at one another. A bit of an 
           awkward laugh. 

           Lola gestures toward the car. 

                                 LOLA
                        Wow! Is that a spaceship?

                                 MICHELLE
                        No just Chase’s idea of a birthday 
                        present... Every well-off liberal 
                        with a conscience has one!

                                 LOLA
                        Okay... Got it. 

           Michelle pops the trunk, feeling silly. Lola helps Michelle 
           unload her bags. 

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        Right this way!

           Lola leads Michelle up the wooden steps of the deck, onto the 
           landing, and around the corner...

           Michelle stops in her tracks, GASPS-- The LAKE. She’s seized 
           by its image.

           Lola looks back at her. She’s pleased.

           Michelle snaps out of her awe.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Sorry, just. Wow.

                                 LOLA
                        I know, right? We can eat out here.

           Lola disappears into the house.
           INT. BATHROOM - DAY

           Lola through the small medicine cabinet mirror -- it’s oddly 
           dim for the middle of the day.

           A toilet FLUSHES. Faucet RUNNING. Lola washes her hands.

           She makes eye contact with herself in the mirror. Her 
           expression impossible to decipher.

           EXT. LAKE HOUSE - DECK - EVENING

           Michelle sits at the wooden table, hands in her lap. She 
           looks around her, uncertain, excited.

           Lola comes through the screen door, two plates of food in her 
           hands. The door CREAKS -- SLAMS SHUT behind her.

                                 LOLA
                        Sorry. That fucking door.

           Lola puts the plates on the table. Turns on her heels to go 
           back for more items inside the house.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Here, let me help you.

                                 LOLA
                        No, no, I’m just getting wine. 
                        Please!

           The door swings wildly, SLAMS SHUT behind her. Michelle 
           winces at the repeated auditory assault.

           Lola reappears with a bottle of white and two large wine 
           glasses. 

           She pauses at the last moment and slows the door’s swing with 
           her foot. Smiles. A gentler SLAM this time.

           Wine is poured. Both women seated.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        Cheers.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Cheers.

           They clink glasses. Polite smiles. Awkward eye contact as 
           they take their first sip of wine - Lola’s gaze intense.

           The LAKE lies just beyond them, heavy and watchful.
                                 LOLA
                        ‘Bon appetit.’

                                 MICHELLE
                        Yum. Thank you.

                                 LOLA
                        Well, don’t thank me yet.

           Michelle carves into her-- steak? Whatever it is, it looks an 
           awful lot like the charred remains of a human heart. She 
           tries a bite...

                                 MICHELLE
                        It’s good!

                                 LOLA
                        Oh good. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        ...It’s like... Gamey. But in a 
                        good way.
                        (fumbling)
                        I was starving!

                                 LOLA
                        I bet. Long drive?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Um. Not too long.

           They eat. Small talk between bites of food.

                                 LOLA
                        Thanks for accepting my invitation, 
                        by the way. I wasn’t sure you’d 
                        come.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Yeah, me neither actually.
                        (awkward chuckle)

                                 LOLA
                        So why did you? Come.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Um, I really needed a break. From 
                        the city. And I miss us, Lo.

           A beat. Lola takes a moment to appreciate making Michelle 
           squirm.
                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        So tell me what you’ve been up to! 
                        Your instagrams look so glamorous 
                        all the time.

                                 LOLA
                        Really? Which ones?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Um, well there was that one at the 
                        gallery with your paintings and 
                        your friends all looked so 
                        interesting and chic.

           A FLASH of Lola’s instagram posts: banal with bad lighting. 
           We read ‘interesting and chic’ as ‘Bushwick trust fund 
           hipster.’

                                 LOLA
                        Oh yeah, that gallery is like, a 
                        sad room in a random alleyway.

                                 MICHELLE
                        How funny.

                                 LOLA
                        “Starving Artists!”

                                 MICHELLE
                        Well you seem to be doing okay up 
                        here at least.

                                 LOLA
                        I’m just lucky I get to have this 
                        place every year.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Is this where you do all your 
                        paintings?

                                 LOLA
                        No. Are you still painting?

                                 MICHELLE
                        ...Not really since college.

           A beat -- was that a twinge of recognition from Lola?

                                 LOLA
                        And work, how’s the company?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Great! I just got promoted 
                        actually.
                                 LOLA
                        Congratulations! What are you doing 
                        now?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Um, pretty much the same thing, I 
                        just got to move one desk forward 
                        and I get new business cards.

                                 LOLA
                        And a raise?

           Michelle nods, uncertain.

                                 MICHELLE
                        I think so... I didn’t ask 
                        actually.

           The motion-detecting porch light CLICKS OFF -- darkness. Lola 
           waves her arms around in a funny dance.

           The light CLICKS BACK ON -- illuminating Lola’s face.

                                 LOLA
                        You just have to--

                                 MICHELLE
                        Yeah. I see that.

                                 LOLA
                        Well cheers to career advancement, 
                        and to not having to worry about 
                        how much you get paid.

           Lola raises her glass. Michelle chuckles, uncomfortable -- 
           CLINK.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Cheers...

                        Are you seeing anyone?

                                 LOLA
                        (chuckles, bitterly?)
                        No. I mean I was, but not anymore. 
                        He wasn’t that interesting.

                                 MICHELLE
                        You’ll find someone new in no time.
                                 LOLA
                        I don’t actually want to find 
                        someone new.

                                 MICHELLE
                        (trying to be encouraging)
                        Oh, hmm!

                                 LOLA
                        You know that feeling like, you’ve 
                        already had all your great love 
                        affairs? Like there’s nothing else 
                        out there that could possibly top 
                        what you’ve had?

           Michelle’s face falls. She looks nervous.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Uh, well...

           The porch light CLICKS OFF again -- leaving her in darkness.

                                 LOLA
                        Oh, of course I don’t mean Chase, 
                        oh no, that’s not what I meant. For 
                        me. For you of course, Chase is 
                        that. Right?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Yes. Yeah.

                                 LOLA
                        Good. I thought for a second, and 
                        then was like, oh no!

                                 MICHELLE
                        Me too, I guess!

           They share a laugh -- Michelle relieved, Lola pointed. 

           Lola raises her glass.

                                 LOLA

           CLINK-- They drink their wine in darkness.
           INT. LAKE HOUSE - SPARE ROOM - NIGHT

           The lights CLICK on -- clinical and bright fluorescents.

                                 LOLA
                        And here’s your room! I know it’s 
                        not the Four Seasons--

                                 MICHELLE
                        No! It’s cute.

           The room is small, bleak. Two twin beds against either wall. 
           Wood paneling that was painted over with a dull mint many, 
           many years ago.

           Michelle stands between the two beds, uncertain. They’re both 
           stripped, a clean set of linens set at the foot of each.

                                 LOLA
                        You can take whichever one you 
                        like. And just set your bag on the 
                        other one. No worries.

           Lola moves away from the doorway and into the threshold 
           across.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        My room’s just across...

           Lola flicks the light ON in her room. 

           Michelle approaches the doorway-- 

           Lola returns. She directs Michelle’s attention back to the 
           spare room.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        My mother used to sleep in here.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Oh. That’s so sweet.
                        (beat)
                        I’m sorry for your loss, by the 
                        way...

                                 LOLA
                        Thanks...

           Lola smiles, polite, starts stuffing pillows into cases for 
           Michelle.

                                 MICHELLE
                        No, no, no. I can do that!
           Michelle pushes Lola out of the room. Lola playfully resists.

                                 LOLA
                        Just let me kill you with my 
                        kindness!

                                 MICHELLE
                        No thank you!

           INT. SPARE ROOM - NEXT

           Michelle WHIPS her top sheet open with a flourish.

           The thin fabric floats downward, obstructing her face-- 
           Michelle SCREAMS.

                                 LOLA (O.S.)
                        What is it?

           Lola races in.

           Michelle laughs at herself, uneasy.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Oh my god. It’s just. A huge 
                        spider.

           Lola lifts the sheet -- a large, brown spider similar to the 
           one we saw in the basement lays on its back, legs curled, 
           dry.

                                 LOLA
                        Must have suffocated to death, poor 
                        thing.

           Lola picks up the dead spider with her bare hands. 

           Michelle shudders, shimmies out of the way as Lola carries 
           the corpse out of the room.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Ew. Ew.

           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A satisfied, eerie smile crosses Lola’s face.

                                 LOLA
                        I’m so sorry. I don’t know how he 
                        could have gotten in there.
           The spider drops into the toilet bowl. FLUSHES. Lola watches 
           the water complete its burial.

                                 MICHELLE (O.S.)
                        No I’m sorry, for scaring the shit 
                        out of you because of a little dead 
                        spider. I’m just so freaked out by 
                        them...

                                 LOLA
                        Aren’t you glad he wasn’t alive?

           Michelle appears in the bathroom doorway.

                                 MICHELLE 
                        Um, yeah.

           INT. LOLA’S ROOM - NEXT

           Lola sets pajamas out on the singular queen bed. 

           She peers through the open door on Michelle’s side -- where 
           Michelle stands in front of her open suitcase, half dressed. 

           Lola watches, unnoticed.

           Michelle disrobes. Rifles through her things.

           Lola slowly starts to undress as well.

           Michelle puts on a nightgown. Then a robe. 

           Lola looks away. 

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Lola sits on the edge of the tub, uses her fingers to 
           untangle her mass of curly, unruly hair. 

           Michelle stands at the sink, goes through the process of 
           multiple washings of her face. 

           Lola observes the curves of Michelle’s body beneath her 
           nightgown... 

           She eyes Michelle’s beauty products, neatly set out on the 
           tiny counter top... 

           The motion of her fingers massaging her skin...

           Michelle takes out an expensive face cream, applies it to her 
           face. 
           She finally notices Lola’s gaze. Lola doesn’t look away. 
           Michelle does. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Want some? Try it, it’s amazing.

           She holds out her pot of face cream. Michelle’s hands -- her 
           cuticles are chewed to bits. Rings of scabs from making them 
           bleed. Lola stares at them.

                                 LOLA
                        Really?

           Michelle’s eye twitches in recognition--

                                 MICHELLE
                        I’ve got gobs of it. It’s fucking 
                        magic for your pores.

           Finally, Lola takes the pot of face cream from Michelle. She 
           delicately unscrews the top. Smells it. Takes some cream with 
           her fingers, admires the consistency. 

           Lola looks at her own fingers. The tips calloused from years 
           of chewing and peeling. Bloody scabs around the cuticles...

           Lola applies the cream to her face, slow. 

                                 LOLA
                        Sure feels like fucking magic.

           Michelle smiles at her in the mirror.

           Lola puts the container of cream on the counter next to 
           Michelle -- PLINK.

           INT. KITCHEN - THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

           Lights out. Faint glow of moonlight. The room is quiet and 
           deserted, as it should be.

           Then-- a thick brown sludge BUBBLES up, SPLURTS out of the 
           drain in the kitchen sink. 

           At first a sputter-- GLUG.

           Then more -- faster than one might have thought possible-- 

           GWAMGWAMGWAMB...
           EXT. THE LAKE - THE LAST MOMENT OF DUSK

           Dark water. Purple, blazing sky. 

           The imprint of something LARGE, INVISIBLE, moves towards us 
           in the water. 

           It seems to be propelled forward, effortless, not swimming. 
           As if some kind of ENERGY were gaining momentum to attack us 
           in the water.

           As the thing creeps FORWARD it seems to multiply and GROW IN 
           SIZE. With it, the same scratching -- SAWING -- a signal.

                                 LOLA (V.O.)
                        There was this sound. Like a 
                        scratching. Something trying to 
                        claw its way out...

           PRELAP: A KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK against the wooden door--

           INT. LAKE HOUSE - MORNING

           Lola stumbles out of her room, autopilot, into the bathroom.

           Michelle enters the kitchen. Goes for the coffee maker--

           She does a double take -- terrified.

           The sink is OVERFLOWING. Brown sludge OOZES onto the floor. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Ohmygod!

           The sludge creeps further into the room... 

           The SMELL hits her next -- foul, rancid.

           Michelle gags. Covers her mouth. Backs out of the room as 
           Lola emerges from the bathroom--

                                 LOLA
                        What’s wrong?

                                 MICHELLE
                        The kitchen--!

           The smell hits Lola. She pinches her nose.

                                 LOLA
                        Ohmygod..!

           PRELAP: the BRRRIIING of a dial-tone on speaker phone.
           EXT. LAKE HOUSE - DECK - MORNING

           Lola and Michelle recline in lawn chairs, coffee cups in 
           hand. 

           Lola’s cell phone RINGS on speaker. The line picks UP--

                                 PHONE GUY (O.S.)
                        John’s Plumbing.

                        Um hi, yeah.

           Lola gets up and takes the call inside.

           Michelle leans forward and fiddles with the tuner on Lola’s 
           90s boombox-- shifting through different frequencies of RADIO 
           STATIC.

                                 LOLA (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Hi, yes, great...

           INT. LAKE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Lola lowers her voice to make sure it doesn’t travel. 

                                 LOLA
                        Silly me, I must have dialed the 
                        wrong number.

           The line CLICKS-- he hung up.

           Lola smiles. She stares at the DARK SLUDGE taking over the 
           kitchen, a faint SAWING sound sputtering from it. Addresses 
           it directly--

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        (louder, into the phone)

                        you so much.

           EXT. LAKE HOUSE - DECK - NEXT

           Michelle TURNS the knob--

                        This is 970AM The Truth. New York 
                        and New Jersey’s only source for 
                        conservative talk radio--

           Michelle TURNS it again-- STATIC.

                        That’s the only station you’ll get

           Lola returns. She reaches over, turns the radio OFF. 

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        Some friendly neighborhood Trumper

           EXT. THE LAKE - DAY

           Lola and Michelle PUSH the row boat into the water. 

           Lola hops in. There’s a big to-do over helping Michelle get 
           into the boat as well...

           Lola rows them out into the open water... 

           The lake is darker, choppier than we’ve seen it before.

           They get further and further away from the house...

           Lola keeps her eyes on Michelle. 
           Michelle looks out over the landscape-- A thick row of trees 
           towers over them from around the lake. 

           Michelle shivers a bit -- as though the air has a sudden 
           chill to it.

                                 LOLA
                        Okay, so you want to make sure to 
                        lean forward when you’re aiming the 
                        oars to slice back into the water.

           She demonstrates.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        That way when you puuulllll back, 
                        you have as much leverage as 
                        possible.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Oh, I don’t know how to row.

                                 LOLA
                        I’m teaching you how to row.

                                 MICHELLE
                        (laughs, nervous)
                        Um, okay. Why not?

                                 LOLA
                        Atta’ girl.

           Lola continues to row in a demonstrative fashion.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        You always want to row facing away 
                        from the bow, using your core to 
                        pull--gives you the greatest amount 
                        of control over the boat.

                                 MICHELLE
                        How do you steer then?

           Lola looks over her shoulder--

                                 LOLA
                        Say we’re going over there.

           Turns and points behind Michelle.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        Then I’m going to pick that point, 
                        opposite, and make it my focus.
           Lola starts to row with razor-like focus -- it feels as 
           though she’s staring directly at Michelle.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        Now I can see if I’m veering off 
                        course. I can hit the brakes--
                        (demonstrates)
                        Steer right-- Or left-- You see?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

                                 LOLA
                        Making sure to bury the blade. 
                        First the blade catches the water. 
                        Then you bury it. Too deep and you 
                        lose the oar. Too high and it’s 
                        like a nick, barely any blood.

           Michelle is getting confused. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Um--

                                 LOLA
                        Watch out.

           Lola brings the oars in.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        Come on, we’re gonna switch. You 
                        try it. Ready?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Oh. Wait.

                                 LOLA
                        Quick so the keel stays even!

           Lola moves toward Michelle.

           Michelle isn’t sure what to do. She lifts off the seat.

                                 MICHELLE
                        How--

                                 LOLA
                        Quick quick!

           Lola throws Michelle to the bow, taking her place. Michelle 
           is a little stunned.
                                 MICHELLE
                        (grabbing her butt)
                        Ow...

           The boat is now drifting -- floating at the mercy of the 
           lake’s changing directions.

           Michelle takes the oars, uneasy. Into the water.

                                 LOLA
                        Slice!

           Michelle rows. Does her best to imitate Lola’s form. She 
           looks over her shoulder, trying to navigate.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        Bury the blade! Dig! Yeah. Now you 
                        get it.

                                 MICHELLE
                        It’s like a rowing machine.

                                 LOLA
                        Yes. A rowing machine is like a 
                        rowboat.

           The oar slips. Michelle scrambles to get it.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        Drive!

           Michelle CHOPS the water. Deep EXHALE. She puts all her 
           effort into it.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Grrraaahhhh--

           The paddles SLICE into the water--

                                 LOLA
                        Drive!

                                                    CUT TO:

           EXT. THE LAKE - A FLOATING DOCK - AFTERNOON

           Frantic, inelegant swimming-- Many arms and legs CRASHING 
           against the surface of the water.

           Michelle reaches the platform first -- Lola a few strokes 
           behind her.
                                 MICHELLE
                        I win!

                                 LOLA
                        As usual...

           Lola stops swimming, she floats the rest of the way. Pissed. 

           Michelle climbs onto the platform. Lies on her back.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Whew. That felt so good.

                                 LOLA
                        Yeah--

           Lola pulls herself up.

           EXT. THE LAKE - A FLOATING DOCK - LATE AFTERNOON

           Lola and Michelle lie in opposing directions, eyes closed. 

           The afternoon sun slowly bakes the water off of their bodies. 

           The trees around the lake seem to grow taller, the landscape 
           nearly claustrophobic, save for the sky’s reflection on the 
           dark water.

           Lola squints one eye open. Shields from the sun with her arm.

           She looks over at Michelle. At her seemingly perfect body -- 
           her perfect bathing suit... Michelle is the sort of slender 
           that makes other women run harder at the gym-- 

           Michelle SIGHS. Lola looks away.

                                 MICHELLE
                        God I just love being cleansed by 
                        the sun. Don’t you?

           Lola closes her eyes.

           PRELAP: A symphony of CRICKETS and other BUZZES and CHIRPS.

           EXT. THE LAKE - A FLOATING DOCK - DUSK

           Sun faded. The sky turns to hues both beautiful and 
           frightening. 

           Lola sits, propped up on one arm. Her hair has dried, frizzy. 
           Her face is pleasant, dreamy. She stares at Michelle, who 
           lies next to her, asleep. 
           It takes us a moment to realize they must have fallen 
           asleep...

           Lola disrupts the silence of the moment:

                                 LOLA
                        Meesh. Meesh!

           Michelle starts awake. She looks at Lola, stunned. 

           Lola strokes her arm, she smiles at Michelle.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Hey... 
                        (looks around)
                        Wow. How long have we been out 
                        here?

           Lola looks around, unfazed. 

           She closes her eyes and listens to the BUZZING all around 
           them...

           A LOW, at first indistinguishable, SOUND rises up, then gains 
           a disturbing volume. SAWING.

           Lola smiles -- she recognizes it. Then:

                                 LOLA
                        Do you remember the night of our 
                        graduation party?

           The SAWING and BUZZING and CHIRPING cacophony of nature seems 
           to get even louder.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Um, yeah. Why?

           Lola stands -- blocking what’s left of the sun.

                                 LOLA
                        I’ve just always wondered if you 
                        and Chase were together that night.

                                 MICHELLE
                        (defensive)
                        Chase and I didn’t get together 
                        until the summertime.

                                 LOLA
                        (pointed)
                        I recall. 
                                 LOLA (CONT'D)
                        But I couldn’t find him that night, 
                        I couldn’t find him at all and then 
                        when he finally appeared he was so 
                        angry with me. Like all of a sudden 
                        he could read my mind and knew all 
                        these things that I’d only told to 
                        you.

                                 MICHELLE
                        That’s--
                        (reconsiders)
                        I mean you two weren’t a good 
                        match, that didn’t have anything to 
                        do with me.

                                 LOLA
                        He knew about the crush I had on 
                        the girl in our theory class. He 
                        was upset because I’d never shared 
                        with him how angry it made me when 
                        he said he didn’t know if he could 
                        deal with dating someone with a 
                        “fucked up family.” Remember?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Family has always been really 
                        important to him...

                                 LOLA
                        He wouldn’t stop accusing me of bad 
                        mouthing him behind his back.

           Michelle stands.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Actually, I’ve been wanting to 
                        bring this up. 

           Lola glares at Michelle, this isn’t what she expected to hear 
           -- she’s not making any sense.

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        I was asleep and you caught me off 
                        guard... Let’s start over.

                                 LOLA
                        Start over how?

           Michelle starts pacing over what little real estate she has 
           on the dock.
                                 MICHELLE
                        (practiced)
                        Lola, I’ve been meaning to bring 
                        this up for years. It’s kind of why 
                        I wanted to come up here. I owe you 
                        a huge apology. Regardless of how 
                        things turned out in the end, I 
                        betrayed your trust as a friend. 
                        And--

           Michelle stops pacing. She’s lost her memorized speech--

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        I haven’t ever stopped feeling 
                        guilty about it. I was young and 
                        stupid and fucked up. You didn’t 
                        deserve to be treated that way by 
                        someone you trusted. I’m so sorry. 
                        Is there any way you can forgive 
                        me? Can we start over as friends? I 
                        promise I’ll never do to you what I 
                        did then. 

           Lola sits back down like she’s had the wind knocked out of 
           her.

           Michelle crouches beside her, chews at her cuticle, anxious.

           Lola catches a glimpse of Michelle’s arm from this new angle -
           - on the underside: scars. Hidden evidence from years of 
           cutting.

           Lola looks down at her own limbs. She has almost identically 
           the same--

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        You were bad mouthing him, anybody 
                        could have told him that. But I 
                        told him. I thought that I was 
                        doing the right thing at the time, 
                        but fuck what I thought. It was 
                        wrong to do that to you. You were 
                        my friend.

           Lola stares at Michelle, tears in her eyes, totally disarmed. 
           She looks at her own hands, goodness knows what she was 
           planning to do with them--

                                 LOLA
                        Okay. I forgive you.

           She’s sealed her fate -- Lola blinks TEARS, surrendering. 
           Michelle grabs her in an embrace.
           The CHIRPING and BUZZING increases frequency and speed until 
           it reaches a loud and high pitched SHRILL--

           Michelle looks up.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Where’s the boat..?

                                                    CUT TO:

           EXT. WOODS - NEXT

           FILTERED: The woods distorted. The light is blue, pale -- as 
           though it exists far away from time as we know it.

           We whirl past Michelle and Lola - soaking wet hair - as they 
           walk through the thick trees.

           They hold hands. It’s sweet, almost childlike. 

                                 LOLA
                        This way.

           The two continue to walk. Leaves CRUNCHING beneath their 
           feet.  

           Lola leads them up the crest of a hill. 

           She stops at the top of the incline to survey the scene 
           before her. Michelle approaches from behind.

           Michelle puts her arms around Lola, nuzzles her face into her 
           neck. Kisses her shoulder.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Are you sure? I think the house is 
                        the other way.

                                 LOLA
                        (creepy)
                        Don’t you trust me?

                                 MICHELLE
                        It’s not about trust. It’s about 
                        not getting lost in the woods.

                                 LOLA
                        (mocking)
                        You sure about that?

           Michelle shakes her head, fighting her unease. She backs 
           away, heads back down the way they came.
                                 MICHELLE
                        I’m going back.

                                 LOLA
                        (taunting)
                        Back where?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Stop it!

           Michelle picks up speed. Her gait disrupts dead leaves and 
           branches-- cascading DETRITUS. 

                                 LOLA
                        (back to normal)
                        Ohmygod don’t move!

           Michelle freezes. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        What is it? What is it?!

           Lola ambles over to Michelle: there’s a black, slimy LEECH on 
           Michelle’s back.

                                 LOLA
                        Holy shit you got a big one--

           Michelle FLAILS her arms, twisting around-- 

                                 MICHELLE
                        What is it?!

                                 LOLA
                        Stay still!

           Lola puts her hands on Michelle.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        They’re just blood cleaners...

                                 MICHELLE
                        (whimpering)
                        Get it out get it out!

           Lola expertly extracts the leech. 

           She holds it up for Michelle to see.

                                 LOLA
                        See?

           Michelle near tears, she’s horrified.
           Lola grins. Then-- EATS IT.

                                 MICHELLE
                        OH MY go--

           Michelle GAGS.

           Lola smiles. Her mouth bloody. She LAUGHS.

           Michelle wretches -- DOUBLES OVER, then VOMITS black SLUDGE. 
           An otherworldly sound comes with it. She gasps for air.

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        Help! Help!

                                 LOLA
                        (laughing)
                        Awwww...

           A SINGLE SNAP of a branch-- From somewhere deep within the 
           woods. Their heads both whip in the direction of the sound--

           PRELAP: A KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK against the wooden door--

           INT. LAKE HOUSE - EVENING

           Lola OPENS the front door-- A NOSY NEIGHBOR, TED (50s) stands 
           on the porch, gnats swarm around his head.

                                 TED
                        Heya, Lo. ...Your dad around?

                                 LOLA
                        Heya, Ted. No, he’s not. 
                        (opens the door to show 
                        Michelle)
                        Just us two girls this weekend.

                                 TED
                        Ah. I saw him pass by a few days 
                        ago. Then thought-- no how-- 
                        haven’t seen ol’ Don in years.

                                 LOLA
                        Yeah, he was up here. Went back 
                        home, though.

           Michelle joins Lola at the door.
                                 TED
                        Oh, right. Well, just wanted to 
                        stop by to tell you all to stay 
                        safe. Ranger found a body out in 
                        the woods early this morn’-- 

           Michelle GASPS. Lola covers her mouth.

                                 TED (CONT'D)
                        Looks like he was mauled by a... 
                        Some kinda creature, I don’t know.

                                 LOLA
                        What do you mean?

                                 TED
                        Well everybody’s saying it’s got to 
                        be a bear, but I’ve seen those 
                        remains an’, don’t look like the 
                        work of a bear to me.

           He thinks about it, grave.

                     MICHELLE
              (to Lola)
                                            TED (CONT'D)
                                     They’re too lil’ for that...
           Didn’t you see a bear out 
           here the other night?

                                 LOLA
                        Where did they find the-- body?
                        (to Michelle)
                        God, we were just out there...

                                 TED
                        South side of the lake. 

           Ted turns and points -- out and across to the other side of 
           the lake. The same direction we saw Lola rowing from on her 
           solo trip, after Don...

                                 MICHELLE
                        What kind of other animals are out 
                        here??

                                 TED
                        That does that..? I don’t know. 

           He thinks about it some more.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        Just be careful, girls. Keep 
                        indoors at night. At least for now 
                        til they figure out what we’re 
                        dealing with here.
           Ted backs away -- towards his car.

                                 LOLA
                        Okay. We will.

           Ted STARTS his car. Rolls down the window-- Shouts:

                                 TED
                        ...And stay outta the woods!

           They watch him back out of the driveway...

                                 MICHELLE
                        Jeez. Is he always that intense?

                                 LOLA
                        No. Not at all really. 

           ...and drive away from the property.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Whatever he saw must’ve really 
                        scared him...

           Michelle’s disposition darkens. She moves Lola aside -- 
           pushes the door SHUT. 

           Lola stares at Michelle, frowning -- when did she start 
           acting like that?

           INT. KITCHEN - NEXT

           Lola TOSSES OPEN a large roll of clear, plastic sheeting.

           Michelle pulls out a long strip of tape. Secures a length of 
           plastic to the ceiling where Lola holds it in place.

           Lola rips off a hunk of tape with her teeth. Applies it, then 
           another, to reinforce the ceiling.

           Lola pushes soaked towels forward, trying to back the sludge 
           away from the kitchen perimeter. Michelle tapes the plastic 
           down in its place.

                                 MICHELLE
                        You really think this is gonna 
                        work?

                                 LOLA
                        (choking from the stench)
                        S’got to.
           Lola carefully applies tape to seal the final seam between 
           two lengths of plastic.

           Their mission is complete -- the kitchen is sealed off 
           completely, like some sort of biohazard quarantine. The clear 
           plastic sheeting giving a vague sense of what’s lying behind 
           it.

           Lola and Michelle admire their work. Then:

                                 MICHELLE
                        So now, uh, dinner?

                                 LOLA
                        Fuck.

           Lola STORMS out of the room. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        I’m sorry, I was trying to be 
                        funny...

           Lola SLAMS her bedroom door shut behind her. Michelle JUMPS, 
           loud noises always seem to make her bolt out of her skin...

           INT. LAKE HOUSE - DINING ROOM - LATE EVENING

           Through the windows we can see the sky outside -- it glows 
           with a lighter blue, gradually darkening. 

           Lola and Michelle sit at the table. Candles lit between them. 
           Red wine and delivery pizza -- it looks every bit as limp and 
           lukewarm as you’d expect to get in back-woods New Jersey.

           It’s awkwardly quiet. Lola makes no attempt at conversation. 
           No clinking of glasses.

           Michelle seems unable to bear the tension between them--

                                 MICHELLE
                        I’m sorry.

           Lola looks up at Michelle, waiting for more.

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        I know this is your mother’s 
                        house...

           Lola averts her gaze.

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        I-- I’ve just been feeling pretty 
                        ripped out of myself today.
                                 LOLA
                        ...I know what you mean.

           Michelle SLURPS her wine. She puts the glass down, 
           embarrassed by the noise. Flashes an awkward half smile, 
           leans back in her chair. The chair SQUEAKS. Michelle closes 
           her eyes, exhales.

           Lola forces a smile. Drinks some wine.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        It’s fine. I’m just feeling... 
                        moody.

                                 MICHELLE
                        (sarcastic)
                        Oh. PMS?

           That gets a chuckle out of both of them. The amusement wanes--

                                 LOLA
                        You know I don’t really paint much 
                        anymore, either. I haven’t picked 
                        up a brush in years. Or at least it 
                        feels that way...

           Lola holds up her glass.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        Now you know my biggest secret.

           Michelle complies, CLINKS her glass against Lola’s.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Cheers, I guess. 
                        (fumbling)
                        I’m sorry. ...Thank you for sharing 
                        that.

           They drink. Michelle opens her mouth to say-- reconsiders. 
           Then--

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        I hate that fucking tesla. Now you 
                        know mine.

           Lola observes Michelle. Sees right through that.

                                 LOLA
                        You’ve really got to stop 
                        apologizing so much.

                                                    CUT TO:
           INT. MICHELLE’S ROOM - A DREAM - NIGHT 

           Michelle in bed, asleep.

           A low rumbling, SCRATCHING SOUND gains momentum outside the 
           window. Michelle’s eyes OPEN. 

           The sound travels past... She holds her breath.

           Then, the SOUNDS SHIFT. It’s coming from inside the house...

           INT. LAKE HOUSE - NEXT

           Michelle peers out of her doorway. The sound GROWS.

           Her ears lead her towards the kitchen. She creeps closer. The 
           sounds like the slow, deliberate SAWING OF BONES. 

           INT. KITCHEN - NEXT

           Michelle approaches, quiet. A shadowy figure behind the 
           plastic causes her to CATCH her breath. 

           The figure takes shape -- it’s LOLA. She stands in front of 
           the sink. Michelle moves closer to see--

           Lola dips her hands in, plays with the oozing, brown SLUDGE. 

           Lola looks up at Michelle. She smiles, demented. Her eyes 
           empty, like the glassy surface of the lake.

           Michelle SCREAMS--

                                                    CUT TO:

           INT. LAKE HOUSE - MORNING

           Michelle enters, dressed for the day. Approaches the window, 
           admiring the view...

           Something catches her eye--

           Outside: the shoreline -- the ROWBOAT is there.

           Michelle looks over her shoulder, paranoid.

           The sound of the SHOWER sputtering to life filters in from 
           the bathroom. The room is empty. 

           Michelle shakes her head, disturbed -- did she dream 
           everything?
           INT. LOLA’S ROOM - NEXT

           Michelle eases into the room, steps carefully, not to make a 
           sound.

           What’s she looking for? She’s not even sure.

           The bedside table comes into focus. Michelle takes a step 
           towards it--

           A CREEAAAKKK from the closet--

           Michelle frowns. She turns around, eyeing it.

                                                    CUT TO:

           The closet door opens. Michelle gasps.

           A big painting on the wall -- giant swirls of blue feed into 
           a deep, black hole.

           Michelle reaches out, hands shaking. The paint -- It’s still 
           wet.

           INT. LAKE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Lola and Michelle sit across from one another. More red wine. 

           Michelle takes cautious sips, keeping her eyes on Lola. She’s 
           suspicious, but she’s not even sure of what.

           They’re playing a trivia card game called “Vices.” The black 
           and gold box lies open beside them. Lola draws a card. An 
           image of a devil sticking its tongue out on the back of it.

                                 LOLA
                        (reading)
                        What did author Yukio Mishima call 
                        “the ultimate form of 
                        masturbation?”

                                 MICHELLE
                        Um. Shit, I don’t know. ...The 
                        selfie?

                                 LOLA
                        Okay, this game was made in the 
                        80s...

                                 MICHELLE
                        Just tell me.

           Lola flips over the card. Reads:
                                 LOLA
                        Ritual suicide, “Seppuku.”

           Michelle’s eyes widen. She frowns.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Okay...

           Michelle draws a card.

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        Have you ever thought about killing 
                        anyone?

           Lola frowns.

                                 LOLA
                        That’s the question?

                                 MICHELLE
                        No. Sorry. Just... a random 
                        question.

           Lola sips her wine, eyeing Michelle.

                                 LOLA
                        I’m not sure I know what you mean.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Last night, we were talking about 
                        secrets. I guess it’s just always 
                        been this weird fantasy of mine...

                                 LOLA
                        So you’re biggest secret isn’t that 
                        you hate your liberal guilt 
                        spaceship... it’s that you’re 
                        harboring a murderous rage.

                                 MICHELLE
                        No, I mean, it’s not that big of a 
                        deal. Just thinking about “if I did 
                        it, how would I...” Etcetera, 
                        etcetera.

           Lola stares at Michelle, waiting for more. Michelle can’t 
           take the heat. She looks down at her card. Reads:

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        Um, okay: “With what object does a 
                        demon force Linda Blair to 
                        masturbate with in The 
                        Exorcist...?”
                                 LOLA
                        A crucifix.

           Michelle checks the answer. Lola got it right.

                                 MICHELLE
                        You played this game as a kid?

                                 LOLA
                        Dad’s favorite.

                        (laughing)
                        That’s fucked. 
                        (embarrassed)
                        Sorry. I didn’t mean--

                                 LOLA
                        No I get it. My childhood was 
                        hilarious. Next?

           Michelle complies, draws another card. Reads:

                        What author loved to beat dogs to 
                        death on his nightly walks?! Oh my 
                        god!

                                 LOLA
                        So how would you do it?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Huh?

                                 LOLA
                        It’s Guy de Maupassant. How would 
                        you kill somebody? “Etcetera, 
                        etcetera...”

                                 MICHELLE
                        I’ve never thought of anything that 
                        would satisfy me.

                                 LOLA
                        Satisfy?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Like the desire to hurt this one 
                        person. Killing them isn’t enough.

                                 LOLA
                        Really. How so.
                                 MICHELLE
                        You’d understand if-- It’s just 
                        this dumb thing I think about 
                        sometimes to make me feel better. 

                                 LOLA
                        Killing someone, or how that 
                        wouldn’t be enough?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Both, I don’t know.

                                 LOLA
                        I think you do know.

           Michelle eyes Lola -- what’s she mean by that?

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        So, is it some serial killer shit 
                        or... Just one person in 
                        particular?

                                 MICHELLE
                        I don’t know! It’s-- Both. This guy 
                        assaulted me once. I don’t even 
                        know why I brought it up.

                                 LOLA
                        And now you want to kill all the 
                        men?

                                 MICHELLE
                        No!

                                 LOLA
                        What did he do to you?

                                 MICHELLE
                        I don’t-- Really want to talk about 
                        it.

                                 LOLA
                        You think I don’t have my fair 
                        share of horror stories?

                                 MICHELLE
                        It’s not that...

                                 LOLA
                        You think I won’t get it.

           Michelle pauses. Looks at Lola’s chewed-up fingernails. Her 
           scabby cuticles.
                                 MICHELLE
                        We both do that.

           Lola follows Michelle’s gaze to her fingers. Michelle’s 
           picked a freshly bloody CUTICLE as we speak--

                                 LOLA
                        I noticed.

                                 MICHELLE
                        It’s the worst, I can’t stop no 
                        matter how hard I try. One time 
                        Chase even tried to make me wear 
                        oven mitts around the house so I 
                        couldn’t do it anymore.

                                 LOLA
                        Uhuh. Classic Chase... And then 
                        what happened?

                                 MICHELLE
                        I just scratched at myself with the 
                        other fingernails anyway... Inside 
                        the mitts, you know.

           Lola chuckles knowingly--

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        Chase really hates it. He says it’s 
                        so unlike me.

                                 LOLA
                        Is it? You’re behaving unlike 
                        yourself?

                                 MICHELLE
                        No, I guess-- It’s just a different 
                        part. Probably one that would take 
                        over if I let it.

                                 LOLA
                        Then you’d have frizzy hair in no 
                        time?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Something like that, yeah.

           There’s a certain sadness to Michelle as she says that. She 
           sips her wine, lost in a thought--

           Lola looks over at the plastic quarantined kitchen -- the 
           faint sound of bubbling sludge filters over from behind it...
                                 LOLA
                        ...My dad used to do this thing 
                        when I was a kid where he’d put me 
                        in dangerous situations and then 
                        punish me if I fucked up-- Like, if 
                        I let myself get hurt or if I got 
                        scared. I was supposed to be 
                        stronger than that.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Stronger than what?

                                 LOLA
                        Than being vulnerable. Weak. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Chase isn’t like that.

                                 LOLA
                        (surprised she took it 
                        there)
                        Are you sure?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Yeah. I’m sure. He just wants me to 
                        be my best self.

                                 LOLA
                        Like your mom?

                                 MICHELLE
                        What?

                                 LOLA
                        Didn’t you always used to say that-- 
                        Your mom, “she just wants me to be 
                        my best self.” But she just... 
                        ignored who you were completely.

           Michelle forces a half-smile. Sips her wine again. She looks 
           wounded, hurt.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Huh. You remembered that.

           Lola gestures as if to say, ‘of course I did.’

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        She did ignore who I was 
                        completely... I was too emotional, 
                        too damaged. She didn’t want me to 
                        be my best self... She wanted me to 
                        be her ‘perfect version’ of myself. 
           Michelle takes a gulp of wine, then:

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        It was empty and hollow. 
                        Meaningless, bullshit.

                                 LOLA
                        Whew! Let it out, sister.

           Michelle shakes her head. She can’t.

                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        And you’re sure Chase isn’t the 
                        same way?

           A flash of recognition in Michelle’s eyes.

                                 MICHELLE
                        What?

           Michelle’s stares at Lola, intense. Her face reddens. She 
           looks like she might explode, or cry.

                                 LOLA
                        Okay... ‘Mea culpa.’

           Lola beats her chest for emphasis.

           EXT. THE LAKE - NIGHT

           The water CHURNS, SWELLS. 

           Something below the surface, trying to break free.

           INT. LAKE HOUSE - LOLA’S ROOM - NIGHT

           A CRUNCHING BOOM. Lola’s eyes fly open. 

           The noise reverberates into that same low, SAWING sound.

           Lola sits up. She looks down at her abdomen. The SAWING grows 
           louder. Lola looks up - it’s not her - the sounds are coming 
           from inside the house.

           Lola goes to the door. 

           The SAWING BREATHS give way to SCRATCHING. Sharp nails. 
           CLAWING to get in.

           It’s CLOSE -- it’s coming from Michelle’s room.
           INT. MICHELLE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           The SCRATCHING continues, persistent... 

           The moon illuminates Michelle in a calm yet eerie light. Lola 
           creeps closer. 

           It’s coming from underneath Michelle’s bed. 

           Lola crouches to look underneath--

           Her ear guides her upward. The SCRATCHING and SAWING seems to 
           be coming from inside Michelle.

           A hand SLAPS against Lola’s wrist. She GASPS-- all the air 
           sucked out of her.

           Michelle holds onto Lola -- her grip TIGHT. Painful.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Don’t be a fucker just do it.

           Lola HEAVES for air that will not enter her lungs.

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        Fucking do it, you baby. Fuck you 
                        and give it to me. It’s time. Fuck 
                        you, I’ll never know! 

           Lola finally INHALES. SCREAMS. Hits at Michelle’s arms, 
           panicked. Michelle gets even closer, her skin blue veins and 
           grey. She GROWLS:

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        Fucking give it to me in my sleep.

           Lola finally pries Michelle’s fingers off her wrist. She 
           flees.

           EXT. LAKE HOUSE - SHORELINE - NIGHT

           Lola in a panic-- 

           She undresses quickly. Mutters a chant to herself. Wades in 
           up to her ankles.

                                 LOLA
                        My road is open. My way is clear. 

           Lola looks up toward the moon -- nothing. It doesn’t seem to 
           be anywhere in the sky.
                                 LOLA (CONT’D)
                        With the power of me, I set you 
                        free..

           Lola near hyperventilating. She dives into the water. Swims--

           Arms and legs move through the murky water. 

           Lola multiplies. There’s another body...

                                                    CUT TO:

           Lola surfaces. Michelle beside her. 

           The moon, bright, lights up the lake. 

           The two women kiss, passionate. Lola loses herself in the 
           duty of this intimate act.

           Lola pulls away, holds Michelle’s head. Her mouth open, she 
           pushes her towards the water...

                                 MICHELLE
                        Wait--

           Michelle CHOKES, suffocating, drowning.

           Lola leans over Michelle. She releases BLACK SLUDGE into 
           Michelle’s open mouth. Her vomiting sounds like a WAR CRY. 

                                                    CUT TO:

           INT. LAKE HOUSE - MICHELLE’S ROOM - DAWN

           Michelle wakes up suddenly-- lifted by her sternum. She GASPS 
           for air.

           HEAVE-- 

           HEAVE-- 

           HEAVE--

           Her arms flail. Wildly. She looks around the room. 

           There’s nothing-- Nothing there.

           Michelle starts to regain her senses. 

           She drops back into the bed. Slows her breath.

                                                SMASHCUT TO:
           EXT. A BUSY STREET - MANHATTAN - MORNING

           The BLARING cacophony of a Midtown Manhattan street. A SWARM 
           of yellow cabs speeds past. SIRENS in the background. 
           CLANGING of coffee carts. The subway RUMBLES underground.

           PEDESTRIANS bubble over from the sidewalk. They spill onto 
           the street, shuffle their way across asphalt to avoid 
           oncoming cars.

           Michelle comes into view -- seemingly out of nowhere. 

           Her face devoid of any expression, she’s wearing an 
           uncharacteristic BRIGHT RED LIP. 

           Michelle breaks away from us. Crosses the street to join the 
           throng of morning commuters.

                                                    CUT TO:

           EXT. SIDEWALK - NEXT

           Throngs in business attire rush past in both directions.

           Michelle is a few steps ahead of us. There’s something 
           different about her -- she’s hunched, her body full of 
           tension.

           We weave through the crowd trying to keep up with her -- our 
           view often lost, interrupted by other people on the sidewalk.

           Michelle crosses the street-- a taxi ZOOMS past. 

           Michelle continues her staccato march. We lose her.

                                                    CUT TO:

           INT. MICHELLE’S OFFICE - DAY

           A plush, cushy office belonging to a high-end design firm. 

           We creep through the empty entryway. Peer around the corner, 
           into the open layout...

           Michelle sits at a desk. She jabs at her keyboard, 
           aggressive.

           A CO-WORKER, JENNA (40s) passes by Michelle - heads for the 
           desk several feet behind hers.
                                 JENNA
                        Lots of email to catch up on! 
                        Almost makes taking time off not 
                        worth it.

           Michelle doesn’t bite.

           TAP TAP TAP--

           INT. MICHELLE’S DESK - NEXT

           The workspace well put together and unmistakably hers.

           --TAP.

                                 MICHELLE
                        (aggressive)
                        Fucking rep for the Madison account 
                        is so stupid and so condescending 
                        at the same time. Like thank you, 
                        Josh, I’m aware that it’s Monday. 
                        Try to spell it properly next time, 
                        asshole.

                                 JENNA
                        Whoa. Can I see?

           Jenna appears behind Michelle. Peers at her computer screen. 
           She reads, grins.

                                 JENNA (CONT’D)
                        Wow. He really is a dumb cunt.

           Jenna looks at Michelle, notices something different--

                                 JENNA (CONT’D)
                        Love that lip color.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Thanks.

                                 JENNA
                        Much more eye-catching than your 
                        usual...

                                 MICHELLE
                        You know you might want to refrain 
                        from using the word cunt as an 
                        insult, it’s perpetuating the 
                        bullshit notion that having, or 
                        being, a vagina is weak.
                                 JENNA
                        Oh. Yeah, totally.

           Jenna returns to her desk. Michelle to her keyboard assault.

                                 JENNA (CONT’D)
                        So did you have a nice trip?

           TAP TAP TAP TAP-- Pause.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Yes, I had a nice trip. Thank you 
                        for asking.

           INT. NAIL SALON - AFTERNOON

           Michelle sits at a small desk -- a NAIL TECHNICIAN (50s) uses 
           a sharp tool to scrape the dirt out from under her stubby, 
           bitten nails.

           The nail salon has a bright, clinical vibe. Large light 
           panels decorate the wall behind the Nail Technician. Splotchy 
           branch patterns splayed across them.

           The Nail Technician takes out a file.

                                 NAIL TECHNICIAN
                        You bite.

                                 MICHELLE
                        A little.

           Nail Technician clicks her tongue in frustration.

           CCCRRRRHH-- CRRRHHH-- CRRRHHHH-- The nail file grates across 
           the tops of Michelle’s fingers. Michelle winces--

           It SCRATCHES across Michelle’s fingernails. The sound gets 
           louder. It starts to sound like the SAWING we heard so many 
           times at the lake...

           Michelle stares at the wall, hypnotized by the scratching 
           sound.

           The branch pattern flickers, starts to MOVE across the wall 
           to the beat of the now deafening CLAWING SOUND--

           Just make it go away. Michelle squeezes her eyes SHUT-- 

                                                    CUT TO:
           INT. EXERCISE STUDIO - EVENING

           Michelle is one of four WOMEN spread out on the wood floor, 
           in the midst of a pilates class. 

           At the front of the class, the teacher, MOLLY, leads the 
           women through their routine. The women all seem to know it by 
           heart, including Michelle - but her movements lack prowess. 
           Her body seems stiff, awkward. Molly comes over, tries to 
           guide her.

                                 MOLLY
                        You doin’ okay? I thought you had 
                        this in the bag.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Fine, just-- 

           Michelle gets frustrated, releases the pose.

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        I did a lot of rowing this weekend, 
                        I dunno.

                                 MOLLY
                        Ohhh that’ll do a number on your 
                        lats. Try this--

           Molly demonstrates an adjustment for Michelle.

           Michelle, flustered, struggles to execute it--

           INT. MICHELLE’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Water SPRAYS against tile. Michelle is in the shower. She 
           washes her hair. Washes her face. Rinses. She can finally 
           breathe.

           From outside the steamy bathroom we can hear the faint sound 
           of the apartment’s front door OPENING and CLOSING.

                                 CHASE (O.S.)
                        (from elsewhere in the 
                        apartment)
                        Babe?

           Michelle doesn’t respond. Doesn’t even seem to register. She 
           relishes in the water pressure.

                                 CHASE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Babe..!

           The bathroom door swings open. Michelle SCREAMS, startled.
                                 CHASE (CONT’D)
                        (annoyed)
                        Babe.

           This is CHASE (30s), the sort of guy who looks equal parts 
           prince charming and privileged buffoon -- or maybe just like 
           he’s been trying to fit in at the country club his entire 
           life.

                                 MICHELLE
                        You scared me.

                                 CHASE
                        You didn’t hear me?

           Chase goes to the sink. Begins to wash his hands.

                                 MICHELLE
                        No I-- Nevermind. Just wasn’t 
                        expecting...

           Michelle watches him, annoyed. She thinks about how he 
           could’ve done that in the hall bathroom, or even in the 
           kitchen--

           Chase turns off the sink faucet. Dries his hands. 

                                 CHASE
                        (gestures to Michelle in 
                        the shower, not ready)
                        So. No going out for dinner 
                        tonight, then?

           He exits the bathroom. Takes off his tie, starts to undress--

                                 MICHELLE
                        Could you close the door? It’s 
                        letting all the steam out.

           Chase returns, SHUTS the bathroom door behind him. 

                                 CHASE
                        Better?

           He continues to undress, steam gathering all around him.

           He’s approaching nudity. Chase grins, mischievous. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Yes. Thank you.

           Chase joins Michelle in the shower.
                                 CHASE
                        I missed you.

           Michelle puts on a smile. They kiss. Rushed, but not entirely 
           dispassionate. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Mmm. I missed you too.

           Chase lathers up. Michelle tries to get herself back into 
           enjoying the shower mode.

                                 CHASE
                        So. How was hanging out with the 
                        drama queen?

                                 MICHELLE
                        It was... Good.

                                 CHASE
                        She didn’t go all single white 
                        female on you?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Clearly not.

                                 CHASE
                        Did you have fun?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Yeah. It was good.

                                 CHASE
                        Wow. So much good. I don’t know 
                        what to do with all this 
                        information.

           Michelle turns to rinse her face.

                                 CHASE (CONT’D)
                        Ooh!

           His fingers zero in on what we can assume is a pimple on 
           Michelle’s back -- she immediately tries to shove him off.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Stop!

                                 CHASE
                        Come on, let me get it!

           He focuses on finishing the pimple. She lets him.
           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Chase sits on the sofa, he’s watching a reality singing 
           competition show on the couple’s massive-screen TV.

           Michelle enters, glistening, in a bath robe, her hair damp. 
           Its texture is suddenly frizzy, curly. Like--

           She plops down next to Chase on the sofa. She’s got some Ben 
           and Jerry’s Ice Cream (Strawberry Not So Shortcake.) Digs her 
           spoon into the smooth surface of the fresh pint.

           Chase glares at this ice cream spectacle.

                                 CHASE
                        We are not having ice cream for 
                        dinner.

                                 MICHELLE
                        I’m eating some ice cream.

           She puts the spoonful into her mouth.

                                 CHASE
                        (to himself)
                        Sick.

                                 MICHELLE
                        What?

                                 CHASE
                        No, I’m just thinking of all that 
                        dairy and sugar on an empty 
                        stomach...

           He rubs his belly as though in pain.

                                 CHASE (CONT’D)
                        (burps)
                        Guh.

           Michelle stares at Chase, holds her spoon mid air. She looks 
           halfway to stabbing him with it.

           Michelle gets up, exits.

           INT. HALLWAY - NEXT

           Michelle passes a painting in the hallway, does a double 
           take.

           It’s a landscape. Realistically rendered, classy frame. 
           She pauses, inspecting it:  a wooded LAKE beneath mountains. 
           A few clouds in the sky.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Babe?

                                 CHASE (O.S.)
                        Yeah?

                                 MICHELLE
                        What happened to my painting?

                                 CHASE (O.S.)
                        What painting?

                                 MICHELLE
                        The painting that I painted. That 
                        used to be hanging right here in 
                        the hallway.

           Chase enters.

                                 CHASE
                        Oh, yeah. You like it? I met the 
                        artist at this opening...

                                 MICHELLE
                        Where’s my painting?

           Chase continues into the kitchen.

                                 CHASE (O.S.)
                        It’s in the closet. I couldn’t find 
                        a new spot for it. Those colors 
                        really clash, you know?

           Michelle stares at the landscape. Chase’s words echo in her 
           ears, reach a shrill pitch. 

           She zeroes in on the lake...

           INT. KITCHEN - NEXT

           The ice cream goes back in the freezer. 

           Michelle slams the door SHUT--

                                                    CUT TO:
           INT. CHASE AND MICHELLE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The couple is mid-fuck. Squeezed together in a tight ball of 
           bodies in motion.

           Rapid moaning from her. Grunting from him.

           They slow-- Intensify. Michelle wields her body to relocate 
           Chase, gets on top of him. 

           She fucks Chase. Her body stiff and violent. It’s hard to 
           tell if she’s normally like this in bed, or if she’s suddenly 
           changed... 

           The movements of her body stretch and strain. From this 
           angle, her figure looks uncannily similar to Lola’s--

                                                    CUT TO:

           INT. CHASE AND MICHELLE’S BEDROOM - LATER

           A silent, still view of the couple’s impressively large 
           bedroom. Manhattan skyline out the window. A massive king 
           bed.

           The couple lays, post-coital, spread out.

           Michelle stares at the ceiling -- spaced out, still agitated. 
           She SNAPS her fingers, aggressive, to a slow, imaginary beat, 

           SNAP-- 

           The same beat as the nail file, as the saw-- 

           SNAP-- SNAP--

           We creep closer to Michelle. To her hand.

           SNAP--

           We move closer.

           SNA-- Chase puts his hand over hers.

                                 CHASE
                        Baby, shh.

           Michelle rips her hand away, throws the covers off--

                                 MICHELLE
                        Okay you want to have a 
                        confrontation? Let’s have a 
                        confrontation.
           Michelle gets out of bed.

                                 CHASE
                        Huh?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Just tell me. What’s your fucking 
                        problem?

                                 CHASE
                        My problem? I’m getting yelled at 
                        right now?

                                 MICHELLE
                        That’s fucking idiotic.

           Michelle starts getting dressed--

                                 CHASE
                        What? What is going on with you?

                                 MICHELLE
                        You tell me.

                                 CHASE
                        I’ll tell you you’re acting super 
                        weird. You don’t ask me how my day 
                        was, how my weekend was--

                                 MICHELLE
                        How was your day? How was your 
                        weekend?

                                 CHASE
                        And yelling at me for no reason 
                        after just taking off without me 
                        for the weekend without--

                                 MICHELLE
                        Ohhh I knew it.

                                 CHASE
                        Knew what?

                                 MICHELLE
                        You don’t like it when I go off 
                        without you. Little Michelley might 
                        get some ideas of her own.

                                 CHASE
                        That’s not even--

           Michelle opens her closet. Stares at the curated palette of 
           clothing.
                                 MICHELLE
                        Why the fuck do I dress like I’m in 
                        a Chico’s catalogue?

                                 CHASE
                        --Chico’s..?

           She opens Chase’s closet: the same palette on display.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Because you dress like a fucking 
                        Chico’s catalogue!

                                 CHASE
                        (trying to reason)
                        Michelle. Baby. Just talk to me. 
                        Tell me. What the fuck is going on?

                                 MICHELLE
                        You wanna erase me? I’ll show you 
                        who’s getting erased. 

           She gets dressed--

                                 CHASE
                        (incredulous)
                        Really?

                                 MICHELLE
                        You ready? 

           She exits the room.

           The front door to the apartment SLAMS shut as she exits.

           INT. SUBWAY STATION - NEXT

           Michelle stomps down the stairs as though trying to give the 
           stiffness in her body release.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Fuck fuck fuck fuuuuuck!!

           She shoves a trash can onto its side. Kicks it.

           Michelle takes a few deep breaths. Looks up at the MTA 
           display: 

           4 MIN.

           The trash can see-saws from Michelle’s kick, its metal edge 
           GRATING against the concrete platform. 
           The GRATING gives way to a familiar, urgent SAWING. On the 
           subway tracks, rats respond to it. They scurry in a panic.

           Michelle tries to crack her neck. In the background, a figure 
           comes down the stairs.

           SAWING-- SAWING--

           A large brown SPIDER ambles over Michelle’s foot. It looks 
           like the one we saw at the lake house, revived and out of 
           place.

           Michelle doesn’t flinch. Hovers, then lowers her foot onto 
           it, slow. CRRRRUNCH--

                                 OLD MAN (O.S.)
                        Hey, honey. You okay?

           Michelle takes a second to respond. She lifts her shoe, 
           inspects the carnage.

                                 MICHELLE
                        You should leave me alone.

           He gets closer. His HEAVY, LABORED BREATHING mixes with the 
           SAWING, gets LOUDER. 

           He reaches out a hand, touches her lower back--

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t touch me!

           She shoves--

           CRUNCH.

           Michelle takes a step towards the yellow line of the subway 
           platform, peers over the edge--

           The OLD MAN (70s) lays sprawled across the tracks. Knocked 
           out, must’ve hit his head.

                                 SUBWAY INTERCOM (O.S.)
                        There is a-- downtown-- express-- 
                        train-- Approaching the station. 
                        Please stand away from the platform 
                        edge.

           The train is coming. The horn HONKS.

           Michelle watches, calm. She peers down. Her hair flies wild, 
           kicking up around her face.

           A few MEN (20s-40s) in MTA construction gear rush past.
                                 MTA WORKER
                        THERE’S A GUY ON THE TRACKS! STOP 
                        THE TRAIN!

           A maglite flashes signals to the conductor--

           The train RUMBLES closer, it slows, halts. 

           Michelle glares in its direction. Her eyes low.

           The men pull the old man up, back onto the platform.

                                 MTA WORKER (CONT’D)
                        (radios)
                        We’re gonna need an ambulance here, 
                        gotta guy passed out on the track--

           Michelle plasters on a smile, like a good girl.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Thank god you came.

           She turns and walks away.

           INT. BAR - LATER

           Good-time MUSIC PLAYS. Michelle stands at the bar with TWO 
           GUYS who are maybe younger than her-- if not in age, 
           definitely in lifestyle. 

           The trio takes a round of shots. 

           GUY #1 is the level of drunk that reduces one to a 
           conversational emcee. GUY #2 is loving the spotlight.

           Michelle’s hair is still curly -- frizzy from air drying. 
           She’s sporting the red lip. She looks disarmingly pretty, but 
           in an almost unrecognizable way...

                                 GUY #2
                        What’d you say your name was again?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Lola. Cheers.

           She holds up another shot glass. Downs it.

                                 GUY #2
                        (sing-song)
                        ‘LalalalaLola--’

                                 GUY #1
                        Oh yeah what’s that song--
                                 MICHELLE
                        (to Guy #2, sarcastic)
                        Wow buddy, never heard that one 
                        before... Can’t imagine why you’re 
                        single.
                        (to Guy #1)
                        It’s called ‘Lola.’

                                 GUY #1
                        Oooouch.

                                 GUY #2
                        Who says I’m single?

                                 MICHELLE
                        You act like you’re single.

                                 GUY #2
                        How do single people act?

                                 MICHELLE
                        They let strange women buy them 
                        several rounds of shots at a dive 
                        bar on a Monday night.

                                 GUY #1
                        Touché...

           Guy #2 doesn’t have anything to say to this. He just eyes 
           Michelle like he’s met his embittered, intellectual match--

                                 GUY #2
                        Well you seem like a real peach 
                        yourself.

                                 MICHELLE
                        You objectifying me?

           She bursts out laughing at her own joke. The two guys follow 
           her lead.

                                 GUY #2
                        No, I get it, you’re trying to tell 
                        me I’m being misogynistic or 
                        something. And that’s a double 
                        standard.

                                 GUY #1
                        That’s not fair!

                                 MICHELLE
                        How’s that a double standard?
                                 GUY #2
                        Here you are buying us drinks like 
                        we’re just pieces of meat and what 
                        do you expect in return?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Maybe my motives aren’t pure. But 
                        that’s my business.

                                 GUY #1
                        Yeah. Wait what?

                                 GUY #2
                        Now wait a minute, let me explain--

                                 GUY #1
                        Explain! Let the man explain

           Michelle leans in closer to Guy #2.

                                 MICHELLE
                        I’m pretty sure you can’t tell me 
                        what to do.

           INT. BROOKLYN APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT

           Michelle enters, drunk, with Guy #2 from the bar.

           Blind fooling around in the dark.

           He pushes her against the wall. She slams him against 
           another. They’re stumbling, drunk.

           Michelle’s phone lights up, but doesn’t make any noise.

           There’s something violent about this drunken hookup that 
           makes us question whether she’s giving him head or hurting 
           him in a very demented way--

                                                    CUT TO:

           INT. THE LAKE HOUSE - A DREAM - NIGHT

           Michelle lies awake in her twin bed. SCRATCHING and BREATHING 
           sounds surround her. Her own breath becomes rapid, panicked-- 

           CRUNCH-- Michelle sits up, looks out the window -- it seems 
           like the sounds are coming from deep within the woods. 

           The SOUNDS GROW closer... And louder-- 

           It’s the SAWING.
           They disappear. Michelle exhales. Wait--

           The SAWING creeps up. SOFT. Barely audible but GROWING AGAIN. 

           It’s coming from inside the house-- It’s coming from inside 
           her--

                                                    CUT TO:

           INT. BROOKLYN APARTMENT - MORNING

           Michelle wakes up -- plain white walls, an unfamiliar space.

           She pulls the dark grey bedsheet around her naked body. The 
           sheet is covered in -- blood stains? The fabric so dark, it’s 
           nearly impossible to tell.

           Michelle stunned, making sure not to look at whatever’s on 
           the bed. She staggers out of the room.

           INT. SUBWAY STATION - MORNING

           Michelle mounts the packed escalator. She stands, waits.

           Her hand grips the conveyor belt -- next to it, her 
           reflection warps and wobbles over the shiny surface of the 
           escalator siding.

           Michelle peers down at her distorted reflection. Her bright 
           RED LIP -- a foreign splotch that wiggles across the metal.

           She rubs it off, quick, disturbed by her own image.

           EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - MORNING

           Michelle walks down the street with a to-go cup of coffee. 
           Sunglasses. A nauseous grimace on her face.

           Michelle stops walking. She sees something: 

           INT. MANHATTAN APARTMENT BUILDING LOBBY - NEXT

           Michelle drags an old, dirty writing desk into the building 
           from the curb. It’s definitely a sight.

           THE DOORMAN opens the entrance door for her, concerned.

                                 DOORMAN
                        You need help--?
                                 MICHELLE
                        No! I got it. I got it!

           Michelle drags the desk across the lobby. It’s like she’s 
           lugging a dead body. Or a rowboat. Her strength seems unreal 
           for her frame, almost hulk-like.

           INT. MICHELLE’S APARTMENT - ENTRYWAY - NEXT

           Michelle shoves the desk through the front door. She’s 
           sweaty, accomplished.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Great. Now...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NEXT

           Michelle’s new desk looks out of place in the otherwise 
           carefully decorated apartment. She didn’t even move other 
           items out of the way to make a proper home for her new find.

           Michelle brings a chair over to the writing desk. She sits, 
           puts her legs up on the desk. Relishes the moment.

           Michelle checks her cellphone. So many missed calls. 

           The screen flashes -- she’s getting another call now: Jenna 
           Office. Michelle puts the phone to her ear.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Hi, Jenna.

                                 JENNA  (O.S.)
                        (over phone)
                        Michelle. Where the fuck are you.

                                 MICHELLE
                        I’m at home. In my new office.

                                 JENNA (O.S.)
                        (over phone)
                        Michelle--

                                 MICHELLE
                        Jenna. Fuck off. 

           Michelle ends the call.

           She pauses. Unsettled.
           INT. MICHELLE’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NEXT

           Michelle hurries into the bathroom. Closes the door behind 
           her.

           Michelle wets a cotton ball with makeup remover, properly 
           wipes the smudged RED lipstick off of her face.

           Inspects herself in the mirror, she doesn’t recognize 
           herself.

           INT. THERAPIST’S OFFICE - EARLY AFTERNOON

           Michelle sits, nervous and small, in a squeaky chair in the 
           corner of a dimly lit room. 

           In the opposite corner, in a nice leather chair, sits her 
           THERAPIST (40s) already balding but still youthful in the 
           face, he has a permanent mocking tone whether he means it or 
           not.

           There’s an awkward pause. He waits for her to begin. Michelle 
           makes an odd, but desperate shrug--

                                 MICHELLE
                        I feel weird.

           He pantomimes her gesture:

                                 THERAPIST
                        “Weird?”

           Long exhale from Michelle.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Yeah. Really weird. Like-- There’s 
                        something wrong. With me.

                                 THERAPIST
                        What makes you think there’s 
                        something wrong with you?

                                 MICHELLE
                        I don’t know, I--

                                 THERAPIST
                        Why don’t you try starting at the 
                        beginning. When did you first feel 
                        this way?

                                 MICHELLE
                        I don’t know where the beginning 
                        is...
                                 MICHELLE (CONT'D)
                        (dawning)
                        I went to see an old friend this 
                        weekend--

                                 THERAPIST
                        Old friend?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Yes, her name’s Lola.

                                 THERAPIST
                        You’ve never mentioned Lola before.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Well it’s been a long time.

                                 THERAPIST
                        You didn’t mention you were going 
                        to see an old friend. I imagine if 
                        it’s been that long it would be 
                        somewhat of an occasion.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Well, I guess, yeah.

                                 THERAPIST
                        But you didn’t bring it up in our 
                        last session, what do you think 
                        that’s about?

                                 MICHELLE
                        In our last session we were talking 
                        about my mother.

                                 THERAPIST
                        I recall...

                                 MICHELLE
                        So it didn’t come to mind. My 
                        mother and Lola have nothing to do 
                        with each other.

                                 THERAPIST
                        That’s interesting. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        What?

                                 THERAPIST
                        That you felt the need to say, “My 
                        mother and Lola have nothing to do 
                        with each other.” Maybe it’s 
                        possible that they do?
                                 MICHELLE
                        I was just trying to address your 
                        question--

                                 THERAPIST
                        Does Lola make you feel invisible, 
                        like your mother does?

                                 MICHELLE
                        No. If anything she makes me feel 
                        too seen...

                                 THERAPIST
                        How so?

                                 MICHELLE
                        (frustrated)
                        I don’t know, like, she notices 
                        everything. Every weakness.

                                 THERAPIST
                        Well there’s a connection there. 
                        One zeroes in on your weaknesses, 
                        the other is terrified to 
                        acknowledge them. Isn’t that, in 
                        its own way, noticing them?

           Michelle shrugs. Shakes her head.

                                 MICHELLE
                        You tell me... I’m just trying to 
                        figure out what’s going on in my 
                        head.

                                 THERAPIST
                        So Lola didn’t come to mind or, did 
                        you, perhaps unconsciously, leave 
                        her out of the conversation?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Sure, maybe I did. I don’t know. It 
                        was “unconscious.”

                                 THERAPIST
                        Well I think that’s something we 
                        need to explore.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Okay.

                                 THERAPIST
                        “Okay.” So why didn’t you want to 
                        talk about Lola?
                                 MICHELLE
                        I didn’t not want to talk about 
                        Lola! I’m trying to tell you that I 
                        went to see her this weekend and 
                        now everything feels off, like, I’m 
                        carrying her around with me, I, 
                        feel like I’m changing and I’m not 
                        in control of it--

                                 THERAPIST
                        She must have had quite an impact 
                        on you.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Yes, that’s the thing. I can’t-- 
                        I’m not-- I’m telling you there’s 
                        something wrong with me.

           A pause. He frowns.

                                 THERAPIST
                        Can you elaborate?

                                 MICHELLE
                        What?!

                                 THERAPIST
                        Tell me your version of what’s 
                        wrong with you.

           Michele’s mind races for a solution. Then something occurs to 
           her:

                                 MICHELLE
                        You think I’m making this up. That 
                        it’s all in my head.

                                 THERAPIST
                        (thrown off)
                        It’s not my role to make judgements 
                        here.

           Sawing--

           Michelle narrows her eyes -- like Lola at the campfire to Don 
           -- pathetic.

           SAWING--

           The Therapist frowns. He’s never seen that expression from 
           Michelle before--
           SAWING--

                                                    CUT TO:

           INT. SUBWAY CAR - AFTERNOON

           The SAWING now rapid, overwhelmingly loud-- 

           Michelle GASPS for air, opens her eyes. She’s PANTING. 
           Terrified.

           Michelle looks at the other PASSENGERS, wild-eyed. They seem 
           pretty disturbed as well, for what it’s worth.

           The subway car pulls into a station. Doors open. Michelle 
           stumbles out of the car and onto the platform.

           INT. 14TH STREET SUBWAY STATION TUNNEL - NEXT

           Michelle jogs through the pedestrian tunnel. In a mild panic. 

           She stares at the PEOPLE she passes by.

           Glimpses of MOTHERS and CHILDREN. PEOPLE, people, people. 
           Homeless. Buskers. Students. SAWING. PEOPLE.

           Michelle, overwhelmed. She has to get away from them.

           INT. THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE MICHELLE’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           Michelle stumbles down the hallway. Relief. She’s made it.

           Her walk to the apartment door is low and stumbling, stiff. 
           Like an evolutionary regression.

           Michelle BANGS and slams her keys at her apartment door. She 
           can’t seem to figure out how to work the key.

           INT. MICHELLE’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Michelle stumbles in. Finally. She SLAMS the door shut behind 
           her. Twitches.

           SAWING SAWING SAWING--

           Michelle begins to SCREAM. 

           A tragic terror creeps up and overwhelms her. Now she fights 
           something. Desperate.
           A petrified possession -- this goes places we did not expect. 
           Her overwhelming fear gives way to laughter. Michelle gasps a 
           bit, giggles.

           Her laugh rumbles into GUFFAW. Hysterical cackling. Her eyes 
           watering.

           Michelle finally gets all the laughter out. She lays back 
           onto the carpet floor. A few remaining giggles escape. She 
           SIGHS. Wipes her eyes, and stares at the ceiling--

           Exhausted, finally surrendered. Michelle relaxes her head, 
           her gaze shifts to:

           INT. THE LAKE HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Our view low, distorted -- Michelle’s delirious POV from her 
           living room floor. 

           The basement door swings OPEN. 

           Michelle, her normal self, stands in the doorway. Her breath 
           cold and visible.

           She enters the darkened basement.

           She finds a lantern. Flicks it on. A warm, dim glow.

           Michelle sits down on a mound of dirt -- where the boat once 
           was -- she looks down at something we cannot see, but we can 
           hear -- Grating, labored BREATHING. SHUDDERING.

                                 MICHELLE
                        I want to tell you my story. I 
                        think I owe you that much.

           A hand -- Lola’s hand -- reaches up into the frame. The skin 
           has the gruesome look of flesh that’s been set on fire and 
           then left to rot.

           A sweet, sickly GROAN from Lola--

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        It was in college. At one of those 
                        parties, you know, that we went to 
                        mostly as freshman because we 
                        thought it was cool and we didn’t 
                        know any better. They were always 
                        in somebody’s dorm and had lots of 
                        booze and people wouldn’t do 
                        anything, really, except stupid 
                        shit... 
                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        You never used to really go to 
                        those parties, maybe you already 
                        knew better.

           Michelle lets out a bitter laugh. Sniffles. Resumes:

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        It was another one of those parties 
                        and there was this guy who I 
                        thought I knew really well. He was 
                        supposed to be my friend and then 
                        he pushed me down on one of those 
                        creaky wood beds that only had a 
                        plastic mat on it and he raped me. 
                        I thought it didn’t matter that 
                        much you know, because I had been 
                        with boys before but-- No one ever 
                        tells you. How was I supposed to 
                        see that coming? And I bled so 
                        much. He just apologized for making 
                        me bleed like that was all. I was 
                        so drunk...

           Lola’s hand reaches up again. Takes Michelle’s. 

                                 LOLA
                        Ah--

           Michelle holds this hand. She smiles, loving.

                                 MICHELLE
                        My mom never looked at me the same 
                        after that happened. Nobody did. 
                        Like their perfect little girl 
                        didn’t exist anymore. And I was 
                        just some imposter... 
                        (gathers herself)
                        My whole family was so afraid to 
                        upset me they never said anything. 
                        It’s like she knew. That anger 
                        would consume me and I’d never be 
                        through with it.

           Michelle leans in closer, reaches over -- seeming to gently 
           caress a bit of Lola’s hair that we can just make out in the 
           frame...

           It FLICKERS-- Wide: the full, gruesome horror of Lola’s image 
           now visible. She sits beside Michelle, leans close to her as 
           if to tell her a secret--

           The remnants of bodies, shoved behind the dirt pile, visible 
           in the background--
           Close on Lola’s disgusting lips, they graze Michelle’s 
           healthy ear:

                                 LOLA
                        (whispering)
                        I have a present for you.

           INT. LAKE HOUSE - NEXT

           Looking out the front windows, we watch Michelle approach the 
           front door with determination in her steps. 

                                 LOLA (V.O.)
                        My mother had an illness, they 
                        always called it ‘the swells.’

           We seem to be inexplicably sucked backwards, though this time 
           we know where we’re going. 

           Our view REVERSED: A force pushes us toward Lola’s bedroom...

                                 LOLA (V.O.)
                        She’d bubble over, and we’d have to 
                        hide away...

           We catch a glimpse of Michelle heading into Lola’s room, she 
           re-appears with something -- a notebook, Lola’s DAY PLANNER -- 
           in her hands...

                                                    CUT TO:

           EXT. THE LAKE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Michelle’s Tesla ROARS to life. 

           Headlights ON. The beams cut a slice through the trees. 
           Obscuring the house in its darkness--

                                 LOLA (V.O.)
                        Now that I’m older, I wonder if 
                        that wasn’t the real her that 
                        finally managed to get out, all 
                        along.

           The car backs out of the driveway. It’s pitch black.

           INT. MICHELLE’S TESLA - THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

           Michelle, disheveled, behind the wheel. Dirt on her hands and 
           all over her clothes from crawling around the basement.
           She sniffles, rubs snot away from her face.

           Michelle hits the turn signal, maneuvers the tesla towards 
           New York City.

           She smiles, intent.

           INT. MICHELLE’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           The satisfying CLICK of a stereo amp being powered to life.

           Michelle - once again wearing a BRIGHT RED LIP - turns up the 
           volume on an aggressive METAL TRACK that sounds something 
           like a volcano vomiting all the demon hell-bats up at once. 

           Michelle turns it up even MORE. A deafening volume -- the 
           track distorted and throbbing. She begins to dance, wildly.

           The volume of the track causes objects around the home to 
           shake and pulse. Glass case doors RATTLE. A bomb could go off 
           and nobody would hear.

           Michelle dances around the room. Contorts and throws herself 
           around. Trying to work all the stiffness out of her body.

           The more furiously she dances, the more it seems to work.

           INT. KITCHEN - NEXT

           Michelle PANTING-- She stuffs spoonfuls of ice cream into her 
           mouth. Ravenously hungry. Liberated.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Mmm. Mmm.

           Michelle loses the spoon. Bites into the chunk of ice cream, 
           straight from the pint.

           EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - MORNING

           Michelle glides along the sidewalk, triumphant. Bags full of 
           different containers of ice cream.

           She hisses at a group of CHILDREN walking to school. Leers at 
           a PANHANDLER.

           A WOMAN cowers and shuffles her KIDS across the street. Two 
           GUYS who would normally intimidate someone else, part and 
           make way for Michelle - whose glare has intensified to the 
           point of threatening to set a newsstand on fire.
           EXT. CHINATOWN FISH MARKET - LATE MORNING

           A storefront lined with algae-crusted aquariums filled to the 
           brim with sea creatures. Chinese characters on the window.

           Michelle peers at the tanks.

           She bends down. Makes eye contact with a GIANT, spindly-
           legged CRAB -- the creature stares back at Michelle as if 
           stunned while fighting for space in the crowded tank.

           Michelle taps the glass.

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

           Michelle approaches the reservoir. A new plastic bag of 
           large, spidery crabs accompanies the ice cream.

           She scans the tree-lined water -- Manhattan’s skyscrapers 
           loom overhead. TOURISTS fumble with oars in tiny rowboats 
           populating the greenish-brown water. 

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK RESERVOIR - NEXT

           Michelle in a rowboat -- she pushes off from the vendor 
           platform. Her grip on the oars is confident. 

           Michelle paddles, vigorous. She drives toward the center of 
           the reservoir.

           Michelle PROPELS onward, in a race against herself.

           As she passes by, PEOPLE pause their leisurely rowing and 
           stare.

           She rows faster, and faster, with increasing effort. GRUNTS 
           as her oars SLICE and DRIVE through the water.

           The sound of her ROWING reaches a near cacophony as Michelle 
           loses herself in a focused, adrenaline-rush state. Her eyes 
           closed. She breathes in-- Out-- Controlled.

           Michelle breathes in-- Out-- In-- She imagines herself on the 
           lake. She smiles. Out--

           EXT. THE LAKE - DAY

           Michelle breathes in-- Her oars dip into the lake’s calm, 
           glassy water.
           Everything is quiet, save for the lapping of the lake, the 
           BUZZING of summer insects. The sounds of Manhattan 
           nonexistent to us.

           Michelle rows. Relishes the fresh, clean air. Pure bliss.

           Michelle keeps rowing. She sings Lola’s SONG to herself -- 
           the song that Lola sang as she rowed home alone all those 
           days ago.

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK RESERVOIR - CONTINUOUS

           Michelle rows past thick brush and trees. Her rowing in time 
           with something CRUNCHING under the PUMMELING of a heavy, 
           blunt object. Slow, rhythmic. The same beat as Michelle’s 
           SNAPPING in the bedroom. As the SAWING creeping forward.

           Michelle recognizes the rhythm. Looks up, toward the shore--

           Through the thick brush, reeds, the branches of trees, is 
           Lola -- she sits on her knees in the mud, using the entire 
           force of her upper body to STRIKE something WET and CRUNCHY 
           with a large, heavy rock.

           FFFTHWACK!!! Blood splatters. Lola HEAVES -- lifting the 
           rock. It’s caked with blood.

           She brings the rock down again -- FTHWAGGKK! 

           We can catch a glimpse of what looks like could be a body - a 
           shoulder, a tuft of hair, Don’s flannel shirt.

           Lola PANTS. Lifts again.

                                 LOLA
                        Grrrrruaaah!!!

           CRUNCH-- that sounded like the last one. Lola catches her 
           breath.

           Lola looks up, calm, makes eye contact with Michelle -- with 
           us.

           Michelle smiles. Drives the rowboat to shore.

                                                    CUT TO:
           BZZZZZZ---
           INT. A DINNER PARTY - EVENING

           Michelle opens the door to a well-designed apartment milling 
           with thirty-somethings in expensive-looking, minimalist 
           clothing. They smell like fancy shampoo and carry vague 
           accents from years of prep school, studies abroad, foreign 
           nannies, and international travels.

           Michelle hates them all. She just didn’t realize it until 
           this moment, standing in the foyer, sweaty and disheveled 
           with her bags full of slowly dying crabs and dripping, melted 
           ice cream.

           DEE (30s) screams Goop more than Gwyneth, comes over to 
           Michelle with a glass of wine ready, takes the bags from her.

                                 DEE
                        (her appearance)
                        ...Michelle..!
                        (the bags)
                        Oh, what are these..?

                     MICHELLE
                                            DEE (CONT'D)
           Crabs.
                                     Crabs?

                                 DEE (CONT’D)
                        (quickly)
                        Thank you!

           She heads to the kitchen, Michelle trailing behind her.

           INT. DEE’S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Dee pauses to display the soaking bags to LESLEY (30s) a waif 
           with a severe haircut:

                                 LESLEY
                        Ohhh, that’s what you had in mind 
                        when you said, ‘bring a dish’!

           Dee frowns at the ice cream, liquid and leaking from the 
           containers, as she pops it in the freezer. Lesley grimaces, 
           stifling a laugh.

           Chase swoops in, with red wine teeth.

                                 CHASE
                        (to Michelle)
                        Honey why don’t you go to the 
                        bathroom and clean yourself up.
           INT. DINING ROOM - NEXT

           Everyone’s getting settled at the table. 

           Michelle re-appears, red lipstick touched up but otherwise in 
           the same condition. Chase doesn’t hide his frown.

           She takes a seat on the other side of the table, opposite 
           Chase. 

           A few glances exchanged as seating is reconfigured around 
           her.

           NOAH (30s) wears a meticulously cultivated affability, enters 
           with a plate of freshly steamed crabs.

                                 NOAH
                        Great idea, Meesh.

           Michelle winks at him.

                                 DEE
                        Glad they cook up so quickly, Noah 
                        knew exactly what to do.

                                 NOAH
                        (to Dee)
                        You’d be lost without me.

                                 CHASE
                        (to Michelle)
                        You brought uncooked crab?

                                 MICHELLE
                        They were alive.

                                 CHASE
                        (to Dee & Noah)
                        I’m sorry about that. I don’t know 
                        what we were thinking.

           Michelle narrows her eyes.

           GINNY (30s) a fashion-forward battle-axe, interjects:

                                 GINNY
                        Michelle I love your outfit. What 
                        is that, norm core?

                                 CHASE
                        I think it’s called ‘wearing house 
                        pants in public.’
                                 MICHELLE
                        I woke up like this.

           THEO (30s) gay but otherwise forgettable, picks it up:

                                 THEO
                        Flawless.

           Michelle and Theo clink glasses.

           PAUL (30s) Chase’s best friend and so handsome it says 
           trouble, says something to Chase, inaudible to the group.

                                 PAUL
                        ...concerned about all of ‘this.’

           Michelle’s demeanor darkens, she glares at Paul and Chase 
           from across the table. Paul catches her eye. She doesn’t look 
           away. He frowns. Chase follows his gaze...

                                 DEE
                        Okay everyone, a toast! To friends, 
                        to Friday nights, to living well.

                                 ALL

                        Cheers, everyone.

           Glasses clinking. Amidst the activity, Michelle stands, 
           raises her glass. It gets awkward, quick.

                                 CHASE
                        Michelle, sit down.

                                 MICHELLE
                        If it’s not a huge intrusion I’d 
                        like to make a toast as well. 

           She doesn’t wait for feedback--

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        I’d like to make a toast to all of 
                        you beautiful people. I know I’m 
                        not one of your kind originally, 
                        but you’ve all made me feel so 
                        welcomed. Genuinely--

           Chase cuts her off, stands and clinks glasses with Michelle.

                                 CHASE
                        Cheers everyone!
           His friends comply. More “cheers” around the table.

           Michelle doesn’t take a drink. She sits, sets her glass down.

                                                    CUT TO:

           A game of loaded questions. Torn up papers in a bowl. 
           Everyone busy scribbling some sort of response.

           Everyone’s had a few more drinks, they’re nice and loosened 
           up. 

           Lesley pulls papers from the bowl.

                                 LESLEY
                        Okay. The thing I hate most about 
                        my body is, ‘weird big toes.’

                        (hands Paul the paper)
                        For you, Paul.

                        toes.

                                 LESLEY
                        Okay next one: ‘my thighs.’

                        That’s it? That could be any of 
                        you...four.

                                 LESLEY
                        Okay. Setting aside...

           Picks a new one, opens it, reads:

                        Didn’t realize I have cellulite on

                        ‘Who in the group would you call to

                        Chase of course.

                                 MICHELLE

                                 MICHELLE
                        I’d pick myself.

                                 LESLEY
                        The power couple.

                                 THEO
                        The rest of us are all so murder-

                        ‘Michelle unfortunately’ ...give 
                        that to Theo. ‘Ginny’ ...give that 
                        to Dee. ‘Lesley, why not?’ 
                        Michelle. ‘Chase,’ hmmm... Ginny. 
                        ‘Chase, he probably deserves it the 
                        most.’ Let’s say Lesley, I’m sure 
                        she’d know.
           Glances exchanged around the table, a few eyebrows raise.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        ‘Michelle, period.’ Uhh... Gonna 
                        give that one to Chase I think.

           Paul’s droning, the rest of the group, their banter, starts 
           to fade away.

           We push closer and closer in on Michelle. She holds a 
           singular, fixed gaze that bores a hole across the table from 
           her:

           Chase. A spotlight shines upon him as he LAUGHS, in slow 
           motion, wine-teeth bared, Lesley’s hand upon his leg.

           Michelle smiles. The SAWING seems to be fully within her now, 
           it’s in the way she breathes, her heartbeat. It might just be 
           the tapered candles, but there’s a fire reflected in her 
           eyes.

           INT. MICHELLE’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Michelle twirls in, all smiles.

           INT. BATHROOM - NEXT

           Michelle opens her red lipstick, twists the stick all the way 
           out of the tube. 

           She crushes it in her hands. Kneading it into a creamy mess.

           Michelle smears the red across her cheeks, her forehead, her 
           chin. Like an ancient warrior’s battle paint.

           Excited now -- she fumbles with her top, removes it. Smears 
           the bright, bloody color across her chest.

           Michelle makes a scary face in the mirror, hissing:

                                 MICHELLE
                        Rah!

           She claps her hands, giddy.

           INT. HALLWAY - NEXT

           Michelle slinks from one room to the next, her hands sliding 
           over the wall, leaving grubby red smudges in her wake.
           She passes the landscape painting, pulling her dirty hands 
           across it. The painting swings, falls. 

           Michelle looks down -- oops. The bright, full moon reflected 
           on the surface of the lake catches her eye...

                                                    CUT TO:

           INT. CLOSET - NEXT

           Michelle flings open a storage closet -- clearly full of the 
           relics of ‘old Michelle.’

           She digs through a container of drawers. Aha -- paint, 
           brushes, success.

           INT. MICHELLE’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The room pitch black except for the Manhattan lights outside. 
           We can’t make out Michelle but we can hear her RASPY 
           breathing. It gains momentum. It sounds just like the SAWING 
           we heard at the dinner table.

           A key UNLOCKS the front door. It OPENS. Chase turns on the 
           LIGHT -- Holy shit.

           A GIANT, SWIRLING BLACK HOLE painted across the living room 
           wall. A shining, full moon at its center.

                                 CHASE
                        What the fuck!

           Below it, Michelle lays on the floor. Sweaty. A delirious 
           look. Red warrior lipstick on her chest, her face. She rolls 
           her eyes over to Chase. Starts to laugh.

                                 MICHELLE
                        There’s a scoundrel. “I’m sure 
                        she’d know.”

                                 CHASE
                        Where the-- What. Where the fuck 
                        have you been? You just leave in 
                        the middle of a dinner party? I--

           Michelle’s face falls. A look of sorrow in her eyes.

                                 MICHELLE
                        (whispering)
                        Baby... I’m so sorry...
                                 CHASE
                        What the fuck did you do to our 
                        apartment, Michelle? What is this?!

           Michelle begins to sob. She covers her face, determined to 
           put on a real show.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Baby, baby, baby...

                                 CHASE
                        What’s wrong with you?

           Michelle gets up, goes over to Chase. Pulls him into an 
           embrace. 

           She sobs, her face buried in his shoulder. He grimaces at the 
           thought of how badly she’s ruining his clothes...

                                 MICHELLE
                        I’m not okay. I’m not okay.

                                 CHASE
                        It’s fine. You’re okay.

           Chase holds Michelle by the shoulders. Tough but loving.

                                 CHASE (CONT’D)
                        Hey. You’re gonna be fine. 

           Michelle shakes her head, ‘no.’

                                 MICHELLE
                        You don’t understand--

                                 CHASE
                        I understand. You had too much to 
                        drink, am I right? And you’ve been 
                        on a real bender these last few 
                        days. Haven’t you.

           Michelle’s lip quivers. He wipes tears off her face. Puts her 
           hair back in place.

                                 CHASE (CONT’D)
                        It’s fucking with your emotions and 
                        making you feel like it’s the end 
                        of the world. I promise it’s not, 
                        okay?

                                 MICHELLE
                        (whispering)
                        Okay. Okay...
                                 CHASE
                        Now please, get yourself washed up. 
                        I’ll figure out what to do about...
                        (gestures at the carnage 
                        of his living room)
                        This.

           INT. KITCHEN - NEXT

           Michelle’s dirty hand pulls a butcher knife from the kitchen 
           block.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

           Chase sighs, paces. He looks kinda like his world is falling 
           apart. He sits, thinking pose.

           He pulls out his phone -- Michelle Mom -- calls.

           He waits. The line doesn’t pick up. He hangs up.

           INT. HALLWAY - NEXT

           Michelle walks toward the living room. A creepy, tiptoe sort 
           of walk, her head bent at an unnatural angle. Butcher knife 
           at her side.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NEXT

           Chase gets up, antsy. He spots Michelle in the hallway. 

           She pauses, peers at him like an animal in the wild. The 
           butcher knife concealed at her side.

                                 CHASE
                        (at a loss)
                        ...I love you.

                                 MICHELLE
                        I love you, too.

           Chase EXHALES, like he’s got a lot more to say.

           He turns, goes over to the stereo. Clicks it on-- DEAFENING 
           HEAVY METAL BLASTS into his face, scaring the shit out of 
           him.

                                 CHASE
                        Ah!
           Chase turns to recover -- it’s Michelle. She STABS the 
           butcher knife into his chest.

                                 CHASE (CONT’D)
                        Gaaahh--

                                 MICHELLE
                        (mocking)
                        AwwwWWW! Poor baby!

           Michelle stabs him. Again and again and again. The whole time 
           she’s singing that song:

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        (shouting)
                        Now I feel the hope! The faith to 
                        go another day..!

           Chase barely has a chance to react. The music muffles any 
           chance of hearing what could be a GURGLE here, a WHIMPER 
           there--

           It’s over. Michelle stares at Chase’s corpse. She licks the 
           gore from the blunt edge of her butcher knife -- yum.

           Then-- she bends over, propelled by instinct. Stabs into 
           Chase’s chest, begins prying at the ribs. Pulling them open -- 
           blood flowing everywhere, it’s impossible to see--

           Michelle THRUSTS the blade in again. CRRAAAACK -- bingo.

           She reaches in, pulls out her prize:

           It’s Chase’s HEART. Mangled and nearly sliced in two.

           She stares at it, dissatisfied. She lets the heart fall -- 
           plop -- this isn’t the release she was hoping for.

           Fingers oozing with blood, Michelle CLICKS the stereo off. 
           Only the sound of RINGING ears.

           BRRRRING-- BRRRRING-- Chase is ringing.

           Michelle drops the knife. CLANG. She fishes Chase’s cellphone 
           out of his -- pocket? Hard to tell.

           An incoming call from Michelle Mom. She hits Accept -- brings 
           the phone to her ear.

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        Mommy..!

                                                    CUT TO:
           EXT. THE CRAPPY PART OF A SEASIDE TOWN - MORNING

           Seagulls and gray sky. The ocean a roaring but distant 
           feature.

           Michelle walks along the deserted boardwalk, calm. She wears 
           a new shade of even BRIGHTER RED lipstick -- it’s nearly 
           electric. Her hair is frizzy. She looks totally content.

           Michelle HUMS a sweet, simple tune. The same one we heard 
           Lola humming before. The same one she sang while she ended 
           Chase--

           KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK--

           EXT. MICHELLE’S MOTHER’S HOUSE - NEXT

           The door opens. Michelle smiles expectantly.

           A WOMAN (late 50s) pulls Michelle into an embrace -- she’s 
           very obviously MICHELLE’S MOTHER in looks, demeanor, 
           mannerisms...

                                 MICHELLE’S MOTHER
                        Oh, my girl!

                                 MICHELLE
                        (faking affection)
                        Hi, mommy.

           Michelle’s Mother can’t seem to help it -- she pulls away 
           from the embrace, gives her daughter a quick once-over, tries 
           to smooth Michelle’s hair.

           Michelle smiles in a way that makes her Mother stop, suddenly 
           self-conscious.

                                 MICHELLE’S MOTHER
                        Sorry... Let’s have some tea.

           Michelle’s Mother pulls her inside.

           INT. MICHELLE’S MOTHER’S HOUSE - NEXT

           Michelle stands at the window. She looks out at the view--

           Partially obstructed, but still, from here you can see the 
           water.

           A wave SWELLS up, rises, shatters back into itself. We can 
           almost hear the break -- it gains volume... 
           It’s the SAWING.

           Michelle’s eyes flash in recognition. Her cheeks burn red.

                                 MICHELLE
                        (calling out)
                        Mommy-- 
                        Can I ask you something?

           Michelle looks at us. An evil, demented smile.

           In her eyes we can see the ocean -- the waves SWELL and 
           CRASH, chaotic.

                                                    CUT TO:

           BLACK.
