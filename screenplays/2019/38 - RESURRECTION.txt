           INT. BIOMATIX OFFICE / LABORATORY - DAY

           GWYN (22, intern) sits at a desk in a large, open plan office 
           adjacent a biotech lab. She speaks to someone O.S.

                                 GWYN
                        I like him a lot. I mean, he’s 
                        really smart and funny. Good-
                        looking. He’s got a lot of, like, 
                        amazing qualities. It’s just..

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Just what?

                                 GWYN
                        Well, he’s always making these jokes 
                        that’re, I don’t know, just sort of 
                        like cutting, y’know? They’re 
                        like... like he’s making fun of me.

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        He makes jokes at your expense. 

                                 GWYN
                        He’s just trying to be funny. 
                        That’s his sense of humor. But 
                        it... I’m, like, I’m not sure if 
                        I’m supposed to joke back, or...

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        You don’t find them funny.

                                 GWYN
                        I mean, sometimes. He’s really 
                        funny. But mostly the jokes sort of 
                        make me feel... on the spot.

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Have you asked him to stop?

                                 GWYN
                        Yeah. Sort of. 

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        And what did he say?

                                 GWYN
                        He says I’m, like, oversensitive. 
                        That they’re just jokes. But, I don’t 
                        know, he says I’m thin-skinned.

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Tell him to stop. Why would he 
                        continue if he knows they hurt you?
                                 GWYN
                        I mean, nobody else seems to mind.

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        If he cared about you, he’d stop. 
                        Why don’t you tell him to stop?

                                 GWYN
                             (slightly exasperated)
                        ‘Cause he’ll just say it’s my 
                        problem and I should get over it.

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Tell him to fuck off. Okay? This 
                        guy’s a sadist; he likes to cut 
                        people down. You can tell him that.

                                 GWYN
                        He’d say I just don’t get the joke.

           ANGLE ON: MARGARET (40s, attractive, athletic) sits on Gwyn’s 
           desk, wearing a lab coat and a compassionate expression. She’s 
           a bit of a surrogate mother to Gwyn. Or is trying to be.

                                 MARGARET
                        Well, the sadist never understands 
                        why others aren’t enjoying his 
                        sadism as much as he is. 

           Gwyn doesn’t quite understand this. Margaret gives her a 
           little hug. It makes Gwyn uncomfortable, but she acquiesces. 

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Find someone who makes you feel 
                        good. Will you do that? 

                                 GWYN
                        Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

           Margaret gazes on her magnanimously. She looks concerned.

                                 GWYN (CONT’D)
                        Just, like, promise you won’t tell 
                        anybody about this, okay?

                                 MARGARET
                        Of course. Fort Knox.

                                 GWYN
                        Thanks.
           INT. MARGARET’S OFFICE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           One of the few private offices in the office/lab space.

           Margaret removes her lab coat, revealing a well-chosen 
           business casual outfit. She gathers items from her desk, puts 
           them in her purse. She surveys the office: aggressively tidy.   

           She sees a small COFFEE STAIN on her desk. She licks her 
           thumb and rubs it right out.

           INT. BIOMATIX OFFICE / LABORATORY - CONTINUOUS

           The Biomatix lab/office takes up an entire floor of a 
           Manhattan building. A biopharmaceutical company. 

           Margaret walks past a row of desks. She carries herself with 
           an air of strength and focus, which seems slightly 
           exaggerated, slightly self-conscious. But only slightly. 

           Most employees have cleared out, but a handful remain. They 
           wish Margaret a good evening. She reciprocates warmly. 

           INT. ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Margaret stands, watching the numbers drop: 12, 11, 10...

           At 5, the elevator stops. The doors open. No one waits. 
           Margaret peers into the hallway: empty.

           The doors start to close, but stop and opens again. Like a 
           ghost is moving in and out. She again checks the hall: no one. 
           An overhead fluorescent flickers out. 

           EXT. MIDTOWN NYC STREET - EARLY EVENING

           Margaret walks. Summer; still bright. It’s late rush hour and 
           crowded on the street, but the DIN of the traffic and crowds 
           is soft and muted in that heavy, late summer way. 

           Margaret’s eyes are active. Taking in the landscape, the 
           details. She’s constantly on alert. 

           She stops at a light. Something pulls her attention. She looks 
           down the block: TEENAGERS make out shamelessly on a stoop. 

           The light changes. She walks.
           INT. SUBWAY - EARLY EVENING

           Margaret stands in a crowded subway. TINNY, SIBILANT EARBUD 
           SPILL fills the car. 

           Margaret locks eyes on a YOUNG MOTHER with a sleeping BABY in 
           her arms. The Young Mother’s eyes are slowly closing. 

           Margaret focuses on the baby, studying it intensely. Then she 
           bumps the mother accidentally-on-purpose, waking her.

           INT. MARGARET’S APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING

           Margaret enters. A modest, tasteful two bedroom on an upper 
           floor of a post-war building. Very clean and organized. Many 
           framed PHOTOS of a GIRL, from infancy through adolescence, line 
           the walls. Some include Margaret; others do not. 

           In the living room is a large picture window looking out onto 
           Manhattan. We’re on the 26th floor, so the view is top-notch. 

           Margaret sets down her bag, removes her shoes. She 
           reflexively begins tidying the living room. 

           ABBIE (17), enters the kitchen, which opens onto the living 
           room. Unlike her tall, put-together mother, Abbie is small, 
           disheveled. An indoor kid, wrapped in the same hoodie she 
           wears every day. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Hi, smidgen. 

                                 ABBIE
                        Hey. 

           She grabs a bowl, sets it on the kitchen island.

                                 MARGARET
                        Are you hungry? I was planning on 
                        cooking--

                                 ABBIE
                        No need. 

           Margaret enters the kitchen. Abbie fills her bowl with cereal.

                                 MARGARET
                        Cereal’s not a meal. Let me--

                                 ABBIE
                        Mom. It’s fine. I’m going over to 
                        Lucy’s in a bit.
           Abbie grabs milk from the fridge, pours it on her cereal.

                                 MARGARET
                        You need something more substantial.

                                 ABBIE
                             (for the millionth time)
                        I’ll get something with Lucy.

                                 MARGARET
                        That means pizza. Don’t get pizza; 
                        let me make you something. 

                                 ABBIE
                        I’ll be fine. See? I’m all grown up.

           Abbie grabs hold of her breasts, makes a “sexy” face. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Abbie, can you please keep your 
                        hands off yourself for five minutes 
                        while I’m talking to you?

           Abbie chuckles wickedly. She plops down in a chair by the 
           kitchen island, eats her cereal.  

                                 ABBIE
                        Want to see something?

                                 MARGARET
                             (sighs)
                        Sure.

           Abbie takes a beat before COUGHING into her hand. She then 
           presents a HUMAN TOOTH, as if she just coughed it up.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        My God, is that your tooth?!

           Abbie cackles, sets the tooth on the kitchen island. 

                                 ABBIE
                        No! It is, in fact, not my tooth. 

           It’s a man’s cuspid, crusted with tartar. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Then whose is it?

                                 ABBIE
                        Dunno. Found it in my wallet.

                                 MARGARET
                        What are you talking about?
                                 ABBIE
                        Seriously. It just, like, appeared 
                        in my wallet today.

                                 MARGARET
                        Well, where the hell did it come from? 

                                 ABBIE
                             (makes ‘I dunno’ sound)
                        Reverse tooth fairy, I guess.  

           Margaret’s rattled. She takes a stool.

                                 MARGARET
                        Oh, God. Smidgen, promise me you’ll 
                        be careful, out there. Promise. 

                                 ABBIE
                        Gonna be reckless, mom. Some frat boy 
                        hands me a pill, I’m just going to 
                        take it, no questions asked.

           Abbie stands, and takes her bowl to her room.

                                 MARGARET
                        That’s not funny!

           Margaret sits, anxiously. She picks the tooth up off the 
           counter top, examines it. Her hand starts to SHAKE subtly. 

           Swiftly, she throws it in the trash.

           EXT. FDR PEDESTRIAN WALKWAY - EVENING

           The sun is starting to set. Margaret, in serious exercise 
           clothes, stretches on the walkway running along the East 
           River. She’s in excellent shape. 

           She scrolls through her iPhone and selects a song: “ROAR” by 
           KATY PERRY. Margaret inserts the phone into a strap around 
           her bicep. She starts running along the East River. 

           Margaret is a very experienced runner – excellent form, 
           tremendous focus, like a Marine. Her steely expression 
           contrasts with the BRILLIANT POP ANTHEM pumping in her ears. 

           Margaret pushes tremendously hard, exhausting herself, testing 
           the limits of her endurance. It’s intense, but also life-
           affirming, like a Nike ad. 

           Margaret stops to PUKE in a trash can. When finished, she 
           continues running. 
           INT. BATHROOM / SHOWER - NIGHT

           Margaret showers, vigorously. She’s a vigorous person.

           INT. MARGARET’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Margaret sits on the sofa in the living room, wearing a 
           bathrobe. Her hair’s wet. She drinks a bottle of beer.

           She picks up her phone, dials. Someone answers.

                                 MARGARET
                        Abbie’s out for the night. 

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Margaret has sex on her bed with PETER (late 40s, appealing). 
           Margaret is on top. They’re serenaded by the BUZZ of 
           Margaret’s VIBRATOR, which she applies to herself. The sex is 
           nothing fancy, but clearly it’s good. Margaret CLIMAXES.

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Margaret and Peter lie naked in a lazy spoon. 

                                 MARGARET
                        How’s the wife?

                                 PETER
                        Fair. I’m going to go with “fair”. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Could be worse.

                                 PETER
                        That’s our motto. It’s inscribed on 
                        our wedding bands. 

           Margaret smiles. Peter massages Margaret’s neck and 
           shoulders. She closes her eyes, enjoys it.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        She’s taking the kids to her folks’ 
                        place, weekend after next. I’ll 
                        have three whole days free.

                                 MARGARET
                        ...interesting.

           Peter was hoping for more enthusiasm, but he doesn’t press. 
           He continues rubbing.
                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Do you like Katy Perry?

                                 PETER
                        Hm?

                                 MARGARET
                        Katy Perry. The singer.

                                 PETER
                        Uh... I mean, I know who she is, 
                        but I don’t think I’d be able to 
                        identify any of her music.

                                 MARGARET
                        It’s just like bubblegum pop crap 
                        for teenagers. Abbie used to listen 
                        to her constantly in middle school. 
                        Although she’d never admit that now.

                                 PETER
                             (not seeing)
                        I see.

                                 MARGARET
                        But there’s this one song that I 
                        just can’t stop listening to. It’s 
                        called ‘Roar’ and I listen to it 
                        over and over.

                                 PETER
                        Okay.

                                 MARGARET
                        It’s not new or anything. I just sort 
                        of re-discovered it. It was a big 
                        hit, I think, and it’s just this 
                        cheesy anthem all about, y’know, 
                        overcoming adversity, believing in 
                        yourself, not giving up, blah blah. 

                                 PETER
                        Sounds like a winner.

                                 MARGARET
                        But, despite how insipid this song 
                        is, I fucking love it. It doesn’t 
                        say anything, but yet it’s... 
                        amazingly uplifting. 

                                 PETER
                        Hm. I... have nothing to add to that.
                                 MARGARET
                        Right. It doesn’t really have 
                        anything to do with anything.

           Beat. She turns to him.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        What’s your energy level? TV or 
                        further sex?

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Margaret lies in bed, alone. She opens her eyes. 

           INT. BATHROOM - MORNING

           Margaret showers with characteristic vigor.

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Margaret dresses meticulously for work. It has a controlled, 
           ritualistic feel, like almost everything Margaret does.

           INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

           Margaret packs a bag lunch for herself, also meticulously.

           INT. HALLWAY / ABBIE’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Margaret opens Abbie’s bedroom door, peeks in. It’s an ungodly 
           mess. Piles of clothes, books, computer equipment everywhere. 
           Abbie is clearly a nerd and serious gamer.

           Margaret enters and climbs onto the sleeping Abbie. Abbie 
           GROANS, wriggles her away. Margaret relents.

                                 MARGARET
                        Morning, smidgen. 

                                 ABBIE
                        Mm.

                                 MARGARET
                        If you get up, I’ll make you 
                        breakfast.

                                 ABBIE
                        Hell, no. 
           Margaret tries a stealth maneuver to embrace Abbie, who GROANS 
           LOUDER, shakes her off again. Margaret gives up.

           INT. BIOMATIX OFFICE/LABORATORY - MORNING

           Margaret walks down a corridor, past a row of offices. The 
           space is buzzing with people. Many say hello as she passes 
           by. She reciprocates warmly.

           Peter, seated at his desk, gives her a nod. Margaret mouths 
           “good morning” to him. 

           INT. BIOMATIX CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Margaret speaks before about a dozen researchers, techs, lab 
           assistants, interns (including Gwyn), presenting research 
           results. TESS (50s), Margaret’s boss, watches approvingly. 

           Margaret utilizes PowerPoint, speaks confidently and fluently. 
           She’s impressive. Her subordinates regard her with respect. 

                                 MARGARET
                        ...binding by appropriate sigma-1 or 
                        sigma-2 ligands can induce selective 
                        apoptosis. In addition, through cell 
                        membrane reorganization, 1037 may 
                        play a significant role in 
                        inhibiting metastasis and tumor cell 
                        proliferation. In short, it’s 
                        potentially... pretty fucking great.

           The audience LAUGHS. Margaret motions to Gwyn and two others.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Interns – you guys didn’t hear that.

           More laughs. Margaret smiles, moves on to the next slide.

           INT. SUBWAY - EARLY EVENING

           Margaret rides the subway. 

           INT. MARGARET’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           Margaret enters, tosses her bag down on a chair.

                                 MARGARET
                        I’m home!

           She removes her shoes, tidies whatever mess Abbie left behind.
                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        I thought we’d order in. Unless you 
                        feel like cooking, that is. Ha ha. 
                             (beat)
                        Abbie?

           Margaret walks to Abbie’s room, knocks on the door, listens. 

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Smidgen?

           She peeks in Abbie’s room. Inside, a big mess, but no Abbie. 

           Margaret tenses. She walks back into the living room, pulls 
           her phone from her bag, and fires off a text to Abbie.

           Nervous, she scans the apartment, unsure of what to do. 

           She sends another text. 

           Margaret looks up from her phone and out the big picture 
           window. Something catches her eye. She moves toward the window. 

           A LIGHT flashes in a tall building not far from Margaret’s. 
           BRIGHT PULSES OF LIGHT in rapid, irregular intervals burst 
           from a single window, like someone is taking photographs with 
           a very powerful flash. It looks a little like Morse Code. 

           Margaret is drawn in, hypnotized by the flashing. She’s 
           STARTLED when her phone VIBRATES in her hand. A text from 
           Abbie: “@ Lucy’s. Sleeping over.”

           Relieved, Margaret returns her attention to the flashing 
           window, but it no longer flashes. 

           EXT. EAST RIVER - EVENING

           ‘Roar’. Margaret runs in her brutal way along the river. 

           INT. MARGARET’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Margaret sits on the sofa, wearing a bathrobe. Her hair’s 
           wet. She drinks a bottle of beer and watches TV.

           Her phone VIBRATES. She answers. A beat.

                                 MARGARET
                        Oh, really? Not until tomorrow? 
           INT. HALLWAY / PETER’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           A door opens, revealing Peter. Margaret stands in the hallway 
           outside his apartment. He gives her a smile. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Evening.

           Margaret enters, begins removing her clothes. 

           INT. PETER (AND HIS WIFE’S) BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Margaret lies post-coitally in bed with Peter. 

                                 PETER
                        They’ve got these sort of rustic, 
                        individual bungalow things, right 
                        in the woods. I’ll send you a link.

                                 MARGARET
                        Connecticut...

                                 PETER
                        Yeah. It’s quaint. Crazy quaint.

           Margaret shifts, reaches down to the floor. 

                                 MARGARET
                        I’m listening. 

           Margaret pulls her phone out of her bag, checks it.

                                 PETER
                        I figure we can take the train 
                        Friday night and be there--

           Margaret GASPS.

           INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT

           Margaret bursts in, marches to the ATTENDANT at the desk.  

                                 MARGARET
                             (breathless)
                        My daughter. 

           INT. ER TREATMENT ROOM - NIGHT

           The Attendant leads Margaret through the treatment room at 
           speed. He pulls a curtain to reveal Abbie, lying on an 
           operating table. A DOCTOR and a NURSE hover over her. 
           Margaret GASPS at the sight of the Doctor finishing up a LONG 
           ROW OF FRESH STAPLES along Abbie’s thigh. 

                                 ABBIE
                        Hi.

           Margaret puts her hand on Abbie’s head, brings her face close 
           to hers. Abbie’s eyes are puffy. She’s shaken, embarrassed. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Oh, Smidgen. 

           Margaret smooths her hair. Abbie is conflicted, but allows it.

                                 ABBIE
                        It’s no big deal.

                                 MARGARET
                        How’d this happen?

                                 ABBIE
                        Riding bikes with Lucy. 

                                 MARGARET
                        You don’t know how to ride a bike, 
                        honey.

                                 ABBIE
                        You never let me.

                                 MARGARET
                        It’s dangerous in the city.

                                 ABBIE
                        Evidently. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Had you... been drinking?

                                 ABBIE
                        ...only a little.

           Margaret closes her eyes, exhales.

                                 DOCTOR
                        All done.

           Margaret looks over to the grisly, jagged line of staples.

           I/E TAXI - NIGHT

           A rainy night. Margaret and Abbie ride in a taxi. Abbie 
           huddles near the window. 
           Margaret, stricken, takes hold of Abbie’s hand. Abbie allows 
           it, but doesn’t look at Margaret, doesn’t acknowledge it.

           INT. ABBIE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Margaret tries to tuck Abbie into bed.

                                 ABBIE
                        Stop tucking me in, please.

                                 MARGARET
                        There’s nothing to be scared of, hon.

                                 ABBIE
                        I’m not scared.

           Margaret ceases tucking, but hovers.

                                 MARGARET
                        Right. It’s just, well, 
                        everything’s all right.

                                 ABBIE
                        I know.

           Margaret relents, sits in Abbie’s desk chair. 

                                 MARGARET
                        I’m so sorry it took me so long. To 
                        get your text. I was doing work and 
                        my phone was in the other room–-

                                 ABBIE
                        I know. It’s fine. 

           Margaret shakes her head, disgusted with herself.

                                 ABBIE (CONT’D)
                        Mom...

                                 MARGARET
                        Stupid. Just, stupid...

                                 ABBIE
                        Jesus, if you’re just going to eat 
                        shit about this, can you do it in 
                        the other room? I’m kinda sleepy 
                        from bleeding all evening.

                                 MARGARET
                        Abbie! What the hell?
                                 ABBIE
                        ...sorry.

                                 MARGARET
                        Don’t curse, please.

           Margaret breathes, trying to calm herself, looks away.

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Margaret enters, takes off her clothes. In bra and underwear, 
           she looks at her strong, athletic physique in the mirror.

           She starts to shake. She sits on the bed, covers her face 
           with her hands, forcing big, slow, measured breaths.

           ANGLE ON: Margaret’s exposed back. Above her shoulder blades, 
           and scattered below her neck, are a series of CIRCULAR MARKS, 
           about a centimeter wide, of varying degrees of severity. 

           The CIGARETTE BURN SCARS rise and fall with Margaret’s breath. 

           INT. MARGARET’S OFFICE - DAY

           Gwyn sits. Margaret, at her desk, listens. Although tired and 
           rattled, she tries to radiate security and wisdom. 

                                 GWYN
                        I told him I don’t want him to make 
                        fun of me anymore. I said, y’know, 
                        regardless of what he meant – if he 
                        just meant to be funny or whatever, 
                        regardless, I wanted him to stop.

                                 MARGARET
                        Then what happened?

                                 GWYN
                        He said I was trying to change him 
                        and that, like, he shouldn’t have to 
                        change if he wasn’t doing anything 
                        wrong. You know, like why should he 
                        be the one changing instead of me. 
                        So I said, can’t you just do this 
                        for me? And then he asked, um, well, 
                        what he’d get, in return.

                                 MARGARET
                             (tenses)
                        And what did you say?
                                 GWYN
                        I said he’d, y’know, be happy 
                        knowing I was happier.

           Margaret gives Gwyn a little smile. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Was that enough?

                                 GWYN
                        No. He wanted me to do something 
                        for him. Things for him. 

                                 MARGARET
                        What kinds of things? 

           Gwyn looks away.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Were they bad?

           Gwyn’s expression suggests they were bad. 

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        And what did you say?

                                 GWYN
                             (emotional)
                        I told him... that he’s a PIECE OF 
                        SHIT. I told him he didn’t deserve 
                        me. And I left. 

                                 MARGARET
                        You said that?

                                 GWYN
                        Yeah.

           Margaret wells with relief, pride. She puts her hand on 
           Gwyn’s shoulder, forcefully.

                                 MARGARET
                        You did good. Hear me? You’re 
                        tougher than leather. 

                                 GWYN
                        Don’t tell anyone, about any of--

                                 MARGARET
                        Never. I promise. (beat) It’s going 
                        to be a happy ending for you.

                                 GWYN
                        Thanks, Margaret.
           INT. BIOMATIX LABORATORY - DAY

           Margaret, restored from her exchange with Gwyn, works alone 
           in the lab. She stops for a moment and texts Abbie: “Status?”

           Moments later, she gets a text back: “Shooting heroin”. 

           Margaret sighs, texts: “How’s the leg?”. 

           Abbie: “GNAR”

           Annoyed and comforted, Margaret resumes working.

           EXT. LARGE MIDTOWN COMMERCIAL BUILDING - DAY

           Peter stands in front of the building, in a lab coat, vaping 
           hungrily. Margaret steps outside, plants herself next to him.

                                 MARGARET
                        Hey, cowboy. 

                                 PETER
                        Hey, cow... girl, I guess. Sorry. 
                        How you feeling?

                                 MARGARET
                        Tired. 

                                 PETER
                        How’s Abbie? 

                                 MARGARET
                        Okay. Pretending to be tough. 

                                 PETER
                        Mm. (beat) By the way, it looks 
                        like I can’t do next weekend after 
                        all. Jenny’s sticking around.

                                 MARGARET
                        All right.

                                 PETER
                        I’m sorry about that. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Don’t apologize.

                                 PETER
                        I know, I just feel bad--
                                 MARGARET
                        You did nothing wrong. If you 
                        apologize, it makes me feel like 
                        you think I don’t understand the 
                        rules. I like our situation. 
                        Wouldn’t have it any other way.

                                 PETER
                        Right, right. I guess I’m just 
                        disappointed. Was looking forward it.

                                 MARGARET
                        Aw. Look who’s being sweet.

           Margaret pats Peter’s butt. He’s deflated by her patronizing 
           tone, but he hides it. 

           INT. OFFICE / LABORATORY- EARLY EVENING

           Margaret walks past a row of desks. She exchanges “good 
           nights” with a few people she passes by.

           INT. SUBWAY - EARLY EVENING

           A packed rush hour train. Margaret stands, grips a pole with 
           one hand, attempts to read The New Yorker with the other. 

           The train stops; doors open. More people pack the car. 

           A woman next to Margaret listens to HOUSE MUSIC loudly in her 
           headphones, providing an abrasive soundtrack to the immediate 
           area. Margaret, uncomfortable/annoyed, remains stoic. 

           The subway lurches forward, SCREECHING through the tunnel.

           Margaret stares at SOMEONE’S SWEATY NECK. She feels HOT BREATH 
           pass by her ear. Her hand slips down the pole, touching 
           ANOTHER PASSENGER’S HAND. Margaret FLINCHES, adjusts her grip. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Sorry.

           The train pulls into a station. The doors open. No one gets 
           out; a few people get in. Sardines.

           The train moves. Margaret exhales and holds on. 

           She looks down the the car. Through the mass of commuters, 
           she spots a MAN (late 50s/early 60s) in a suit, seated. 

           The Man is large and powerfully built, yet carries a bulging 
           BELLY. 
           His appearance suggests a dignified professional, possibly a 
           professor. But a closer look reveals that his haircut is 
           incompetent and self-inflicted, and his second-hand suit is 
           worn and ill-fitting.

           At the sight of this Man, Margaret STOPS BREATHING. 

           Her heart POUNDS in her ears.

           Her knuckles go WHITE around the subway pole. 

           Her body begins to TREMBLE; her jaw CLENCHES.

           The Man sits. Margaret LOCKS on him. He doesn’t look her way. 

           The train pulls into a station. The doors open. Margaret 
           LAUNCHES HERSELF toward the open doors, desperately worming 
           her way through layers of bodies. 

           Commuters COMPLAIN as she forces her way into the station. 

           INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS

           Margaret tumbles from the subway, choking on air, pitched 
           forward, legs shaking. The doors close behind her.

           Struggling to remain upright, she turns and sees The Man 
           through the subway window, sitting calmly. 

           The subway RUMBLES into the tunnel. A GASP escapes her 
           throat. Her knees buckle. She staggers to a trash can. 

           She grips the trash can, convulsing and sucking PANIC BREATHS 
           for a bit before noticing a handful of GAWKING COMMUTERS. 

           Suddenly self-conscious, Margaret hobbles toward the exit. 

           EXT. STREET - EARLY EVENING

           Margaret emerges onto street level. She looks like her 
           entrails are about to leap out of her mouth. 

           She propels herself uptown, fighting to breathe. 

           Margaret begins to RUN, dodging pedestrians, weaving through 
           the rush hour traffic, heart POUNDING LIKE A JACKHAMMER.

           INT. MARGARET’S APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING

           Margaret SHOVES the door open, enters. SLAMS it; LOCKS it. 
                                 MARGARET
                        Abbie!!! Abbie!!!

           She runs down the hall and throws Abbie’s bedroom door open.

           Abbie sits at her computer, headphones over her ears. She 
           looks at her mother: sweaty, blanched, wild-eyed. 

                                 ABBIE
                        What the fuck..? 

           Abbie pulls off her headphones.

                                 MARGARET
                             (breathless)
                        It’s fine. It’s fine. Are you okay?

                                 ABBIE
                        Yeah. Are you okay?

                                 MARGARET
                        I’m... yes... Everything’s okay. I 
                        just thought... something 
                        might’ve... I’m sorry, honey. 

                                 ABBIE
                        What happened?

                                 MARGARET
                        Nothing. I feel a little... off. 
                        I’m going to take a shower. Just... 
                        don’t go anywhere, okay? Love you. 

           Margaret turns and slowly walks down the hall.

           INT. BATHROOM - EARLY EVENING

           Margaret showers and CRIES. Water flows over her SCARS.

           INT. KITCHEN - EARLY EVENING

           Margaret sits at the kitchen island, staring at her laptop. 
           Her hair is wet. She’s dressed in sweatpants and a t-shirt. 

           Very slowly, she types “David Moore biologist” into Google. 
           She hits search, scans the results. Nothing relevant.

           She tries “David Moore Central Michigan University”. Again, 
           nothing. She closes her eyes. 

                                 ABBIE
                        Hey.
           Margaret opens her eyes. Abbie stands there, apprehensive. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Hi. 

                                 ABBIE
                        You sure you’re alright?

                                 MARGARET
                        I, um, I threw up. Must’ve been 
                        something I ate. Feeling better now. 

                                 ABBIE
                        Do you want to, like, lie down or 
                        something?

           Abbie is clearly freaked out. 

                                 MARGARET
                        What do you want for dinner? I 
                        don’t want to cook. 

                                 ABBIE
                        I might go to--

                                 MARGARET
                        I’m going to need you to stay here.

                                 ABBIE
                        I’m not going to go biking, okay?

                                 MARGARET
                        You go out too much. 

                                 ABBIE
                        I go to Lucy’s. We play Elder 
                        Scrolls. 

                                 MARGARET
                        You get drunk and carve up your--

                                 ABBIE
                        Mom! I’m 18 years old!

                                 MARGARET
                        In three weeks. Stay home. 

           Abbie starts hobbling to her room. She stops, turns.

                                 ABBIE
                             (emotional)
                        Will you stop? Will you ever stop 
                        treating me like I’m a toddler, or, 
                        or some sort of retard.
                                 MARGARET
                        You’re not. Any of those things. 
                        You’re remarkable.

                                 ABBIE
                             (groans)
                        If I’m so remarkable, how come you 
                        never let me do anything? You 
                        wouldn’t even let me go to Pitchfork--

                                 MARGARET
                        Is that what this is about? Not 
                        going to Pitchfork?

                                 ABBIE
                        No! It’s... listen, I did what you 
                        wanted, didn’t I? I got the grades, 
                        and now I’m going to fucking Yale, 
                        like you insisted. Don't you think 
                        I’ve earned a little trust? 

           Beat. 

                                 MARGARET
                        We’ll order Thai food. We’ll stay 
                        in and eat Thai food, okay?

           INT. MARGARET’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Margaret and Abbie on the couch, in the cold glow of the TV. 
           Abbie sleeps. Remnants of a Thai meal litter the coffee table. 

           A soft KNOCK on the door. Margaret WHIPS her head around and 
           stares. Eyes fused to the door, she MUTES the television. 

           Quiet. She drops her gaze to the line of light bleeding under 
           the door. It holds steady, then falls briefly into shadow, as 
           if someone outside passed closely by. Margaret BRACES.

           She rises and moves to the door. She looks through the 
           peephole to the hallway outside: empty. 

           Margaret turns, looks to Abbie. Something catches her eye.

           Through the big picture window, she again sees the FLASHING 
           LIGHT in the window of the building across the way, pulsing 
           at the same weird, irregular intervals. 

           She stands, watching the flashes, mesmerized... 

           A SHARP EXHALE. She shakes herself from her trance and shuts 
           the drapes. Margaret stands at the covered window, sweating.
           INT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Margaret and Peter, in evening dress, sit at a romantic table, 
           sharing fond glances. The TABLE CLOTH has an unusual pattern – 
           light yellow and green flowers over faint polka dots.

           A look of concern crosses Margaret’s face.

                                 PETER
                        What is it?

                                 MARGARET
                        I... I feel...

                                 PETER
                        It’s fine, it’s fine, it’s fine...

                                 MARGARET
                        What is it..? The name... of 
                        that... thing? You know. The thing.

           Peter shushes her playfully.

           A WAITRESS arrives, carrying two plates.

                                 PETER
                        Fantastic.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Here you are.

           She sets a delicious salmon entrée down in front of Peter. 

           She sets the other plate in front of Margaret. On the plate, 
           beautifully presented, is a THOROUGHLY SEASONED AND ROASTED 
           MALE HUMAN INFANT, surrounded by delectable sides. 

                                 WAITRESS (CONT’D)
                        Bon appétit. 

           She walks off. Margaret looks at the dead baby on her plate. 
           Something’s wrong, but she can’t quite put her finger on it.

           Peter eats his salmon with relish. Noticing Margaret’s 
           reluctance, he makes a “go ahead and eat” motion.

           Margaret picks up her fork and knife. Tentatively, she sticks 
           both in the crispy baby flesh. It OPENS ITS MOUTH AND SCREAMS. 

           INT. APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

           Margaret convulses awake on the couch. Sunlight slices 
           through the crack in the drapes. Beside her – no Abbie. 
           She rises, walks swiftly down the hall. 

           Abbie’s door is ajar. Margaret peeks in. Abbie sleeps 
           peacefully under her covers. Margaret’s shoulders drop.

           EXT. STREET - MORNING

           Margaret stands outside the entrance to the subway. Commuters 
           flow in and out. She watches.

           INT. TAXI - MORNING

           Margaret sits, moving slowly through rush hour traffic. She 
           nervously scans the faces of the pedestrians on the sidewalk.

           INT. MARGARET’S OFFICE - DAY

           Margaret at her desk. She rubs her eyes, unable to work. She 
           does her BREATHING EXERCISES, trying to calm her nerves.

           She reaches for her phone and forcefully sends a text. She 
           sets it down and leans back, eyes closed.

           Margaret’s phone BUZZES. She bolts forward, scoops it up. Text 
           from Abbie: “FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STOP TEXTING ME”

           It provides a precious hit of relief. 

                                 GWYN (O.S)
                        Margaret?

                                 MARGARET
                        What?

                                 GWYN
                             (flummoxed)
                        I... just wondering if you could 
                        sign my time sheet...

                                 MARGARET
                        It’s not a good time. I’m not 
                        available every second, okay? 

                                 GWYN
                        ...okay.

           INT. ABBIE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Abbie at her computer, headphones on. She looks over and is 
           STARTLED to see Margaret spying through the cracked door.
           Abbie pulls off her headphones.

                                 ABBIE
                        Okay, now you’re just being creepy. 

           Margaret opens the door. She works to project calm, stability.

                                 MARGARET
                        It’s not creepy to want to look at 
                        your child. 

                                 ABBIE
                        No, but you’re doing it in a creepy 
                        way. 

                                 MARGARET
                        I’m sorry. 

                                 ABBIE
                        Mom, what’s going on? You’re being 
                        even more suffocating than usual.

                                 MARGARET
                        I’m just, going to miss you. 

                                 ABBIE
                        I’m gonna be 80 miles away.

                                 MARGARET
                        Who will protect you?

                                 ABBIE
                        I don’t need protection.

                                 MARGARET
                        I know. You’re very strong. But know 
                        that, if anyone so much as touches a 
                        hair on your head, I will find them. 
                        And I will hurt them.

                                 ABBIE
                        Mom, when you say things like 
                        that... I mean, that’s for you, not 
                        me. I don’t need to hear it. But you 
                        seem to need to say it an awful lot.

                                 MARGARET
                        I’m just... trying to tell you that 
                        I love you.

                                 ABBIE
                        Then just say I love you.
                                 MARGARET
                        I love you.

                                 ABBIE
                        Okay then.

           INT. MARGARET’S OFFICE - DAY

           Margaret sits, TAPPING HER FINGER ON THE DESK. It sounds like 
           a small, racing heartbeat. It seems to comfort her.

           The tapping stops. She grabs her phone, dials.

                                 MARGARET
                        What’re you doing? 

           INT. BIOMATIX BATHROOM - DAY

           A single-occupancy bathroom. Margaret and Peter, in their 
           clothes, have sex standing up (sort of). It’s awkward. 

           Peter is a bit worried, keeps looking at the door.

                                 PETER
                        Wait, I think...

                                 MARGARET
                        Keep going.

           Peter tries to keep going.

                                 PETER
                        Wait. I gotta... stop here.

           Peter withdraws. Margaret grabs his diminishing cock and 
           tries to bring it back to life.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        No, it’s just... listen, I...

                                 MARGARET
                        Keep going.

                                 PETER
                        Just – stop, okay? I’m not... into 
                        this, whole thing.

                                 MARGARET
                        Right. (sighs) It happens.
                                 PETER
                        No, it’s not, I mean, you know me. I 
                        just, since when do we fuck in the 
                        bathroom? What’s the great urgency?

                                 MARGARET
                        I felt like it.

                                 PETER
                        Well, it’s not my thing.

           Margaret pulls up her underwear.

                                 MARGARET
                        If it’s not your thing, you 
                        shouldn’t have agreed to do it.

           The opening chords of ‘Roar’ chime in...

           EXT. EAST RIVER - EVENING

           ‘Roar’ continues. Margaret jogs ferociously along the river.

           INT. BATHROOM - EVENING

           The shower SCREAMS, puking jets of hot water onto Margaret.  

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Margaret, hair wet from the shower, enters. Abbie watches TV. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Do you want to drink whiskey?

                                 ABBIE
                        What?

                                 MARGARET
                        I figure if you’re going to drink, 
                        I’d better should show you how. 

                                 ABBIE
                        Seriously?

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Margaret sits with Abbie. Two GLASSES containing whiskey 
           shots and a bottle of JAMESON rest on the coffee table. 
                                 MARGARET
                        Ready?

           Abbie nods. 

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Wait.

           Margaret makes a FIST and KISSES IT, then slowly “punches” 
           Abbie’s cheek with her fist-kiss. Abbie’s taken aback. 

                                 ABBIE
                        What the hell is that?

                                 MARGARET
                        Nothing. (beat) 3, 2, 1, go!

           They both down their shots. Abbie starts COUGHING.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Aww, c’mon. I raised you tougher 
                        than that. Again! 

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Margaret assists an unstable, drunken Abbie down the hall 
           towards Margaret’s bedroom. 

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Abbie, clothed and drunk, sleeps in Margaret’s arms. Margaret 
           holds her, looking rather guilty for what she’s done. 

           INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

           One of those stores that sells designer clothes at a discount. 
           Margaret goes through the racks. Abbie isn’t playing ball.

                                 MARGARET
                        I haven’t even picked anything yet.

                                 ABBIE
                        Doesn’t matter. I’m not gonna wear it.

                                 MARGARET
                        Smidgen, you can’t wear a 
                        sweatshirt every single day, okay?

                                 ABBIE
                        Apparently I can.
                                 MARGARET
                        If you show up at school looking like 
                        this, people will think you’re weak. 
                        That’s not what you want to project.

                                 ABBIE
                        My hoodie gives me strength. It’s 
                        the source--

           Margaret’s attention is yanked across the room. She WATCHES.

                                 ABBIE (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 MARGARET
                        Stay here.

           Margaret moves forward, weaving around a few racks. She spots 
           a figure turn and move down a far aisle. 

           She follows. She reaches the aisle, peers around the corner.

           At the far end of the aisle stands THE MAN, idly browsing 
           sports jackets. 

           Margaret darts out of sight. She stands, gripped by panic. 

           She moves towards Abbie, grabbing her firmly by the shoulder. 

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        We have to go. 

                                 ABBIE
                        What? What’re you--

                                 MARGARET
                        We have to go. Would you like that? 

           She heads toward the exit, nearly dragging Abbie behind her.

                                 ABBIE
                        Mom! Stop! What’re you--

                                 MARGARET
                        SHH! Keep you’re voice down. Come on. 

           Margaret moves ahead, pulling a frightened Abbie along.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        We’ll go get ice cream. How does 
                        ice cream sound?

           Margaret collides with the exit.
           E/I STREET / TAXI - CONTINUOUS

           Margaret and Abbie burst onto the noisy, packed NYC street. 

                                 MARGARET
                        We’re getting a cab!

           Margaret walks out into traffic, furiously trying to hail a 
           cab. There are a bunch of cabs, but none have their light on.

           A car nearly HITS Margaret. Abbie JUMPS.

                                 ABBIE
                        Mom! Be careful!

                                 MARGARET
                        TAXI!!

                                 ABBIE
                        GET OUT OF THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET!!

           Their screaming attracts the attention of pedestrians. 
           Margaret spots a WOMAN getting out of a cab up the block.

                                 MARGARET
                             (to Abbie)
                        Come on!!

           Margaret takes off towards the cab. She HAILS frantically. 
           The driver sees her. She turns back to Abbie.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        I GOT THE FUCKING CAB! COME ON!

           Rattled, Abbie jogs up to the taxi as Margaret gets in. 

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                             (to driver)
                        87th and 1st.

           The cab moves into traffic. Abbie sits, unnerved, confused. 

           Margaret looks out the window as they drive past the 
           departments store. THE MAN stands outside. 

           INT. MARGARET’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Abbie, tears streaking her cheeks, barrels through the front 
           door and down the hall to her room, Margaret on her heels.

                                 MARGARET
                        Abbie...
           Abbie SLAMS her door behind her and locks it.

                                 ABBIE (O.S.)
                        Stop being fucking crazy!!!

           Margaret stands in the hall. She closes her eyes and BREATHES. 
           She KNOCKS lightly on Abbie’s door.

                                 ABBIE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Go away!

                                 MARGARET
                        Smidgen. I’m sorry. I... can you 
                        hear me? Can you hear me?

                                 ABBIE (O.S.)
                        Yes, I can hear you!

                                 MARGARET
                        Things are... challenging for me 
                        right now. It’s a challenging time.

                                 ABBIE (O.S.)
                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about.

                                 MARGARET
                        Well, there are factors, creating 
                        stress, in me. You’re going away, 
                        and... work. It’s a transitional 
                        period. I need to think. (beat) 
                        Don’t be scared. I’m on top of it.

           Margaret stands guard. Begins her breathing exercises.

           INT. BIOMATIX CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Margaret sits with Tess, two BIOMATIX EXECUTIVES, and TWO 
           CLIENTS at a conference table. All have packets in front of 
           them labelled CENAVEX 2-73. 

                                 TESS
                        ...a clean data profile, showing 
                        anti-amnesic properties and 
                        neuroprotection in several models. 
                        I’ll kick it to Margaret to break 
                        down the trials for you.

           Tess turns to Margaret, staring out the window.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        Margaret? 
           Margaret turns to Tess. She seems far away, exhausted.

                                 MARGARET
                        What?

                                 TESS
                        The trials.

                                 MARGARET
                        Yes, of course.

           She looks to the Clients, the Executives. 

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        A... phase one single ascending dose... 

           She struggles. Tess looks concerned; the others confused.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        A phase one... (breathes) It’s all 
                        in the packet. It’s in the packet. 

                                 TESS
                        Margaret. Are you--

                                 MARGARET
                        I have to go. I have... um, I mean 
                        I’m not feeling quite--

           She arises, BANGING her knee, spilling a GLASS OF WATER. 

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. I mean, I apologize. 

           She flees the room, doesn’t look back.

           EXT. PARK - DAY

           Margaret sits in a small, well-populated park. She focuses on 
           her hands, trying to will them to stop shaking. 

           She looks up at the sun, closes her eyes, takes big drinks of 
           air. She lowers her head and opens her eyes: 

           THE MAN sits on a bench at the other end of the park, wearing 
           the same Goodwill suit, eating a sandwich, reading the NY Post. 

           Margaret freezes. The Man YAWNS.

           Slowly, she rises, as if pulled on strings. She walks to him 
           mechanically. He seems unaware of her approach. 
           She stops a few feet from him, looking at the ground, like a 
           child caught misbehaving.

                                 MARGARET
                        Go away.

           The Man reads the Post.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Please, David. Go away.

           She steps closer. She can’t seem to look directly at him. 

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        You heard me. I want you away from 
                        my daughter.

                                 MAN
                        Are you speaking to me?

                                 MARGARET
                        Of course I’m speaking to you. Why 
                        are you here? 

                                 MAN
                        ...in the park? 

                                 MARGARET
                        Stay away, from me and my kid.

                                 MAN
                        You approached me, ma’am.

                                 MARGARET
                        What do you want? 

           The Man looks at her searchingly.

                                 MAN
                        I don’t want anything. I’m eating 
                        lunch.

                                 MARGARET
                        Whatever you’re going to do, do it. 
                        What are you waiting for?

                                 MAN
                        I’m used to waiting. Spent a lot of 
                        time waiting. Anyway, I don’t know 
                        who you are.
                                 MARGARET
                             (voice down)
                        DON’T PLAY FUCKING GAMES. Why are 
                        you here? Why now?

                                 MAN
                        You’re mistaking me for someone 
                        else. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Do not play dumb with me, David!

                                 MAN
                        Who’s David? What’s your name? 

                                 MARGARET
                        You piece of shit. You goddamn 
                        motherfucking piece of--

                                 MAN
                        Ben’s with me. Right now.  

           This comment sends a CURRENT through Margaret. She begins to 
           tremble, sweat. Shallow, rapid breaths. 

                                 MAN (CONT’D)
                             (pats his belly)
                        Here.

                                 MARGARET
                        THAT’S A LIE! 

           People look at the shouting woman. 

                                 MAN
                        No need to raise your voice, ma’am. 
                        We’re going to go now.

           The Man crumples the remains of his sandwich into a paper 
           bag, collects his paper, rises.

                                 MARGARET
                        Don’t walk away from me! What do 
                        you intend to do? 

                                 MAN
                        I intend to go home, Margaret.

                                 MARGARET
                        I thought you didn’t know who I am.
                                 MAN
                        You just introduced yourself. We 
                        shook hands. You told me about 
                        Abbie. Don’t you remember? 

           The Man smiles, revealing a missing CUSPID in his upper 
           teeth. Margaret GASPS. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Stay away from my daughter!

                                 MAN
                             (to gawking pedestrians)
                        I don’t know this woman. She’s 
                        insane.

           DAVID walks away. As he exits the park, he tosses the paper 
           bag into a TRASH CAN.

           Margaret, drenched in sweat, watches him head up the block. 
           She instinctively advances a few steps, then stops. He turns 
           the corner and disappears.

           She stands, stunned. Slowly, her eyes drift downward. She sees 
           David’s bag in the trash. On it is a logo and name: BAGEL ZONE.

           INT. MARGARET’S APARTMENT - DUSK

           A LOCKSMITH installs new locks in the apartment door. Margaret 
           stands at the kitchen island, closely monitoring his progress. 

           Abbie watches from her room with a mix of confusion and dread.

           INT. MARGARET’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           WHOOSH. Margaret closes the curtains over the picture window. 

           She walks to the kitchen island. Two place settings; take-out 
           Indian. Abbie sits, looking nervous. Margaret dishes up. 

           She stops, goes to the front door, checks that it’s locked. 

           She returns to the kitchen island, resumes dishing.

                                 ABBIE
                        I think you need to see somebody.

                                 MARGARET
                        Oh?
                                 ABBIE
                        I think you’re having some kind of 
                        episode and--

                                 MARGARET
                        I’m not. Okay? I promise. You have 
                        nothing to worry about. 

           Margaret, projecting normalcy, sits, forces herself to eat.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been thinking... You know how 
                        you’ve always wanted to go to London 
                        and Scotland, that area? Well, how 
                        would you like to take that trip. 

                                 ABBIE
                        What are you talking about?

                                 MARGARET
                        It’d be a gift. Something nice, 
                        before you go.

                                 ABBIE
                        You already got me a graduation 
                        present.

                                 MARGARET
                        I know. But I feel bad, for the 
                        other day and I’d like to make it 
                        up to you. What do you think?

                                 ABBIE
                        Like, together?

                                 MARGARET
                        No. With Lucy, or... another friend. 
                        I’ll pay for everything. Two weeks.

                                 ABBIE
                        What? When?

                                 MARGARET
                        Any time. Tomorrow, even.

                                 ABBIE
                        What?

                                 MARGARET
                        No, it’d be perfect. You and Luce 
                        adventuring through Britain. I’ll 
                        pay for Lucy, too. Or whoever. When 
                        you get back, you’d still have two 
                        weeks before school.
                                 ABBIE
                             (rattled)
                        I... don’t want to. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Of course you do. You talk about it 
                        all the time.

                                 ABBIE
                        Why do you want me to go away? 

                                 MARGARET
                        I don’t. I want you to... expand your 
                        horizons. You said I never let you do 
                        anything. Well, this is something. A 
                        pretty cool offer, don’t you think?

                                 ABBIE
                        You can’t make me take a vacation. 
                        I’m not going anywhere.

                                 MARGARET
                        Smidgen, think about it. Talk to 
                        Lucy. (beat) Please.

                                 ABBIE
                        No.

           Margaret looks away. Abbie takes a bite, trying not to cry. 

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Margaret lies in bed, in the dark, staring at the ceiling. 
           The gears turn behind her eyes. 

           INT. BATHROOM - MORNING

           Margaret showers, her posture and movements (or lack thereof) 
           telegraph her fatigue. 

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Margaret dresses. She looks in the mirror – dark circles under 
           bloodshot eyes. She lifts her chin, INHALES, cowboys up. 

           EXT. POLICE STATION - MORNING

           Margaret stands outside a police station. 
                                 MARGARET (V.O.)
                        There’s a man. Following me. 

           INT. OFFICE / POLICE STATION – AFTERNOON

           Margaret sits in a messy office in the rear of the station. 
           Across a desk sits a uniformed policeman - OFFICER VERDE 
           (male, 40s). He seems tired, skeptical.

                                 OFFICER VERDE
                        All right. Do you know this man?

                                 MARGARET
                        Yes. We were... involved. Once.

                                 OFFICER VERDE
                        Married?

                                 MARGARET
                        No. 

                                 OFFICER VERDE
                        Children?

           This seems to throw Margaret a bit. Beat.

                                 MARGARET
                        No. No children.

                                 OFFICER VERDE
                        When did you split up?

                                 MARGARET
                        Twenty-five years ago.

           He gives her a look.

                                 OFFICER VERDE
                        25 years.

                                 MARGARET
                        I hadn’t seen him since I was 19. 
                        Then, a week ago, he just appeared--

                                 OFFICER VERDE
                        At your home? Your workplace?

                                 MARGARET
                        No. On the train, and in a store, 
                        and then again, in a park--

                                 OFFICER VERDE
                        Public places.
                                 MARGARET
                        Yes, but places where I happened to 
                        be. It’s not coincidental.

                                 OFFICER VERDE
                        No need to get excited. Just trying 
                        to get the facts. Now, has this man 
                        accosted you, harassed you...

                                 MARGARET
                        Not... exactly. 

                                 OFFICER VERDE
                        Has he been calling or texting--

                                 MARGARET
                        No.

                                 OFFICER VERDE
                        Has this men initiated 
                        communication at all? 

                                 MARGARET
                        No. But I know him, Officer. I know 
                        what he’s capable of. 

           Verde takes a beat, irritated by this pushy woman.

                                 OFFICER VERDE
                        Was he ever violent towards you?

                                 MARGARET
                        He... made me be violent, to myself. 

                                 OFFICER VERDE
                        To yourself.

                                 MARGARET
                        Yes.

                                 OFFICER VERDE
                        25 years ago.

                                 MARGARET
                        Yes.

                                 OFFICER VERDE
                        Did you ever report it?

           Margaret shakes her head. Verde sighs.

                                 OFFICER VERDE (CONT’D)
                        Do you have an address for this man? 
                        Phone number? 
                                 MARGARET
                        No.

                                 OFFICER VERDE
                        Okay. So I understand: your ex-
                        boyfriend, who you haven’t heard from 
                        in twenty-five years, shows up, in 
                        public, a couple of times. He doesn’t 
                        approach you, doesn’t threaten you. 
                        He hasn’t come to your home or place 
                        of employment or contacted you in any 
                        way. And you don’t know where he 
                        lives or how to get a hold of him. 

                                 MARGARET
                        I understand it doesn’t sound like 
                        much, but I know he’s following me. 
                        He’s a very dangerous man.

                                 OFFICER VERDE
                        Well, what would you like us to do?

                                 MARGARET
                        I’d like to get a protection order. 
                        I’d like him arrested.

                                 OFFICER VERDE
                        I’m sorry, ma’am, but those aren’t 
                        options, at the moment. Now, you’re 
                        free to file a complaint. And I can 
                        provide guidelines on how to deal 
                        with potential stalkers. But until 
                        you’ve got something – calls, texts, 
                        emails - to show this man is 
                        harassing you...(shrugs) 

                                 MARGARET
                        Officer, I can’t just wait around 
                        for him to, to strike--

                                 OFFICER VERDE
                        There’s just nothing we can do, at 
                        this point, okay? So just, please, 
                        be smart, be careful, and contact us 
                        if the situation escalates. We’re 
                        here to help you. 

           Margaret stares at him with impotent rage.

           INT. GUN STORE - DAY

           Margaret points a PISTOL. A SALESMAN addresses her.
                                 GUN SALESMAN
                        Very light, but packs a punch. 
                        Accurate. Good value.

           Margaret points the gun at the far wall. 

                                 GUN SALESMAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m not even supposed to let you 
                        hold that thing without a license.

                                 MARGARET
                        How do I get the license?

                                 GUN SALESMAN
                        Apply. In New York, usually takes 
                        three to six months to process the--

                                 MARGARET
                        Can’t I buy a gun online?

                                 GUN SALESMAN
                        Yeah, but any retailer’s got to ship 
                        it to a Federal license holder, and 
                        they’re going to need to see a 
                        license to release it.

                                 MARGARET
                        Shit. That’s... What’s your name? 

                                 GUN SALESMAN
                        Freddy.

                                 MARGARET
                        Freddy. Okay.

           Margaret pauses, sets the gun on the counter. Tentatively, 
           she reaches into her pocket and pulls out a ONE HUNDRED 
           DOLLAR BILL. She lays on the counter with a trembling hand.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Listen, Freddy. I don’t have time. 
                        Can you put me in touch with someone? 

           He eyes her warily.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Please. I need protection now. Not 
                        in six months. Please. 

           He slides the bill back toward her.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        I... I’m sorry, I--
                                 GUN SALESMAN
                        Here’s what you do: go to an ATM, 
                        get four more of those, come back. 
                        You do that, I give you the number 
                        of a guy upstate. Understand?

                                 MARGARET
                        I can’t... travel upstate--

                                 GUN SALESMAN
                        He’ll ship it. (beat) All right?

                                 MARGARET
                        How do I know you’re not scamming me?

                                 GUN SALESMAN
                        You don’t. 500. Get to it.

           INT. HALLWAY / ABBIE’S BEDROOM – NIGHT

           Margaret KNOCKS on Abbie’s door. Beat. She knocks harder. 

                                 ABBIE (O.S.)
                        What?

           Margaret opens the door, finds Abbie on her bed, headphones 
           on. She enters and takes a seat at the foot of her bed. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Can you take those off, please?

           Abbie removes the headphones, looks at her.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        I want you to know that 
                        everything’s fine. 

           Abbie nods almost imperceptibly.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        But I’m going to need you to do 
                        something, okay? I’m going to need 
                        you to be extra careful for the next 
                        little bit. If anyone you don’t know 
                        approaches you, tries to talk to you, 
                        go away. Immediately. Don’t engage. 

                                 ABBIE
                        Mom, did you just come in here to 
                        tell me not to talk to strangers?

                                 MARGARET
                        Take this seriously, please. 
                                 ABBIE
                        Take what seriously? When are you 
                        going to tell me what the hell is 
                        going on?

           Margaret struggles to assemble a response.

                                 MARGARET
                        Someone is behaving... erratically. 
                        And I worry. 

                                 ABBIE
                        Who?

                                 MARGARET
                        No one you know.

                                 ABBIE
                        WHO?

                                 MARGARET
                        Someone, from work. Someone... I 
                        let go. Is upset. Making trouble.

                                 ABBIE
                        What kind of trouble?

                                 MARGARET
                        He’s angry. Making noises.

                                 ABBIE
                        Then go to the cops. Or, like, HR-- 

                                 MARGARET
                        I did. I’m handling it. I just want 
                        to be extra careful. Will you do 
                        that for me? 

           Abbie examines her skeptically.

                                 ABBIE
                        What’s his name? This guy.

                                 MARGARET
                        ...David. Moore. Tall man. About 60.

                                 ABBIE
                        David Moore. Okay. I’ll steer clear 
                        of tall, old David Moore.

                                 MARGARET
                        Stay away from anyone you don’t 
                        know. Until I say all clear.
           Something’s not right. Abbie’s not buying it, but she nods.

                                 ABBIE
                        If you say so.

           EXT. BAGEL ZONE – MORNING

           Margaret approaches Bagel Zone, a tacky bagel shop/deli. She 
           looks up at the sign to confirm she’s at the right place.

           INT. BAGEL ZONE – MORNING

           Margaret enters. It’s empty of customers.

           She approaches the counter, attended to by a male EMPLOYEE 
           (17, puffy, shy) wearing a BZ cap and name tag (’LEO’).

                                 LEO
                        Morning. How can I help you?

                                 MARGARET
                        Good morning... Leo, I was hoping to, 
                        well, uh, were you working here, last 
                        Wednesday, during the day?

                                 LEO
                        ...yeah.

                                 MARGARET
                        Okay. So, I’m wondering if maybe you 
                        know a man, who comes in here. Was 
                        here Wednesday. Big, white man. About 
                        60. David, is his name. Wears a suit.

                                 LEO
                        Um... I don’t know. 

                                 MARGARET
                        You were working Wednesday?

           He glances back to the Manager, who is otherwise engaged.

                                 LEO
                        Yeah. But, I don’t know...

                                 MARGARET
                        It’s very important. Please, think 
                        back. Tall. Gray hair, gray suit. 
                        Looks rather... poor.

           A nervous shrug is all she gets. Margaret startles him with:
                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Please. Think. Can you do that for me?

           He is now clearly unnerved. No idea how to respond. 

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                             (high-pressure soothing)
                        It’s okay, Leo. I just need you to 
                        concentrate, and try to remember. 
                        Does this man come here a lot? 

           Leo is frozen, silent. He looks at Margaret like she’s about 
           to leap over the counter and sink her teeth into his windpipe.  

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        THINK, GODDAMMIT!

           He WINCES. Then, to Margaret’s alarm, begins to CRY.

           She stands, watching Leo weep, guilt welling inside her. 

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. I’m sorry for my tone. 
                        It’s just... important.

           The tears continue. He looks at the floor. Long seconds pass.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        David, is his name. I think he 
                        might come here--

           Leo FLEES into the kitchen and out of sight.

           Margaret stands alone in Bagel Zone. The Manager glares at 
           her from the kitchen, but says nothing.

           Margaret moves to the door. She’s about to exit when she 
           STOPS SHORT. She presses her face to the glass and sees--

           DAVID, in his same shitty suit, emerge from a uniquely dreary 
           six story building across the street. The weathered sign 
           above the door reads THE WORLD HOTEL. 

           Margaret, watches David, frozen, afraid, unprepared. He 
           ambles up the block. She grasps the door handle, looks at The 
           World, back at David. With sudden force, she--

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           --THRUSTS open the door and steps onto the sidewalk. She can 
           still make out David in the distance, stopped at a newsstand. 
           She stands still, watching him pay for a newspaper. 
           When the transaction is complete, he keeps walking. 

           It takes a moment to kick in, but Margaret moves. She trails 
           him falteringly, breathlessly, struggling to keep him in sight.

           David turns a corner and out of view. Margaret speeds up. She 
           reaches the corner and peers down the block. He’s gone.

           Her head spins, searching frantically, as if expecting 
           ambush, but there’s nothing but city and strangers and noise.

           She walks a few yards down the block, craning her neck, but 
           there’s no sign of David. She stops. She’s lost him.

           INT. BIOMATIX LABORATORY – DAY

           Margaret works in the laboratory, alone. Her expression is 
           blank as she looks through a very high-end MICROSCOPE. 

           Suddenly, she drops to her knees, releasing three SHORT, 
           PIERCING SCREAMS. Then: quiet, still, for a few moments. 

           She then rises and resumes her work, as if nothing happened.

           INT. BIOMATIX / MARGARET’S OFFICE - EVENING

           The office has mostly cleared out. Gwyn collects her things 
           from her work station and heads down the corridor.

           A light in Margaret’s office. Gwyn stops, peers in. Margaret 
           sits in the dark. Gwyn KNOCKS.

           Margaret turns, looks at her. She looks shaken, exhausted.

                                 GWYN
                        Hey. Dark in here.

                                 MARGARET
                        Yeah.

                                 GWYN
                             (wistful sigh)
                        Just nine more days. Went so fast.
                             (beat)
                        Um, will you be doing my 
                        recommendation, or will--

                                 MARGARET
                        Me.

                                 GWYN
                        Cool. (beat) Okay, well, good night.
           She turns to leave. Margaret stops her.

                                 MARGARET
                        Gwyn.

                                 GWYN
                        Yeah?

                                 MARGARET
                        Do you think you could kill someone? 

                                 GWYN
                        What?

                                 MARGARET
                        If you had to. Them or you.

                                 GWYN
                             (uncomfortable chuckle)
                        Um... probably not. (beat) Why?

           Margaret shakes the question off, looks away.

                                 GWYN (CONT’D)
                        Are you okay?

                                 MARGARET
                        No.

                                 GWYN
                        Do you want to talk about it? I’m 
                        actually like a really good listener. 

           Margaret looks at Gwyn’s eager, credulous face. She can’t 
           decide if she wants to hug her or smack her. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Have you ever done anything bad?

                                 GWYN
                        Bad? Like... I mean, yeah. Sure. 

                                 MARGARET
                        I did something very bad. When I 
                        was young. Unforgivable.

                                 GWYN
                        What? (beat) I won’t tell, promise. 

           Margaret studies Gwyn, as if assessing a possible threat.

                                 GWYN (CONT’D)
                        Fort Knox.
           Pause. Margaret closes her eyes. Then she opens them again, 
           looks away from Gwyn.

                                 MARGARET
                        I was 18. 

           [Note: The below is intercut with fleeting, silent FLASHBACKS]

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        And I... well, my parents – they were 
                        biologists. They’re dead now. But, 
                        after high school, I took a year off, 
                        and I went with them to a research 
                        facility, on the Queen Charlotte 
                        Islands, off the western coast of 
                        Canada. I drew a lot, at that time. 
                        Wanted to be an artist. I thought 
                        being in nature would somehow 
                        stimulate me, creatively. But it 
                        didn’t. It was just cold. Harsh. 
                        Boring. There was almost nobody else 
                        around. But there was this... man. 
                        Another biologist, from some bullshit 
                        university in Michigan. David, was 
                        his name. And he was young, and 
                        handsome. Charismatic.

                        And he noticed me. Of course he did. 
                        An 18 year-old girl in that remote 
                        place. And he went about it right – 
                        charmed mom and dad first. They just 
                        fell in love with him. He was a 
                        flower child like them, big talker. 
                        And before you knew it, it was the 
                        four of us, all the time. He’d tell 
                        us stories, entertain us. He’d give 
                        me wine, pills. He was the most 
                        impressive man I'd ever met.

           tremendous intensity despite the wind and the cold.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        It was like he dropped a bomb on me. 
                        Pure adoration. I’d never felt 
                        anything so powerful as his 
                        attention. I moved into his quarters. 
                        My parents, they were hippies. Naive.

                        At first, it was wonderful. Together, 
                        every second. I was his muse; I 
                        inspired him. He said he was on the 
                        verge of a breakthrough. I didn't 
                        question it. He was a visionary; I was 
                        a kid. All I knew was, for the first 
                        time, I felt important, felt seen. So 
                        I didn't object, when he started 
                        asking me to do things. Kindnesses, he 
                        called them. Just small things at 
                        first: cleaning, cooking. He told me 
                        to stop drawing. Told me not to wear 
                        shoes. Even outside. But the 
                        kindnesses, they evolved. Became 
                        tests. Endurance tests. Meditation, 
                        for hours, or fasting, for days, or... 
                        poses. Stress positions.

                        They made him so happy. After a 
                        kindness, he’d shower me with 
                        affection, praise. Give me gifts. Let 
                        me sleep through the night. And the 
                        more I did, the more inspired he 
                        became. Said he could hear God 
                        whispering his name. Said he could 
                        see the future. And I believed him. 
                        Every goddamn thing he said. Whatever 
                        he requested, I could hack it, and I 
                        was proud of that. Each time, it'd 
                        get a little harder, he'd need a 
                        little more. And I’d do it. If I 
                        couldn't, he’d tell me to burn myself 
                        with cigarettes. But I could hack

                        up I didn't realize I was pregnant.

                        He told me not to tell anyone. Said 
                        the baby was an enemy, a spy. He 
                        forbid me from giving birth. I tried 
                        to stop it, but it kept growing. And, 
                        no matter what I did, no matter how 
                        much I could take, David wasn't

                        healthy. A boy. I looked at him and 
                        immediately I knew why I’d been put

                        For a few weeks, it was okay. David 
                        paid no attention, but I cared for 
                        him; I loved him. I didn't think I 
                        could love anything more than David, 
                        but Ben proved me wrong. And David 
                        saw this. One day, he told me to 
                        drive into town for supplies. I'd 
                        never let my baby out of my sight

                        all he’d say is that he’d eaten him

                        wasn’t. He was just... inside. In his 
                        belly. He could feel him moving, 
                        fighting. Hear him crying, crying out 
                        for me. And, after a while, I could 
                        hear him, too. Suffering, screaming, 
                        trapped, but alive. I wanted so bad 
                        to believe it, and David made it so.

           CUT TO: The Teenage Girl’s frail hands caress the large, hairy 
           belly of a man. The outline of a TINY HAND slowly makes itself 
           visible through the abdominal flesh, as if REACHING for her. 
           She places her hand over it, lovingly.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        It went on for weeks. I did what I 
                        could for my baby – tried to soothe 
                        him – but David wouldn't let me near 
                        unless... the kindnesses, became very 
                        hard. And I did my best. But I guess 
                        I wasn't as tough as we thought.
                             (pause)
                        I ran. Stole some money, the truck. 
                        And ran. Not back home. East. Where 
                        I figured he wouldn’t find me. And 
                        here I am.

           Margaret looks at Gwyn. 

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        I’ve never told anyone that in my 
                        whole life. You should be honored.

           Gwyn is utterly freaked out, scared. No idea what to say.

                                 GWYN
                        ...I don’t... understand...

                                 MARGARET
                        I let it happen. I let him use me. 
                        I let him hurt me. Poison my brain 
                        with lies. And I let him kill my 
                        child. (beat) I could’ve controlled 
                        it, Gwyn. But I failed. And I ran.

           Margaret’s tone distresses Gwyn further. She becomes emotional.
                                 GWYN
                        I don’t know... What is this? Is this 
                        some kind of joke? Or, like, a test? 

           Margaret feels pangs of guilt, regret.

                                 MARGARET
                        I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have-- 

                                 GWYN
                        I don’t like being made fun of.

                                 MARGARET
                        I know. You’re right. It was a joke. 
                        Wasn’t funny. Just, forget it. Never 
                        happened. Go home. I’m sorry. 

           Gwyn wipes her eyes, steadies herself. 

                                 GWYN
                        It’s okay. (beat) Feel better.

           Gwyn flees. Margaret sits alone in her dim office.

           INT. HALLWAY / ABBIE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Margaret peers into Abbie’s room. Abbie works on her computer, 
           earbuds in, oblivious to Margaret’s gaze. 

           Satisfied, Margaret heads down the hall toward her bedroom.

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Margaret sits on the bed, nervous. She examines a POST-IT 
           with a phone number scrawled on it in pencil. She dials. 

           RINGING. She looks out the window. The light FLASHES once in 
           the window of the building across the way, seizing her 
           attention. She waits, but it offers no more.

                                 MAN (O.S./ON PHONE)
                        Hello? (beat) Hello?

                                 MARGARET
                        Yes. Hello. I’m sorry, I, well, I 
                        got this number from... Freddy, 
                        from, from Caso’s. He said you could 
                        help me get something, quickly. Do 
                        you know who I mean – Freddy? He--

                                 MAN (O.S./ON PHONE)
                        I know ‘em, yeah.
                                 MARGARET
                        Okay. Does that mean you can... I 
                        mean, can we make a deal?

           Pause. She can hear the Man thinking on the other end.

                                 MAN (O.S./ON PHONE)
                        Might be able to help you out.

                                 MARGARET
                        Oh. Thank you. Very much, I--

                                 MAN (O.S./ON PHONE)
                        What’re you’re looking for?

                                 MARGARET
                        A... a gun.

                                 MAN (O.S./ON PHONE)
                        Yeah, can you be more specific?

                                 MARGARET
                        A handgun.

                                 MAN (O.S./ON PHONE)
                             (disdainful chuckle)
                        What kind? What you need it for?

                                 MARGARET
                        To protect my daughter.

           EXT. STREET / WORLD HOTEL – MORNING

           Rush hour. Margaret stands in a doorway across the street 
           from The World Hotel. She stares at the entrance to the 
           hotel, waits. We sense that she’s been there for some time. 

           The door of the World opens. Margaret REACTS. A YOUNG WOMAN 
           in rough shape emerges, heads up the block. The door slowly 
           swings shut. Margaret stands down.

           The closing door is halted. It opens again. DAVID emerges 
           into the sunlight and heat, again in his suit. Margaret’s 
           eyes dig in, follow him as he heads up the block.

           This time, she’s ready. She springs from her position and 
           begins tailing him, closing in, keeping him in her eye.

           He turns a corner. She breaks into a jog to keep up.

           She turns the corner, spots him, and follows at a distance 
           for half the block until he enters a CRAPPY DINER. 
           She crosses the street and advances toward the diner. She 
           stops when she sees David, seated at a table in the window.

           She watches, frozen for a few beats. She claws together the 
           courage, crosses the street, and enters the diner.

           INT. DINER - DAY 

           A WAITRESS sets a CUP OF TEA before David. She walks away, 
           revealing Margaret, standing, breathing shallow, rapid breaths.

           He smiles broadly, conveying what feels like genuine warmth.

                                 DAVID
                        Good morning, Maggie. So glad you 
                        could make it. Have a seat. Please.

           She takes the open seat at his table. As before, she can barely 
           meet his eye. He looks at her with great fondness.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        You look beautiful. Still beautiful.

                                 MARGARET
                        You look like shit.

                                 DAVID
                        True. But distinguished shit. (laughs)

                                 MARGARET
                        Get out, of New York. Now. You leave, 
                        I won’t do anything. I never saw you. 

                                 DAVID
                        I love New York. 

                                 MARGARET
                        If you don’t leave, I will do 
                        whatever I have to do. I will-- 

                                 DAVID
                        It’s okay. We’ll be fine. Better than 
                        fine. All of us. You, me, Abbie-- 

                                 MARGARET
                        Did you just threaten my daughter?

                                 DAVID
                        Threaten? No. I don’t make threats. 
                        Seems to me you’re the one making 
                        the threats at this table.
                                 MARGARET
                        You’re goddamn right I am.

           David takes a sip of tea. 

                                 DAVID
                        She’s leaving soon. All grown up.

                                 MARGARET
                        Don’t you dare talk about my--

                                 DAVID
                        Where’s her father these days? 

                                 MARGARET
                        She doesn’t have one. 

                                 DAVID
                        That’s quite a trick.

                                 MARGARET
                        I went to bars, met men. It was easy. 

                                 DAVID
                        She must be delighted.

                                 MARGARET
                        She doesn’t need a father.  

                                 DAVID
                        Every girl needs a father. 

           This registers as a threat. Margaret eyes him as he sips tea. 

                                 MARGARET
                        I’ve gone to the police. I can have 
                        you arrested at any time-- 

                                 DAVID
                        Arrested? For what? Drinking tea in 
                        a diner? Sitting in a park? 

                                 MARGARET
                        You’re following me.

                                 DAVID
                        Following you? You’re following me. 
                        Approached me. Sat down with me.

           Margaret’s frustration mounts. David sips his tea.

                                 MARGARET
                        Why are you here? 
                                 DAVID
                        He’s still inside me.

                                 MARGARET
                        Don’t--

                                 DAVID
                        In my belly. Suffering.

                                 MARGARET
                        Don’t you dare--

                           DAVID
                                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
                                              Shut up, just shut your face--
           Every day he cries and he 
           screams: “Where is mother? 
           Why did she abandon me?”

           Margaret closes her eyes tight, shakes her head slowly.

                                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
                                              No... 

                                              Lies... you lying...
                           DAVID
           I tell him to let go. I say: 
           your mother ran. Ran from her 
           baby. But he refuses. Hangs 
           on. He should hate you. But 
           he yearns for you.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                             (fighting tears)
                        ...insane fucking PIG.

                                 DAVID
                        Protest too much. I know you know. 
                        He’s alive. I kept him so. I took 
                        good care. He’s here, thanks to my 
                        charity. Any minute I could drink 
                        battery acid, burn him to a crisp, 
                        and shit him out, chunk by chunk. 

           David retreats, chagrined by his outburst.

                                 MARGARET
                        I thought you don’t make threats.

                                 DAVID
                        If the boy’s dead, where’s the threat? 

                                 MARGARET
                        What do you want?

                                 DAVID
                        A kindness.

           This hits Margaret like a punch in the gut.
                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        It would be... right, if, from now 
                        on, you didn’t take the subway to 
                        work. Instead, you walk. Barefoot. 
                        No shoes; no socks. Every day.

                                 MARGARET
                        I won’t.

                                 DAVID
                        It’d be best, for everyone. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Or what? Huh? What?

                                 DAVID
                        I’m giving you a gift. Don’t you see? 
                        I’m offering complete control. Just 
                        do this very simple thing, and life 
                        goes on, undisturbed. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Until the next thing. Then the next. 
                        I know how this works.

                                 DAVID
                        No. I’ll vanish. I promise you. Just 
                        do as I ask - don’t follow me, don’t 
                        meddle in my affairs. Do this; leave 
                        me be. And I disappear.

                                 MARGARET
                        You arrogant fucking... I don't do 
                        what you say anymore. Understand? I 
                        don’t take orders; I don’t negotiate; 
                        I don’t look away. So whatever you 
                        think you’re doing, it’ll to fail. 
                        Because I’ll be there, ready. You 
                        come after my daughter, I’ll kill 
                        you. I swear to God I will.  

                                 DAVID
                        If you kill me, you kill him. 

                                 MARGARET
                        There is no him.

           He shakes his head, leans back, digs into his pocket, places 
           its contents on the table: four wadded DOLLARS, a WERTHER’S 
           ORIGINAL, a crumbled RECEIPT, some lint, and his ROOM KEY. 

                                 DAVID
                        I just want you to be happy.
           He unwads, smooths the singles on the tabletop. Margaret 
           looks at the key. The TAG and ROOM NUMBER (408) are visible.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        That’s why I’m here. 

           David rises, weights the dollars with the salt shaker.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        You wouldn’t be able to live with 
                        yourself if something happened.

           He turns. As he exits:

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Barefoot. Every morning. All I ask.

           INT. MARGARET’S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

           Margaret paces, phone to her ear. 

                                 MARGARET
                        I can’t wait that long... I need it 
                        yesterday, goddammit... I’ll pay 
                        more. Whatever it takes... No. 
                        There’s got to be-- ...fine, fine... 
                        I said fine. Just get it here. 

           She slams the phone on her desk, suppressing panic.

           EXT. FDR PEDESTRIAN WALKWAY - NIGHT

           Margaret runs along the dark, empty walkway, ‘Roar’ pumping 
           in her earbuds. She looks POSSESSED. 

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Margaret lies on the bed, in her running clothes and a pool 
           of sweat. She stares at the ceiling. In a very quiet, 
           whispery voice, she sings a LULLABY. It seems almost 
           involuntary, as though isn’t aware that she’s doing it. 

           INT. BATHROOM - MORNING

           Margaret showers, leaning against the tile to stay upright.
           INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

           Margaret, looking as though she didn’t sleep at all, stands 
           in front of the mirror, dressing vehemently. She’s 
           misbuttoned her shirt, but doesn’t seem to notice.

           INT. HALLWAY - MORNING

           Margaret stands outside Abbie’s closed door.

                                 MARGARET
                        Text me every hour on the hour, to 
                        let me know you’re okay. Just write 
                        ‘ok’. That’s all. Can you do that?
                             (silence)
                        I’ll make it worth your while. $20, 
                        per text. How does that sound?

           INT. ABBIE’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Abbie cowers on her bed, freaked out.

                                 MARGARET (O.S.)
                        Good way to make some pocket money, 
                        don’t you think? (beat) Smidgen? 

           EXT. STREET - MORNING

           Margaret stands outside a subway entrance, waging an internal 
           battle. Commuters flow in and out. She makes a painful decision.

                                 MARGARET
                        Mother-fucker.

           Margaret grimaces, reaches down and strips off one of her 
           SHOES. Then the other. She stuffs them both in her bag. 

           A beat, then she moves up the block, barefoot.

           EXT. STREET - MORNING

           Margaret walks to work barefoot. She moves quickly. Her 
           expression of pride is obviously fraudulent.

           EXT. MIDTOWN COMMERCIAL BUILDING - MORNING

           Margaret arrives outside her office building. She stops in 
           front of the revolving door. Pedestrians stream around her.
           She turns, presents herself to an unseen audience, making 
           sure she’s visible, her naked feet are visible. She calls out 
           to David, wherever he might be.

                                 MARGARET
                        Happy, you piece of shit?? Now you 
                        disappear! Now you fucking disappear!

           Passers-by eye her curiously. She turns, enters the building.

           INT. MIDTOWN COMMERCIAL BUILDING FOYER / LOBBY - MORNING

           Margaret quickly, clumsily puts on her shoes in the foyer. 

           She enters the lobby, walks past the security desk and the 
           elevators and enters the stairwell.

           INT. MIDTOWN COMMERCIAL BUILDING - STAIRWELL

           Margaret stands in a dark corner under the stairs. She checks 
           the time on her iPhone. She waits.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Margaret sits on the floor. She’s been there for some time. 
           She checks the time. Enough has passed. She rises and exits. 

           INT. MIDTOWN COMMERCIAL BUILDING - HALLWAY

           Margaret walks down a back hallway towards a door with a red 
           EXIT sign hovering above it. She pushes the door open.

           EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           Margaret emerges into an alley behind the building. She looks 
           around: the coast is clear. She walks toward the street.

           EXT. STREET / DINER - MORNING

           Intense heat. Margaret sweats as she conceals herself in a 
           doorway across the street from the diner, watching David, 
           sitting at the same table, drinking tea and reading the paper.

           He pays, rises. Margaret huddles further into the doorway. 

           David exits and begins ambling north. She stealthily follows.
           EXT. MANHATTAN STREETS - DAY

           David walks. Margaret stalks. 

           He strolls aimlessly, turning random corners, headed nowhere, 
           block after block through the blander parts of Midtown East. 
           She follows as closely as she can, careful to avoid 
           detection. But it doesn’t seem to matter – he never turns 
           around, always looks straight ahead, totally oblivious. 

           EXT. PARK - DAY

           David sits on a bench. The sun beats down. He must be boiling 
           in that suit, but seems not to mind. He pulls moist crackers 
           from his pocket, feeds a few pigeons. He’s quickly surrounded 
           by a mob of scrounging gutter fowl.

           Margaret watches from afar, face coated with thick 
           perspiration like molasses.

           David looks up. She moves behind a tree. David squints, then 
           returns to nourishing the revolting pigeons.

           I/E APARTMENT BUILDING VESTIBULE / WORLD HOTEL - NIGHT

           Margaret leans against the wall in the vestibule of a shabby 
           apartment building, looking like an upright cadaver. Through 
           the door, The World is visible across the street. Again, she 
           sings the LULLABY to herself, barely audible.

           Her phone VIBRATES. A text from Abbie: the ‘OK’ EMOJI. The 
           13th in a line of ‘OK’ emojis, sent throughout the day. 

           She returns her gaze to the hotel. A moment passes.

           She REACTS. David emerges from the hotel, heads up the block. 
           Margaret’s eyes follow him. She exits.

           EXT. STREET / LIQUOR STORE / FDR DRIVE - NIGHT

           As before, Margaret follows David at a healthy distance. 

           Unlike in the daytime, with its crowds and cacophony, the city 
           at night is curiously empty, silent. David and Margaret seem 
           to be alone on the streets. A car passing feels like an event. 

           David enters a LIQUOR STORE. She waits for a few.

           David emerges with a PLASTIC SHOPPING BAG in hand, heads east. 

           Margaret follows until he reaches the FDR Drive. 
           She stops as David walks up the steps of a PEDESTRIAN BRIDGE. 
           He crosses over the FDR and slowly makes his way along the 
           riverside walkway. Margaret cautiously ascends the bridge 
           steps, keeping an eye on David as he recedes in the distance.

           Just as she’s about to dash across the bridge, David stops 
           and takes a seat on a bench looking out on the river. 

           Margaret stops. David is clearly visible from her spot on the 
           bridge. He pulls a pint bottle of CHEAP VODKA from the shopping 
           bag, unscrews the top. Margaret FLINCHES at the sight of the 
           booze. It seems to anger her, worry her. She shakes it off.

           David sips from the bottle, staring at the moonlit water. 

           Margaret doesn’t move from her spot on the bridge. She 
           studies David hatefully as he drinks to the sound of the cars 
           WHOOSHING by behind him. He’s all alone on the walkway.

           EXT. FDR - LATER

           Margaret huddles on the bridge, still casing David, now 
           passed out on the bench. The empty bottle at his feet. 

           Despite her exhaustion, she fidgets, impatient. She leans in, 
           clutches the fence. 

                                 MARGARET
                             (whispered)
                        What’s your game, you piece of shit? 
                        What the hell are you up to?...

           He sleeps. Dead to the world.

           Frustrated, she pushes off the fence, rises. She takes a 
           final look at David’s before descending the steps at speed.

           EXT. WORLD HOTEL - NIGHT

           A TAXI comes to a halt outside The World. Margaret emerges, 
           shuts the door. The taxi drives off.

           Margaret reviews the hotel’s sickly gray facade. 

           INT. WORLD HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

           The lobby is bleak. Behind a Plexiglass partition is the DESK 
           CLERK (60s) a gaunt woman from a foreign land. She scrutinizes 
           Margaret as she enters, moves through the lobby to the elevator.

           The Desk Clerk is instinctively suspicious.
                                 DESK CLERK
                             (heavily accented)
                        What you here for?

                                 MARGARET
                        I’m... visiting a friend.

                                 DESK CLERK
                        Come here.

           Margaret, confused, approaches her. 

                                 DESK CLERK (CONT’D)
                        What friend?

                                 MARGARET
                        ...David. Moore--

                                 DESK CLERK
                        No David.

                                 MARGARET
                        I know he’s staying--

                                 DESK CLERK
                        No David here. 

                                 MARGARET
                        There is. He’s--

                                 DESK CLERK
                        Rent room or get out. (beat) Rent 
                        room or get out.

                                 MARGARET
                        How much?

           INT. THE WORLD / FOURTH FLOOR HALLWAY – NIGHT

           Margaret walks down the squalid, dim hallway, holding a ROOM 
           KEY. No sound from the street, nor from any of the rooms. 
           Just a FAINT WHISTLE from the inadequate air conditioning. 
           It’s like the city of New York has evaporated entirely.

           She reaches room 408, stops, looks down the hall. At the far 
           end, an ancient SECURITY CAMERA stares at her threateningly. 

           Margaret turns her back to the camera and reaches into her 
           bag. She removes her WALLET and pulls out her INSURANCE CARD. 
           She moves to slide the card between door and jamb when she 
           stops. The door isn’t flush with the frame. It’s OPEN. 

           Margaret steps back, uneasy. She KNOCKS softly. 
           Nothing. She KNOCKS again, harder. Nothing.

           She holds her breath and gives the door a PUSH. It opens 
           readily onto a dark room. 

           INT. DAVID’S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Margaret steps inside. The room is empty. The BEDSIDE LAMP is 
           on. A pink handkerchief is draped over the shade. Dim pink 
           light suffuses the space.

           The room is tiny, grimy, reeking of mildew. The single, grease-
           coated window looks out into the air shaft. A small, 
           mirrorless sink dangles from the wall. The carpet is rotten, 
           crispy, and promiscuously stained. Bedbugs are nearly audible.

           Yet it’s very tidy. Everything in its place, as if expecting 
           company. The bed is severely made, military-style. Over it 
           hangs a faded print of an 18th century pastoral painting. 

           Margaret steps in further, holding the door open. She surveys 
           the space: On the tiny dresser are a few BODEGA CANDLES, a 
           months-old New Yorker, a pair of READERS, a few LIBRARY BOOKS.

           Margaret re-checks the hall: all clear. She closes the door.

           Urgently she begins searching the space. She checks under the 
           bed: nothing. She digs through a DUFFEL BAG on the floor: 
           among the socks and underwear, she finds a bulging DOPP KIT. 

           She unzips it. Inside is a large collection of plastic 
           PRESCRIPTION BOTTLES. She checks the labels – antipsychotics, 
           antidepressants (CLOZAPINE, CITALOPRAM, etc). Of various 
           ages, from various pharmacies in various states. 

           Margaret zips the kit, returns it to the duffel. She looks to 
           the far wall: a piece of PAPER and a PHOTO are taped to it. 
           The candles are huddled near these items. She moves in closer.

           Margaret pulls out her phone and shines the flashlight on the 
           photo: An old POLAROID, badly faded. In it, a TALL, HANDSOME 
           MAN IN HIS 30s stands in the forest, his arm around a skinny, 
           bespectacled TEENAGE GIRL. They smile broadly, clearly in love. 

           Margaret becomes emotional. She’d forgotten this photo ever 
           existed. There she is – before the fall.  

           Beside the photo, a small, faded NOTEBOOK PAGE. On it, is 
           barely discernible pencil, is a handwritten POEM, fringed by 
           a meticulous geometric PENCIL DRAWING. From Maggie to David. 
           The photo and poem and candles all look rather pitiful 
           together, as if assembled by a child.
           Margaret shakes it off, opens the top dresser drawer: folded 
           thrift store shirts and a worn FILE FOLDER. In it she finds a 
           Metrocard, EBT card, receipts. She unfolds sheets of yellowing 
           paper: DISCHARGE FORMS from Western State Psychiatric Hospital 
           in Lakewood, WA, dated two years prior. She studies the pages a 
           moment, returns them to the file. 

           She opens the lower drawer, is TAKEN ABACK. One item there, 
           wrapped in light blue tissue paper, like a gift. Faintly 
           written on it in pencil is an ‘M’.

           She reaches in, takes hold of the package. Something soft, 
           cloth. Blood rushes in her ears as she peels away the tissue. 

           She GASPS, DROPS IT, and RECOILS, instantly overcome. The 
           partially opened gift sits on the floor like a landmine. 

           After a beat, she rushes back to it, tears off the tissue––

           A BABY BLANKET unravels onto the floor. Faded, filthy. With a 
           pattern of yellow and green flowers over faint polka dots.

           Margaret kneels over the blanket, mesmerized, emotional. 

           She doesn’t register the door open slowly behind her...

           Or the figure silently oozing into the room...

           A sudden SCREAM––

                                 FIGURE
                        YOU GET OUT! 

           JOLTED, Margaret crumbles into a protective ball on the 
           carpet. Panic. Behind her the DESK CLERK HOWLS.

                                 DESK CLERK
                        GET OUT! GET OUT! NOW NOW NOW NOW! 

           Margaret scrambles to her feet, grabs the blanket in her 
           fist. The banshee Clerk shreds her vocal chords. Full fury.  

                                 DESK CLERK (CONT’D)
                        GET OUT GET OUT GET OUT GET OUT

           Margaret pushes past the Desk Clerk and into the hall.

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Margaret moves down the hallway, towards the glowing red EXIT 
           sign, blanket in hand. The Desk Clerk follows, bludgeoning 
           her with SCREAMS. She’d hurl stones if she had some. 
                                 DESK CLERK
                        GET OUT GET OUT GET OUT GET OUT

           Margaret doesn’t look back. She escapes into the stairwell.

           INT. MARGARET’S APARTMENT - PREDAWN

           Margaret, shattered with fatigue, enters, removes her shoes. 

           Down the hall, a bleary Abbie emerges from her room, in her 
           sleepwear. Their eyes meet for a second. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Good morning, baby.

           Abbie wordlessly goes into the bathroom.

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - DAWN

           The first rays of sunlight creep into the room. Margaret sits 
           on her bed, clutching Ben’s blanket, examining it, overwhelmed.

           She brings the blanket to her face and INHALES DEEPLY, as if 
           by doing so she can breathe in something of her lost child. 
           This seems to have a narcotic effect. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           Margaret wakes with a sickening intake of breath, as if she’d 
           been suffocating in her sleep. The blanket still in her grip.

           She looks at her bedside clock – 8:33. Late.

           INT. BATHROOM - MORNING

           Margaret enters. She catches sight of herself in the mirror. 
           On her shirt, over her nipple – small, wet SPOTS. 

           Startled, confused, she examines the fabric, the leakage. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           Margaret bends over the tub, under the shower head. She turns 
           on the COLD water. She SHRIEKS when it hits her head.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Margaret, dressed, circles the living room ferociously, like 
           a caged panther, throwing punches, GRUNTING, trying to psyche 
           herself awake, alert. It’s violent, atavistic, a bit scary.
           Churning SCORE builds from the rhythm of her movements, 
           bridging into the following MONTAGE:

           MONTAGE - VARIOUS

           A) EXT. STREET - MORNING – Heat. Margaret walks through the 
           rush hour crowds, barefoot, unsteady, limping slightly.

           B) INT. STAIRWELL - MORNING – A sweaty, depleted Margaret 
           waits in the stairwell. 

           C) EXT. STREET - DAY –  Margaret, in sunglasses, hair back, 
           walks with grim determination through the crowded streets. In 
           the distance, David continues walking nowhere. She follows.

           D) EXT. MCDONALDS - DAY – Margaret hides behind a bus stop, 
           watching David read the Post at a table by the window.

           She checks her phone: a LOOOOONG stream of OK EMOJIS from 
           Abbie. She returns her gaze to David.

           E) I/E LINCOLN TUNNEL - DAY

           A black car travels through the Lincoln Tunnel. Inside, 
           Margaret huddles in back. Light floods the interior as the 
           car emerges into New Jersey.

           F) EXT. PARKING LOT / SHOOTING RANGE - DAY

           Margaret exits the Uber and walks towards a large shooting 
           range in a strip mall.

           G) INT. SHOOTING RANGE - DAY – Margaret waits at the front 
           counter. Displayed on the wall: MANY DOZENS OF GUNS of all 
           shapes and sizes. A sign reads ‘Over 100 Guns For Rent!’. 

           H) I/E LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT - David buys a bottle of vodka 
           from a CLERK behind a bulletproof divider. DOLLY IN, past 
           David, towards the clear plastic door. Across the street, 
           Margaret crouches in the murk, watching.

           I) EXT. STREET - DAY - Margaret’s bare feet, walking across 
           the street, among a deluge of other pedestrian feet, all shod. 

           J) INT. SHOOTING GALLERY - DAY - Gun enthusiasts fire guns at 
           targets, wearing ear guards. An INSTRUCTOR provides Margaret 
           with guidance on how to aim a HANDGUN at a TARGET POSTER.

           K) FDR DRIVE PEDESTRIAN BRIDGE / WALKWAY - NIGHT - Margaret 
           sits on her perch on the pedestrian bridge, watching David, 
           passed out on the bench, empty bottle at his feet.
           L) INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - DAWN - Margaret lies in bed, on 
           top of the covers, clutching Ben’s blanket like a life raft. 
           She looks dangerously tired, but her eyes are open.

           M) EXT. FDR PEDESTRIAN WALKWAY - DAY – Margaret traverses the 
           area around David’s bench, now empty. She surveys the 
           landscape: walkway, river, passing cars. She runs her eyes 
           across the pedestrian bridge. Nestled in a corner under the 
           bridge is a TRAFFIC SURVEILLANCE CAMERA. Distant, but visible. 

           She shifts her back to the camera. She checks over her 
           shoulder, then slowly raises her arm, pointing toward the bench 
           and an invisible David. 

           N) INT. SHOOTING GALLERY - DAY - Margaret fires a HANDGUN. 
           She doesn’t look natural or comfortable, but she approaches 
           it with fierce resolve. She fires five shots, then pauses, 
           focuses hard on the target, then FIRES HER FINAL BULLET.

           O) EXT. FDR PEDESTRIAN WALKWAY - NIGHT - The BULLET 
           penetrates the skull of the sleeping David. His skull spits a 
           jet of blood, snaps back, and hits the bench. 

           P) FDR PEDESTRIAN WALKWAY - DAY - Margaret stands over the 
           bench, making a “gun” with her fingers, as if she’d just fired 
           the fatal shot. She drops her arm and walks briskly away.

           Q) EXT. FDR PEDESTRIAN BRIDGE / WALKWAY - NIGHT - Rain. 
           Huddled on the bridge, a soaked Margaret stakes out David, 
           sipping vodka on his bench. He looks more alive than she does. 

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - MORNING

           Margaret, a filthy wreck, snaps to attention. She looks 
           around, disoriented. She recognizes her door.

           At her feet, on the door sill, is a USPS EXPRESS MAIL BOX. 
           Slowly, painfully, she leans down and collects the box. 

           INT. MARGARET’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Margaret throws open the door and finds Abbie and Peter 
           sitting in the living room, poised to intervene. 

                                 MARGARET
                        What the hell are you doing here? 

                           PETER
                                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
           Margaret...
                                                (to Abbie)
                                              What is he doing here?
                                 PETER
                        Relax. Why don’t you have a seat?

                                 MARGARET
                        Answer the question.

                                 ABBIE
                        I called him.

                                 MARGARET
                        You did what?

                                 PETER
                        She’s concerned. I’m concerned. You 
                        haven’t been to work in a week. You 
                        haven’t returned my calls, my texts--

                                 MARGARET
                        You just let a total stranger into 
                        our house--

                                 ABBIE
                        He’s your boyfriend, isn’t he?

                                 MARGARET
                        I don’t have a boyfriend.

                                 ABBIE
                        Don’t treat me like I’m a fucking 
                        infant. I know what you guys do.

                                 MARGARET
                        Don’t curse.

                                 PETER
                        The point is: we’re here to help.

                                 MARGARET
                        I’m fine.

                                 ABBIE
                        You’re not fine.

           Margaret looks at Abbie, clearly hurting. Then to Peter.

                                 MARGARET
                        Can I speak to you alone?

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Margaret walks in, sets down the box. Peter follows.
                                 MARGARET
                        Shut the door.

           Peter shuts the door behind him. 

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        How dare you come here uninvited? 

                                 PETER
                        It’s important for me to know that 
                        you’re all right--

                                 MARGARET
                        I am all right. As far as you’re 
                        concerned, I’m always all right.

                                 PETER
                        Margaret, we’re friends. And when I 
                        see a friend who’s having trouble--

                                 MARGARET
                        I’m handling it, ok? I’m doing what 
                        I have to do to protect my daughter, 
                        and myself, and keep us from harm. 

                                 PETER
                        What... harm?

                                 MARGARET
                        None of your business.

                                 PETER
                        I have the number, of a good woman, 
                        a psychiatrist. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Stop. You’re overstepping. I owe you 
                        nothing. If I don’t return your calls, 
                        you suck it up. That’s the deal. You 
                        don’t pop in, and you certainly don’t 
                        discuss me or anything else with my 
                        goddamn daughter.

                                 PETER
                        What harm, Margaret? 

                                 MARGARET
                        If you think that I’d allow anything 
                        to happen to her, you are mistaken! 
                        I will do anything, sacrifice 
                        anything for my children. 
                        Understand? For them, I’m 
                        unstoppable. I’m a goddamn champion.
                                 PETER
                        Children? When was the last time 
                        you slept?

                                 MARGARET
                        Get out, now. (beat) Now.

           Peter looks at Margaret solemnly. 

                                 PETER
                        Fine.

           As he turns to leave, he pulls a BUSINESS CARD from his 
           pocket, sets it on the bureau.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        This is the person I mentioned.

                                 MARGARET
                        Out.

           Peter walks out. The front door OPENS and CLOSES. 

           INT. MARGARET’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Margaret enters the living room. Abbie sits on the sofa.

                                 MARGARET
                        If that buzzer rings, you don’t 
                        answer. For anyone. Do not open that 
                        door. Do not leave this apartment, 
                        ever, for anything, unless you’re 
                        with me. Understand? 

                                 ABBIE
                        You can’t keep me prisoner. I’m an 
                        adult.

                                 MARGARET
                        You’re a child and you’ll do what I 
                        fucking say!

           Abbie recoils. Margaret is shocked by her own outburst. She 
           instinctively goes to Abbie.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Oh, God. Baby, I’m so sorry I yelled. 

           She tries to put hands on Abbie, but Abbie retreats.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Please, I...
           Margaret takes a seat on the sofa penitently. 

                                 ABBIE
                        You lied to me. I called your 
                        office. Nobody named David Moore 
                        ever worked there. 

           Margaret closes her eyes.

                                 MARGARET
                        He’s not from the office. He’s... 
                        from when I was young. When I was a 
                        different person. And he wants to 
                        hurt me. Tear us apart. But I won’t 
                        let that happen. I’m sorry I 
                        couldn’t tell you. I was ashamed.

           Abbie becomes emotional. Margaret puts her hand on her knee.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        What is it, baby?

                                 ABBIE
                        Mom. You’re lying to me again. 

                                 MARGARET
                        I’m not. I promise you.

                                 ABBIE
                        There’s no man. You’re making this 
                        up, to control me, to keep me here. 

                                 MARGARET
                        No.

                                 ABBIE
                        I’m leaving, and you won’t be able 
                        to, anymore. And you can’t take it.

                                 MARGARET
                        No, smidgen. That’s not right.

                                 ABBIE
                        You have to let me go.

                                 MARGARET
                        I know I do. Come here.

           Margaret takes her in her arms. Abbie allows it.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        It’ll all be over soon. I promise.
           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Margaret enters. Closes and locks the door.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Margaret, sitting on her bed, uses a SCISSORS to slice open 
           the USPS BOX. She pulls out handfuls of styrofoam peanuts.

           In the box is an object thoroughly armored in BUBBLE WRAP and 
           PACKING TAPE. She tears through the dense wrapping, revealing 
           a .38 caliber SNUB NOSED REVOLVER and a small box of BULLETS. 

           Margaret stares at the weapon fearfully. She feels its weight 
           in her hand, closes her eyes, tries to reconcile herself to 
           the reality of it. 

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - EVENING

           Margaret forces herself to load her gun along to a YOUTUBE 
           INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEO dedicated to this particular weapon. 

           She snaps the cylinder into the frame.

           EXT. FDR DRIVE PEDESTRIAN BRIDGE / WALKWAY - NIGHT

           Margaret, in her usual place, watches David, passed out on 
           his bench. She’s alert. Radiantly nervous. Adrenaline 
           flooding her skull. She looks around – except for the cars 
           whizzing beneath her, there’s no one in sight. 

           She reaches into her bag and produces LATEX GLOVES. She pulls 
           them over shaking hands. She again reaches into her bag and 
           produces a black BALACLAVA, which she wraps over her head. 

           Then she reaches in and pulls out the GUN. She looks at it, 
           grips it firmly. She returns her hand, still holding the gun, 
           into her bag and keeps it there. 

           She rises, crosses the bridge, and descends the steps onto 
           the pedestrian walkway. She walks quietly towards David. 

           She stops a few feet from him, in the exact spot where she 
           practiced. She again scans the area. All clear. The two of 
           them are not visible to passing cars. 

           Margaret can barely breathe. It’s actually happening. 

           She pulls the gun from her bag and points it at his head.

           She searches for the will to fire. Do it. Now.
           The gun vibrates. Her trigger finger twitches.

           David’s eyes open. He seems neither shocked nor afraid. 

                                 DAVID
                        If you kill me, you kill him.

           They hold like this. Margaret’s eyes are filled with anguish 
           as tries to compel her body to execute. David is calm. 

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Well?

           She battles. Every pore silently screaming.

           She can’t. Her quaking hand slowly drops. David looks on her 
           with sympathy. 

           Then, with sudden violence, he LUNGES and seizes Margaret’s 
           wrist. Holding it firm, keeping the gun pointed at the ground.

           Panic. She tries, fails to wrench her wrist from his grip.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Let go. Finger off the trigger.  

           It hurts, but she won’t release the gun. The exertion is 
           fierce, but oddly static, like an arm wrestling match.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay. You don’t need it. 

           It’s clear she won’t give in. It pains him, but David knows 
           what needs doing. He KICKS at her ankle. She collapses to the 
           concrete. Her arm twists in his grip. She CRIES OUT. 

           He peels the gun from her hand. He grabs the balaclava and 
           strips it off, throwing it aside.

           He fights for breath. She struggles to rise.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Don’t move. I have a gun.

           She stops. David drops back down on the bench, gun in hand. 
           He recovers his breath, studying her through unfocused, 
           inebriate eyes. Her eyes are filled with hate. 

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        He’s here. Right here. That’s why 
                        you couldn’t fire. 

                                 MARGARET
                        He’s dead.
                                 DAVID
                        Then why isn’t there a great, big 
                        hole in my brain this very second?

           Margaret has no answer. 

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        You love him so much. More than 
                        anything. And he loves you. 

                                 MARGARET
                        You killed him and he’s fucking dead!

                                 DAVID
                        All these years, all he wants, is 
                        his mother back. That’s all. 

           David takes to his feet with some difficulty.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        He’s very upset, that we’re arguing. 
                        Listen. Can you hear him cry? 

           David takes a step, hovering directly over Margaret. Gun 
           dangling at his side.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Shh. Listen. Can you hear?

           He reaches out. She slaps his hand away. 

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Listen!

                                 MARGARET
                        He’s dead!!

           David grabs her hair and pulls her head against his stomach, 
           holding the gun to her temple. 

                                 DAVID
                        Listen to your son. 

           Silence as David holds Margaret’s ear to his gut. She closes 
           her eyes, controls her breathing. The sound of her 
           RESPIRATIONS, the RIVER, the PASSING CARS.

           Then – the faint, muffled sounds of a CRYING BABY, from 
           within David’s belly. Margaret’s eyes open.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        He can’t understand why you allowed 
                        this to happen. Why you let him get 
                        hurt; why you ran. 
           Margaret tries to shut out Ben’s SHRIEKING, will it away.  

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        What kind of mother abandons her 
                        child when he needs her most? Are you 
                        going to fail him, Maggie? Again? 

           David shifts her head so he can see her face. 

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Is Ben in my belly? Is he?

           She looks on the verge of cracking. She opens her mouth, but 
           instead of answering, she SPITS. It’s clumsy. It runs down 
           her lip, chin, like she’s spit on her own face. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Stay... away... from my daughter.

           David regards her tenderly – he doesn’t buy this act of 
           defiance for one second.

                                 DAVID
                        She’s just a substitute. 

           He releases her head. She falls to the ground. He steps away, 
           takes a breath, shakes it off.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I held up my end. But you – you 
                        followed me, tried to kill me. In 
                        breach, of our deal. So I think this 
                        calls for a kindness.

           He steps to her.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Assume a position. In the park. 
                        Ruppert Park. Two o’clock, ‘til dawn. 
                        Every night. Until further notice.

           Margaret’s moist eyeballs throb with rage.

                                 MARGARET
                        Go near her and I’ll kill you. 

           David SIGHS, tiring of her bluster. He leans in close. 

                                 DAVID
                        What happens next is entirely in 
                        your hands. If you want to keep her 
                        safe, then do as I ask. And she 
                        stays safe. It’s that simple. I hold 
                        up my end, Maggie. Always have. 
           David inhales deeply, stands upright. 

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Stop following me. Get back to your 
                        life. Back to work. Take the position 
                        in the park. Normalcy – from now on.
                             (off the gun)
                        Not the time for recklessness.

           He pockets the gun, starts towards the pedestrian bridge. 

                                 MARGARET
                        I’ll kill you, David. I will!

           Margaret watches him walk away. Then she CRUMPLES – guilt, 
           self-rebuke. She SCREAMS through gritted teeth.

           INT. MARGARET’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Margaret enters the dark apartment, barely able to stand. She 
           looks like she just wandered out of a battlefield.

           She removes her shoes, looks to Abbie’s room. The door is shut.

           She moves into the kitchen, leans against the island, closes 
           her eyes. A moment. Then she slowly peels her eyelids open.

           There. Outside. Through the picture window: the FLASHING 
           LIGHT, pulsing from the building across the way.

           Margaret watches it a moment, tries to decipher it’s message. 
           It confounds her. She becomes frustrated.

           She staggers across the room, puts her hand on the window. 
           She focuses on the light, as if it carries vital information 
           that she can’t quite grasp it.

                                 MARGARET
                        What? What??

           The light continues its frenetic pulsing. 

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        WHAT???

           Margaret PUNCHES the window, nearly topples over. The thick 
           glass doesn’t crack. She punches it again, harder, wincing. 

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Come on, you fucker! Tell me!!

           It flashes mutely. 
                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        TELL ME!

           She PUNCHES the window again, full-force. A web of CRACKS 
           explodes outward from the contact point. Margaret tumbles to 
           the floor, delirious, furious. She squirms, but can’t muster 
           the strength to stand. The light flashes.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                             (feeble whisper)
                        Tell me, you fucker...

           Her head falls back on the sofa.

           CUT TO: an EXT MLS shot. Through the cracked window, Margaret 
           sits in a heap on the floor like a discarded doll. 

           The camera retreats from her, framed by the cracked window. 
           She gets smaller and smaller as the image encompasses other 
           windows, other buildings, the city around her, becoming a 
           wide POV from the source of the flashing light.

           From here, Margaret looks like a small animal dying in a cage.

           INT. MARGARET’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           The FRONT DOOR OPENS. Margaret’s head rises off the carpet. 
           She’s curled on the floor by the sofa. Early morning sunlight 
           pours through the cracked window.

           Abbie, carrying a BACKPACK and DUFFEL BAG, stands by the open 
           door, about to leave, but not quite able. She looks scared.

                                 MARGARET
                             (softly)
                        Happy birthday. 

                                 ABBIE
                             (trying to be brave)
                        Don’t come after me. Don’t call me. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Baby... I fucked up.. I... I just... 
                        left him there. With that man... I 
                        should burn in hell, for what I did. 

           Margaret can see that Abbie is confused, disturbed by this.

                                 ABBIE
                        Go to the doctor. You’ll be okay.

           Abbie closes the door behind her. A beat, then:
                                 MARGARET
                        Abbie, no!!

           Margaret frantically assembles herself and RUNS to the door. 

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Abbie stands by the elevator. Margaret moves toward her. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Don’t go.

                                 ABBIE
                        Go back inside. Call the doctor.

                                 MARGARET
                        Smidgen, please.

           Margaret reaches Abbie as the elevator doors open. Abbie 
           enters. Margaret follows.

           INT. ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Abbie works to remain stoical. She won’t look at Margaret.

                                 MARGARET
                        He wants to hurt you.

                                 ABBIE
                        Nobody wants to hurt me. 

                                 MARGARET
                        If you stay, I can protect you. I 
                        won’t fail you again. I promise. 
                        You don’t have to be scared. 

           The doors open. 

                                 ABBIE
                        The only thing I’m scared of is 
                        you, mom. 

           Abbie exits the elevator. Margaret follows.

           INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           Abbie walks through the foyer to the door. Margaret follows a 
           few feet behind.

                                 MARGARET
                        Abbie. Abbie, no.
           Abbie opens the door, goes outside.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Please, baby. No. 

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING / STREET / SUBWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Once outside, Abbie picks up the pace, striding away from the 
           building. Margaret keeps up, trailing ten feet behind. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Abbie, stop! Talk to me, please!

           Margaret speeds up, closing the gap. Abruptly, Abbie breaks 
           into a RUN and rounds the corner. Margaret gives chase.

           Once around the corner, Margaret encounters a SUBWAY 
           ENTRANCE. She races down the steps, nearly tumbling, falling.

           INT. SUBWAY STATION – CONTINUOUS

           Margaret enters just as Abbie pushes through the turnstile. 
           It’s a secondary station entrance – one turnstile, FLOOR TO 
           CEILING BARS, no attendant. 

           NOISE. A train hurtles into the station.

           Margaret throws herself against the turnstile, shakes the 
           bars violently. No means of entry.

                                 MARGARET
                        Abbie! Come back!

           Abbie briskly moves down the platform. 

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Abbie! Don’t do this! ABBIE!!!

           The train comes to a halt. The doors open. Abbie enters. 
           Margaret continues to HOLLER futilely.

           The doors close. The train leaves the station. 

           Devastated, Margaret rests her head on the bars. The station 
           goes quiet, save for Margaret’s rapid, convulsive BREATHING. A 
           PANIC ATTACK expands throughout her body. 
           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Margaret slowly walks, weaving slightly, down her block, 
           towards her building. Around her, the city undulates in the 
           heat. Sounds melt into a SOFT DRONE.

           She looks up, stops. Up the block: a familiar face. PETER, 
           across the street from her building. Seemingly spying.

           He looks up, sees Margaret. He realizes he’s been spotted, 
           tries feebly to cover.

                                 MARGARET
                        Mother-fucker.

           Margaret marches towards him. He gives a little wave.  

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING??

           Peter braces himself.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        JUST WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK 
                        YOU’RE DOING??

           Margaret breaks into a SPRINT, running at a full, rageful 
           gallop towards Peter. Peter turns and RUNS.

           Margaret CHASES Peter through the street. Peter attempts some 
           evasive maneuvers, but Margaret is too fast for him. She 
           catches up and TACKLES him to the pavement. Hitting the 
           concrete REALLY HURTS. Peter CRIES OUT.

           Pedestrians are alarmed to see a woman throw a man to the 
           pavement. They’re equally alarmed when she grabs him by the 
           hair and starts SLAPPING THE SHIT OUT OF HIM. 

                                 PETER
                        STOP! MARGARET!! PLEASE!

                                 MARGARET
                        Were you fucking spying on me??

           Margaret PUNCHES Peter, bloodying his nose. She eases up, 
           looms above him. A small crowd has gathered.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Why are you here?

                                 PETER
                        I was worried! Jesus, I’m bleeding...
                                 MARGARET
                        What did I tell you? Stay away from 
                        me. My children are in danger. I 
                        don’t have time for your bullshit!

                                 PETER
                        You’re not well. You need help. 
                        And, and...

                                 MARGARET
                        And what? 

                                 PETER
                        ...I’m in love with you. 

           Preposterous. 

                                 MARGARET
                        You’ve got to be fucking kidding me! 

                                 PETER
                        Didn’t you know?

                                 MARGARET
                        Fucking men. Can’t put your dick in 
                        anything without deciding you hate 
                        it or you love it. 
                             (gets right in his face)
                        You don’t love me. You just annoy 
                        me. Impede my mission once more, 
                        I’ll beat you ‘til you’re dead.

           The small crowd watches the terrifying woman walk away.

           INT. MARGARET’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Margaret enters violently, slams the door. She tears down the 
           hallway, enters the bathroom.

           INT. BATHROOM - MORNING

           Splashes water on her face, her head, hair. Water everywhere. 
           Looks in the mirror. Her expression is cruel, predatory.

           INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

           Margaret, still wet, strips her torn, filthy top from her 
           torso. Her arms and shoulders are covered with bruises, cuts.

           She starts to undo her jeans, but stops abruptly. She closes 
           her eyes, fighting something off. 
           A wave of overwhelming exhaustion engulfs her. She sways, 
           trying to stay upright. She shakes her head to and fro, but 
           its no use. The room swims. 

           Her legs start to give. She staggers to the bed and collapses.

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           It’s dark. Margaret wakes on the bed. She looks around, 
           disoriented, gathers her bearings.

           She rises quickly, grabs her phone, checks it – no calls; no 
           messages. She presses a button, holds it to her ear. Pause.

                                 MARGARET
                        Where are you? Abbie. Call me. As 
                        soon as you get this. Let me know 
                        you’re safe. Don’t question it; just 
                        do it. I love you.

           Her arm drops to her side. She paces. Frantic. She stops, 
           looks at the clock: 1:23.

           She’s stands still, knowing what must be done.

           EXT. RUPPERT PARK - NIGHT

           CU: Margaret, eyes closed, sweating, enduring.

           The camera WITHDRAWS, revealing her to be SQUATTING... on the 
           ground... in a small UES park. Torso pitched forward, hands 
           CLASPED BEHIND HER BACK. A “stress position”. Her legs tremble.

           It’s clearly extraordinarily uncomfortable, but she persists. 
           She will be there until daybreak.

           INT. BATHROOM / BEDROOM / KITCHEN - MORNING

           Morning routine, calmly and swiftly:

           – Margaret showers.

           – Margaret dresses for work.

           – Margaret prepares a bag lunch. 

           INT. STREET - MORNING

           Margaret walks to work, barefoot.
           INT. BIOMATIX OFFICE / LABORATORY - MORNING

           Margaret, in shoes, exits the elevator and walks past a row 
           of work stations. Co-workers MURMUR, look at her strangely, 
           mutter hellos. She doesn’t respond.

           Margaret passes Gwyn’s desk, says nothing. 

           INT. OFFICE - MORNING

           Tess (Margaret’s boss) sits at her desk, concerned. Margaret 
           sits across from her, wearing an expression of brittle pride. 
           She’s gaunt. The circles under her eyes are coal black. 

                                 TESS
                        You look tired.

                                 MARGARET
                        I feel strong.

                                 TESS
                        Are you sure--

                                 MARGARET
                        I’m well enough. I’m ready to work. 

           Tess wants to believe her. 

           INT. MARGARET’S OFFICE - DAY

           Margaret, in her lab coat, sits at her desk, stupefied. 

           Her phone BUZZES. She grabs it. A text from Abbie: THE OK 
           EMOJI. A rush of relief. She tears up, touches the emoji.

           Her DESK PHONE RINGS rudely. She answers.

                                 MARGARET
                        Yes?

                                 VOICE (O.S./ON PHONE)
                        Someone’s up front to see you.

           INT. BIOMATIX CORRIDOR / RECEPTION AREA - DAY

           Margaret strides down the corridor, enters reception. 

           She halts when she sees David, in his suit, a batch of YELLOW 
           CARNATIONS in hand. He chats convivially with the RECEPTIONIST. 

           David looks over at the frozen Margaret.
                                 DAVID
                        Maggie.

           He steps towards her, presents the flowers.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Is there someplace we can talk?

           INT. BIOMATIX OFFICE / LABORATORY – AFTERNOON

           Peter, still bruised from his confrontation with Margaret, 
           peers around the wall of his cubicle, watching, leery.

           At another end of the office, a worried Gwyn also watches:

           Through the glass partition enclosing the CONFERENCE ROOM, 
           David is visible, standing, holding a cup of coffee, staring 
           at Manhattan through the windows on the far side of the room. 
           Margaret tensely sits in a chair at the conference table. 

           It’s odd. This is clearly not a professional meeting.

           INT. BIOMATIX CONFERENCE ROOM - AFTERNOON

                                 DAVID
                        Ballion. What is that? French? Felt 
                        strange, asking the girl for 
                        ‘Margaret Ballion’. What was wrong 
                        with Walsh? It’s a fine name. Maggie 
                        Mary Walsh. Love saying that.  

           David steps to the other side of the room, looks through the 
           partition and into the buzzing offices. 

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Margaret Ballion to these cretins.

           He smiles at her. Her gaze is fixed on the buildings outside.

           David takes a seat at the table. He leans close to Margaret.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Tell me. How was it, last night?  

           He gazes upon her reverently. She won’t meet his gaze. 

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        They still work, don’t they? The 
                        kindnesses. Still ease the pain. 
                        Quiet the noise. Make you proud. 
                        (beat) You’re incredible. Just 
                        needed permission.
           He looks at the office, Margaret’s colleagues. 

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Look at them. They truly have no 
                        idea. Do you realize that I’m the 
                        only person who can see you? Who 
                        knows who you really are? These 
                        people - they don’t have the first 
                        inkling of what you’re capable of. 
                        They’re soft. Every one. But not you. 
                        You’re a born warrior. A champion. 

           Margaret looks at the floor. 

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I’m the only one who knows. So I’m 
                        the only one who can see the hole, 
                        right there, in the center of your 
                        heart. This life, this... character 
                        you made. Ballion. Did you think she 
                        would fill it? Did you think this job 
                        would fill it? You made a daughter, 
                        to fill the hole, but even that 
                        didn’t work. Because nothing will 
                        heal you. Nothing, except him. 

           He leans in closer.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I carried him, kept him perfect, so 
                        you could be with him again. Do you 
                        want that? Do you want him? 

           He examines her. She forces a blank expression. But he can 
           see, behind her eyes, her resistance wavering. 

           He reaches into his pocket, pulls out a folded NOTE CARD.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Come to this room. Tonight. 10 
                        o’clock. Be with your son. It’s been 
                        27 years, Maggie. Be with him. 

           Pause. She turns, meets his eye.

                                 MARGARET
                        Fine.

           INT. BIOMATIX OFFICE / LABORATORY - AFTERNOON

           David walks down the corridor. Margaret follows, saying 
           nothing, looking at no one.
           David reaches Peter’s workstation. He pats him on the shoulder.

                                 DAVID
                        Afternoon, stud.

           Peter, baffled, watches them pass.

           INT. BIOMATIX RECEPTION AREA / ELEVATOR - DAY

           David stands in the elevator. Margaret in the reception area. 
           He smiles at her softly. The elevator doors close.

           INT. MARGARET’S OFFICE - EARLY EVENING

           Margaret in her office. She reaches into her bag and produces 
           Ben’s blanket. She holds it to her face and BREATHES IT IN.

                                 GWYN (O.S.)
                        Knock.

           Margaret turns. Gwyn stands there nervously. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Hey.

                                 GWYN
                        Just wanted say that I’m glad you’re 
                        feeling better.

                                 MARGARET
                        Thank you. 

           There’s an awkward, melancholic feeling between them, like a 
           couple in the wake of a painful break-up.

                                 GWYN
                        Um, who was that guy earlier?

                                 MARGARET
                        Client.

           Gwyn knows this isn’t true. Doesn’t press. 

                                 GWYN
                        Tomorrow’s my last day. 

                                 MARGARET
                        My goodness. We’ll have to do 
                        something special for you.

                                 GWYN
                        Oh, that’s not necessary.
           Margaret gives her a wan smile. Gwyn doesn’t know what to say.

                                 MARGARET
                        You haven’t seen that guy again, 
                        have you? 

                                 GWYN
                        What?

                                 MARGARET
                        The... asshole.

                                 GWYN
                        Oh. No.

                                 MARGARET
                        Good. You’re very strong.

                                 GWYN
                        Thanks. (beat) See you tomorrow. 

           She turns to leave.

                                 MARGARET
                        I helped.

                                 GWYN
                        Excuse me?

                                 MARGARET
                        I helped. Right? I’ve helped you. 
                        With... things.

                                 GWYN
                        Yeah. Of course. A lot of things.

                                 MARGARET
                        Good. (beat) I’ll make sure your 
                        letter is glowing.

                                 GWYN
                        Thanks.

           Gwyn, relieved, gives a little nod, exits. 

           INT. BIOMATIX OFFICE / LABORATORY – EARLY EVENING

           Margaret walks down the corridor towards the exit, carrying 
           Ben’s blanket. Most of the office has cleared out.
           INT. SUBWAY - EARLY EVENING

           Margaret rides the subway, still holding the blanket.

           EXT. RESIDENTIAL MANHATTAN BLOCK - EARLY EVENING

           Margaret, trying to be invisible, stands in the doorway of a 
           building, staking out a brownstone across the street. 

           Abbie emerges with LUCY (18), an awkward girl with Marfan 
           Syndrome. Margaret squeezes herself further in the doorway, 
           as she watches Abbie and Lucy walk down the street.

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Margaret sits on her bed, laptop at her feet. She turns on 
           the camera. Her image appears on screen. She hits record.

                                 MARGARET
                        Abbie. If you’re watching this, it 
                        means--

           Her voice catches. She holds back tears, stops the recording, 
           collects herself. Then she takes a breath, starts over.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Abbie. Smidgen. If you’re watching 
                        this, it means something happened. 
                        Something went wrong. 

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Margaret combs her wet hair. Her message continues in V.O.

                                 MARGARET (V.O.)
                        I wrote everything, in a letter, a 
                        long time ago. I hoped I’d never 
                        have to give it to you. It’s what 
                        happened, to me. Every word is true.

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Margaret dresses. 

                                 MARGARET (V.O.)
                        I’m so sorry I couldn’t tell you. 
                        I’m so sorry I lied. I thought I 
                        could make it all okay. But I was 
                        unlucky, in what happened. 
           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Margaret prints out a document from the printer on her desk.

                                 MARGARET (V.O.)
                        But Abbie, I was so lucky - so 
                        lucky - to have you.

           She folds several pages and places them in an ENVELOPE.

                                 MARGARET  (V.O.)
                        A million deaths would be worth the 
                        18 years I spent with you. 

           She writes ‘Abbie’ in pen on the envelope.

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Margaret wraps her ankle with DUCT TAPE. 

                                 MARGARET (V.O.)
                        I love you; I admire you. I hope 
                        you understand why I needed to do 
                        what I did. 

           She presses a STEAK KNIFE against the tape on her ankle, and 
           wraps the blade with more tape, securing it in place.

                                 MARGARET (V.O.)
                        If you don’t - if you’re angry or, or 
                        confused - I’m sorry. But I know, 
                        once you have a child of your own, 
                        you’ll understand. 

           She holds it by the handle and YANKS the knife from the 
           makeshift sheath. Seems to work okay.

                                                                CUT TO:

           She tapes a small PARING KNIFE to her forearm.

                                 MARGARET (V.O.)
                        Once you become a mother, your own 
                        life doesn’t mean much anymore. You 
                        become disposable.

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           ON-SCREEN / MARGARET’S VIDEO:

           Margaret, on her bed, speaking to the laptop camera. 
                                 MARGARET (V.O.)
                        Gloriously disposable.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Margaret, dressed and ready, sets the ENVELOPE on the coffee 
           table. On top of it she places a FLASH DRIVE. 

           She produces her phone, sends Abbie a text: ‘I love you 
           forever’. She pockets the phone. 

           Nothing left to do. She looks at her apartment, at the clock: 
           9:29 pm. She closes her eyes, breathes, foraging courage.

           INT. HALLWAY / ELEVATOR / FOYER / STREET - NIGHT

           Margaret, moving deliberately, but with tremendous focus, 
           walks to the elevator. 

           She presses the button. The elevator opens. She gets on. 

           INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

           Margaret rides the elevator, keeping it together.

           INT. FOYER - NIGHT

           The elevator doors open. She walks through the foyer, through 
           the front door, and into the street. 

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           She turns, heads down the sidewalk, keeping her head high. 

           She walks, struggling to keep her emotions in check. 

           But she can’t. Her face is steely, but tears roll down her 
           cheeks. She marches down the street, every step bringing her 
           closer to violence.

           EXT. STREET / NEW YORK HILTON MIDTOWN - NIGHT

           Margaret stands on a street corner across from the MIDTOWN 
           HILTON. She looks up at the immense, hideous structure.

           She crosses Sixth Ave. Traffic, tourists, pedestrians, noise. 
           No one notices her. Completely anonymous. 
           She approaches and enters the building.

           EXT. NEW YORK HILTON MIDTOWN LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           Margaret passes through the vast lobby. TRAVELERS and STAFF 
           drift about. She walks straight to the wall of elevators.

           EXT. NEW YORK HILTON MIDTOWN LOBBY - NIGHT

           Margaret waits for the elevator next to a TOURIST FAMILY: 
           mother, father, child. The elevator doors open. 

           INT. HOTEL ELEVATOR - NIGHT

           The elevator ascends. The Family CHAT in hushed, self-conscious 
           elevator tones. Margaret looks straight ahead, like a soldier. 

           The Family gets off on 6. She rides to 17 alone.

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY / DAVID’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Margaret exits the elevator, heads down the hallway, soundless 
           save for her breathing and the rushing of blood in her ears. 

           She reaches room 1708. Stops. She lifts her hand to knock. 

           Margaret’s hand slowly drops. She closes her eyes.

                                 MARGARET
                        David. 

           Pause. No sound. She waits.

           The door OPENS, revealing David, smiling. She’s taken back. 
           He’s TRANSFORMED. Dressed in casual KHAKIS and BUTTON-DOWN 
           SHIRT. Clearly brand new, never washed. Socks but no shoes. 

           He’s showered. His hair has been professionally cut. On his 
           neck are tiny, fresh shaving scabs. He reeks of Old Spice. 

           Although awkward in execution, the overall effect is one of 
           acute normalcy. He looks like a benign, handsome middle-aged 
           man with a paunch. Someone’s uncle, father, husband. 

                                 DAVID
                        Thank you for coming, Maggie. It 
                        means a lot to me. Come on in. 

           His manner is calm, pleasant. Humble. 
           Margaret enters. He shuts the door. She looks at the room: a 
           suite. The cheapest suite, but a suite nonetheless. It’s nice, 
           immaculate, utterly banal. There’s a view onto Sixth Avenue.

           On the table is an open bottle of cheap WHITE WINE and a 
           glass, as well as a pitcher of WATER and a bowl of CASHEWS.

           David looks at Margaret, half dead with exhaustion, barely 
           standing, dirty, wearing an old sweatshirt. 

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        You look wonderful. 

           He moves toward the table, the wine.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I wanted to get something at the 
                        Carlyle, or the Plaza, but... it’s 
                        not bad, though, right? There’s a 
                        view, here. And some wine. Can I get 
                        you a glass? We can order room 
                        service, too, if you’re hungry.

           Margaret hovers near the door. She lightly touches her forearm. 

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Okay. Well, let me know if you 
                        change your mind. Please, sit.

           She scans the space, alert to danger, threats. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Where is it?

                                 DAVID
                        Hm?

                                 MARGARET
                        The gun. Show it to me.

                                 DAVID
                        No. That’s all done with.
                             (off her expression)
                        It’s gone. In the river. None of 
                        that, anymore.

           She studies his face, trying to determine if he’s lying.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I have something here for you.

           Her muscles tighten. David picks up a MANILA ENVELOPE from a 
           chair and sets it on the bed. He smiles reassuringly.
                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay. Please. Go ahead.

           He backs away. Margaret approaches the bed and picks up the 
           envelope. Leery, she opens it, producing an old, yellowed 
           piece of GRAPH PAPER, folded into a square. 

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I saved it for you.

           Margaret unfolds the 11x17 paper. It’s very fragile, nearly 
           crumbling in her fingers: an obsessively-detailed LATTICE 
           DRAWING. The result of many hours of meticulous teenage labor. 

           She trembles. Her knees give a bit. 

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Do you recognize--

                                 MARGARET
                        Yes.

           She lowers herself to the bed. David sits in a chair.

                                 DAVID
                        I thought they might not let me keep 
                        it, so I hid it away. Went back for 
                        it, when I could. Kept it safe.

           He looks at her, solemnly regarding the paper. 

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I remember you drawing it, when I 
                        first saw you. There, on the beach. 
                        You were transfixed. I walked up to 
                        you, but you didn’t seem to notice, 
                        even when I was just beside you. So I 
                        said, “And who might you be?” 
                        Thinking you’d be startled. But you 
                        just turned and calmly looked at me 
                        through those funny brown glasses and 
                        said, “If you have five seconds, I’ll 
                        tell you everything there is to know--

                                 MARGARET
                        “The story of my life.” I said, 
                        “The story of my life.” 

                                 DAVID
                        Right. It was very witty, I thought. 

                                 MARGARET
                        It’s a lyric. A song lyric. I 
                        didn’t make it up. 
                                 DAVID
                        Still. I was impressed.

           He looks at the floor demurely.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Every morning, there you’d be, on 
                        that beach. With your pad. No matter 
                        the weather. Working for hours on 
                        the same drawing. Or swimming, in 
                        that frigid water. I was amazed you 
                        could endure it. You didn’t know, 
                        but I was watching--

                                 MARGARET
                        I knew. I always knew. 

                                 DAVID
                        Of course you did. You always saw 
                        right through me. 

                                 MARGARET
                        You just watched, and watched. And 
                        never said another word. Then one 
                        day, there you are, in our place, 
                        getting my parents shit-faced. On 
                        that disgusting homemade wine.

                                 DAVID
                        Chokecherry wine. 

                                 MARGARET
                        It was all very smart, what you 
                        did. You knew exactly what you were 
                        doing. Exactly what you wanted.

                                 DAVID
                        So did you. I’d done nothing. Said 
                        nothing. No overtures, no... 
                        indications-- 

                                 MARGARET
                        There were indications.

                                 DAVID
                        --when the gifts started appearing, 
                        at my doorstep.

                                 MARGARET
                        I was a child.
                           DAVID
           A pinecone. An apple. A moth. 
           Each night, something 
           different, for six nights.
                                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
                                              A stupid child. You just kept 
                                              coming around and coming 
                                              around...

                                 DAVID
                        Then, the drawing. Finally 
                        complete. Rolled up, tied with a 
                        bow. I was so moved.

                                 MARGARET
                        Yet you still did nothing.

                                 DAVID
                        Two nights later, there you were. 
                        At my door. 

                                 MARGARET
                        I had nothing else left to give.

                                 DAVID
                        And within minutes, a world that for 
                        a lifetime had seemed so cruel, so 
                        disordered, became... immaculate. 

           Margaret turns her head, as if to hide from the memory.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Do you remember? In the morning. How 
                        stunned we were. When the sun came 
                        up, and we realized it’d all been 
                        real. Do you? 

                                 MARGARET
                        Of course I remember. 

           David becomes emotional. Tears up. 

                                 DAVID
                        That time. The life, we made. Was 
                        holy. It was perfect. (beat) Am I 
                        wrong? If I am, tell me. Please. 
                        Did I just imagine it all? 

           She looks at him. Doesn’t contradict him.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        God, Maggie... I missed you so much.

           Margaret watches as he works to contain his emotions. She 
           remains stoic, but there are glints of sympathy in her eyes.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        ...it’s too bright.
           He rises, goes to a lamp by the window, turns it off. He 
           hovers in a dim corner, as if trying to be unseen.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I never abandoned you. After you 
                        left, I looked. Everywhere I could. 
                        For weeks. Months. But I couldn’t 
                        find you. And I panicked. I couldn’t 
                        imagine a life without you. (beat) 
                        Heartbreak. That’s why they put me 
                        away. The greatest pain there is.

           He steps forward a bit, into the light.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I see you. So clear. I know how hard 
                        it’s been. How you’ve had to fight, 
                        and be so strong, all alone, for so 
                        long. And you did it. Goddammit, you 
                        did it. Unfailingly. Heroically. But 
                        starting tonight, the hard part is 
                        over. From now on, there’s going to 
                        be no more pain. Nothing more to 
                        prove. No more sacrifices. You can 
                        stop fighting. You can breathe. And 
                        just be, exactly who you are. Maggie, 
                        the war is over. And you won.

           He tentatively approaches, sits on the bed, not too close.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I’m here to help you find peace. God 
                        knows you’ve earned it. Would you 
                        like that? After everything, some 
                        relief?

           She doesn’t answer. He inches closer, whispers.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        He’s right here. He’s awake.

           A bit closer.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        He knows you’re here. Would you 
                        like to feel?

           Ever so gently, he reaches over and takes her hand. He lifts 
           it slowly, resting it on his abdomen.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Do you feel him? Do you feel?
                                 MARGARET
                        ...yes.

                                 DAVID
                        He’s reaching out to you. Do you 
                        feel his little hand?

           She nods. David places both hands on her’s. They commune with 
           Ben. Margaret is stunned, trapped between wonder and terror.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Do you have anything to say, to him? 
                        He can hear you. 

           She looks at him. 

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay. Say something. He’ll 
                        respond to you.

           Margaret is afraid.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Nothing bad will happen. I promise. 

           Margaret looks down to his belly, their hands.

                                 MARGARET
                             (softly)
                        ...Ben.

           Margaret GASPS, RECOILS. He reacted.

                                 DAVID
                        It’s okay. It’s okay. See? He says 
                        hello. Here, put your hand here.

           She’s overwhelmed. Speechless. It’s all too much.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        He needs you, Maggie. It’s okay.

           He takes her hand. She hesitates, but allows him to slowly 
           bring her trembling hand back on his belly. 

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Do you want to say hello? To your 
                        son? Say hello.

           Tears form in her eyes.

                                 MARGARET
                        Hi... baby... my baby...
                                 DAVID
                        That’s right. Good. Now, tell him 
                        how you feel.

           She chokes up. 

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Anything. Anything you want. He’s 
                        here. 

                                 MARGARET
                             (emotional)
                        Ben.... Ben, I... I’m... sorry. For 
                        being a bad mom. 

           It’s all she can say. David wraps an arm around her, pulls her 
           into an embrace. He holds her hand firmly to his belly.

                                 DAVID
                        He forgives you. You’re forgiven. 
                        You’re loved. 

           They hold like this, very close. Margaret’s shoulders spasm 
           along with her tears. He continues to whisper soothing words.

           At first, it seems Margaret is calming, her breath slowing. But 
           her body does not quiet. Her spasms become more pronounced. 

           She moving in the wrong direction. Becoming agitated. David 
           draws her in closer, tighter, but she needs out. She extracts 
           herself from his arms. He gives her space.

           She looks at him fixedly, something powerful welling up from 
           within, like an electric current. A shocking realization. 

                                 MARGARET
                        David.

                                 DAVID
                        Yes?

                                 MARGARET
                        He’s alive. My son is alive.

           David is relieved. He nods, touched. Gratified.

                                 DAVID
                        He is.

                                 MARGARET
                        He’s... inside you... 

                                 DAVID
                        Yes.
                                 MARGARET
                        Suffering. 

                                 DAVID
                        No. He’s so happy, to be with you.

                                                     DAVID (CONT'D)
                         MARGARET
           He’s suffering. You said. He 
           needs... he needs...
                                              He has everything he needs.

                                 MARGARET
                        He needs to be held. Fed. 

                                 DAVID
                        He’s happy now. 

                                 MARGARET
                        He needs his mother.

                                 DAVID
                        He has her. And she has him.

           Margaret slowly rises to her feet. 

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Maggie. Sit. Come here.

           She steps back from him, creating distance.

                                 MARGARET
                        I failed him.

                                 DAVID
                        It’s okay. Just relax.

                                 MARGARET
                        I left him alone. And you put him 
                        inside.

           As she speaks, she continues to retreat, slowly pulling up 
           her sleeve. David notices, around her forearm, DUCT TAPE.

                                 DAVID
                        I had no choice. Because of what 
                        you did. But I took care of him, 
                        brought him back. For you.

           He sees the handle of the PARING KNIFE.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing? Maggie, what--
                                 MARGARET
                        Thank you, for bringing him back. I 
                        have him now. And he has me. We 
                        don’t need you anymore.

           She YANKS the knife from the duct tape. David is nervous.

                                 DAVID
                        Now, now. You’re... tired. Let’s 
                        sit down... collect our thoughts.

           Now she slowly advances. Shaking, but determined.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Talk to me. What’s happening?

                                 MARGARET
                        I’ll do anything, for my children.

                                 DAVID
                        Just wait a moment. Take a deep 
                        breath. Relax.

           She THRUSTS her arm forward, like an reflex. The knife JABS 
           into the side of David’s neck, above the collar bone. She 
           withdraws it quickly. The wound is superficial, but within 
           moments it’s BLEEDING generously. 

           David is STUNNED. It takes him a moment to grasp what’s 
           happened. He cups his hand over the spurting wound.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Maggie... I’m... I’m cut. I... 
                        let’s sit. Let’s sit and talk.

           She STRIKES again with the blade. A quick SLICE across his 
           ear. He BARKS in pain and recoils, STUMBLING backward.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        STOP THAT! JUST STOP! Put it down! 
                        Put the knife down!

           He tumbles backward to the bed, sits. Hands on his bleeding 
           neck, ear. The shock of the attack makes speaking difficult.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I’m okay... alright... You’re very 
                        emotional right now... not thinking 
                        clearly.... But Ben is so happy, 
                        so... no more, okay? Mistakes happen, 
                        but put the knife down now. 

           Margaret approaches slowly. The air is thick with adrenaline.
                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        He’s crying. Do you hear? He’s crying 
                        because mom and dad are fighting... 
                        Please don’t hurt him.

           She steps toward him with the bloody knife. 

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Stay where you are. MAGGIE! STOP! 

           Another step. She’s too close. He LUNGES, TACKLING her onto 
           the carpet, landing on her body, pinning her beneath him.

           She feebly tries to STAB at his back but he quickly gets hold 
           of her wrist, SLAMMING her hand to the floor.

           She’s trapped. Immobilized. Blood drips on her face as he 
           strips the soiled knife from her hand. Her other hand PUNCHES 
           weakly at his back, but he ignores this. 

           Once he has the knife, David lies still, trying to catch his 
           breath. They lie there for a while, as if they just finished 
           making love. Finally, David speaks:

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Don’t move. Or I’ll stab you in the 
                        heart. 

           He peels himself off of her. GRUNTING, brandishing the knife, 
           he rises to his knees and then, shakily, to his feet. 
           Margaret remains motionless.

           He backs up, to the bed. Sits, bleeding, panting. She watches 
           him, waits. He becomes DISTRAUGHT.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Why?? Why did you do that? I can’t 
                        fathom this. I, I did everything I 
                        was supposed to. It’s what you 
                        wanted. There was no other way. 

           Margaret sits up, watching him BLUBBER and BELLOW. She 
           discreetly draws up her pant leg, revealing the STEAK KNIFE 
           taped to her ankle. He’s oblivious.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I come to you with the greatest gift, 
                        and this is what you do? Without me 
                        there is no him. Can’t you see that? 
                        We’re one. And we love you. 

           She PULLS out the knife. David sees.
                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Stop that. Do not move.

           Margaret SCRAMBLES to her feet. She stands, ready for combat. 

           David creaks to his feet. Wounded and afraid. 

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Just stay where you are.

                                 MARGARET
                        I won’t let you hurt him any more.

           Margaret ATTACKS. 

           David HURLS HIMSELF TOWARD HER, DEFLECTING HER KNIFE, 
           WRAPPING HIS ARMS around her torso in a defensive BEAR HUG. 

           He propels them against the MEDIA STAND, CRACKING the 
           TELEVISION and SLAMMING Margaret’s body and head against the 
           wall, knocking the wind out of her. Concussing her. A 
           standing lamp COLLAPSES. The bulb SHATTERS. The room dims. 

           David REARS BACK, SQUEEZING with all his strength. He POUNDS 
           HER INTO THE WALL, trying to incapacitate her, knock her out. 
           She would scream but there’s no air in her lungs. 

           He rears back again, more slowly now. Trying to hang on, stay 
           on his feet. Very little left. Drenched with sweat and blood. 

           Margaret seizes the moment, SHOVES her knife into his RIBS. 
           He reacts reflexively, JAMMING his knife between her spine 
           and right shoulder blade. She emits a SILENT HOWL, goes limp. 

           He drops her to the ground. The air RUSHES back into her 
           lungs. Her breathing is labored – her lung punctured.

           A knife protrudes from David’s side. It’s deep. He regards it 
           with bafflement. Then he looks at Margaret, on the soiled 
           carpet, GASPING, knife embedded in her back.

                                 DAVID
                        Let’s be quiet now... and think. 
                        We’ll... do some thinking...

           She starts to CRAWL to him across the carpet. Pulling herself 
           forward with her arms, like a tarantula. 

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        No. Maggie. Please. No more... we 
                        need to... the hospital... 
                        together... we can... a story... it 
                        doesn’t have to be over...
           Margaret stops at his feet. She gently placing her left hand 
           on David’s foot. A tender gesture of apology, submission.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                             (crying)
                        Oh God.... somebody hurt you... but 
                        I’ll save you... We can be a family--

           She GRIPS his ankle suddenly, TIGHTLY, throws her right hand 
           over her shoulder and YANKS the knife from her back. In one 
           continuous motion, she DRAWS THE KNIFE ACROSS THE BACK OF HIS 
           ANKLE, slicing the Achilles tendon like a rubber band. 

           David SCREAMS and TUMBLES halfway onto the bed. Margaret 
           swiftly plunges her knife THREE TIMES into his thigh. 

           He slides off the bed, onto the floor. It’s an ungodly mess: 
           blood everywhere. The room suddenly smells of fresh excrement.

           David, replete with new, wet holes, lies still. He’s 
           conscious, but too weak and wounded to move much. Certainly 
           to stand. He keeps his watery eyes fixed on Margaret. 

           She’s on her knees, holding the knife. Losing blood. 

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        ...say something. Talk to me. I’m 
                        bleeding. Please. Talk to me.

           She stares, dead-faced, like she may pass out.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        You’re killing him. You’re 
                        murdering your own son. God, it 
                        stinks. It stinks in here...

           She shakes off a blackout, staggers to her feet, to the  
           TELEPHONE. She strips the cord from the phone and the wall.

           She returns to David, drops to her knees, landing next to his 
           mutilated leg. She sets down her knife, grabs his wrists, 
           wraps the PHONE CORD around them. He barely puts up a fight. 
           He speaks slowly, weakly, through the pain, slurring.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        You’re a murderer.... Baby killer. 
                        He was so wrong about you... Hates 
                        you. You’re a terrible mother.

           WHEEZING, she ties his wrists tightly to the BEDPOST.

                                 MARGARET
                             (soft, hoarse)
                        I’m a good mother. 
                                 DAVID
                        If I die, he dies.

                                 MARGARET
                        Then I’ll do it while you’re alive.

           She finishes. David lies on the carpet, arms above his head, 
           bound to the bed. Consciousness starting to slip.

           Margaret draws as much oxygen as she can, then SWINGS her leg 
           over him, straddling. She takes hold of the knife jutting 
           from his side, PULLS IT OUT. David GASPS and starts QUIETLY 
           SOBBING. The GUSHING wound adds to the puddle on the floor. 

           She positions herself over his torso, unbuttons his shirt. 

                                 DAVID
                        Please don’t. 

           With the knife, she SAWS down the front of his undershirt. 

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        It’s not my fault... I just did 
                        what you wanted... 

           She RIPS opens the v-neck, exposing David’s chest and abdomen, 
           wet with sweat and blood. She adjusts the knife in her hand. 

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Your happiness is more important 
                        than anything...

           Margaret THRUSTS the blade into David as hard as she can, 
           just below the sternum, creating a GUSHING WOUND. He makes a 
           CHOKING sound as blood leaks from his mouth across his cheek. 
           His eyes are still open. He keeps trying to talk.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        ...I would’ve done anything... 

           She holds tightly to the submerged knife and, with a mighty 
           effort, begins working it downward, inch by inch. His voice 
           is getting softer and softer. He SHIVERS convulsively.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        ...I came back... I came back... 

           She battles to form a deep incision down David’s abdomen. The 
           work of cutting David seems to lend her renewed strength. 

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Because... I see you... Maggie... I 
                        see you.
           He goes silent. Clinging tightly to consciousness, she works 
           the incision down through David’s navel. It’s a godawful mess.

           A tiny little RATTLE, then David is motionless, silent. Dead. 

           Margaret registers this, discards the knife. A sudden 
           urgency. She doesn’t have much time.

           She touches the wound with her right hand, pressing her 
           fingertips into the gash, working them inside. Her HOARSE, 
           LABORED BREATHING mixes with the MOIST SOUNDS of Margaret’s 
           digits penetrating David’s belly.

           After some digging, she’s knuckle-deep. She gives a couple of 
           good pulls to the right, opening the wound some. Then she 
           digs in with her left hand. Soon she’s got a strong, two-
           handed grip on either side of the expanding wound.

           She stops, holding onto the walls of the cut. She rests her 
           head on David’s chest, closes her eyes, summoning the will. 

           Margaret sits up and, with all her strength, JERKS THE WOUND 
           WIDE OPEN, SCREAMING as she does so. 

           She stops. Now the wound looks like a HUGE, GAPING MAW. It’s 
           not pretty, but it allows access to David’s insides. 

           She dives in, extracting entrails by the handful and tossing 
           them aside. It’s tough going, but she’s possessed. She manages, 
           chunk by sloppy chunk. 

           She’s CLOSE. She can feel it. She’s a MACHINE, clearing the 
           guts. She GRUNTS; her veins BULGE; she gnashes her teeth. 
           She’s not recognizably human any more. 

           Progress. Progress. Margaret yanks out a big piece of meat. 

           Then she HALTS. She sees something. 

           She sits up, retracts her coated hands from the body. Her 
           face softens. A vague sense of wonder. Something ILLUMINATES 
           her face dimly and warmly from below.

           Margaret’s eyes glisten and fill with IMMENSE PRIDE.

           A little smile. Her face is quite still, yet water GUSHES from 
           her eyes, carving skinny pathways through the drying blood on 
           her cheeks. Her rasping voice is barely audible.

                                 MARGARET
                        Hey, you.

           CUT TO: OH shot. Margaret kneels over David’s body, splayed 
           open, surrounded by miscellaneous viscera.
           In the chasm in David’s middle lies a THREE WEEK-OLD BABY 
           BOY, asleep. He’s all bloody, and he’s MISSING TWO FINGERS 
           from his right hand, but he’s breathing and resting calmly. 
           Looking damn good, all things considered.

           Margaret marvels at her boy, every inch the loving mother.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Nice to see you again.

           Margaret leans in and collects the baby from David’s body. 

           She holds him close. He fusses a little bit, wakes up.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        I saved you. I saved you.

           She lovingly tends to her baby son. Blood pours down her back. 
           The sounds of Sixth Ave faintly audible in the distance.

                                                              FADE OUT.

           INT. ABBIE’S ROOM - DAY

           Abbie finishes packing a bag. Other LUGGAGE sits on the 
           floor, as well as a few boxes. She looks at the bags, her 
           room, nervous. She’s done.

           She collects herself, walks into the hallway.

           INT. HALLWAY / KITCHEN / MARGARET’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Abbie pauses. SOUNDS of activity in the kitchen. 

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        Abbie?

                                 ABBIE
                        Yeah.

           Abbie enters the kitchen. Peter is there, wearing an apron 
           that says ‘World’s Okayest Cook’, preparing food clumsily.

                                 PETER
                        Can you ask your mom how many eggs 
                        she wants in her omelette?

                                 ABBIE
                        Sure.

           Abbie turns to leave.
                                 PETER
                        Sure you don’t want any? Going to 
                        be scrumptious!

                                 ABBIE
                        No, thanks.

           Abbie heads down the hall to her mother’s bedroom. She 
           enters, stands near the doorway.

                                 ABBIE (CONT’D)
                        Mom.

           ANGLE ON: Margaret sits in a comfortable chair. She holds a 
           sleeping Ben, smartly dressed in a onesie and little hat.

           Margaret’s face and arms are covered in BRUISES and SCRATCHES. 
           She sits up awkwardly, her breathing strenuous. The BANDAGE 
           over the stitches in her back juts out from under her collar. 
           She looks tired, but content.

                                 ABBIE (CONT’D)
                        I’m all packed.

                                 MARGARET
                             (smiles)
                        Okay, smidgen.

           Her voice is gravely and soft due to the injuries. Abbie 
           hovers, seems to want to say something more.

                                 ABBIE
                        Um, Peter wants to know how many 
                        eggs you want.

           Margaret looks admiringly at her daughter.

                                 MARGARET
                        Do you want to hold him? 

                                 ABBIE
                        Okay.

           Abbie walks to Margaret, collects Ben. She stands, holding 
           him a bit awkwardly. He wakes partially, squirms a little. 

                                 ABBIE (CONT’D)
                        Hey, little fatass. Hey, you.

           Abbie touches his nose, cheeks. He reaches up with his right 
           hand and wraps his three remaining fingers around her finger.
                                 ABBIE (CONT’D)
                             (whispered shout)
                        The claw! The claaaaw!

           Margaret smiles. 

                                 ABBIE (CONT’D)
                        Mom. I--

                                 PETER (O.S.)
                        All you guys have is mozzarella! Is 
                        that okay? I guess it’ll have to be...

           Margaret rolls her eyes at the silly man. Abbie smiles.

                                 MARGARET
                        What is it?

                                 ABBIE
                        I, well...

                                 MARGARET
                        What, baby? 

                                 ABBIE
                        I want you to know. I don’t feel 
                        scared anymore. You made everything 
                        okay. So I’m not scared. 

                                 MARGARET
                             (gratified)
                        C’mere.

           Abbie approaches. 

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Closer.

           Margaret makes a fist, KISSES it. Then she gently rubs the 
           fist into Abbie’s cheek, punching her with the kiss.

                                 ABBIE
                        Thanks, mom.

           Margaret is happy. She watches Abbie bounce Ben. It’s perfect.

           DOLLY IN on Margaret’s face. Her expression is one of love 
           and contentment. Then a flash of consternation in her eyes. A 
           touch of distant panic, as if something in the very back of 
           her mind is softly knocking on the door, trying to tell her 
           something, but she can’t quite grasp it.

           Awareness seeps into Margaret’s consciousness. Her eyes widen. 
           Something frightening, or something glorious. Overwhelming.
           Margaret inhales tremulously and HOLDS HER BREATH.

                                                           CUT TO BLACK
