           Foghorns.  Waves lapping the shore.  Seagulls.

           EXT. WATERFRONT DOCK - SEATTLE - EVENING

           CLOSE on MARGOT, her face red and puffy, remnants of tears.  
           She puts drops in her eyes.

                                 CRAIG (O.S.)
                        Margot, you sure you’re okay?

                                 MARGOT
                        Yeah, I’m fine.

                                 CRAIG (O.S.)
                        I said I was sorry.  And I am.  I’m 
                        really sorry.  Super sorry.

                                 MARGOT
                        I believe you.

           The couple in their 30s stand waiting on a pier, elegantly 
           dressed in an off-the-rack sort of way, their clothing perhaps 
           purchased at Von Maur at the mall.  Craig wears a non-iron 
           shirt beneath his suit and “nice” loafers with tassels.  He’s 
           a stiff, eager type, and maybe a tad portly.  

           Margot has chosen a red floral print dress and flats.  A navy-
           blue cardigan covers her shoulders.  She’s quicker than 
           Craig, her bullshit detector higher. 

           Right now Craig is contrite -- for what, we don’t know.  All 
           we can tell is that he’s eager to get a special evening back 
           on track.  As he puts an arm around her, she digs a cigarette 
           out of her purse.  

                                 CRAIG
                        Honey, no, don’t --

                                 MARGOT
                        Don’t what, “kill my palate?”  

                                 CRAIG
                        Well, yeah.  Of all nights --

                                 MARGOT
                        Then my palate will die happy.  
                            (lighting up)
                        I’ll only smoke half.

           She takes a long drag.  Craig puts his hands in his pockets 
           and looks down, sulking a little.
                                 CRAIG
                        I’m only thinking of you.  The 
                        flavor profiles are going to be 
                        super-subtle and delicate.  

                                 MARGOT
                        Yeah, well.  I have like zero 
                        appetite.

                                 CRAIG
                        Honey, I asked you not to eat that --

           He trails off.  What’s the use?  He glances at a beautiful 
           BOAT docked nearby, where a uniformed CREW prepare the deck.  

           They are not alone on the dock.  A well-dressed couple in 
           their late 60s also stand waiting nearby.

                            (affable)
                        Good evening.

                                 MARGOT
                        Hi.

           RICHARD and ANNE LIEBRANDT respond with polite, tight smiles.

                                 CRAIG
                        I bet we’re in for quite a night 
                        tonight, huh?

                                 RICHARD
                        Oh, yes.  We are indeed.  First 
                        time?

                                 CRAIG
                        We flew in from Indianapolis just 
                        for the occasion.  It’s our 
                        anniversary.  

                                 RICHARD
                        You don’t say.

                                 ANNE
                        Congratulations.

                                 CRAIG
                        How about you guys?

                                 RICHARD
                        Oh, we’ve been here quite a few 
                        times. 
                                 CRAIG
                        A few times?  Oh, wow.  Lucky you.

                                 ANNE
                        Well, we live locally.  You know.

           Richard and Anne lose interest and turn away.  

           FOUR RICH TECH-NERD BROS in their 30s and 40s amble up to the 
           dock, a little drunk, a little rowdy.

                                 TECH BRO #1
                        Don’t talk to me about hedging 
                        crypto.  I invented hedging crypto.

           They all laugh.

                                 CRAIG
                        Great.  A power tasting.  They’ll 
                        be wasted by the amuse.

           Now an Uber Black pulls up and drops off an intellectual-
           looking twosome.  First to emerge is TED BLOOM -- 50s, hip 
           suit, bow tie, precise eyewear.   With him is GRETCHEN ROSS -- 
           also 50s, bookish, smartly-dressed, large jade jewelry.

                                 CRAIG (CONT’D)
                        Shit, that’s Ted Bloom.

                                 MARGOT
                        Who’s Ted Bloom?

                                 CRAIG
                        You know who he is.  Food critic at 
                        the New York Times for years.  Now 
                        he’s at Saveur.  Restaurants rise 
                        and fall on his reviews.  He must 
                        be prepping his next world top-
                        fifty.  Last time he had it number 
                        seven.  But San Pelligrino already 
                        has it at number three.  

                                 MARGOT
                        Oh.  Cool. 

           A BOATMAN opens a little gate on the dock.

                                 BOATMAN
                        All aboard for Hawthorn!

           As they file down the dock and board, the passengers hand the 
           boatman fancy TICKETS. 
           INT. BOAT - EVENING

           A magical interior -- dark wood, brass fixtures, candlelit 
           tables, flowers.  Ravel plays dreamily on the sound system.

           A finely-dressed CAPTAIN appears, flanked by WAITERS bearing 
           trays of champagne.

                                 CAPTAIN
                        Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.  
                        Just a brief 29-minute ride to 
                        Hawthorn, and we endeavor to make 
                        your journey a pleasurable one.  
                            (pointing)
                        Restrooms are over here, and in the 
                        unlikely event of an emergency, 
                        life vests are located on either 
                        side, beneath the benches.  
                        Meanwhile, Chef Slowik joins me in 
                        welcoming you aboard with a glass 
                        of 2005 Henri Gouturbe Special Club 
                        champagne.  Crisp pear and apple 
                        notes, maybe even a slightly 
                        chocolatey finish.

           As guests take their flutes, they hear British accents coming 
           from the dock.

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Uh...no.  Uh-uh.  I change my mind.

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Please.  Just get in the boat.  I 
                        promise you’ll love it.

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        It’s my one day off of shooting, 
                        and I wanted supper, not fucking 
                        Pirates of the Caribbean.  You know 
                        I’m claustrophobic.

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        I told you a hundred times it’s on 
                        an island.  You can’t swim to it.

           We hear the pair clamor aboard, and they peer inside the 
           cabin.  Why, it’s none other than a famous MOVIE STAR and his 
           assistant FELICITY.

                                 MOVIE STAR
                        Excuse me.  Does anyone know how 
                        long the trip is?
                                 CAPTAIN
                        Just 29 minutes.  

           Noting the opulence of the room and all the faces recognizing 
           him, the movie star is “on,” instantly transforming from 
           spoiled actor to charming famous personage. 

                                 MOVIE STAR
                            (venturing inside)
                        Ahoy!  Avast me hearties!  Let’s 
                        hope she’s seaworthy, eh?  Good 
                        evening, everyone.

                                 CRAIG
                            (whispering to Margot)
                        Can you believe this night?  First 
                        Ted Bloom, and now a big movie 
                        star?
                            (looking at her squarely)
                        We have no reason to be fighting, 
                        babe.  It’s our anniversary, and 
                        look where we are.  I mean, look at 
                        where we are!  We’re super lucky.  
                        Plus Hamilton tickets tomorrow?  
                        Come on.

           Margot looks at him -- he’s really trying -- and concedes a 
           smile and nod.  

                                 CRAIG (CONT’D)
                        This whole trip is going to be good 
                        for us.  You’ll see.  We needed this.

                                 MARGOT
                        I know.  We really did.

           They peck-kiss.  A WAITER approaches with two large porcelain 
           spoons on a tray.

                                 WAITER
                        Just a small bite to go with the 
                        champagne. 

                                 CRAIG
                        And this is...?

                                 WAITER
                        Silverbrite salmon caviar harvested 
                        this morning right here in the 
                        Sound.  Served with a smoked Hood 
                        River oyster, oysterleaf cream, and 
                        a pale ale “air.”  Enjoy.
                                 CRAIG
                        Gorgeous.  Thank you.

           The waiter walks away. 

                                 MARGOT
                        Pale ale air?

                                 CRAIG
                        Fancy name for, you know, 
                        stabilized beer foam.

                                 MARGOT
                        So why can’t they just say beer 
                        foam?

           Margot places the spoon in her mouth, but Craig takes a quick 
           photo with his phone before slurping his.  

                                 CRAIG
                        Fuck.  Oh, my God.

                                 MARGOT
                        Really good.  I’d be happy with 
                        just the oyster, though.

           Craig waits for the finish and opens his eyes.

                                 CRAIG
                        You’re right.  Perfect oyster.  But 
                        it’s the balance of the products 
                        together.  You need the richness of 
                        the cream and the mouthfeel of the 
                        roe.

                                 MARGOT
                        What’d you just say?

                                 CRAIG
                        Uh... mouthfeel.

                                 MARGOT
                        Really?

           The HORN BLOWS.

           EXT. PUGET SOUND - EVENING

           The boat makes its way across the water, the ISLAND in the 
           distance.
           INT. BOAT - EVENING

           All lean in as the great Ted Bloom holds court. 

                                 TED BLOOM
                        ... and he’s always had trouble 
                        staying put.  Cuts his teeth with 
                        Keller, puts in a year as a stage 
                        with Ferran and Albert, then 
                        suddenly pops up as head development 
                        chef at The Fat Duck.  Two years 
                        later he opens his own place in New 
                        York, Tantalus.  Immediately, boom -- 
                        two Michelin stars.  That’s when I 
                        discover him.  But then three years 
                        later, at the top of his game, he 
                        closes up shop and disappears.  
                        Falls off the map.  Probably lost a 
                        fortune just on the lease.  

                                 CRAIG
                        Do you have a theory on where he

                        Hi, everybody.

                                 TED BLOOM
                        So yeah, I’m in Portland.  
                        Umbrellas, beards, heroin.  Big

                        Right you are.  Big arena full of 
                        pop-ups.  And I think, if I have to 
                        sample one more lukewarm consommé or 
                        one more precious little salmon-
                        cream cone, I’m going to puke.  So 
                        I’m walking to Powell’s Bookstore 
                        and stop at a Korean taco truck.  
                        And I fucking lose my mind.  It’s 
                        like the Platonic ideal of a Korean 
                        taco.  The Korean taco of your

           Margot blinks.  What?

                        I look in the truck, and guess 
                        who’s manning the grill.

                        And that’s the now-famous piece Ted

                        The point is, after all those 
                        years, I’d found him.  It was like 
                        a sign from God.  Before you know 
                        it, every investor in the Northwest 
                        is hounding him, but Slowik plays 
                        it cool.  

           As she half-listens, Margot notices the older couple.  
           Richard glances at his phone, while Anne just looks bored.

                        restaurant again on four conditions.  
                        One, total menu autonomy.  Well, 
                        duh.  Two, land to forage and grow 
                        his own produce and raise and 
                        slaughter his own livestock.  Three, 
                        it has to be by the water so he can 
                        fish and access kelp and seaweed.  
                        And four, complete privacy.

                        I happen to own an island in the

                        because of Ted.

                        Last two times I ate here, it was

                        tonight I think we’re in for 
                        something new, something special.  
                        He texted me personally last week 
                        with the invitation.  I didn’t even 
                        think he had a phone.

                        Yeah, we actually work with Doug 
                        Varrick but were still waiting 
                        another four months for our table.  
                        Then they suddenly call last week 
                        to say they could take us tonight, 
                        so we’re like, yeah, we’re in.

                        Huh.  We put in for the lottery

                        very next day.  That never happens.  
                        We’d been trying for two years.  

                                 MARGOT

                            (brightening)
                        Maybe it’s because I told them it’s 
                        our anniversary.

                        wouldn’t care about that.

           EXT. HAWTHORN DOCK - EVENING

           SERVERS and HOUSE STAFF line the spotless wooden dock of 
           Hawthorn Island.  Behind them gleams the jewel-box 
           RESTAURANT, at once rustic and modernist.
           The gangway is secured, and the guests disembark, welcomed at 
           the end of the dock by ELSA, the polite but severe Nordic 
           restaurant captain. 

           Elsa recognizes everyone while checking names against a list.  
           Margot and Craig get their turn.

                                 ELSA
                        Welcome to Hawthorn, Mr. and Mrs. 
                        Spooner.  My name is Elsa, and I 
                        will be at your service this 
                        evening.  Everyone at Hawthorn, 
                        especially Chef Slowik, joins me in 
                        wishing you an exceedingly happy 
                        fifth wedding anniversary.  

                                 CRAIG AND MARGOT
                        Thank you.

           EXT. GREAT LAWN - EVENING

           The guests assemble on an expanse behind the restaurant.

                                 ELSA
                        Again, welcome to Hawthorn.  You are 
                        all part of an enormously special 
                        evening.  As those of you who’ve 
                        eaten with us before well know, each 
                        of our menus tells a unique story.  
                        Tonight we will tell you a story 
                        we’ve never told before, and will 
                        never tell again.  So let me warn 
                        you -- 
                            (smiling)
                        -- wonderful surprises await you 
                        all.

           Everyone laughs fondly.  It’s all so exciting.

                        But first let us introduce you to 
                        our home.  

           As Elsa begins the tour, we cut to BEAUTIFUL SHOTS OF THE 
           ISLAND -- trees, unusual wild plants, gentle waves on rocks, 
           dragonflies buzzing through reeds.

                                 ELSA (V.O.)
                        Hawthorn Island comprises twelve 
                        acres of prodigiously fertile forest 
                        and pasture.  Our principal investor 
                        purchased the island in 1989, but we 
                        prefer to think of it as ownerless.

                        As wild.  As a natural outgrowth of 
                        the sea and the air and the sky.

           MARGOT whispers to Craig.

                                 MARGOT
                        Oh, boy.  Here we fucking go.

           Craig nudges her -- just go with it, okay?

           EXT. HAWTHORN GARDEN AND GREENHOUSE - EVENING

           Elsa leads the group toward the garden and greenhouse tended 
           by a small but diligent STAFF. 

                                 ELSA
                        Wild sea beans, salmonberries and 
                        sea lettuce, for example, grow 
                        abundantly on our shores and are 
                        easily foraged.  And our garden here 
                        supplies us with no end of produce 
                        throughout the year.  
                            (pointing to the shoreline)
                        And of course we have the abundance 
                        of the sea which surrounds us.  Out 
                        there, right now, we are harvesting 
                        manila clams.  You’ll eat them 
                        tonight!

           She waves broadly at a GUY IN A ROWBOAT.  As if on cue, he 
           waves back.  The guests join in and wave as well.  

                                 MOVIE STAR
                            (cupping his hands)
                        Keep looking!  We’re starved!

           Everyone laughs at what the famous guy said, everyone but --

                                 ELSA
                        Right this way, please. 

                                 GRETCHEN 
                            (to Ted Bloom)
                        It’s like a biome for creative 
                        energy.  Just magical.

           Margot overhears this and reacts.

           EXT. SMOKEHOUSE - EVENING

           Elsa removes a giant KEY RING and opens the door.
           INT. SMOKEHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           All enter a compact room where large slabs of MEAT and FISH 
           hang on sharp hooks.  

                                 ELSA
                        Our smokehouse mixes the traditions 
                        of a Nordic smokery with the demands 
                        of a modern luxury restaurant.  We 
                        use dairy cow meat only, chosen from 
                        our own stock, and we age it for an 
                        astonishing 152 days, the exact 
                        point at which the protein strands 
                        in the muscle tissue relax to the 
                        point of supreme tenderness.

                        What happens if you serve it on the 
                        153rd day?  All hell breaks loose?

           He and his posse laugh.  Elsa smiles tightly.

                                 ELSA
                        Actually, at this temperature, on 
                        the 153rd day, the bacteria, having 
                        breached the interior of the flesh, 
                        would seep into the customer’s 
                        bloodstream and produce a series of 
                        very unpleasant symptoms.  
                        Pathogens would spread into the 
                        customer’s spinal cord membrane, at 
                        which point he or she would become 
                        incapacitated and shortly 
                        thereafter expire.  So, yes.  All 
                        hell breaks loose!

           Elsa laughs.  They all laugh.

                        Good thing we are professionals, yes?

           EXT. ROOT CELLAR - EVENING

           Elsa leads the group toward a wooden DOOR built into the side 
           of a small hill.  Again the key ring.

                                 ELSA
                        And this is our root cellar. 
           INT. ROOT CELLAR - CONTINUOUS

           A dank, wood-paneled cellar with rows and rows of carefully-
           labeled JARS and BASKETS.

                                 ELSA
                        In all seasons, we use only what we 
                        produce here on the island.  Here 
                        we store vegetables, preserves, 
                        seeds and nuts for the winter.  

                                 MOVIE STAR
                        Maybe this is a good time to mention 
                        I have a severe nut allergy.

                                 ELSA
                        Oh, yes, we know.  We’ve planned for 
                        that.  And Mrs. Liebrandt’s 
                        shellfish allergy.  And Mr. Nelson’s 
                        gluten sensitivity, even though 
                        technically no such condition 
                        exists. 

           Mr. Nelson, one of the tech bros, makes a puzzled face.

                        We try to know everything about our 
                        guests, and Chef Slowik plans his 
                        menu accordingly.

           EXT. GREAT LAWN - EVENING

           The group follows Elsa quietly across the idyllic lawn.    
           Craig reaches over to take Margot’s hand.  

                                 CRAIG
                        Just beautiful, right?  Foodie 
                        Disneyland.  I feel like I’ve died 
                        and gone to heaven.

           At the front of the group, Elsa sees Ted Bloom taking notes.

                                 ELSA
                        Writing good things, I hope, Mr. 
                        Bloom?  Not like what you wrote 
                        about our friends at Mercia.

                                 TED BLOOM
                        Mercia?  Now, be fair. I wrote a 
                        very kind review of Mercia.
                                 ELSA
                        Not completely, Mr. Bloom.  Not 
                        completely.

           At the end of the group, one of the tech bros turns amiably 
           to the actor.

                        Well, you guys probably had no 
                        trouble at all getting a table.

                        Actually, yes, eight months ago we 
                        got an e-mail out of the blue 
                        saying the chef was a huge fan, and 
                        if he was ever in the area, we 
                        should come dine.

                            (to Felicity)
                        Did the chef mention any of my 
                        theatre work?  My Equus?

                                 FELICITY

                        I got naked in Equus, you know. 
                        Very risky.

           INT. BUNKHOUSE - EVENING

           The group is led inside what looks exactly like a MILITARY 
           BARRACKS.  Bunk beds line the walls.  In the bathroom area, 
           open showers and toilets without walls or doors.

                                 ELSA
                        Yes.  All of us together.  All of 
                        us except Chef.

                                 GRETCHEN
                        Total commitment.  Love it.

                        It’s not a question of love, Miss 
                        Ross.  It’s what we do.  We are like 
                        a family.  A common mission unites 
                        us, and that mission is to run the 
                        world’s finest restaurant.  We work 
                        eighty hours per week if we’re 
                        lucky.  And we’re never lucky.  Each 
                        day starts at six with five hours of 
                        prep work.  We harvest.  We gather.  
                        We ferment. We slaughter.  We 
                        butcher.  We chop.  We marinate.  We 
                        steep.  We smoke.  We temper.  We 
                        liquify.  We spherify.  We gel.

                                 MARGOT 
                        You gel?

                                 ELSA
                        We gel.  After staff luncheon, we 
                        have only four short hours for pre-
                        service prep.  Supper is typically 
                        four hours and twenty-five minutes.  
                        And once our guests depart, we 
                        break down the kitchen and scrub 
                        and clean for another two hours.  
                        By then, it’s well past two in the 
                        morning.  Yes, it’s best that we 
                        all stay here.

                        Like at our office, if we get 
                        tired, we have nap rooms.

                                 ELSA
                        Chef holds himself to the highest 
                        possible standard in every single 
                        detail of every single task, large 
                        or small, and he demands the same 
                        of anyone who has the honor of 
                        working at Hawthorn.  He never... 
                        naps.  So we do not...nap.  Now --
                            (big, terrifying smile)
                        Who’s hungry?

           EXT. GREAT LAWN - DUSK

           As they approach the restaurant, Craig notices a charming 
           COTTAGE perched on a hill in a copse of trees.

                                 CRAIG
                        Excuse me, Elsa.  Who lives there?

                                 ELSA
                        Chef.

                                 CRAIG
                        Are we seeing that?

                                 ELSA
                        Even we are not allowed inside 
                        Chef’s cottage.

           EXT. HAWTHORN RESTAURANT - DUSK

           Elsa shows everyone inside and quietly locks the door.

           The interior is high-end and spare, formal and stiff, a touch 
           sad even.  Despite warm wood on the walls, the minimalist 
           décor and somber lighting don’t suggest a place where people 
           necessarily “enjoy” eating.

                                 ELSA
                        You will find your names at your 
                        table settings.

           A sad husk of a woman around 75 -- LINDA -- sits drinking 
           wine at a small table abutting a wall.  The diners are mildly 
           confused by her presence.
                                 LINDA
                            (quietly)
                        Welcome.  Welcome.

           Everyone takes his/her seat almost in unison.  These will be 
           their stations for the evening.

           THE KITCHEN is open, visible from the dining area.  It’s cool 
           to watch the bustling staff hard at work.

                                 ELSA
                        Chef Slowik likes to dissolve the 
                        barrier between host and guest, so 
                        please feel free to observe the 
                        cooks as they create.  We ask only 
                        one very small favor.  Please do 
                        not photograph our dishes.  Chef 
                        feels strongly that part of the 
                        beauty of his creations is 
                        precisely their ephemeral nature.

                                 MARGOT
                            (whispering to Craig)
                        Boy, she is some piece of work.

           Most seem wary about actually getting up and going into the 
           kitchen -- but not Craig.

                                 CRAIG
                        Here, come with.  Let’s not miss 
                        this.

           They rise, and, Craig leads Margot by the hand into the --

           KITCHEN

           -- where they watch the beautiful machine that is one of the 
           finest kitchens in the world.  COOKS OF ALL RANKS hunch over 
           their tasks -- more cooks, in fact, than diners.

           One SOUS-CHEF spoons a cold, snow-like powder into a bowl.

                                 CRAIG (CONT’D)
                        Hi.  So, do you make that with a 
                        Pacojet?

                                 SOUS-CHEF
                        Exactly right, sir.

                                 CRAIG
                            (to Margot)
                        A Pacojet can powderize cold 
                        ingredients without thawing them.
                                 SOUS-CHEF
                        Gee, you really know your stuff, 
                        Mr. Spooner.

                                 CRAIG
                        You know my name?

                                 SOUS-CHEF
                        We like to know everyone who dines 
                        with us.  We even keep records of 
                        what you eat, so if you ever come 
                        back you won’t have the same thing.

                                 CRAIG
                        Amazing.

                                 SOUS-CHEF
                        Now why don’t you take your seat?

           Craig is unsure whether to feel offended until --

                                 SOUS-CHEF (CONT’D)
                        We’re about to serve.

                                 CRAIG
                        Yeah, okay.  Sure.

           LINDA still sits alone, idly playing with her empty wine 
           glass.  A cheery SOMMELIER approaches with a bottle.

                                 SOMMELIER
                        More Lambrusco, madam?

           CRAIG AND MARGOT take their seats.  

                                 CRAIG
                        I think this place even beats 
                        Azurmendi in the Basque country.  The 
                        attention to detail is just -- Shit, 
                        there he is.

           Craig and Margot look toward the kitchen, where they and we 
           get our first glimpse of the man himself.

           CHEF JULIAN SLOWIK

           is 50ish, brooding, intense.  Utterly focused, he glides 
           swiftly from station to station, tasting dish after dish.  

           Spoon to mouth, he glances over and scans the faces of 
           tonight’s guests, his eyes eventually falling upon Margot, who 
           is staring back at him.  
           They lock eyes.  In that moment the great chef and his guest 
           share a type of recognition -- a sadness perhaps?  A longing?  
           Chef tersely breaks eye contact and resumes his tasks.

           SERVERS appear at once in the dining room and fan out in

                        This is a pine-nut tuile cone 
                        filled with a Shuksan strawberry 
                        sofrito and a goat’s milk snow.  
                        Enjoy.

                        obsession with cones?

                        It’s like a pandemic.  No one is 
                        immune.  

           Craig holds his cone just so and furtively snaps a photo.  He 
           will do this with every dish.

                                 MARGOT
                        Craig, they specifically asked us 
                        not to do that.

                                 CRAIG
                        Yeah, but, you know, we’re paying 
                        $725 apiece.  I won’t post them. 
                            (then)
                        Tonight.

           He pops the cone into his mouth and closes his eyes.

                        You’re funny.
           Margot’s gaze falls on the WINDOW, where she sees the BOAT 
           leaving the dock and sailing away into the twilight.  She 
           watches longingly, wishing she were on it.

                                 TITLE CARD AGAINST BLACK:

                                      FIRST COURSE

           CLOSE on Chef as he inspects the food.  He tastes something, 
           closes his eyes and keeps them closed long after swallowing, 
           as though in contemplation.  Then he opens them.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Okay.  

           We follow Chef into the dining room, where he takes a stance, 
           raises his hands and CLAPS.  Once, loud.  All conversations 
           stop.  His staff stops.  Everything stops.  

           Chef Slowik stares at his diners, smiling tightly.  It’s 
           clear that this is his show.  Everything revolves around him, 
           the all-powerful sun in this solar system.  

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        Welcome to Hawthorn.  I am Julian 
                        Slowik.  And tonight it will be our 
                        pleasure to feed you.

           The diners dutifully, nervously applaud.  Ted Bloom and 
           Gretchen exchange self-satisfied looks.  Margot scrunches her 
           face and smiles, playing begrudgingly along.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        Over the next few hours, you will 
                        ingest fat, salt, sugar, protein, 
                        bacteria, fungi, various plants and 
                        animals -- at times entire eco-
                        systems -- at a brisk but fair 
                        pace.  We hope you find it musical, 
                        actually.  But I wonder if you 
                        could all do one thing for me.  
                            (dramatic pause)
                        Do not eat.

           The patrons look amused, if confused -- especially the movie 
           star, who furrows his brow in mock alarm at Felicity.  Ted 
           Bloom smiles knowingly.  Craig laps it all up.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        Taste.  Savor.  Relish.  Consider 
                        every morsel you place in your 
                        mouth and stomach.  Be mindful.  
                        But do not eat.  Our menu tonight 
                        is far too precious.
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                            (then)
                        Some of you may have noticed the 
                        presence of a camera crew. 

           We see a hipster-ish three-person CAMERA CREW near the 
           kitchen, filming them all at this very moment.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        They will film us tonight for a 
                        documentary.  No, nothing as 
                        pedestrian and bourgeois as “Chef’s 
                        Table.”  They are here only to 
                        document.  And a crucial document 
                        it will be.

           We see Chef from the MONITOR of the handheld camera, looking 
           directly at us.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        They have promised not to intrude 
                        upon your dining experience.  I 
                        take that promise very seriously.

           The crew exchange nervous looks but offer reassuring nods.  
           Chef turns again to the diners.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        Open your eyes.  Look around you.  
                        Breathe deeply.  Accept.  Accept 
                        all of it.  Forgive.  This is what 
                        the right food can help you do.  
                        And on that note...
                            (smiles)
                        Food!

           Servers fan out in perfect formation carrying exquisitely 
           manicured plates.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        Our first course is called “The 
                        Island.”

           One of the plates lands on a table in a gorgeous, slow-motion 
           CU product shot.  Perfectly curated bits of flora and jewels 
           of clam meat rest artfully atop a smooth, icy rock. 

           A SUPERIMPOSED TITLE reads, “THE ISLAND.  Foraged plants, 
           manila clam, seawater.”  

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        On your plate are various plants 
                        from the island.  They’ve been 
                        placed on rocks from the shore 
                        covered in barely-frozen seawater.
                                 CRAIG
                        Are these the same clams the guy 
                        was fishing for outside?

           Rather than fielding a perfectly honest question from a 
           valued diner, Chef stares at Craig with a withering glare.

                                 CRAIG (CONT’D)
                        Oh.  Sorry if I interrupted... you.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Perfectly all right.  And yes, they 
                        are those very same clams.
                            (back to the group)
                        Here is what you must remember 
                        about this dish as you...eat.  We, 
                        the people currently on the island, 
                        are not important.  The island and 
                        the nutrients it provides exist in 
                        their most perfect state without 
                        our gathering them, manipulating 
                        them or digesting them.  What 
                        happens in this room is meaningless 
                        compared to what occurs outside, in 
                        the soil and the water and the air.  
                        This dish is a testament to 
                        nature’s perfection and our own 
                        irrelevance within it.  We are but 
                        a frightened nanosecond.  Nature is 
                        timeless, eternal.  
                            (warm smile)
                        Enjoy!

           He retreats into the kitchen.  Margot arches an eyebrow at 
           the pomposity.

                                 MARGOT
                        Cheery thought.  
                            (noticing)
                        Hey.  Are you crying?

                                 CRAIG
                        Sorry.  I... I just think it’s all 
                        so beautiful.  To be in the presence 
                        of... true beauty... and true 
                        genius.  I just wish I... Oh, well.  

           He quickly wipes his eye before sliding his phone out of his 
           pocket for another photo.  Margot stares at him. 

                                 CRAIG (CONT’D)
                        It’s almost too stunning to eat.
                                 MARGOT
                        Oh, I agree.  I would happily not 
                        eat it.

           She pokes perfunctorily at the weird sea life on her plate 
           and drops her fork.   

                                 CRAIG
                        Can you please just try to enjoy 
                        it? 

                                 MARGOT
                        I can’t make a joke?

                                 CRAIG
                        Of course, a joke, sure.  But could 
                        you please at least just allow me 
                        to feel how I feel?  And be in the 
                        moment?  I mean, it’s like being at 
                        the Louvre.

                                 MARGOT
                        No, Craig, being at the Louvre is 
                        like being at the Louvre.  This is 
                        like being in Alcatraz.  For rich 
                        people.  

           She holds up a big forkful of wet seaweed. 

                                 MARGOT (CONT’D)
                        I mean, come on.  What in the hell 
                        is happening with this?

           Margot means it to be funny, but Craig takes her sarcasm as 
           an attack.

                                 CRAIG
                        Please, Margot.  I don’t want to get 
                        sucked into another fight right now. 

           The sommelier slides up, seemingly out of thin air.

                                 SOMMELIER
                        And to pair, from our friends at 
                        Isabelle et Denis, a premier cru 
                        Chablis from 2011.  Not just single 
                        vineyard but a single row of --

                                 MARGOT
                        Sorry, not now.  We’re fighting.

                                 CRAIG
                        No, we’re not.
                                 MARGOT
                        Yes, we are.

                                 SOMMELIER
                            (finishing the pour)
                        Happy anniversary!

           The MOVIE STAR and FELICITY stare at their perfect plates.  
           Neither lifts a fork.

                                 MOVIE STAR
                        So, like, he meant literally don’t 
                        eat?

                                 FELICITY
                        I think he meant it figuratively.  
                        Don’t just stuff your face.  Really 
                        think about it first.  Or 
                        something.

                                 MOVIE STAR
                        Right.  So just to be clear, I am 
                        eating this now?

                                 FELICITY
                        Yes.

                                 MOVIE STAR
                        Lovely.

           TED BLOOM AND GRETCHEN dine with pure ecstasy.

                                 GRETCHEN
                        Astonishing.

                                 TED BLOOM
                        He always pays homage to the sea 
                        around us, but I’ve never tasted 
                        anything so clean, so utterly... 
                        thalassic.

                                 GRETCHEN
                        Thalassic?

                                 TED BLOOM
                        Oceanic.  From the Greek.  Thalassa 
                        was the primeval spirit of the sea. 
                        Slowik is essentially allowing us 
                        to actually eat the ocean.

                                 GRETCHEN
                        We’re eating the ocean.

                        We’re eating the ocean.

           RICHARD AND ANNE sit eating silently like two live corpses.  
           They could just as well be eating prime rib at a casino.

           AND THE TECH BROS are in fact purely eating and drinking, not 
           even looking at their plates as they talk.

                                 TECH BRO #1
                        ... and the cloud space is only 
                        getting crazier.  Everyone scales 
                        up, and their OPEX budgets grow, 
                        and, if we’re smart, that’s where 
                        we’ve got to capitalize.

                                 TECH BRO #4
                        But that’s my fucking point.  
                        You’re literally making my fucking 
                        point for me.

                                 TECH BRO #2

                                 TECH BRO #3
                        To be honest, the plating’s a little 
                        frou-frou for my taste.  And I’ve 
                        had shellfish just as good at 
                        Kashiba, or even with my chef at 
                        home.  But whatever.  Now we can say 
                        we’ve been here.  As my dad used to 
                        say, “We’re buying an experience.”  

           ELSA stands against the wall near the tech bros, eying them -- 
           all the diners, really -- with utter contempt.

           CRAIG eats, still annoyed.  Margot picks idly at her food.

           THE KITCHEN teems as the next course is prepared.  Chef 
           steals a glance at Margot, noting with concern her tense 
           posture and nearly-full plate.  Then he sees Craig extending 
           his fork toward hers.  Chef is disgusted but shakes it off.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Plating in five!

           All stand suddenly upright like soldiers, turn to face him, 
           and answer in unison.
                                 ENTIRE KITCHEN
                        Yes, Chef!

           Chef looks directly into CAMERA, irritated.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Excuse me?  Orson Fucking Welles?  
                            (pointing)
                        On the plate.

           The camera crew, who have been filming Slowik, turn the lens 
           to a sous-chef.

                                 CAMERAMAN
                        Sorry.

           EXT. HAWTHORN ISLAND - TWILIGHT

           Darkness descends.  We see the restaurant from afar, bay 
           windows aglow with warm light.  But out here, amid the water 
           and trees, all is quiet save for the lonesome, distant call 
           of a loon.

           INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Margot and Craig look silently at each other.

                                 MARGOT
                        Say something.

                                 CRAIG
                        I don’t know what to say, Margot.  
                        Seems like anything I say is wrong.  

           Chef Slowik enters again and CLAPS.  He waits in silence a 
           few moments.  Too many moments.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Bread has existed in some form for 
                        over 12,000 years and in every 
                        culture of the world, in particular 
                        among the poor.  Flour and water.  
                        What could be simpler?  Even today, 
                        grain represents 65% of all 
                        agriculture.  Fruits and vegetables?  
                        Only 6%.

                        Ancient Greek peasants dipped their 
                        stale, measly bread in wine for 
                        breakfast.  It is, and has always 
                        been, the food of the common man.  
                        But you, my dear guests, are not the 
                        common man.  Thus, tonight you do 
                        not get bread.

           Margot shakes her head.  You’ve got to be kidding. 

           Servers place SHALE PLATES on the tables, along with a lovely 
           NOTE on parchment.  Where there would normally be bread is an 
           empty space surrounded by condiments -- creams, pickles, 
           butters.  Another gorgeous slow-motion CU.  

           A SUPERIMPOSED TITLE reads, “BREADLESS BREAD PLATE: no bread, 
           savory accompaniments.”

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        In this spirit, please enjoy the 
                        unaccompanied accompaniments.

           The MOVIE STAR looks at his plate and smiles.

                                 MOVIE STAR
                        Is he fucking serious?

                                 FELICITY
                        I guess so.  Kind of a cute 
                        gimmick, if you ask me.

                            (starts eating)
                        I will say, though, the shit around 
                        the total absence of bread is quite 
                        nice.

           TECH BRO #4 reads the parchment note.

                        “The bread you will not be allowed 
                        to consume tonight is made from a 
                        heritage wheat called red fife,

           TED BLOOM AND GRETCHEN chuckle.

                        What a wickedly clever conceit. 
                        Slowik is famous for his bread.

                        tonight no bread?  

                                 GRETCHEN
                        Outrageous.

                                 TED BLOOM
                        Fiendish.  He’s always been keenly 
                        aware of food as a history of class 
                        while still preserving his sense of 
                        the delicious.
                            (poking at a sauce)
                        Although I will say the emulsion 
                        here does look slightly broken.

                                 GRETCHEN
                        I was just thinking the same thing.

                                 TED BLOOM
                        And you really --
                            (whispers)
                        You really shouldn’t see that in a 
                        restaurant of this quality.  I’m 
                        frankly surprised.
                            (jotting a note)
                        Minor quibble.  But there it is.

           Chef Slowik sees this and smiles.  

           Now CRAIG AND MARGOT. 

                                 CRAIG
                        See, he always weaves allegories 
                        into his food.  The game is trying 
                        to get what the over-arching theme 
                        of the entire meal is going to be.  
                        I read that you can’t really tell 
                        until the very last course, and 
                        then you can sort of piece it all 
                        together in hindsight.

           Margot watches him snap another photo before digging in.  

           She wishes she could partake in Craig’s fascination, his 
           little foodie hobby, but she feels a million miles away.  She 
           smiles faintly with acceptance of that’s just how things are.  
           Her anger toward him, at least for now, dissolves into pity.

                                 CRAIG (CONT’D)
                        You should try these things.  One 
                        tastes better than the next.
                                 MARGOT
                        I’m sorry, babe.  I’m just not that 
                        hungry.

                                 CRAIG
                        At least just taste everything.  
                        Put a little on your tongue.  

                                 MARGOT
                        I’m happy you’re happy, Craig, but 
                        I just don’t like this kind of 
                        food.  I’m sorry, I don’t get it.  
                        It’s all trying way too hard, and 
                        for what?  

                                 CRAIG
                        Honey it’s not just food -- it’s 
                        art.  You could say the same thing 
                        about any medium.  I think part of 
                        you attacks it just because I like 
                        it appreciate it so much.

                                 MARGOT
                        That’s not true.  I’m happy you 
                        like it.  And you know I don’t have 
                        an appetite when we argue.  I get 
                        so fucking anxious...
                            (tearing up)
                        ...and sad.  

           First glancing around, Craig leans over and rubs her arm.

                                 CRAIG
                        Margot, Margot, sweetheart.  Please 
                        don’t cry.  I’m sorry.  I’ve told 
                        you a hundred times I’m sorry.

                                 MARGOT
                        What are you sorry for?

                                 CRAIG
                        You know... everything.  Well, not 
                        everything.  But, you know, 
                        everything we’ve been through and 
                        been talking about and dealing with 
                        these last couple of months.  
                        Everything we’ve been sharing with 
                        Dr. Gertler.

                                 MARGOT
                        I don’t think you really even know 
                        what you should be sorry for. 
                                 CRAIG
                        And you know I’m sorry about that, 
                        too.  I want to be more aware.  I’m 
                        really trying to listen now. 

                                 MARGOT
                        But, Craig, here’s the thing.  I 
                        don’t even know any more what you 
                        should be sorry about. 

                                 CRAIG
                        Please.  I hate seeing you cry.

                                 MARGOT
                        You just don’t want people to stare 
                        at us.

           Indeed, Ted Bloom and Gretchen are glancing over, and Craig’s 
           mortified about it.  But he hides it with a smile before 
           turning back to Margot.

                                 CRAIG
                        It’s our anniversary, for Christ’s 
                        sake, and this opportunity tonight 
                        is maybe once in a lifetime.  Let’s 
                        treat ourselves and forget 
                        everything else, you know, roll 
                        back the clock.  Just tonight.  
                        Please eat.  I’m serious, honey.  
                        Please just eat.  This is 
                        humiliating.

           Margot blows her nose into her napkin.

                        This is all clever and funny and 
                        whatever, but -- Okay, I really 
                        don’t want to play this card, but 
                        you know who we are, right?

                                 ELSA

                        Yes, I know who you are.

                        on the same team.  Just bring us a

                                 ELSA
                        I said no.  Yes.  

                                 TECH BRO #1
                        Okay.  Wow.
           Elsa leans in to speak in a menacing whisper.

                                 ELSA
                        You will eat less than you desire 
                        and more than you deserve.

           She spins and walks away, passing --

           MARGOT AND CRAIG’S TABLE.

                                 CRAIG
                        So if you really don’t want to eat 
                        it, fine.  I’ll have it.

           Rather than extending his fork, Craig reaches over and picks 
           up her entire plate to exchange it with his own.  He tries to 
           do it carefully but can’t help bumping a wine glass with his 
           elbow.  It SHATTERS on the ground.

           Two servers materialize to clean up the shards.  Craig 
           apologizes profusely, and they reassure him it’s all right.   

           Margot watches her husband as he fumbles.  We see she still 
           has sympathy for this man.  But respect?  Attraction?

           Now Craig spots Chef Slowik marching over and soon towering 
           above their table.

                                 CRAIG (CONT’D)
                            (tail between legs)
                        Sorry for the disturbance.  Total 
                        accident.

           Chef ignores him, focuses solely on Margot.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        You haven’t touched your food.

                                 MARGOT
                        Yeah, sorry.  Guess I don’t want to 
                        fill up early.  

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        That would not be possible.  I’ve 
                        precisely designed the portions to 
                        account for that.  Please eat.  The 
                        menu makes sense only if you eat.

                                 MARGOT
                        But you told us not to eat.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        This is not what I meant, and you 
                        know it.
                                 MARGOT
                        Thank you, but I’ll eat what I want 
                        to eat.  And when I want to eat.

           Chef half-smiles and half-grimaces.  No one talks to him like 
           this.  He walks away.  Craig is even more mortified.

                                 CRAIG
                        Well, that was humiliating.

                                 MARGOT
                        I’m not humiliated.  That guy’s a 
                        prick.

           AT LINDA’S TABLE.  There is no food on her table, only wine.  
           Chef kneels at her side and gently takes her hand in his.  
           She looks at him with glazed, wounded eyes.  He smiles at her 
           with deep understanding.  She weakly smiles back.  Chef 
           kisses her forehead, rises and heads back into --

           THE KITCHEN

           -- where he looks at his watch.

           EXT. HAWTHORN ISLAND - NIGHT

           Tall, spindly evergreens shiver in the cold darkness.

           VERY CLOSE on an OWL on a limb.  Its glassy eyes scan the 
           island floor until, spotting something, it takes flight.

           INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Richard and Anne sit across from each other.  No eye contact, 
           silent, a still life.  PAN to Craig and Margot, also silent, 
           no eye contact.

                            (arriving)
                        This is a 2009 Valpolicella 
                        Classico Superiore from Tommaso 
                        Bussola, which we’ve hyper-decanted 
                        with an immersion blender.  
                        Slavonian oak.  Rich cherry and 
                        tobacco.  Faint notes of longing 
                        and regret. 

           Chef Slowik’s CLAP.  All heads swivel toward him.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        The next course is called “Memory.”  
                        That’s what it’s meant to evoke -- 
                        a memory.  Let me tell you one of 
                        mine.  When I was a child growing 
                        up in Waterloo, Iowa, Tuesday was 
                        taco night.  Taco Tuesday!
                            (a hand on Linda’s 
                              shoulder)
                        This is my mother.  As you can see, 
                        she is quite drunk.  When I was 
                        seven years old, one Tuesday my 
                        father came home, also quite drunk.  
                        Not unusual.  Mother grew angry and 
                        screamed at him.  At which point he 
                        proceeded to wrap a telephone cord 
                        around her neck and pull it tight.  
                        I wept.  I wept very hard and 
                        begged him to stop.  He ignored me.  
                        To make him stop, I finally had to 
                        stab him in the thigh with kitchen 
                        scissors.  You remember that, 
                        mother, don’t you?

           Linda reacts vaguely, continues drinking.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        We thought he might leave us for 
                        good.  But he stayed in our home.  
                        And from that point forward, and 
                        until his death, we never exchanged 
                        a single word to each other.  His 
                        mere presence brought unspeakable 
                        agony.  I should have stabbed him 
                        in his fucking throat that evening!

           The diners exchange uneasy glances.  This is getting weird.  
           Margot, however, watches Chef intently and with empathy, 
           somehow understanding his pain.  Noticing, Chef says the next 
           line directly to her.
                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        It was, as you can imagine, a very 
                        memorable taco night.  

           Servers appear and somberly distribute plates fashioned of 
           tightly coiled telephone cords, as well as bowls of 
           tortillas.  Atop the plates are chicken thighs with tiny 
           scissors sticking out of them.

           A SUPERIMPOSED TITLE reads: “MEMORY.  Chicken thighs al 
           pastor, smoked pineapple salsa, tortillas.”

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        You have house-smoked Bresse 
                        chicken thighs al pastor and our 
                        own tortillas made with heirloom 
                        corn masa from Masoned.  Images on 
                        the tortillas have been made using 
                        a computer-controlled laser cutting 
                        and engraving machine.  We hope 
                        this taco night evokes pungent 
                        memories for us all.  
                            (warm smile)
                        Enjoy.

           At Richard and Anne’s table, they have way more tortillas 
           than anyone else.  Anne peeks at the tortilla on top.  It 
           reads, “Welcome back, Mr. and Mrs. Liebrandt.”  

           All the subsequent tortillas show Richard and Anne sitting 
           across from one another like corpses.  The only thing

                                 CRAIG
                        They’re all... from tonight.
                        Shit. 

           Margot looks.  Each shows Craig sneaking photos of the food.

                                 MARGOT
                        Jesus.  What’s with this guy?  This 
                        means they’ve been photographing us 
                        the whole night.
           They look around to see where the cameras might be.  Feeling 
           busted, Craig starts to panic.

                                 CRAIG
                        Goddammit.  First the wine glass.  
                        Now this.  He must hate me.  Do you 
                        think I should apologize?  I think 
                        I should go apologize.    

                                 MARGOT
                        They’re the ones who should 
                        apologize.  We’re sending it back.

           Margot turns to wave a server over.  Craig snaps his fingers.

                                 CRAIG
                        Hey.  Hey!  Margot!

                                 MARGOT
                        Did you just snap your fingers at 
                        me?

                                 CRAIG
                        Are you out of your mind?  You don’t 
                        send shit back here.  You thank them 
                        for even letting us in the door.

           Craig folds a tortilla, constructs a taco and takes a bite.  
           His rage and humiliation begin to dissipate.

                                 CRAIG (CONT’D)
                        Fuck.
                            (chewing)
                        This is incredible.  Oh, my God.  
                        You have to try this.

           Incredulous, Margot throws down her napkin down and gets up.

           INT. SIDE HALLWAY 

           En route to the ladies’ room, Margot stops at a stunning 
           SILVER DOOR molded in an ornate floral pattern, like a museum 
           piece.  She reaches for the handle.

                                 ELSA
                        Can I help you, madam?

           Margot turns to see a disapproving Elsa.

                                 MARGOT
                        I’m looking for the little girls’ 
                        room.
                                 ELSA
                            (nostrils flaring)
                        Down the hall, to your right.

                                 MARGOT
                        What’s behind this door?

                                 ELSA
                        Dessert.

           INT. LADIES’ ROOM - NIGHT

           Margot enters the dim, minimally-decorated room and locks the 
           door.  She pauses, breathing a little heavily with 
           exasperation over the entire night.  It’s nice to be alone. 

           She gets a cigarette from her purse, cracks a tiny window and 
           lights up.  She gazes at an artsy framed photo on the wall of 
           a marshmallow roasting on a campfire.

           Suddenly the lock turns on the door.  Margot flicks the 
           cigarette out the window.  CHEF SLOWIK ENTERS.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK 
                        What are you doing here?

                                 MARGOT
                        It’s... the ladies’ room.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        I mean here on this island, you 
                        little fool.  You’re not supposed 
                        to be here.

                                 MARGOT
                        What do you mean “not supposed to 
                        be here?”  We have reservations.

           He takes slow, deliberate steps toward her.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        We did not prepare for you. 

                                 MARGOT
                        What does that mean?

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        My guests are eaters.  They eat and 
                        eat and eat and eat until they 
                        convince themselves that they are 
                        no longer hungry, that they are 
                        full.  But not you.  You’re ruining 
                        everything.
                                 MARGOT
                        Um... I’m sorry.  I just don’t have 
                        much of an appetite tonight.  What 
                        do you want me to -- ?

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        I can see you.  You’re starved.  I 
                        know you are.  Starved.  Because so 
                        am I.  But tonight I will be sated.  
                        And you will not stand in the way.  
                        And if you wish, you may be sated, 
                        too.

           They exchange a long, weirdly intimate look.

           He exits.  ON MARGOT -- what the fuck was that?

           INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           She returns to the table.

                                 MARGOT
                        That’s it.  We’re fucking out of here.

                                 CRAIG
                        What?

                                 MARGOT
                        We need to go.  We’re leaving.

                                 CRAIG
                        Leave?  We can’t.

                                 MARGOT
                        You do what you want.  I’m gone.

                                 CRAIG
                        We’re on an island.

           She stares at him.  He’s right.

                                 MARGOT
                        He walked in on me in the bathroom, 
                        Craig.  Confronted me.

                                 CRAIG
                        Who did?

                                 MARGOT
                        The fucking chef. 
                                 CRAIG
                            (blinks)
                        Why would he do that?  
                            (pointing)
                        Look, what are you talking about, 
                        he’s right there.  What kind of 
                        scene are you trying to cause now?  
                            (smelling)
                        Were you smoking again?

           THE TECH BROS

                                 TECH BRO #1
                        I don’t like the feel of this.  At 
                        all.  I want out of here.

                                 TECH BRO #2
                        Dude, chill.  It’s a fucking taco.

                                 TECH BRO #1
                        A fucking taco that would hold up 
                        in court.

                                 TECH BRO #3
                        All four of us have plausible 
                        deniability.  It’s not like we’re 
                        that high up the food chain anyway.  
                        If they turn us in, then we --

                                 TECH BRO #2
                        Right.  If they turn us in, then 
                        they’re turning Verrick in.  And 
                        then they’re just as fucked as we 
                        are.  We’re fine.  Hey.  We’re 
                        fine.  
                            (unsure)
                        Right?

           Uncertain, they sit silently with this thought.  Then, 
           shrugging their shoulders, they make tacos.

                                      Fourth Course

           The patrons watch two servers methodically unrolling a TARP 
           across the middle of the floor and smoothing out all the 
           wrinkles.  Other servers arrive with decorative baskets and 
           cover the tarp with sea fennel and edible flowers.  

                                 TED BLOOM
                        Never seen anything like it, not 
                        even when I ate here before.
                        It’s like theater.
                                 GRETCHEN
                        I was going to say.  Very 
                        theatrical.  And minimalist, like 
                        in the Japanese minimirasuto style.

           Chef enters.  CLAP!

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        We are ready for our next course, 
                        which I think you’ll find --

                                 TECH BRO #2
                            (rising to his feet)
                        Excuse me.  But just what the fuck 
                        is going on here?

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Glad you asked.  Elsa?

           Elsa walks over, rears back and PUNCHES HIM.  Hard.  She then 
           calmly re-folds his napkin and places it back on the table.

           Shock.  The first hint of real violence.  No one dares speak as 
           Tech Bro #2 writhes in pain, bleeding at the mouth.  Elsa 
           flashes a small sadistic smile.  She’s been wanting to do that.

                        Craig!

           But Craig has no answers.  

           The shocked guests now officially know they’re into something 
           bad.  Only Linda remains impervious.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Thank you, Elsa.  Ladies and 
                        gentlemen, meet sous-chef Jeremy 
                        Loucks.

           A chef around thirty strides out of the kitchen and stands in 
           the middle of the tarp.  He stares straight ahead, stoic.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        Jeremy created the next dish.  It’s 
                        called “The Mess.”  Jeremy, may I 
                        explain “The Mess?”

                                 JEREMY
                        Yes, Chef.
                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Originally from Sparks, Nevada, 
                        Jeremy graduated from the Culinary 
                        Institute of America in Hyde Park.  
                        Jeremy’s goal, as he wrote in a 
                        heartfelt letter, was to work for 
                        me here at Hawthorn.  Isn’t that 
                        right, Jeremy?

                                 JEREMY
                        Yes, Chef.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Jeremy is talented.  He’s good.  
                        He’s very good.  But he’s not great.  
                        He will never be great.  He 
                        desperately wants my job, my 
                        position, my prestige, my status. My 
                        talent.  Isn’t that right, Jeremy?

                                 JEREMY
                        Yes, Chef. 

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Jeremy has forsaken everything to 
                        try to achieve that.  He works so 
                        hard, so very hard.  He works 
                        twenty hours a day.  He has no time 
                        for friends.  No time for family.  
                        He can’t even go to the park or see 
                        a movie or stop at the bank.  
                        Jeremy, when’s the last time you 
                        talked to your mother?

                                 JEREMY
                        I don’t remember, Chef.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        His entire life is service and 
                        pressure.  Pressure to put out the 
                        best food in the world.  Pressure to 
                        please his Chef.  Pressure to please 
                        the customers.  Pressure to please 
                        the critics.  And even when all goes 
                        right, and the food is perfect, and 
                        the customers are happy, and the 
                        critics are too, there is no way to 
                        avoid The Mess.

                        increasingly care nothing about.  
                        Jeremy, do you like your life, this 
                        life you dreamed about?

                                 JEREMY
                        No, Chef.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Do you like my life, the life you 
                        envy?

           His forehead beaded with sweat, Jeremy looks at Chef Slowik.  
           He wasn’t expecting this question.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay.  You can answer.  Do you 
                        like my life?  Not my position.  Not 
                        my prestige or my talent.  My life.  

                                 JEREMY
                            (tears in his eyes)
                        No, Chef. 

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Ladies and gentlemen, your fourth 
                        course.  Sous-chef Jeremy’s Mess.

           Chef takes a step back.  Jeremy removes a pistol from the 
           back waistband of his apron and blows his brains out.

           Everyone shrieks as blood splatters on the walls and the 
           floor and on their faces -- including on Linda, who continues 
           to drink, unfazed.  Jeremy falls backwards.  

           Servers rush over and, with practiced efficiency, roll up the 
           tarp with Jeremy’s body inside.  

           Other servers approach tables with perfectly-folded moist 
           washcloths so diners can wipe their faces.

           Still other servers fan out with plates for the tables.  A 
           SUPERIMPOSED TITLE reads, “THE MESS.  Pressure-cooked beef, 
           bone broth, heirloom carrots and potatoes.  R.I.P. Jeremy 
           Loucks, 1988-2020.”

           Panicked and screaming, many diners rise from their seats and 
           run toward the door.  Servers and cooks rush out from the 
           kitchen to block their way. 
           The horrified documentary crew have stopped filming.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        Film.  Film!  What will you ever 
                        shoot in your lives better than 
                        this?

                                 TECH BRO #3
                            (to no one in particular)
                        Is this real?  Is this real?

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Please.  Please.  Sit.  Make 
                        yourselves at home.  Everything’s 
                        fine.  All part of the menu.  All 
                        part of the show.

           He casually strides back into the kitchen.  Scared diners 
           hesitantly return to their seats. 

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        Fifth course, on order!

                                 ENTIRE KITCHEN 
                        Yes, Chef!

           CRAIG AND MARGOT, faces still splattered, haven’t moved.  

                                 MARGOT
                        Craig, what’s -- what’s happening?  
                        What’s happening?

                                 CRAIG
                        I don’t know.

           The sommelier sashays up, cheery and helpful as ever.

                                 SOMMELIER
                        This is a biodynamic Cabernet 
                        Franc/Gamay blend from our friends 
                        at Clos de l’Elu in the Loire 
                        Valley.  No added sulfites.  A bit 
                        of barnyard funk, but a wonderful 
                        match with braised proteins.  

           RICHARD AND ANNE

                                 RICHARD
                        We’re leaving.  Now.

                                 ANNE
                        My -- my coat.
                                 RICHARD
                        Forget your coat.  Get up!

           They rush to the front door, but Elsa stands in their way.  
           Everyone else watches to see how this goes.

                                 ELSA
                        Is something wrong?

                                 RICHARD
                        Get out of our way.  We’re leaving.

                                 ELSA
                        There is no boat to leave on.

                                 RICHARD
                        Then I’ll call a helicopter.  

                                 ELSA
                        That will be difficult without 
                        phone service.

                                 RICHARD
                        Get the fuck out of our way!

           Richard tries to push past her when two cooks appear wielding 
           meat cleavers. 

                                 ANNE
                        Oh, Jesus.  Richard, just do what 
                        they say, for God’s sake.

                                 RICHARD
                        Let me handle this.  I’ll handle 
                        this.

                                 ELSA
                        With which hand?

                                 RICHARD
                        What?

                                 ELSA
                        With which hand will you “handle” 
                        this, Mr. Liebrandt?  Your left or 
                        your right?

                                 RICHARD
                        What are you saying, you bitch?

                                 ELSA
                        Shall we choose?
                                 RICHARD
                        Choose what?

                                 ELSA
                        Very well.  Left hand.  Ring 
                        finger.

           A cook grabs Richard and forces his left hand onto a table.  
           The other one tries to aim, but Richard squirms.

                                 ELSA (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Liebrandt, please hold still.

           He looks at her for split second and freezes, giving the cook 
           the opening to chop his finger off.  Everyone screams.

                                 ELSA (CONT’D)
                            (to the room)
                        You try to leave, you lose an 
                        appendage.  Questions?

           A petrified MOVIE STAR AND FELICITY watch the chaos.

                                 MOVIE STAR
                        This is happening, then?

                                 FELICITY
                        I think so.

                                 MOVIE STAR
                        Right.  Brilliant.  Thanks for 
                        bringing me.  You’re such a good 
                        assistant.  I’m giving you a raise.

           RICHARD writhes in pain on the floor.  Two servers gently 
           wrap a linen napkin around his bleeding stump and tie it with 
           decorative ribbon.  Elsa picks up his finger from the table, 
           slides the wedding ring off and offers it to Anne.

                                 ELSA
                        Your husband’s ring, madam.  

                                 ANNE
                            (in a daze)
                        Thank you.

           TED BLOOM watches incredulously.  This can’t be real, right?

                                 TED BLOOM
                        Yes... yes... it might all be a 
                        show just for our benefit.  Just 
                        for us.  He’s never been above 
                        stunts.  That’s why he texted me.  
                        This is incredible.  
                                 GRETCHEN
                        It’s excellent.  Performance art.  
                        Like one of those mystery dinner-
                        theater things -- 

                                 TED BLOOM
                        -- but at an exceedingly high 
                        level.  Amazing.  

                                 GRETCHEN
                        Very Antonin Artaud.  The actors 
                        are so convincing.

           MARGOT AND CRAIG are shaking, confused.  Still, Craig lifts a 
           trembling fork to his mouth.  He’s almost enjoying it.

                                 MARGOT

                            (approaching)
                        Mrs. Spooner, please join Chef 
                        Slowik in the kitchen.

                                 MARGOT
                        What?

                                 ELSA
                        Chef would like you to join him in 
                        the kitchen.  Right now.  Please.

                                 CRAIG
                        Can I come, too?

                                 ELSA
                        No.

           Craig watches helplessly as Margot follows Elsa toward the 
           kitchen.  COOKS WITH KNIVES guard the kitchen entrance, but 
           Elsa waves them aside.

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           A scared but brave Margot stands face to face with Chef.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        I won’t have it.  You are ruining 
                        my menu. So I ask you again: Why 
                        are you here?

                                 MARGOT
                        Why are you doing this?

                        Do not answer my question with a 
                        quest--  Look, you do not meet my 
                        requirements.  You are supposed to 
                        be one half of a middle class 
                        foodie couple -- the doting wife 
                        who encourages her husband’s hobby, 
                        pathetically embracing it herself 
                        to bolster his happiness at the 
                        expense of her own.  That, and to 
                        eat some very good food.  Mrs. 
                        Spooner, where do you and... Bonzo 
                        come from?

                                 MARGOT
                        His name is Craig.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        And what do you do in Indianapolis?

           Pretty weird line of questioning, but she goes with it.

                                 MARGOT
                        Craig’s at Deloitte.  He’s a lawyer 
                        and CPA who specializes in tax and 
                        estate planning.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Not him.  You.

                                 MARGOT
                        Me?  I work in the office of

                        Development.

                        Oh, dear.  Do you have children?

                                 MARGOT
                        No.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Did you want to be here tonight?

                                 MARGOT
                        My husband’s been into food for 
                        years.

                        Pretty much all he talks about.  
                        And the bassoon.  He plays bassoon.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Jesus. Look, it’s you I care about.  
                        Answer for you.  Did you want to be 
                        here tonight?

                                 MARGOT
                        Why does it matter?

           Chef looks into her eyes, almost pitying her.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        This menu, this guest list, this 
                        entire evening has been 
                        painstakingly planned by myself and 
                        every member of the staff.  And we 
                        all have made a very large 
                        commitment.  It wasn’t easy to 
                        achieve.  And you, who have barely 
                        touched your food -- you are 
                        throwing everything off.  You don’t 
                        know how hard I’ve worked, how 
                        assiduously I’ve prepared.  It will 
                        be my single greatest achievement.  
                        All I asked was that you fit a 
                        certain archetype I have seen over 
                        and over in my restaurant.  But you 
                        do not, for you clearly do not wish 
                        to be here at all, or to be married 
                        to that thing.  That Craig, if 
                        that’s his name.  Craig.  

           He’s right, but she’s not about to give him a victory.

                                 MARGOT
                        That’s not true.  And he’s not a 
                        thing.  That man is my husband.  
                        And what did you say?  Archetype?  
                        We’re people, not fucking 
                        archetypes? 

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        They are.  Not you.  You are a 
                        smudge of grease on the rim of the 
                        plate, spoiling both the flavor 
                        balance and visual appeal of the 
                        dish.  But it’s all right.  The 
                        first lesson every good chef learns 
                        is what to do when the recipe 
                        fails.  You set out to make a 
                        perfect omelette, but something 
                        happens.  The stars do not align.

                        So you try to make perfect 
                        scrambled eggs.  Please help me.  
                        In order to proceed, I just need to 
                        know where to seat you, with us or 
                        with them?

                                 MARGOT
                        What do you mean, “with us or with 
                        them?”

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Answer the question.

                                 MARGOT
                        And then what, you’ll let us eat 
                        and leave?

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Oh, no.  We’re all going to die 
                        tonight.  
                            (to the kitchen)
                        Isn’t that right?

                                 ENTIRE KITCHEN
                        Yes, Chef!

           We see Margot realize more and more the horror of the whole 
           scene.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        So the question is, Margot Spooner, 
                        do you want to die with those who 
                        give?  Or with those who take?

                                 MARGOT
                        You’re fucking crazy.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        No, I am feeling quite well.  I’ve 
                        never felt calmer or clearer.

           This is chilling.  He believes it.  And the more Margot 
           starts to panic, the calmer and more comforting Chef grows.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        I understand a new and unsettling 
                        question like this takes time.

           He sets a KITCHEN TIMER.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
                        Fifteen minutes.  That is how long 
                        you have to decide.  Our side or 
                        theirs.

                        In the meantime, please return to 
                        your seat.  The next dish is --
                            (mocking, American accent)
                        -- super awesome.
                            (turning away, clapping)
                        Plating in five!

                                 ENTIRE KITCHEN
                        Yes, Chef!

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        I love you all.

                                 ENTIRE KITCHEN
                        We love you, Chef!

           Put yourself in her shoes.  Margot is thoroughly creeped out.  
           Mass psychosis.

           She turns to walk through the kitchen toward the dining room 
           and sees Elsa emerge from the SILVER DOOR with Linda, now so 
           drunk she must hang on Elsa’s arm. 

                                 LINDA
                        Thank you, Elsa.  For showing me.

                                 ELSA
                        My pleasure.

                                 LINDA
                        A beautiful room to die.

                                 ELSA
                        Yes.

           Elsa and Linda take a few steps. 

                                 LINDA
                        I couldn’t be a good mother.  I 
                        wanted to, but I couldn’t.

                                 ELSA
                        I understand.

                                 LINDA
                        He was a monster.

           THE DINING ROOM

           Margot returns to a wide-eyed Craig.

                                 CRAIG
                        What happened?  Did you get a 
                        kitchen course?
                                 MARGOT
                        A kitchen course? 

           What person in his right mind would react like that?  Maybe 
           something is really wrong.

                                 MARGOT (CONT’D)
                        Are you all right?  What’s the 
                        matter with you?  Don’t you see 
                        what’s going on?

           Chef Slowik enters the dining room and surveys the guests.   

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Thank you again for dining with us 
                        at Hawthorn and for taking a chance 
                        on our constantly changing menu.  
                        Nothing is as constant as change.  
                        The wisest among us know that, we 
                        who pay close attention to nature.  
                        Before we continue, are there any 
                        questions about me, or Hawthorn, or 
                        why none of us are getting out of 
                        here alive tonight?

           It’s the first time anyone but Margot has heard this news.  

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        Really?  No questions?

           All are hesitant to venture a question, all except --

                                 CRAIG
                        Was that star anise I detected in 
                        the stew?

                                 TECH BRO #2
                        That’s your question?

                                 CRAIG
                        I’m curious.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        And saffron, yes.  Exactly right.

           Margot looks at her husband as though he’s a victim in 
           “Invasion of the Body Snatchers.”  The terrified movie star 
           raises his hand.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        Actor man.  Yes?
                                 MOVIE STAR
                        I suppose I -- yes, I would like to 
                        know why this is happening.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Frankly it depends.  Some of you 
                        were chosen because of what you’ve 
                        done.

           We cut to Richard and Anne, to the techies, to Ted Bloom.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        Others because you’ve lived as 
                        complacent bystanders.  

           We cut to Gretchen and Felicity.  To Margot, too, to see how 
           she’s taking all this in.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
                        As Dr. King said, “In the end, we 
                        will remember not the words of our 
                        enemies, but the silence of our 
                        friends.”

           Did he really just quote Martin Luther King?

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        But this shouldn’t be a surprise to 
                        any of you.  Mr. Bloom -- Ted, if I 
                        may -- my cherished early advocate, 
                        knows the damage he has done to so 
                        many livelihoods.

                                 TED BLOOM
                        Now, wait a moment, Chef, I’ve been 
                        very --

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        YOU DON’T TALK!

           At that moment, a server approaches Ted Bloom and sets down a 
           comically LARGE NEW CONTAINER.

                                 SERVER
                        Your broken emulsion, sir.

           Ted Bloom stares at it.  How is this happening?  Chef turns to 
           the terrified CAMERA CREW to make sure they’re getting this, 
           wordlessly directing them for a better shot.  

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        What happens here tonight is 
                        nothing.  One day the real change 
                        is going to come.
           Elsa appears at Margot’s table, bends down and gestures to 
           the KITCHEN TIMER in her hand.  The texture of reality is 
           growing stranger by the moment.

                                 ELSA
                        Ten minutes, Mrs. Spooner.

                                 MARGOT
                            (to Chef)
                        I have a question.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Yes, Mrs. Spooner?

                                 CRAIG
                        Margot, be careful.

                                 MARGOT
                        Why do you deserve to die?

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Excellent question.  I deserve to 
                        die because I’ve wasted my life.  I 
                        thought I was an artist, but 
                        instead I see I’ve been slavishly 
                        trying to please people who can 
                        never be pleased -- starting with 
                        her.  
                            (his chin toward Linda)
                        Now, at the peak of my powers, all 
                        I see is that my food turns 
                        instantly to shit inside a rich 
                        man’s stomach.

                                 ELSA
                        And woman’s.

           Chef glares at Richard and Anne. 

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        You two.  How many times have you 
                        eaten here in the last five years?

                                 RICHARD
                        I don’t know, six or seven. 

                                 ANNE
                        I think more than that.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Eleven.  Eleven times.  Most people 
                        consider themselves blessed if they 
                        eat here only once.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT'D)
                        Mr. Liebrandt, name one dish you 
                        ate the last time you were here. 
                            (off Richard’s silence)
                        You can’t, can you?  Eleven times 
                        you take the boat, come out here, 
                        where we introduce every dish, 
                        every fucking time.  We tell you 
                        exactly what we are feeding you.  
                        And we tell you a story.  We even 
                        give you a copy of the fucking menu 
                        to take home.  So tell me one dish 
                        you ate the last time you were 
                        here.  One!

           Richard looks at Anne.

                        It wasn’t cod, you fucking donkey. 
                        It was halibut!  Rare fucking 
                        spotted halibut that we caught just 
                        four hours before you... you wasted 
                        it!  Why do you two even bother to 
                        come to my restaurant?  You come 
                        here just because you’re rich.   
                        WHY?  You come, you sit, you don’t 
                        talk, and you --

                        We have nothing else to do! 

           Silence.  That’s pretty sad and hangs in the air.  Margot 
           registers this on quite a few levels.

                                 TECH BRO #3
                        It’s not your restaurant.

                        You’re right.  He’s right.  It’s not 
                        mine.  Doug Verrick owns this island.

                        And seeing how this restaurant is my 
                        entire life, Doug Verrick owns me.  
                        All of which is complicated by the 
                        fact that I currently own Doug 
                        Verrick.

           Chef gestures to Elsa, who in turn gestures to TWO COOKS.  
           They open a pantry door and extract a man in his mid-50s, 
           gagged and tied to a spit rod like a roast pig.

           The tech bros stare, mouths agape.

                                 TECH BRO #2
                        Now we know why he wasn’t at the 
                        teleconference this morning.

           The cooks carry the spit rod into the center of the dining 
           room and hold it aloft before, at Chef’s nod, dropping it.  
           Doug Verrick lands with a thud and a groan.  

           Chef picks up Doug Verrick’s bandaged, FINGERLESS RIGHT HAND.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Doug Verrick lost the first finger 
                        due to Elsa’s no-escape rule.  Doug 
                        Verrick is a very determined man.  
                        That’s how he got to be Doug 
                        Verrick.  The thumb was punishment 
                        for how Doug Verrick questioned my 
                        menu.  He would even request 
                        substitutions even though --
                            (screaming into Doug 
                              Verrick’s face)
                        THERE ARE NO SUBSTITUTIONS AT 
                        HAWTHORN!!! 
                            (calm again)
                        This brings us to the other three 
                        fingers.  They were to get the 
                        information we printed on table 
                        four’s tortillas.  
                            (to the Tech Bros)
                        Did you enjoy your tacos, 
                        gentlemen?
                            (off their numb nods)
                        Doug Verrick will not live to see 
                        tomorrow, but his wife, his children 
                        and his empire will.  That is, until 
                        the SEC and FBI receive what I’ve 
                        sent them.

           Doug Verrick starts lunge-crawling toward the door.  It’s too 
           slow, and he has no chance.  It’s pathetic.  He gets as far 
           as Margot’s feet before the cooks drag him away.

                        Outside.  Loud followed by quiet, 
                        please.

           As Elsa unlocks the front door, the cooks hoist up Verrick 
           and carry him outside.  CAMERA creeps closer to Chef.

                        Quiet.

           Eyes closed, Chef listens a few more seconds.  Nothing.

                        Do you hear that silence?  Listen.
                        Can you hear it?  That silence 
                        means... I’m free.

           Close on MARGOT, motionless, struck by Chef’s utter serenity.

                                       FIFTH COURSE
           Margot and Craig sit silently, filled with dread.  The 
           sommelier brings little BLACK CUBES with straws.

                                 SOMMELIER
                        As you can see, our next pairing is 
                        literally in a black box.  Meaning 
                        I can’t tell you what it is.  
                        You’ll see when the food arrives.  
                        Have fun!

           Elsa walks by their table with the kitchen timer.

                                 ELSA
                        Five minutes, Mrs. Spooner.

           Margot tries her mystery wine.  Maybe it’s the booze, the 
           food, the fear, but for whatever reason she belches.

                                 MARGOT
                        Well, Craig, I’m not sure what’s 
                        coming out of that kitchen next, so 
                        should we exchange gifts?

           Craig looks at her quizzically.

                                 MARGOT (CONT’D)
                        I brought a gift for you.  For our 
                        anniversary.  Would you like it?

                                 CRAIG
                            (brightening a little)
                        I brought you a gift, too.

           He reaches into his pocket and slides over a jewelry box.  
           Margot opens it to find a silver necklace with a charm -- a 
           wooden heart.

                                 CRAIG (CONT’D)
                        The fifth anniversary is wood, so I 
                        looked for something with that 
                        theme.  It’s a necklace with a 
                        wooden heart.  The fifth is wood.  
                        I love you, Margot. 

           Margot looks at this half-assed gift and then up at Craig 
           softly, pitying.  Then she looks again at the wooden heart.

           CLAP!  Guess who’s back.

                        I entered the house of dust, and I 
                        saw the kings of the earth.” 
                        The dark.  We avoid it.  We fear it.  
                        Yet some of the most beautiful and 
                        interesting ideas emerge from the 
                        dark.  The glow of a firefly, a 
                        singing boy emerging from the 
                        darkened canvass of a Caravaggio.  
                        And now, one of Hawthorn’s signature 
                        dishes, “The Blackout.”  We change 
                        our menu constantly, but this has 
                        been a staple since day one.  It’s 
                        what --
                            (turning to him)
                        -- Mr. Bloom once said --

                                 TED BLOOM
                        Put you on the map.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Put me on the map.  And precisely 
                        what map would that be?

           As this rhetorical question hangs in the air, servers fan out 
           and place dishes before the patrons.  

           No one moves.  Why eat if they’re going to die?  Chef Slowik 
           sees them not eating and, in perhaps the angriest he will 
           ever be -- 

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        EAT!!!

           They obey.  And you know what?  It’s good. 

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                            (to Ted Bloom)
                        I was happy in my taco truck.  I 
                        was fine.
                            (to the room)
                        Oh, almost forgot.  In our test 
                        kitchen last week, we discovered 
                        that the Blackout should be eaten 
                        in literal blackout so the senses 
                        can be heightened.  Elsa, can you 
                        please turn off the lights?  Oh, 
                        wait.  Almost forgot again.  Elsa, 
                        where is my head this evening?

           As Elsa makes a humorous “I don’t know” gesture, a server 
           enters with a CRATE and puts it in the center of the room.
                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        We also found that the dish is best 
                        when paired with my friend 
                        Walterinnesia aegyptia.

           He slides open a side of the crate.  As a glistening BLACK 
           SNAKE slithers out, the room goes dark.

           IN COMPLETE DARKNESS

           SCREAMING, CLANGING and an ominous HISS.  Diners are 
           destroying the room.  Finally we hear what sounds like snake 
           bites followed by shrieks of pain.

           Over the black screen, a SUPERIMPOSED TITLE reads: ‘THE 
           BLACKOUT’ - black squid ink rice, black charred veal, 
           blackened parsnip, black snake.”

           The lights come back on.  The dining room is in complete 
           disarray.  People are in tears, many cowering atop tables, 
           including Margot and Craig.

           A cook wearing elbow-length gloves and carrying a short, 
           hooked pole catches the snake and replaces it into the crate.

           Tech Bro #3 is convulsing and foaming at the mouth -- 
           anaphylactic shock from the snake bite.  

           Carrying a SYRINGE and a spoonful of food, Elsa calmly 
           approaches Tech Bro #3.  She waits a bit too long, taking 
           extra moments to enjoy his suffering, then kneels and stabs 
           him with the needle.  

                                 ELSA
                        As the anti-venom takes effect, 
                        please enjoy this spoonful of 
                        kaffir lime gel. 
                            (to the room) 
                        We gel.

           As his convulsions cease, she shoves the spoonful of food 
           into Tech Bro #3’s mouth.  

                                 TECH BRO #1
                        If we’re all going to die tonight, 
                        why not just let him die?

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        He hasn’t finished eating.

           CRAIG dissolves into tears, barely able to speak between 
           little gasps.
                                 CRAIG
                        Oh, God... Forgive me, Margot.  I’m

                        tonight, and now we... we... we 
                        might die.  I’m so sorry.  I’m so 
                        sorry.  I didn’t know.  I didn’t 
                        know....

                        Huh?

           Margot reaches into her purse and takes out --

                        An... old phone?

                        Mine.  From years ago.  I saved it.

           With a look that says, “Let me show you,” Margot presses the 
           screen a few times, finding a VOICEMAIL.

                                 MARGOT (CONT’D)
                        Listen.

           As she plays a message on speakerphone, we watch Craig’s 
           saddened, pained face.  Unlike the shell of a man we see 
           before us, the voice we hear is alive and charming, perhaps 
           even that of a man in love.

                                 CRAIG’S VOICE
                        Hi.  It's me. I'm calling to say... 
                        Okay, well, this might freak you 
                        out, and I know it's only been a 
                        few weeks and I'm supposed to play 
                        it cool, but there was a moment 
                        tonight at dinner.  You were 
                        telling me about your Dad, and the 
                        old house, and how you used to 
                        watch the trees from the roof, and 
                        there was a second when your voice 
                        caught.  Remember?  And you looked 
                        away, because I guess you felt 
                        vulnerable.  And I suddenly 
                        thought, "Oh.  This person is my 
                        new favorite person.  This is the 
                        best person."  And I wanted to hold 
                        you so badly, in front of everyone.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 CRAIG’S VOICE (CONT'D)
                        But that stupid table between us 
                        felt five miles long.  I just 
                        wanted to be safe and warm with 
                        you.  And hold you. 
                            (laughs, choking up)
                        Anyway.  I just thought you should 
                        know.  And I can’t wait to see you 
                        again, my friend.  My lover.  My 
                        friend.  Okay.  Bye. 

           Craig can’t bring himself to look at her.

                                 MARGOT
                        What happened to that guy?  Is he 
                        still in there?  Or did he get full 
                        and move on?

           DING!  That pesky kitchen timer.

                                 ELSA
                        Time’s up, Mrs. Spooner.

                                 MARGOT
                            (to Craig)
                        Yes, it is.  It’s too late.

                                 ELSA
                        Chef will speak with you now.  In 
                        his office.

           Margot rises and follows her --

           THROUGH THE BUSY KITCHEN 

           -- and to a plain door.  Elsa knocks.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (O.S.)
                        Come in.

           Elsa opens the door for Margot.

           INT. CHEF SLOWIK’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Margot enters.

           The “office” is a completely barren room, larger than you’d 
           predict.  No decoration, no desk, nothing.  Just plain white 
           walls, a white floor, and a chair where Chef Slowik sits, 
           upright and still.  The atmosphere is other-worldly.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        You’ve made your decision.
                                 MARGOT
                        I have.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        And?

                                 MARGOT
                        I’ve decided what you said earlier 
                        was correct.  I shouldn’t be here 
                        tonight.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        I’ve decided that you should.  
                        Only, it’s even clearer now that 
                        you are in the wrong cage.

                                 MARGOT
                        The wrong cage.  What cage should I 
                        be in?

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        You should be with your own breed, 
                        Margot.  With those who have been 
                        subjugated.  The forgotten.  The 
                        starved.

           Margot recognizes these words as Chef says them almost 
           hypnotically.  Her defenses already weakened, tears appear in 
           her eyes.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        Why do you cry?  Are you afraid?  
                        Afraid of death?

                                 MARGOT
                        No.  I mean, yes, sure.  But --

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        But what?

           She looks at him and blinks, wipes her eyes.  Why should she 
           tell this guy anything?  Still -- 

                                 MARGOT
                        When you asked me whether we have 
                        children... We almost did, not that 
                        long ago... But... we lost it.  I 
                        lost it. 

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        I’m sorry.

           Margot looks at him a long moment.
                                 MARGOT
                        I wasn’t.  

           Chef nods at her slowly, compassionately.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Come with me.

                                      SIXTH COURSE

           INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Chef and Margot enter.  Tension and dread hang in the air.  
           Exhausted diners flinch as Chef walks near, like beaten dogs.

           Chef motions for Margot to stand by his side.  This stuns 
           Craig.  Chef CLAPS, but the diners are too numb to respond.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Ladies and gentlemen, our next 
                        course will be presented by sous-
                        chef Katherine Ocampo.

           KATHERINE steps out of the kitchen and takes her place at the 
           center of the room.  She smiles amidst the exquisite silence.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Good evening, everyone.  I have a 
                        story for you all.  Two years ago, 
                        Chef Julian Slowik tried to fuck me.

           Chef Slowik remains impassive.  As Katherine speaks, CAMERA 
           slowly semi-circles around her from profile to front-on.

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Naturally I refused his advances.  
                        He was angry but not dissuaded.  A 
                        week later he tried again.  Again I 
                        refused.  But he did not fire me.  
                        “That would be unethical,” he must 
                        have thought.  He just kept me in 
                        the kitchen and refused to look me 
                        in the eye or speak directly to me 
                        for eight months, during which time 
                        male cooks rose above me in the 
                        ranks.  This was unjust.  Not 
                        because I deserved to be treated as 
                        an equal.  But because I deserved 
                        to be treated as a superior.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        I am better than the male commis in 
                        this kitchen.  I am better than the 
                        male chef de parties.  I am better 
                        than the male sous chefs.  I am 
                        better even than Chef Slowik.  And 
                        he knows it.
                            (into camera)
                        I should be the star.  But I’m not. 
                        Because none of you would accept me 
                        in that role.  Only men get to be 
                        the dark romantic geniuses who 
                        suffer for their art.  A woman chef 
                        is a trooper.  A go-getter.  A 
                        mother hen in the kitchen doing 
                        women’s work, grandma’s recipes 
                        with a sly modern twist.  A woman 
                        chef doesn’t challenge.  She 
                        nourishes.  Isn’t that right?

           Diners shift uncomfortably in their seats.  Ted Bloom nods as 
           if he agrees, fingertips to chin, fascinated.

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        I have been groped, I have been
                        leered at, I have deserved more but 
                        earned less, I have not been 
                        featured in one FUCKING shot this 
                        entire night by the documentary 
                        crew.

           She shoots an accusing finger at the crew.  Sure enough, 
           their camera is trained on Chef Slowik.

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D) 
                        All of it an attempt to
                        humiliate me.  Well, I will show you 
                        what true humiliation looks like.  
                        Our next course is called 
                        ”Humiliation.” 
                            (sincerely warm)
                        Please enjoy.

           Katherine approaches Chef Slowik and stands very close, 
           looking him directly in the eyes.  She pulls a small PARING 
           KNIFE from her apron and stabs it into his thigh.  He accepts 
           it with a slight wince and nod.

           Katherine and Chef Slowik share a long, meaningful hug. 
           Theirs is a deep understanding that we’ll never know.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                            (a whisper)
                        I’m sorry.
           Katherine smiles at him.  He smiles back and pulls the knife 
           from his thigh.  A SERVER is there with a tray with a little 
           flower on it to take it away.  For the rest of the movie, 
           Chef will have a growing bloodstain on his pants and limp.

           More servers arrive, but not bearing plates.  Instead, they 
           line up six PLASTIC DOG BOWLS on the floor.

           We view one of the dog bowls in gorgeous, slo-mo close-up.  
           Inside rests an impossibly refined vision of haute cuisine.  
           A SUPERIMPOSED TITLE reads: “SEVENTH COURSE: ‘HUMILIATION’ - 
           squid, chorizo, slow-poached egg & pheasant consommé.”

           The diners exchange glances.  Why dog bowls?  Why only six?

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        This course is designed for our
                        gentlemen diners alone.  

                                 TED BLOOM
                            (sees where this is going)
                        Oh, fuck.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Ladies, enjoy your palate-cleansing 
                        calvados sorbet.

           The women diners are presented with little ice cream bowls.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        Gentlemen, please remove your 
                        pants.

           The men sit there, dazed.  What did he just say?

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        Servers, please assist the 
                        gentlemen with their pants.

           Servers approach each male customer, physically lifting the 
           resistant men from their chairs.  As burly COOKS raise 
           threatening cleavers, the servers begin removing the men’s 
           pants and underwear.

                                 THE MEN
                        What are you --?  Get the fuck off 
                        me!  Hey, leave me alone!

           Chef Slowik smiles at Margot, as though they share a private 
           joke.  Then she looks at Craig, who looks back at her --
           helpless, hurt, betrayed -- as he’s being stripped.

           Soon the scared men are NUDE below the waist. 
                                 KATHERINE
                        Eat.  Get down and eat.

           They do as they’re told.  They line up in front of the bowls, 
           kneel and begin scooping up the food with their hands.

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        No hands.

           The half-nude men bend over on all fours and eat directly 
           from the bowls.  Like dogs.  The always-gracious SOMMELIER 
           arrives.  Servers place tiny doggie bowls next to the larger 
           ones and pour wine into each.

                                 SOMMELIER
                        This is a searingly beautiful 
                        Alsatian Pinot Gris.  One of my 
                        favorites on the list, actually.  
                        Cuvee St. Catherine from Weinbach.  

           The men lap up wine as well, some first sniffing.  

           Margot is not smiling at the sight, but she’s not entirely 
           unhappy either.  Some perverse part of it feels good.  Other 
           female diners seem to share this feeling.  Finally --

                                 CHEF SLOW
                        Enough!
                            (to Margot)
                        Please sit.

           Margot returns to her table.  All the men stop eating except 
           for Craig, who hasn’t quite finished.  In fact, servers have 
           to drag him away from his bowl.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Pants on, please.  Take your seats.

           The men put their underpants and pants back on and return to 
           their tables.  They’re like children.  Every ounce of their 
           dignity has been drained.

           Gretchen and Anne can barely bring themselves to look at 
           their partners.  And Craig looks at Margot, devastated.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        I’m afraid our menu tonight cannot 
                        continue as planned until we deal 
                        with an unresolved matter.
                            (approaching his table)
                        Craig Spooner.

                                 CRAIG
                        M-me?
                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Yes, you.  I’ve been avoiding you
                        all night for a reason.  You’re 
                        different, aren’t you?

                                 CRAIG
                        I am?

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Don’t be coy.  You know what I’m
                        talking about.  I read your letters.  
                        You know this world.  You know about 
                        me.  You know what we do here.  You 
                        know about food.  Don’t you?

           A tiny flush of confidence returns to Craig’s face.

                                 CRAIG
                        Well... I have been trying to eat 
                        at as many of the world’s best 
                        restaurants as I can, if that’s 
                        what you mean.  I do my research.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        I noticed.  We all noticed.  And we
                        were... Well, part of me hates to 
                        admit it, but we were quite 
                        impressed.  You yourself cook, do 
                        you not?

                                 CRAIG
                        I fool around a little in the 
                        kitchen, sure.  I guess you could 
                        say that I’m an avid home cook.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        And you’ve been told that you’re
                        good.  You know you’re good.

                                 MARGOT
                            (to Chef)
                        Leave him alone.

                                 CRAIG
                        That’s for others to say, but yeah, 
                        I get some compliments.  I worked 
                        in a kitchen in college.  And I 
                        like to cook my way through whole 
                        cookbooks.  Right now I’m about 
                        halfway through Eleven Madison 
                        Park.  And every Thanksgiving we 
                        usually host around fifteen, twenty 
                        people, and every year I try step 
                        up my game.
                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        You noted the star anise.  You know 
                        what a Pacojet is.  You may be our 
                        first customer who knows what a 
                        Pacojet is.  You’re not like the 
                        others, are you?

                                 CRAIG
                        I... I don’t know about that.  I 
                        mean, look, there’s Ted Bloom.  
                        He’s probably forgotten more about 
                        food than I’ll ever know.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Somehow I don’t feel comfortable 
                        keeping you out here with the 
                        others.  You belong in the kitchen.  
                        With us.  We need some fresh blood.

           Craig looks to the kitchen staff behind Chef.  They all smile 
           warmly and nod, welcoming him.  Elsa comes over with 
           beautifully folded CHEF’S WHITES and hands them to Craig.  

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        Go on.  They’re for you.

                                 MARGOT
                        Craig, don’t.

           Craig hesitantly dons the whites and apron, tying the belt 
           around his waist.  

           A server approaches to place little tongs and a meat 
           thermometer in his left sleeve pocket.  Another server brings 
           a mirror so Craig can admire himself.  The word “Hawthorn” is 
           embroidered on his breast, as is, miraculously, “Craig.”

           Craig looks over at Margot.  He can’t help feeling a little 
           proud despite the fucking weirdness of it all.  

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        That’s more like it, don’t you 
                        think?  You look wonderful. 

                                 LINDA
                        Mr. Handsome Boy!

           Craig doesn’t quite know what to say. Pause.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Now cook.

                                 CRAIG
                        What?
                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Cook.  You’re a good cook, so cook.

                                 CRAIG
                        What do you mean, cook here?  Me?  
                        Oh, I’m not prepared, I could never --

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Not prepared?  You are ten feet 
                        away from a fully stocked, world-
                        class kitchen.  Now show me.

           Craig fumbles for an answer for a moment, until Chef Slowik 
           starts shooing him into --

           THE KITCHEN.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        COOK COOK COOK!  GO ON NOW, COOK!

           Chef Slowik seizes Craig by the shoulders and positions him 
           in front of the burners.  The other cooks halt work to watch.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        COOK SOMETHING!

           Trying to stay strong, Craig takes a pan and puts it on a 
           burner.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        What do you need?  We have 
                        everything.  Just tell me what you 
                        need for your dish.

                                 CRAIG
                        L-l-l-leeks?

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Get the cook some leeks!

                                 SOUS-CHEFS
                        Yes, Chef!

           Someone hands Craig two leeks.  Craig’s hands shake as he 
           takes a knife and finds a nearby cutting board.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        What else?

                                 CRAIG
                        Um.  Sh-sh-sh-

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Shit?  Would you like some shit?
                                 CRAIG
                        Shallots.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Shallots for the great foodie!  Mr. 
                        Food himself!  Foodie McFooders!

           Someone hands Craig two shallots.  Craig is so flustered that 
           he can cut only haphazard chunks, like with the leeks.  
           Margot watches horrified from the dining room.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        Everyone pay close attention.  We 
                        must learn from Craig.  This is a 
                        new dicing method of which we have 
                        been woefully ignorant.
                            (to Craig)
                        What next?

                                 CRAIG
                        Uh -- uh -- B-butter?

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Butter!  Leeks and shallots sautéd 
                        in butter!  I bear witness to a 
                        revolution in cuisine!

                                 MARGOT
                            (yelling)
                        Leave him alone!

           Craig is given butter.  He’s so nervous at this point that he 
           lamely dumps it into the pan, followed by the leeks and 
           shallots.  

           Someone hands him a piece of lamb, which he dutifully, numbly 
           puts in the pan, too.  Same with carrots and capers.  Salmon 
           roe.  Strawberries.  Eggs.  The cooks just hand him shit, 
           and, to their amusement, he puts it in.   A horrible, 
           grotesque comedy.

           They hand him a spatula.  Completely out of body, he stirs.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Is it done?  Or would you like to 
                        jam it into the Pacojet?
                            (Craig shakes his head)
                        Then plate it.

           Someone produces a plate, and Craig basically just dumps the 
           food onto it.  He tries to arrange it in some artful way, but 
           his hands tremble, and it’s just terrible.   
                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        Shall I taste it?

           Craig can’t even respond.  He’s crying.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        I think if you want to work at 
                        Hawthorn, I should taste your 
                        cooking, don’t you?

           Chef takes a spoonful of Craig’s food and lifts it to his 
           mouth.  Just as he’s about to try it --

                                 AGAINST BLACK, TITLE CARD:

                                   SUPPLEMENTAL COURSE

           CLOSE ON CRAIG’S HIDEOUS PLATE.  A SUPERIMPOSED TITLE reads, 
           “CRAIG’S BULLSHIT.  Under-cooked lamb, inelegantly reduced 
           strawberry-salmon-leek butter sauce, utter lack of cohesion."

           Chef Slowik puts the forkful into his mouth.  He looks to be 
           savoring it.  Craig watches through tears.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Mmmmm.  Mmmmmm!

           Chef continues to chew, eyes rolling in back of his head in 
           mock ecstasy.

                                 MARGOT
                        STOP!

           She pushes aside the cooks, runs up to Chef and SLAPS HIM. 

                                 MARGOT (CONT’D)
                        Stop this right now!  Leave him 
                        alone!  What the fuck is your 
                        problem, you sadistic son-of-a-
                        bitch?  You and your cunt sidekick! 

           Elsa smiles.  She takes it as a compliment.

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        My husband may not be perfect, but 
                        he doesn’t deserve this.  No one 
                        does. 
                            (taking his hand)
                        Come on, Craig.

           Chef calmly spits out Craig’s food into a napkin.
                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        I meant no harm.  I simply wished 
                        to demonstrate to Craig here how 
                        the mystery has been drained from 
                        our art. 
                            (to Craig)
                        People like you feel knowledgable 
                        and informed about our craft.  But 
                        you are not.  And you will never 
                        be.  You see that now, don’t you?  
                        Craig?

                                 CRAIG
                        Yes.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Yes, what?

                                 CRAIG
                        Yes, Chef.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        But if you really wish to cook, you 
                        can start as we all did, at the 
                        bottom.  So.  You can go back to 
                        the table with your wife.  Or you 
                        can stay here with us.  In the 
                        kitchen at Hawthorn.  Washing 
                        dishes.

           Craig looks back and forth between Chef and Margot.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        Which will you choose?

           His spirit broken, Craig -- shoulders slumped, head bowed -- 
           robotically plods to the DISH STATION in back of the kitchen 
           and starts rinsing plates with the dangling FLEX-HOSE. 

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                            (to Margot)
                        The man wants to work his way up.  
                        You have to respect that.  
                        Greatness begins at the bottom.  I 
                        learned that as a child in 
                        Bratislava.

           Back in the dining room, Felicity makes a face.  Do does 
           Gretchen.  Didn’t he say Iowa before?

           CLOSE ON MARGOT, looking back and forth between Chef and 
           Craig.  Yet a new level of incredulity.
                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        Now you.  Follow me.

           Chef leads Margot into the --

           PASTRY AREA

           -- where cheery FEMALE PASTRY CHEFS, faces dotted with flour, 
           ply their craft.  They greet Chef Slowik as he passes.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                            (to Margot)
                        We have only one more savory course 
                        left on our menu.  That means we 
                        have to prepare for dessert.

           Margot has no idea what to do with this information.  And 
           she’s still shaky from what just transpired.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        Dessert requires a large barrel 
                        that is supposed to be there, in 
                        the corner.  Do you see a barrel?

                                 MARGOT
                            (weary)
                        No.  No, I do not see a barrel.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Neither do I.  That is because my 
                        negligent employee Elsa forgot to 
                        assign someone to bring it.

           Elsa, always somehow nearby, looks gutted by her error.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        You will fetch the barrel instead.

                                 MARGOT
                        Me?

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        You remember the smokehouse.

                                 MARGOT
                        I -- yes.

                                 ELSA
                        Chef, perhaps a member of the 
                        kitchen staff should --
                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        No, Elsa.  We need to know once and 
                        for all which side Mrs. Spooner 
                        falls on.  She knows and accepts 
                        that she is going to die.  But 
                        she’s with us now.  With me.  Isn’t 
                        that right?

                                 MARGOT
                            (pause)
                        Yes.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Yes, what?

                                 MARGOT
                        Yes, Chef.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Elsa, give her the smokehouse key.

                                 ELSA
                        Yes, Chef.

           Elsa slides a KEY off of her big key ring and, against her 
           better judgment, hands it to Margot.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Go.

           Margot looks at him, then at her husband, dutifully rinsing 
           dishes amid a spray of hot, steamy water, as if born for the 
           job.

           Margot’s incredulity shifts to something we’ve not seen this 
           entire time -- ease.  Almost the hint of a smile.  

                                 MARGOT
                        Yes, Chef.

           EXT. HAWTHORN ISLAND - NIGHT

           A clear, beautiful evening, lit by moonlight.  Calls of 
           insects and night birds.  

           Margot walks purposefully across the lawn.  She’s actually 
           going through with this.  She appears committed. 

           Not far off looms a patch of WOODS leading to the smokery.
           EXT. WOODS - MOMENTS LATER

           Margot enters the dark forest.  Up ahead is the small 
           SMOKEHOUSE lit by a single, dim porch light.

           As she walks, she hears a rustling sound in the woods and a 
           distant SNAP.  She stops and turns to listen.  Nothing.  Then 
           she looks down at the KEY in her hand.

           INT. SMOKEHOUSE - NIGHT

           Margot enters and flips on the overhead light.  Sure enough, 
           there’s the BARREL resting beneath hanging ocean trout.

           She approaches the barrel as if to retrieve it.  But instead 
           she reaches behind the barrel, where a scaling KNIFE hangs by 
           a nail on the wall.

           Taking the knife, she glances out a small window and spots 
           Chef Slowik’s COTTAGE bathed in moonlight.

           INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           The room is silent.  Chef Slowik enters and is about to clap 
           when the movie star rises to his feet, scared but brave.

                                 MOVIE STAR
                        Excuse me, Mr. Slowik. I have s-
                        something to s-say.

           Chef turns to him.  The famous actor summons all of his 
           experience and talent for this crucial moment.

                                 MOVIE STAR (CONT’D)
                        I want you to know I truly 
                        understand the premise of this 
                        evening.  Everyone here is being 
                        punished.  Including you.  But I 
                        don’t deserve to die -- none of us 
                        do.  Especially my friend here, my 
                        assistant.  

           Felicity looks up at him.

                                 MOVIE STAR (CONT’D)
                        I’m famous.  I can’t change that.  
                        And with fame comes fortune.  But 
                        I’ve come by my success honestly, 
                        and I’ve tried to treat people -- 
                        everyone -- with compassion and 
                        respect.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MOVIE STAR (CONT’D)
                        I don’t consider myself better than 
                        anyone in this room, or on the 
                        planet, for that matter.   Quite 
                        the opposite.  In fact, we actors 
                        often suffer from worse self-image 
                        problems than average people.

           He looks at Felicity and smiles warmly.   She smiles back.

                                 MOVIE STAR (CONT’D)
                        As for my friend, let me tell you 
                        about my wonderful friend Felicity.  
                        We’re shooting up in Vancouver, had 
                        a couple of days off, and she 
                        simply wanted to give me a treat.  
                        It’s been a miserable year, you 
                        see.  I’ve felt quite lost.  And 
                        afraid.  She simply wanted to cheer 
                        me up.  
                            (directly at Chef Slowik)
                        Forgive me, but you know nothing 
                        about Felicity.  She’s a complete 
                        stranger to you.  You know nothing 
                        of her life, of her pain.  She’s 
                        innocent.  And she’s wonderful.  
                        Which is why I implore you -- please 
                        let her go.  Thank you for 
                        listening.

           Chef Slowik stares at him, unmoved by his little speech. 

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Do you wish to know why you’re 
                        being punished?

                                 MOVIE STAR
                        Yes.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        I saw the movie Victor Frankenstein, 
                        and I did not enjoy it.

           The puzzled movie star furrows his brow.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        It was a Sunday.  My one day off in 
                        months.  And I saw Victor 
                        Frankenstein alone in the cinema.

                                 MOVIE STAR
                        That’s a weird movie to go out of 
                        your way to see.
                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        I’m a weird man.  And a very big 
                        fan of Shelley’s Frankenstein, or 
                        The Modern Prometheus.  Which you 
                        ruined.  You undercut the power and 
                        value of the Frankenstein myth.  
                        You turned a crucial metaphor into 
                        a cheap action film.

                                 MOVIE STAR
                        I didn’t direct it.  I just acted 
                        in it.  I’m just an actor.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        What did you do with the money you 
                        made from it?  You already have 
                        more money than God.  Did you give 
                        it to charity?  To children?

                                 MOVIE STAR
                        I give a lot to charity.  Right, 
                        Felicity?

                                 FELICITY
                        He does.   Frequently.

                                 MOVIE STAR
                        Wasn’t there a dog thing?  
                        Recently?  That dog thing?

                                 FELICITY
                        That’s right.  You gave to a dog 
                        thing. 

                                 MOVIE STAR
                        Right, helping dogs was it? 

                                 FELICITY
                        Yes, helping dogs.  A dog charity.  
                        Other charities as well.

           He looks at Chef hopefully.  Chef stares at him.  It’s futile.

                                 MOVIE STAR
                        And her?

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        She works for you.  Who knows how 
                        much abuse she puts up with just to 
                        say she works for a big movie star?

                                 MOVIE STAR
                        That’s not fair.
                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                            (weighing the word)
                        Fair.

                                 MOVIE STAR
                        Well.  That’s that, then.
                            (grim beat)
                        Cheers.

           The movie star sits down.  He and Felicity reach across the 
           table and warmly grip each other’s hand.

           EXT. CHEF SLOWIK’S COTTAGE - NIGHT

           Margot approaches Chef’s domicile at the edge of the forest.  
           She reaches for the door handle and, to her surprise, finds 
           it UNLOCKED.

           INT. CHEF SLOWIK'S COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Margot enters and looks around.  The interior is an EXACT 
           REPLICA of the interior of the restaurant.  

           It’s so quiet here, so clean.  No blood.  Pristine.

           For reasons she doesn’t quite know, she takes her same seat 
           from the restaurant, closes her eyes, breathing in the quiet 
           and tranquility.

           INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Back in the real dining room.  Not quiet.  Screaming.  
           BEDLAM. 

           One cook holds the movie star’s head in a vice-like grip. 
           Another holds a cleaver to Felicity’s throat, forcing her to 
           feed him NUTS.  He’s having a massive allergic reaction.

           A SUPERIMPOSED TITLE reads, “EIGHTH COURSE: ‘GONE NUTS’ 
           peanut dashi, peanut foam, peanut curd, peanut brittle, and 
           raw peanuts hand-fed.”

           The sommelier pops up with fresh stemware and a bottle.

                                 SOMMELIER
                        I can see you’re busy, so I’ll just 
                        pour and tell you about it later.  
           INT. CHEF SLOWIK'S COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Silence.  

           Margot remains seated.  She looks at the chair once occupied 
           by her husband.  She fights tears and starts to breathe 
           heavily, as if finally able to process everything.

           Then Margot realizes that the mysterious SILVER DOOR might be 
           here, too.  And whatever lurks behind it.  She gets up, 
           leaving the scaling knife on the table.  

           She finds the door, indeed an exact replica of the other one.  
           She tries to open it, but it’s locked.  

           She hears the front door open.  We see the footfalls of the 
           person stepping inside the cottage.  CAMERA rises to reveal --

                                 ELSA 
                        I told you when you arrived that no
                        one may enter Chef’s home.  And you 
                        have disobeyed this rule.

           Elsa sees the knife on Margot’s table and smiles.

           Margot enters the dining room, ready for a confrontation, and 
           sees Elsa holding the knife.

                                 MARGOT
                        Fuck.

                                 ELSA
                        I worry about the customers so Chef 
                        can worry about the menu.  And you 
                        have made my job quite difficult.  

           Elsa takes a step toward Margot, who braces for whatever 
           attack Elsa might unleash.

                        But yet I admire you.  How you’ve 
                        carried yourself.  How you’ve 
                        talked to him.  He is after all 
                        just a man, isn’t he?  Yes, he is 
                        just a man.

           Extending the knife, Elsa takes a couple of threatening steps 
           toward Margot.  Margot sprints to the front door, but it’s 
           locked.  Then she turns back to Elsa and picks up the nearest 
           weapon she can find -- a chair -- and raises it high.

           Elsa looks at her and laughs.  Then she SLITS HER OWN THROAT 
           with the scaling knife.  
           Margot puts down the chair and manages to catch Elsa before 
           she falls to the ground.  Through disgusting gurgles, Elsa 
           manages a final whisper.

                                 ELSA (CONT’D)
                        I just remembered.

                                 MARGOT
                        What’s that?

                                 ELSA
                        We neglected to re-fold your napkin 
                        when you went to the ladies’ room 
                        earlier.  Apologies.  

           Elsa dies.  Margot lays Elsa down, then takes the key ring 
           from her pocket and returns to the silver door. 

           INT. THE SECRET ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A lovely room.  A real office and man cave.  Warmly lit and 
           beautiful.  Fragments of an actual life.  A desk.  
           Comfortable leather furniture.  Stacks of recipe books.  A 
           lava lamp.

           AND PHOTOS

           -- YOUNG CHEF SLOWIK smiles with his mentors and classmates 
           from culinary school.   

           -- A GRADUATION of some kind -- Slowik happy and optimistic. 

           -- His restaurant TANTALUS in New York.  He’s CLOWNING in 
           front of it. 

           -- SLOWIK OPENING HAWTHORN, standing with Doug Varrick.  
           Slowik looks deadly serious, joy drained from his face.  

           Then Margot notices a RADIO on a shelf across from his desk.  
           She dashes towards it and fiddles with the transceiver. 

                                 MARGOT
                        Hello?  Is anyone there?  Can 
                        anyone hear this?  Hello!  Can 
                        anyone hear this?  CAN ANYONE 
                        FUCKING HEAR ME?

                                 VOICE
                            (crackly)
                        Hello? 

                                 MARGOT
                        Hello?  Who is this?
                                 VOICE
                        Coast Guard.  Who am I talking to?

                                 MARGOT
                        Oh, thank Christ.  I’m at the 
                        restaurant.  The... Hawthorn.  
                        Hawthorn.  People are getting 
                        murdered.  Send help.  Send help!

                                 VOICE
                        What did you say?

                                 MARGOT
                        Just get here!  Now!  PLEASE!  
                        Hawthorn Island!  People are dying.  
                        It’s an emergency!

                                 VOICE
                        Okay, just, uh -- don’t move. 

           INT. CHEF SLOWIK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

           Margot staggers back out into the dining room and, stepping 
           over Elsa’s body, retakes her seat.  Silence.  

           Then a startling CLAP from an INTERCOM speaker.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (O.S.)
                        Do you like my home?

           Margot makes a face like, “Of course this isn’t over.”

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        People always say you shouldn’t 
                        take your work home with you.  I 
                        wholeheartedly disagree.  Go ahead.  
                        Speak.  I can hear you.

                                 MARGOT
                        You didn’t strike me as someone 
                        who’s into the whole work/life 
                        balance thing.  Elsa’s dead.  

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (O.S.)
                        I know.  It’s what she wanted.  
                        It’s what I want, too.  Death is 
                        nothing.  I am a chef, Margot.  I 
                        work with death every day.  Death 
                        is my raw material.  My paint.  How 
                        can I call myself the greatest chef 
                        who’s ever lived if I don’t 
                        experience death for myself? 
                                 MARGOT
                        But then you’d be dead. 

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Hmm.  So.  Just between us starved 
                        individuals, say tonight had gone 
                        as normal.  The food eaten, the 
                        bill paid, and you and the man 
                        named Craig return to shore.  Would 
                        you have woken up tomorrow morning 
                        happy to be alive? 

                                 MARGOT
                        We have Hamilton tickets.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Do you want to see Hamilton?

                                 MARGOT
                        I don’t really like musicals. 

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Exactly.

           Margot laughs slightly.

                                 MARGOT
                        Okay, I have a question.  If you’re 
                        so fed up feeding your precious art 
                        to rich people, why don’t you just 
                        chuck it and go work as a cook in a 
                        soup kitchen?  Or a monastery?  Go 
                        back to your little taco truck? 
                        Come to think of it, why did you 
                        put a Korean taco truck so close to 
                        a food convention you knew was 
                        swarming with food critics?  

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (O.S.)
                            (long pause)
                        Please do retrieve that barrel.  
                        The guests are waiting.

           The intercom speaker clicks off.    

           INT. HAWTHORN DINING AREA AND KITCHEN - NIGHT

           We PAN ACROSS the restaurant.  PEOPLE ON THE GROUND IN PAIN, 
           choking, too wasted to scream.  
           Anne weeps over Richard’s battered body.  Gretchen is keeled 
           over in her seat in some ungodly pain, and Ted Bloom numbly 
           sneaks a bite of her leftover food.  The movie star is 
           wheezing, struggling to breathe, near death. 

           The documentary crew, meanwhile, is being made to shoot a 
           long, unbroken close-up of an egg poaching in a small pot. 

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Don’t film me.  Film the egg.  If 
                        you can poach an egg perfectly, you 
                        can do anything.  The essence of 
                        cooking.  A minute to learn, a 
                        lifetime to master.

           An sweaty Margot enters the restaurant, rolling the barrel in 
           front of her, and stops to absorb the chaos.  

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        Leave that there.  And take your 
                        seat. 

           Margot sits at her table, which has been cleaned and 
           perfectly re-set.  Chef Slowik walks over.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        I thought about your question.  Here 
                        is the answer.  I am a monster.  No, 
                        was a monster.  And a whore. But 
                        tonight everything I’m doing is 100% 
                        pure.  100% egoless.  And at last, 
                        the pain is almost gone. 

           There’s a CANDLE on Margot’s table.  Chef Slowik extends his 
           hand directly over it.  The flame burns his flesh, but he 
           doesn’t so much as flinch.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        Chef’s Hands.  “Asbestos hands,” we 
                        call them.  I can carry a cast-iron 
                        pan from a 550 oven to your table 
                        with no protection.  That’s a 
                        cook’s training.  But this isn’t.

           Now Chef Slowik bends over and holds his CHEEK to the flame, 
           burning the side of his face for many seconds.  It crackles.  
           Margot turns away.

           Chef Slowik stands upright, now sporting a gruesome BURN.  He 
           extinguishes the candle with his thumb and forefinger.  Smoke 
           trails upward.
                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        I can no longer be hurt, Margot.
                        As Dr. King said, “We know through 
                        painful experience that freedom is 
                        never voluntarily given by the 
                        oppressor.  It must be demanded by 
                        the oppressed.”

                                 MOVIE STAR
                            (eyes bulging, barely 
                              alive)
                        Did he just quote Martin Luther 
                        King again?

           Outside the large bay windows, a LIGHT appears on the water.  
           A small BOAT.  Margot sees it out of the corner of her eye 
           and stifles a gasp.  

           Chef Slowik spots it, too, for a moment frozen with 
           indecision, perhaps even fear.  Then a calm comes over him.  
           He knows what to do.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        So you found our radio.
                            (to the kitchen)
                        Clear the dining room.  Immediately!

           Servers appear from everywhere to get people seated again, 
           wipe down the floor, their work hyper-fast and spotless.  One 
           server administers an EPI-PEN to the movie star, and his 
           breathing begins to clear.  

           Another applies a white bandage to Chef’s cheek and ties a 
           new apron around him to mask his blood-soaked pants.

           Margot looks out the window to see a lone COAST GUARD OFFICER 
           stepping onto the dock.  No back-up.  Not good.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        I see we have an unexpected guest.  
                        Sadly we are fully booked tonight 
                        and cannot accommodate him.  You 
                        will be tempted to ask him for 
                        help.  To plead, even.  This would 
                        be unwise.  He cannot help you.

           The guests look unconvinced and exchange conspiratorial 
           glances.  How can they let this opportunity pass?

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        I can see you don’t believe me.  
                        You think this might be your only 
                        chance, a chance worth taking.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        But ask yourselves if you really 
                        want to be responsible for the 
                        death of an innocent man.  A man 
                        who did nothing to deserve a death 
                        here tonight. 

           He’s right.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        And ask yourselves -- this entire 
                        evening, why didn’t you all try to 
                        harder to escape?  Honestly, you 
                        probably could have.

           All the patrons look at one another.  Why didn’t they?

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        Anyway, something to think about. 

           A knock.  Chef Slowik nods at a server to unlock the door. 

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        Good evening, officer.  How can we 
                        help you?

                                 COAST GUARD OFFICER
                            (stepping inside)
                        I got a radio report of a 
                        disturbance.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        A disturbance?  Here?  No. 

           The officer doesn’t quite trust this answer.  He looks around 
           the nearly empty dining room.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        What kind of disturbance, exactly?

                                 COAST GUARD OFFICER
                        A violent disturbance.  In fact, I 
                        don’t want to alarm you folks, but 
                        there was a report of a possible 
                        murder.

           We cut to the diners’ quietly panicked faces.  Chef Slowik 
           begins to laugh, and one by one the whole staff joins in.  
           The diners play along wearily with forced smiles. 

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        No, officer.  Nothing of that 
                        nature.
                                 COAST GUARD OFFICER
                        Are you the owner?

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Ownership changed hands this 
                        evening, but that’s another story.  
                        I am the executive chef.  I don’t 
                        wish to be rude, but, as you can 
                        see, we are right in the middle of 
                        our dinner service.

                                 COAST GUARD OFFICER
                        What happened to your face?

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        If you must know, I have been 
                        undergoing treatment for skin 
                        cancer. 

                                 COAST GUARD OFFICER
                        Oh - okay. Are these your only 
                        guests?

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Tonight is a private event.  We’re 
                        peer-testing a new concept menu.

           Not quite understanding that, the officer looks around at the 
           diners.  They seem composed enough.

                                 COAST GUARD OFFICER
                        Did anybody here call in a distress 
                        on the short-wave tonight?

           All shake their heads, even Margot.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        We are not in the habit of serving 
                        our guests short-wave radios with 
                        their meals.

           The cooks laugh again.  Maybe a little too loud.  The Officer 
           notices the movie star panting at his table. 

                                 COAST GUARD OFFICER
                        Hey, are you --?

                                 MOVIE STAR
                            (instantly)
                        Yes.

                                 COAST GUARD OFFICER
                        Oh, wow.  I’m a big fan.  (Wrong 
                        Name), right?
                                 MOVIE STAR
                        (Right name).

                                 COAST GUARD OFFICER
                        (Right name)!  Shit.  Sorry.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Would you like his autograph?

                                 COAST GUARD OFFICER
                        Oh.  Uh, I mean, I don’t want to 
                        bother you.

                                 MOVIE STAR
                        No bother at all.

           A server arrives with a pen and paper on a tray.  

                                 MOVIE STAR (CONT’D)
                        What’s your name?

                                 COAST GUARD OFFICER
                        Doug.

                                 MOVIE STAR
                        Doug.

                                 COAST GUARD OFFICER
                        You’re great.  Loved that, uh... 
                        what’s it called?  The Frankenstein 
                        one.

                                 MOVIE STAR
                        Victor Frankenstein.

                                 COAST GUARD OFFICER
                        Yeah.  Great stuff.

           The movie star smiles sadly and hands over the autograph.

                                 MOVIE STAR
                        Thank you.

                                 COAST GUARD OFFICER
                        Okay.  Well, sorry again to bother 
                        you folks.  I’ll be going now.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Thank you for your service.

           The officer turns and walks back toward the door.  But then 
           we see, from his POV, a SMEAR OF BLOOD on the floor, perhaps 
           the only one missed by the wait staff.
           The officer stops, whips out his gun, turns and points it at 
           Chef Slowik.

                                 COAST GUARD OFFICER
                        Hands above your head!  Now!

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                            (nervous laugh)
                        Are you joking?

                                 COAST GUARD OFFICER
                        I am not joking, sir!

           A cook behind Chef Slowik steps forward to protect his 
           master, but Chef holds up a hand.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        No, we will comply.  Clearly 
                        there’s some misunderstanding. 

                                 COAST GUARD OFFICER
                        Get down on your knees with your 
                        hands up.  Now!

           Chef Slowik draws a long breath and kneels.

                                 ANNE
                        Help us, officer!  He wants to kill 
                        us.  He wants to kill us all!

           Others diners chime in as well.

                                 COAST GUARD OFFICER
                        Nobody move till I say so!

           The officer inches forward.  When he has almost reached Chef, 
           he pivots toward Margot’s table, gun still pointed, and pulls 
           the trigger.  A SMALL FLAME emits from the barrel, and he 
           lights the extinguished candle on Margot’s table.

                                 MOVIE STAR
                        Fuck me. 

           Chuckling, the officer holsters the gun.  Somebody tosses him 
           an apron, and he joins his comrades in the kitchen.  They 
           laugh and pat him on the back.  That was a good one.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                            (standing)
                        Thank you, Douglas.

                        In a kitchen everyone works 
                        together, or nothing works at all.

                        You have betrayed our sacred bond 
                        of trust.  And you have shown your 
                        craft to be sloppy.  I was wrong.  
                        You’re an eater.  A taker.  An 
                        animal like all the rest.

           We scan the FACES of the cooks and servers behind Chef 
           Slowik.  He’s right.  She has failed the test.  Chef trots 
           back into the kitchen.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        Final course plating in five! 

                                 ENTIRE KITCHEN
                        Yes, Chef!

           Two cooks unplug the top of the barrel and tip it on its 
           side.  A thick, VISCOUS LIQUID pours out across the floor.  
           What is it -- chocolate?  Rendered animal fat?

           Resigned to their fate, the diners don’t even bother lifting 
           their feet.  By now some even feel as if they deserve it.

           Margot’s head droops.  All is lost.  But she doesn’t look 
           scared.  Or sad.  Instead, a kind of quiet, simmering anger 
           builds inside her.

                                 MARGOT
                            (barely audible)
                        I don’t like your food.

           Servers have begun busily draping thick sheets of 
           MARSHMALLOWS strung together with candy floss over the 
           diners, over the documentary crew, even over themselves.  As 
           a server drapes a marshmallow sheet over her torso, Margot 
           does nothing to stop her.  

                                 MARGOT (CONT’D)
                        I don’t like your food.

           Again no one hears.  The staff continue to hustle, now 
           creating elaborate, Jackson Pollock SPLATTERS AND SWIRLS of 
           melted chocolate and graham cracker crumbles atop the tables.  

           The SOMMELIER pours dessert wine over the diners’ heads.

                                 SOMMELIER
                        This is a Palo Cortado Sherry from 
                        our friends at Lustau Almacenista.  
                        I think you’ll find it highly 
                        flammable and redolent of leather, 
                        cigar box and freshly mown grass. 
           Margot rises, tears off her marshmallow coat, hurls it onto 
           the floor, and CLAPS.  Everything stops, just like at the 
           beginning of the meal.  Even the film score stops.  

           Chef Slowik looks over from the kitchen.

                                 MARGOT
                            (loud)
                        I don’t like your food!

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                            (entering the dining room)
                        What did you say?

                                 MARGOT
                        I said I don’t like your food.  And 
                        I would like to send it back.

           We see the faces of the staff, shocked and ready to tear 
           Margot to pieces.  Slowik takes a deep breath, unhappy but 
           not angry.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        I’m very sorry.  What about my food 
                        is not to your liking?

                                 MARGOT
                        You’ve taken the joy out of eating. 
                        Every dish we’ve had tonight has 
                        been some intellectual exercise 
                        rather than something you just want 
                        to sit and enjoy.

           The COOKS can’t believe what she’s saying, even if deep down 
           they know there’s a kernel of truth to it.  Chef Slowik 
           doesn’t react at all.

                                 MARGOT (CONT’D)
                        When I eat your food, it tastes 
                        like it was made with no love. 

                                 SLOWIK
                        That’s ridiculous.  I always cook 
                        with love.  Love is the most 
                        important ingredient.

                                 MARGOT
                        You’re kidding yourself.  Even your 
                        hot dishes are cold.  And dead. Like 
                        they were made by one of those 
                        fucking fish hanging in your little 
                        smoke shack.  There’s no personality.  
                        Only concepts.  You are a chef.

                        Your one single fucking purpose on 
                        this Earth is to serve people food 
                        that they will like.  And you have 
                        failed.  And you’ve bored me.  And 
                        worst of all... you’ve left me 
                        hungry.

           Chef Slowik takes it all in and nods slightly. 

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        You’re still hungry, you say?
                            (off her nod)
                        How hungry?

                                 MARGOT
                        You know the answer.  Starved.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        What are you hungry for?

                                 MARGOT
                        What do you have?

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Everything.

                                 MARGOT
                        You know what I want?

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Tell me.

                                 MARGOT
                        What I really want?

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        I’m all ears.

                                 MARGOT
                        A cheeseburger.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        I can do a cheeseburger.

                                 MARGOT
                        I mean a real cheeseburger.  Not 
                        some fancy deconstructed avant 
                        bullshit.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        I can make you a very good, very 
                        traditional cheeseburger. 
                                 MARGOT
                        I don’t think you’re capable.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        I will make you feel as if you are 
                        eating the first cheeseburger you 
                        ever ate.  The one that tasted 
                        better than any other cheeseburger 
                        in the world.

                                 MARGOT
                            (strong, daring)
                        Show me.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        How would you like it cooked? 

                                 MARGOT
                        Medium.  American cheese.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        American cheese is the best cheese 
                        for a cheeseburger because it melts 
                        without splitting.

                                 MARGOT
                        And no weird homemade artisanal 
                        ketchup.  I want Heinz.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        I make a special sauce that’s equal 
                        parts Heinz, mayo, and hot dog 
                        mustard.

           Margot cocks her head, suspicious.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        You want it.  It’s delicious. 

                                 MARGOT
                        How much?

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        $9.95.

                                 MARGOT
                            (weighing)
                        That come with fries?

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                            (yelling)
                        Niels!
                                 SOUS-CHEF NIELS
                        Yes, Chef?

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Is the fryer still on?

                                 SOUS-CHEF NIELS
                        Yes, Chef.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                            (to Margot)
                        Crinkle-cut or Julienne?

           LATER

           The sound of cooking.  Slowik is alone in the kitchen.  The 
           rest of the staff has gathered in the dining room, chatting 
           amiably with diners.  The tension in the room has dissipated.  
           Everyone seems fine.  Margot waits patiently.  

           Chef emerges from the kitchen and, sloshing across the liquid 
           still covering the floor, places a plate in front of her.  

           It looks, no shit, like the best fucking cheeseburger ever.  
           A SUPERIMPOSED TITLE reads, “SUPPLEMENTAL COURSE: ‘A 
           CHEESEBURGER - just a well-made cheeseburger”

           Margot looks at it and nods.  All present -- diners, kitchen 
           staff, servers, sommelier, film crew, Mama Linda -- watch 
           carefully as she takes a bite, closes her eyes and chews 
           slowly.  The moment is suspended.  What’s the verdict?

                                 MARGOT
                        Now that is a cheeseburger.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Yes.  That is a cheeseburger. 

           They smile and share the moment.  She takes another bite.

                                 MARGOT
                        Unfortunately, my eyes were a 
                        little bigger than my stomach. 

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Meaning?

                                 MARGOT
                        Can I get the rest to go?

           DOLLY IN on Slowik as he thinks.  He looks around his 
           restaurant, the sum total of his life’s work.  
           The ferocious beauty of his menu.  The havoc he has caused.  
           Somehow his entire life has led up to this very moment.  He 
           nods.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        One moment, please.

           LATER 

           Chef Slowik hands Margot a TO-GO BAG.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        Thank you for dining at Hawthorn.  

           Margot goes on tippy-toe to spot her husband, still washing 
           dishes.  He pauses to look back, smiling wistfully, perhaps 
           offering a final little wave.  She blows him a kiss.

                                 MARGOT
                            (to Chef)
                        Thank you for everything. 

           She reaches into her purse and hands him a ten-dollar bill.

                                 MARGOT (CONT’D)
                        Keep the change.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                            (handing it over)
                        And don’t forget your gift bag.
                        Tonight’s menu is included along 
                        with a little personal memento to 
                        remember us by.

                                 MARGOT
                        Goodnight.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        Goodnight.

           Margot walks out of the restaurant, free to go.   The sneaky 
           camera crew try to follow her out, but Slowik stops them.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        Where do you think you’re going?  
                        Have you no respect for your craft?

           They sadly shuffle back inside.  Chef Slowik CLAPS.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK (CONT’D)
                        So.  Before our final dessert 
                        course, there is, as they say, the 
                        matter of the bill.
           Servers place CHECKS on the tables, along with little 
           Hawthorn gift bags.  The movie star reaches for his wallet, 
           as does Ted Bloom, until Gretchen stops him.

                                 GRETCHEN
                        No, this is on the magazine.

                                 TED BLOOM
                        You sure?

                                 GRETCHEN
                        Absolutely.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        We are on a no-tip system, so 
                        gratuity is included.  Also, please 
                        enjoy your gift bags.  A few 
                        goodies in there -- a booklet 
                        listing our local suppliers, some 
                        house-made granola, chocolate 
                        truffles, a human finger, and a 
                        copy of tonight’s menu. 

           Using his only good hand, Richard reaches for his wallet and 
           hands it to Anne.

                                 RICHARD
                        Can you take out my Amex?

           The tech bros all toss in a credit card.  They’re splitting 
           it four ways.

                                 CHEF SLOWIK
                        And now, our final dessert course 
                        is a play on the traditional 
                        campfire classic -- the s’more. 

           EXT. HAWTHORN ISLAND - NIGHT

           From afar we see Margot board the coast guard boat.

           INT. COAST GUARD BOAT - NIGHT

           Margot steers the boat with one hand on the wheel, gazing 
           wearily into the distance, Hawthorn Island at her back.  
           BRIGHT FLAMES rise inside the restaurant.

           Margot’s other hand rises into frame holding the leftover 
           cheeseburger.  She takes a bite. 
                                 AGAINST BLACK, TITLE CARD: 

                                    “FINAL COURSE”

           EXT. HAWTHORN ISLAND - MORNING

           Daylight has finally arrived. 

           FIREFIGHTERS AND EMERGENCY CREW WORKERS scavenge through the 
           charred remains of Hawthorn Restaurant.  We STEADICAM through 
           the wreckage, passing the remains of the dining room, the 
           remains of the kitchen, and the remains of the diners and 
           staff.

           A SUPERIMPOSED TITLE reads: “FINAL DESSERT COURSE: ‘S’MORE’ - 
           marshmallow, chocolate, graham cracker, customers, staff, 
           restaurant.”

           We finally reach the locked SILVER DOOR, the portal to the 
           room inside, which remarkably has not burned.  It’s like a 
           jumbo-sized version of the black box of an airplane.  

           Officers blow the door with an explosive charge, and it flies 
           open in a plume of smoke.

           We continue in through the door.  When the smoke clears, we 
           see the interior --

           A beautiful, perfectly preserved office like the one in which 
           Margot used the radio.  Only this one has three small TABLES 
           lined up side by side. 

           On the left-hand table is the camera from the documentary 
           crew along with all of their tapes. 

           On the right-hand table is Chef Slowik’s smiling severed head 
           on a platter.

           And on the middle table are Chef Slowik’s two severed hands, 
           positioned perfectly upright so that they are holding Chef 
           Slowik’s menu, with all of the courses we saw the night 
           before, listed in order.

           The shot stops once the MENU fills the ENTIRE FRAME.

           A SUPERIMPOSED TITLE APPEARS: 

                               “THE MENU”
