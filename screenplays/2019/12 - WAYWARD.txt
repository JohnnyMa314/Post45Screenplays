          John Zaozirny, Jeff Portnoy / Bellevue
           FADE IN:

           NORTHEAST OKLAHOMA

           We’re gliding over endless acres of cropland and cattle 
           pastures, dotted with swamps and bursts of prairie trees. 

           It’s mid-April in the heartland, green and alive.

           Descending along a two-lane COUNTRY HIGHWAY, we lock onto -

           A single PICKUP TRUCK heading east.

           IN THE TRUCK

           A woman lies across the seat, her head resting on the 
           driver’s leg.

           She is CLAIRE (30s) and she watches the sky unspool across 
           the windshield. Her dress flutters, tossed by the rush of 
           breeze through the open windows. Barefoot, free and easy.

           She peers up at the driver, ERIK (30s). The setting sun rings 
           his scruffy hair in gold. 

           One of Erik’s hands rests lazily on the steering wheel, the 
           other caresses Claire’s exposed shoulder. A subtle touch, but 
           one that quickens Claire’s heart rate, desire building.

           Wherever they’re going, they can’t get there soon enough.

           INT. RENTAL CABIN - DUSK

           A rustic getaway, peacefully dormant. The last light of day 
           slices through the windows. Then -

           WE HEAR the sound of ERIK’S TRUCK rumbling to a stop outside. 

           Claire and Erik’s playful VOICES, growing louder...

                                 ERIK (O.S.)
                        C’mere!

                                 CLAIRE (O.S.)
                        What are you doing?

           A key rattles in the lock and the door swings open. Erik 
           carries a laughing Claire across the threshold.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                        You’re going to hurt yourself.
           With an exaggerated groan, Erik sets Claire on her feet. He 
           closes the door, shutting them inside. 

           Claire’s eyes sweep the room. 

                                 ERIK
                        So what do you think?

                                 CLAIRE
                        It’s cute. How do you know this 
                        place?

           Claire drifts across the room, deliberate, conscious of 
           Erik’s hungry gaze on her.

                                 ERIK
                        I used to hole up here every time I 
                        thought I could write a novel.

           She peers out a window at a pristine lake. They’re very  
           alone here.

                                 CLAIRE
                        And how much writing do you plan to 
                        get done tonight?

                                 ERIK
                        I believe that’s up to you.

           Enough words. They come together in a fervid kiss, long-
           awaited. Clothes are hoisted off.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CABIN - MOMENTS LATER

           Claire and Erik make urgent love on the floor. 

           Claire is on top of Erik, controlling their rhythm, 
           fulfilling a deep need.

           RAINDROPS dapple the windows, just a few at first...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CABIN - NIGHT

           A RAINSTORM is now pounding the roof.

           Claire and Erik lie on the floor, wrapped in a blanket. 
           Claire stares at the FIRE crackling in the fireplace. 

           We hear ERIK TALKING, but it’s muffled, distant. Then, Claire 
           emerges from her trance -
                                 CLAIRE
                        Hm?

                                 ERIK
                        Your hands.

           She sees he’s examining her hand in the glow.

                                 CLAIRE
                        What about them?

                                 ERIK
                        I was saying they remind me of a 
                        Mayan carving I once saw down on 
                        the Yucatan. The goddess Ix-Chel.

                                 CLAIRE
                        She’s got stubby little fingers?

                                 ERIK
                        She’s got beautiful fingers. I love 
                        her fingers.

           He kisses her hand.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I want to see that carving.

                                 ERIK
                        Okay. We’ll leave in the morning.

           An exhilarating thought, one they live in for a beat.

                                 ERIK (CONT'D)
                        You warm enough?

                                 CLAIRE
                             (basking)
                        Mm-hm.

                                 ERIK
                        Good, then I’ll be right back.

           He stands, begins dressing.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Where are you going?

                                 ERIK
                        Into the wild to slay us a feast.
                             (off her look)
                        There’s a great barbecue shack up 
                        the road.
                                 CLAIRE
                        You’re leaving me for a rack of 
                        ribs.

           He kneels next to her.

                                 ERIK
                        Of course not. I’m leaving you for 
                        the brisket.

           Claire grabs him, they wrestle playfully. A final kiss.

                                 ERIK (CONT'D)
                        Don’t go anywhere.

           He heads for the door.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Don’t come back without cornbread. 
                        Your goddess commands it.

           Her eyes return to the fire.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           Through the rain, we barely make out the sight of -

           A MAN walking along the road, soaked to the bone, wearing 
           frayed flannel and denim. He looks up to see -

           ERIK’S TRUCK pulling onto the highway, disappearing down the 
           road.

           The man considers THE CABIN down the driveway. No lights on.

           INT. BATHROOM - CABIN - NIGHT

           Claire starts the shower, steps in.

           EXT. CABIN FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

           The man steps to the door. 

           His name is RONNIE and we see him clearly in the harsh glow 
           of the porch light: 40s, hollow eyes. Water slicks off his 
           greasy hair and beard.

                                 RONNIE
                        Hello - ?

           No answer. He knocks again.
                                 RONNIE (CONT'D)
                        Anyone here?

           INT. SHOWER - CABIN - SAME

           Claire can’t hear the knocking over the running water.

           EXT. CABIN FRONT DOOR - SAME

           Ronnie tests the doorknob, locked. 

           He peers into a nearby window. He pushes on the sash, the 
           window slides open.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CABIN - MOMENTS LATER

           Ronnie moves through the darkness, over the strewn clothes.

           He hears the sound of a RUNNING SHOWER. He steps to the 
           BATHROOM DOOR, pushes it open a crack, looks in and sees -

           A blurry CLAIRE, visible through the translucent curtain. 

           After a moment, Ronnie turns away, gets down to business:

           He sifts through the pockets of their clothes. Steals an IPAD 
           from Erik’s backpack, digs through Claire’s MAKEUP BAG and 
           finds - 

           Her giant DIAMOND RING. Jackpot.

           INT. BATHROOM - SAME

           Claire turns off the shower, reaches for a towel.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Ronnie hears the shower stop. Frantic, he gathers his loot 
           and hurries toward the exit just as - 

           The front door opens and ERIK ENTERS.

                                 ERIK
                             (calling out)
                        Guess who forgot his wallet -

           Then he sees Ronnie.

           Both men freeze, taking in the reality of each other.
                                 ERIK (CONT'D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 RONNIE
                        Nothin’, man. I’m just leavin’. 
                        Don’t look at my face.

           Erik is hit with a wave of panic.

                                 ERIK
                             (yelling)
                        Claire!?

                                 RONNIE
                        I didn’t touch her. I swear. 

           Erik instinctively reaches for a weapon - grabs a wrought 
           iron FIREPLACE POKER.

                                 RONNIE (CONT'D)
                        I lost my job today. I was just 
                        lookin’ for somethin’ to pawn.

           But Erik isn’t hearing him.

           BATHROOM

           Claire has slipped into a t-shirt and underwear. Oblivious to 
           the confrontation in the next room.

                                 ERIK (O.S.)
                        Claire!

                                 CLAIRE
                        Be right out.

           LIVING ROOM

           Ronnie drops the stolen goods to the floor.

                                 RONNIE
                        Here, just take your shit.

           He dashes to the BACKDOOR, but it’s bolted shut. Dead end.

                                 RONNIE (CONT'D)
                        Fuck.

           Then, as he turns back -

           The BATHROOM DOOR OPENS and Claire steps out, between Erik 
           and Ronnie. Claire goes rigid at the sight of the intruder.
                                 ERIK
                             (to Claire)
                        Get back in there!

           Ronnie is a caged animal. He GRABS CLAIRE, wraps an arm 
           around her neck. She flails, fighting to get away.

                                 RONNIE
                        Lemme through and I let her go!

                                 ERIK
                        You’re choking her!

           Erik stalks closer, wielding the poker.

                                 RONNIE
                        Drop that fucking thing!

           Claire grasps for any piece of Ronnie. Her hand finds HIS 
           EAR. She grabs it, digs in with her fingernails.

           Ronnie YELLS, THROWS CLAIRE away from him. Her body SLAMS 
           into a heap of firewood.

           Erik drives at Ronnie with the poker. But Ronnie TACKLES ERIK 
           against the wall. They lock up in a BRAWL, gouging, clawing.

           ON CLAIRE

           For a moment, she drifts in a haze. Her focus sharpens as 
           oxygen returns to her brain. She turns to see -

           Ronnie overpowering Erik.

                                 ERIK
                        Claire, go -

           Claire considers the front door, then Erik. A choice.

           She stands and rushes to Erik’s aid. She grabs Ronnie from 
           behind, fights to pry him off.

           The whole cabin seems to sway as the three of them wrestle 
           along the wall. And then -

           It’s like the wall holding them up vanishes. They fall into 
           the BLACK VOID of the -

           OPEN CELLAR DOOR

           A violent clatter as three bodies crash down a FLIGHT OF 
           STAIRS into -
           DARKNESS

           The sound of pressured breathing is all we hear. Then -

                                 CLAIRE
                        Erik?

                                 ERIK
                        I’m okay. Jesus Christ -

                                 CLAIRE
                        Where is he?

                                 ERIK
                        I’ve got him. Are you hurt?

                                 CLAIRE
                        No.

                                 ERIK
                        Get upstairs.

           She scurries up the staircase. Feels for a light switch. She 
           finds it and CLICK, the cellar is ILLUMINATED, revealing -

           A battered Erik lies on top of Ronnie at the bottom of the 
           stairs. Erik climbs off him to see -

           Ronnie’s NECK CONTORTED in a fatal position, eyes open and 
           ghostly still. DEAD.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Wisps of smoke are all that remain of the fire. Rain 
           continues to batter the roof.

           Claire and Erik sit in the dark. The closed CELLAR DOOR looms 
           large across the room.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Everything they’ve done for me - I 
                        can’t do this to them.

           She looks at Erik with tortured, pleading eyes. Erik escapes 
           to the far side of the room, calculating.

                                 ERIK
                             (a solution)
                        Then I was here alone. He broke in, 
                        I defended myself.

           He lifts her to her feet. 
                                 ERIK (CONT'D)
                        It’s going to be okay. But we have 
                        to get you home. C’mon -

           THEN -

           HEADLIGHTS slice through the blinds. Erik hurries to a window 
           to see -

           A CAR has pulled up outside.

           INT. FRONT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Erik cracks the door open. A chirpy woman (PATTY, 50s) steps 
           to the cabin.

                                 PATTY
                        Hey, I'm Patty. I took your 
                        reservation.

                                 ERIK
                        Yeah, hi.

                                 PATTY
                        With this old roof, you’re gonna 
                        need these to catch some leaks.

           She holds up a stack of empty buckets. Erik takes them.

                                 ERIK
                        Alright, thank you.

                                 PATTY
                        I’da brought extra towels if I knew 
                        you had company.

                                 ERIK
                        It’s just me.

                                 PATTY
                        Well, you must look prettier than a 
                        pie supper in that dress.

           Erik follows her gaze to a chair where Claire’s DRESS AND BRA 
           are draped. He searches for words -

                                 PATTY (CONT'D)
                             (a knowing wink)
                        Sorry to interrupt.

           Patty heads back to her car. Erik closes the door, locks it. 
           Claire exits the bedroom where she’s been hiding. She and 
           Erik exchange a helpless look, as we -

                                                                CUT TO:

                                      TITLE: WAYWARD

           EXT. RANSOM, OKLAHOMA - MORNING

           We’re rolling through RANSOM, OKLAHOMA on a perfectly 
           cloudless July day.

           It’s THREE MONTHS LATER.

           Once a rough-and-tumble frontier town, Ransom is now an 
           upbeat Tulsa suburb. The housing developments and big box 
           stores say the city is thriving, but there’s still an element 
           of poverty that’s been neatly pushed to the fringes.

           But it’s SUNDAY MORNING, and both rich and poor are headed in 
           the same direction. Moving with them is -

           A 1961 JAGUAR COUPÉ, a shiny collectible.

           IN THE CAR

           Claire rides in the passenger’s seat. She wears a designer 
           dress and heels, her hair and makeup precise. 

           There’s no amount of makeup, though, that can hide the tired 
           torment in her eyes. She mindlessly twists her WEDDING RING, 
           a nervous habit.

           Claire sneaks a look at the driver -

           SETH LEWIS (30s). Claire’s husband sits tall and in-control 
           behind the wheel. But his fingers drumming the gearshift 
           betray a worried mind.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Just ‘cause it’s a big day doesn’t 
                        mean you can’t enjoy it.

           It breaks Seth from his anxious daze.

                                 SETH
                        I’m enjoying it.
                             (off Claire’s look)
                        I am.
           BEEWP! A MOTORCYCLE COP has pulled up next to the car. The 
           officer gestures for Seth to follow him.

           Seth tails the POLICE ESCORT around the gridlock of cars. 
           Starstruck motorists wave as Seth and Claire pass.

                                 SETH (V.O.)
                        How do you describe you?

           EXT. NEW DAWN CHURCH - MORNING

           A modern megachurch, the biggest show in town. Actually, by 
           the looks of the traffic coming off the I-44 freeway, it’s 
           the biggest show within a hundred miles.

           The cars funnel into a massive PARKING LOT. They’re directed 
           by cheery VOLUNTEERS in vests that read “Greet Team.”

                                 SETH (V.O.)
                        When you look in the mirror every 
                        morning, what’s the first thing you 
                        say about yourself? “I’m tired? I’m 
                        old? I’m fat? I’m a failure?” Maybe 
                        some combination of those things.

           EXT. NEW DAWN CHURCH - WELCOME GATES - MORNING

           As they enter the sprawling property, visitors are met with 
           signs: “You Belong Here!” and “You Are Loved!”

                                 SETH (V.O.)
                        I’m giving you a challenge. 
                        Tomorrow morning when you drag 
                        yourself to that dreaded mirror, I 
                        want you saying just one thing: “I 
                        am saved.”

           EXT. NEW DAWN CHURCH - CAMPUS - MORNING

           New Dawn’s well-funded CAMPUS boasts a food court, childcare 
           complex, fitness center, gift shop. FAMILIES play lawn games 
           in the grassy common area.

                                 SETH (V.O.)
                        It’s the only description of 
                        yourself that will ever matter. Say 
                        it with me: “I am saved.” And being 
                        saved makes you perfect in the eyes 
                        of God.

           Overlooking it all is...
           INT. SETH’S OFFICE - MORNING

           Exact and orderly, the room’s focal point is a polished GOLD 
           SCULPTURE mounted to the wall. A shiny Pentecostal flame. 

           Seth is alone. He stares into the sculpture, rehearsing his 
           weekly message to his own gilded reflection.

                                 SETH
                        And there’s no secret to it. It’s 
                        right there for the taking. Like 
                        the blind beggar on the road to 
                        Jerusalem in Luke 18 who asked the 
                        Lord to restore his sight -

           He trails off, checks the script on his IPAD.

                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                        Like the blind beggar on the road 
                        to Jericho. 
                             (furious with himself)
                        Jericho. JERICHO –

           In here, Seth lets himself be vulnerable, naked -

           There’s a KNOCK on the door.

                                 STAGE MANAGER (O.S.)
                        Pastor Seth. Fifteen minutes.

                                 SETH
                             (gritted teeth)
                        Thank you.

           Seth is derailed. He crosses to the guest couch, buries his 
           face between the cushions - 

           AND SCREAMS. Releasing pent-up emotion into the upholstery.

           Seth finishes, red-faced. He collects himself, tries on a 
           confident look in the sculpture reflection. Then exits.

           INT. READY ROOM - NEW DAWN - LATER

           Thirty STAFF MEMBERS hold hands in a circle. Associate 
           pastors, musicians, technical crew, coordinators.

           Seth leads them in a PRE-SERVICE PRAYER. There’s passion in 
           his words, a faithful believer -

                                 SETH
                        - may our words and music touch the 
                        hearts of those who came today.
           Claire stands with Seth, their hands locked. Her head is 
           bowed, eyes closed.

                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                        And Father, as our ministry embarks 
                        on the next leg of its journey, may 
                        we continue to prove ourselves your 
                        worthy servants. We pray this in 
                        Jesus’s name. Amen.

           Claire whispers “Amen,” along with the group.

                                 STAGE MANAGER
                        Alright. Worship Team, to your 
                        marks.

           The energy ratchets up, the frenzy of a busy newsroom.

           Seth calls out -

                                 SETH
                        Hey, Erik?

           Claire turns to see -

           ERIK,

           moving toward them. Haggard, in need of a shave. The same 
           despair in his face as Claire.

           Erik and Claire avoid eye contact.

                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                        Mornin’, Erik. We baptizing you 
                        today?

                                 ERIK
                        No, my soul’s as clean as it’s 
                        gonna get.

           Seth laughs at their weekly banter. Claire does not.

                                 ERIK (CONT'D)
                             (to Claire)
                        Good morning.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Morning.

           They share a charged look before Claire walks away. 

           We stay with Seth and Erik -
                                 SETH
                        I want to try a different verse in 
                        the coda. Acts 2:38 was my dad’s 
                        go-to.

                                 ERIK
                        First John 1:9?

                                 SETH
                        First John -

           He digs into his Bible, but Erik cuts him off -

                                 ERIK
                             (from memory)
                        “If we confess our sins, he is 
                        faithful and just and will forgive 
                        and purify us from 
                        unrighteousness.”

                                 SETH
                        I’m sorry, but you can’t know your 
                        scripture that well and call 
                        yourself an atheist.

                                 ERIK
                        Maybe I’m an atheist because I know 
                        my scripture that well.

           Seth marvels at his non-believing sermon writer.

                                 SETH
                        No, there’s devotion in there. 
                        You’re not hiding anything from me. 
                             (back to work)
                        Okay, slug that verse into the 
                        script. Make sure Graphics has the 
                        change.

           ACROSS THE ROOM

           Claire waits alone, twisting her wedding ring.

                                 GIDEON (O.S.)
                        Young lady, do you know who might 
                        have my sermon notes?

           Claire turns to GIDEON LEWIS (70). The founding patriarch of 
           New Dawn, now losing a battle with dementia. Despite his 
           failing mind, Gideon still holds sway over this place.

                                 GIDEON (CONT'D)
                        I can’t seem to find them.
                                 CLAIRE
                        Mr. Lewis, your son Seth is leading 
                        the service again this week.

                                 GIDEON
                        Who’s doing the preaching?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Seth.

                                 GIDEON
                        That doesn’t sound right.

                                 CLAIRE
                        He’s been at it for a while now -

           JUNE LEWIS swoops in. In her late 60s, Seth’s mother is the 
           picture of poise.

                                 JUNE
                        Gideon, dear, why don’t you sit 
                        down and relax a minute?

           June helps him to a chair.

                                 GIDEON
                        Alright, but I’d like to go over my 
                        sermon notes.

                                 JUNE
                             (infinite patience)
                        I’ll see if I can find them for 
                        you.

           June moves off, returns to Claire’s side. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        I hope I didn’t confuse him.

                                 JUNE
                        He’s fine. As long as he’s here, 
                        the man’s in heaven. Wish it didn’t 
                        make Seth so jumpy.

           June studies Claire. There’s a remoteness to her.

                                 JUNE (CONT'D)
                        When's the last time he took you 
                        out? And not a donor dinner. A real 
                        date.

           Claire thinks, but nothing comes.
                                 JUNE (CONT'D)
                        He’ll be hearing from me about 
                        that.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Please, don’t. This broadcast deal 
                        has him stretched so thin.

           June recognizes a familiar echo. 

                                 JUNE
                        Married to a man that’s married to 
                        his church. It’s a quandary. And 
                        Lord, if you dare complain -
                             (a shrill impression)
                        “Can you believe that ungrateful 
                        preacher's wife? Her man don't 
                        gamble, he don't run around, he 
                        ain’t a boozer. What’s she got to 
                        bellyache about?”

           Claire lightens, buoyed by their kinship.

                                 JUNE (CONT'D)
                        They can't give love if they’re not 
                        getting it. That's our job. We’re 
                        the fuel source that can’t run dry. 
                        But what do I say?

                                 CLAIRE
                        God’s got it.

                                 JUNE
                        That’s right, sweetie. God’s got 
                        it.

           Stage Manager enters the room -

                                 STAGE MANAGER
                        Five minutes to worship.

           INT. WORSHIP CENTER - DAY

           A crowd of 4,000 CHURCHGOERS are on their feet, young and 
           old, wealthy and poor. They sing along to lyrics projected 
           onto screens around the auditorium. 

           On stage, New Dawn’s WORSHIP BAND plays an OPENING ROCK HYMN. 
           Choreographed lights and haze machines give the feel of a 
           rock concert.

           June and Gideon take their “reserved” seats in the front row. 
           Gideon winces, disoriented by the lights and loudness.
           INT. BACKSTAGE - SAME

           Claire waits in the darkness of the bustling stage wings. 

           Across the room, Seth is fitted with a headset microphone.

           Claire feels a presence next to her. It’s Erik, eyes buried 
           in a sermon script.

                                 ERIK
                             (a whisper)
                        Did you see the news?

           Claire stares straight ahead, their lips barely move.

                                 CLAIRE
                        What news?

           Erik muscles out the words -

                                 ERIK
                        They found him.

           Claire’s heart drops through the floor.

                                 ERIK (CONT'D)
                        I’m sorry, Claire.
                             (fumbling)
                        I didn’t - I’m sorry.

           Claire is blank, unable to react.

           On stage, the band hits their final chord.

                                 STAGE MANAGER
                        Seth and Claire, stand by.

           Seth grabs Claire’s lifeless hand.

                                 STAGE MANAGER (CONT'D)
                        And, you’re on.

           Claire staggers forward as Seth leads her into the lights -

           ON STAGE

           Worshipers APPLAUD their favorite Christian couple.

           Claire forces a smile, but she’s haunted by Erik’s words.

           Seth escorts Claire to her special ON-STAGE SEAT near the 
           band. She sits.
           Seth turns his attention to his flock. They wait for it -

                                 SETH
                             (finally)
                        Who’s here for Jesus?

           The crowd erupts with LOUD PRAISE, Bibles in the air.

                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                        Good. You’re in the right place. 
                             (takes it in)
                        Lord, what a sight.

           Seth is warm and folksy, a salt-of-the-earth vessel for God’s 
           word.

                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                        A couple things before we get 
                        started: First, if you know me at 
                        all, you know how much my family 
                        means to me. Which is why I'm so 
                        thrilled to welcome home my big 
                        brother Ben.

           He points to the FRONT ROW -

           Sitting next to June and Gideon is BEN LEWIS (late-30s). 
           Broad shoulders, tight haircut, world-weary eyes.

           A camera projects BEN’s face on the VIDEO SCREENS. 

                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                        After years of overseas defense 
                        work, Ben is back with us as our 
                        new Head of Security. 
                             (audience applause)
                        I love you, buddy. It's good to 
                        have you home.

           Ben nods, anxious to have his face off the screens.

                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                        Another thing: My lovely wife still 
                        needs volunteers to help fill 
                        fifteen hundred Purpose Packs next 
                        week.

           Claire snaps to attention. She’s been lost in thought.

                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                        Claire’s been working her tail off 
                        all summer to round up food, 
                        clothing, and hygiene products for 
                        the needy of the Tulsa County area.

                                 (MORE)
                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                        So if you can lend a hand, call the 
                        volunteer office to find out all 
                        the wheres and whens.

           Finally, the announcement he’s been dying to make -

                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                        One last thing - and this - well, 
                        it’s an answer to prayer: Three 
                        Sundays from now, we'll be taping 
                        our first broadcast for nationally 
                        syndicated television. 

           A MURMUR goes up among the worshipers.

                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                        The church my dad started in an 
                        empty shoe store forty years ago 
                        will now be seen in homes all 
                        across the country. It’s going to 
                        be a new day for New Dawn.

           ON GIDEON

           He turns to June -

                                 GIDEON
                        What’s he talking about?

                                 JUNE
                        All good things.

           BACK ON SETH

                                 SETH
                        And we couldn’t have gotten here 
                        without your prayers and 
                        generosity. But we’re gonna need 
                        more of both to keep it going. So 
                        when that plate is passed around 
                        later, I hope you’ll give what you 
                        can so that we may shout the Lord’s 
                        message into a world that so 
                        desperately needs it.

           Seth basks in the crowd’s excitement.

           It takes all of Claire’s energy to maintain a smile.
           EXT. NEW DAWN COURTYARD - DAY

           The service is over. Claire and Seth mingle with delighted 
           church members.

           Seth gives his undivided attention to everyone. It’s easy to 
           see why he’s so loved.

           Claire plays her part, but her mind is elsewhere...

           INT. SETH’S OFFICE - DAY

           Claire waits while Seth meets with New Dawn directors: DAVID 
           (Operations) and LIZ (Media), along with a gathering of 
           lieutenants.

           We don’t hear what they’re saying, we’re just fixed on 
           Claire. Absent, she watches as -

           An accounting clerk stacks CASH into a cube safe in the 
           corner of Seth’s office. Sunday’s offering.

           EXT. LEWIS HOME - DAY

           Claire and Seth’s mansion stands tall behind a set of gates. 
           A lawn manicured to country club standards.

           EXT. BACKYARD BASKETBALL COURT - DAY

           Seth shoots hoops on his private court, driving hard against 
           an invisible opponent. 

           When he misses a lay-up, he immediately lines up the shot 
           again. Striving for perfection.

           EXT. PORCH - DAY

           Claire huddles on a porch swing, knees to her chest. She 
           swipes through her phone and lands on a NEWS HEADLINE: 

                            “BODY BURIED ON RANCH IDENTIFIED” 

           She tenses as she reads the story, her head swimming. A line 
           plagues her: “...survived by daughter Adelaine Brooks...”

           Claire scrolls further and stops on - 

           A PHOTO
           The scene of the body’s discovery: Cops, a forensic team. 
           Behind police tape, curious locals look on. Among them is -

           A TEENAGE GIRL. Hand to her mouth, tears imminent, a girl 
           whose world is falling apart.

           Claire’s eyes dampen as she focuses on the girl. Then -

                                 SETH (O.S.)
                        Hey, you busy?

           Seth stands over her, sweat-drenched from his work out. 

           A startled Claire hides her phone screen.

                                 CLAIRE
                        No.

           He pulls the swing toward him, rocking Claire into a kiss.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                        Why?

           He swings her into another kiss. She’s thrown by the 
           unexpected affection.

                                 SETH
                        I just got a calendar alert. It’s 
                        Day Thirteen of your cycle.

           Instantly less sexy.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I thought you had to be on a call.

                                 SETH
                        In twenty minutes.

           He senses Claire’s hesitation.

                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                        That book says it’s a good day to 
                        try.

                                 CLAIRE
                             (gingerly)
                        I know - I’m just not feeling a 
                        hundred percent.

                                 SETH
                        I’ll be the one doing all the work.

           Seth stops the swing, holds Claire suspended away from him.
                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                             (growing irritation)
                        I’m up there giving family advice 
                        without a family of my own. How do 
                        you think that looks?

           A flash of his underlying temper. Claire relents before it 
           becomes a thing -

                                 CLAIRE
                        Okay, I’ll be right there.

           Seth releases the swing and gives Claire a final kiss.

                                 SETH
                        I feel good about this. Lucky 
                        thirteen.

           He heads into the house. When he’s out of sight -

           Claire deletes the BROWSING HISTORY on her phone.

           INT. BEDROOM - DAY

           Seth is on top of Claire, penetrating her. She lies there, 
           detached from the process. 

           When Seth finishes his work, he climbs off Claire, kneels 
           next to the bed. He takes her hand and prays silently.

           After a moment, he stands, kisses Claire on the forehead. He 
           exits, leaving Claire to her nagging thoughts.

           INT. BATHROOM - DAY

           Claire is in the shower when she’s hit with sudden dread. She 
           pulls back the curtain, scans the room, confirms she’s alone. 

           She returns to her shower.

           INT. BATHROOM - LATER

           Claire stands in a towel, frozen. Finally - 

           She wills herself to move. Reaches into a drawer and pulls 
           out a well-worn MAKEUP BAG.
           INT. CLAIRE'S CAR (MERCEDES) - MOVING - DAY

           Claire drives toward the prairie outskirts of town. She 
           glances up to see -

           A glossy BILLBOARD advertisement for NEW DAWN CHURCH. 

           SETH & CLAIRE’S FACES smile down from it, warm and welcoming.

           Claire averts her look, accelerates past the billboard.

           EXT. SAINT MARY MAGDALENE CATHOLIC CHURCH - MORNING

           Off a forsaken country road -

           The modest church is nestled into a grove of hackberry trees. 
           Its white lap-siding is twenty years overdue for a fresh coat 
           of paint. 

           CLAIRE’S CAR is parked behind the church, hidden from view.

           INT. SAINT MARY MAGDALENE’S - DAY

           Empty and silent. Relief sculptures line the walls: The 
           Stations of the Cross, depictions of Christ’s sacrifice, 
           growing progressively more brutal.

           A mahogany CONFESSIONAL stands in a dark corner...

           IN THE CONFESSIONAL

           Claire sits in the cramped blackness. She’s looking at her 
           phone, transfixed by the TEENAGE GIRL in the NEWS PHOTO.

           The latticed window slides open. FATHER PEREZ (60s) appears 
           on the other side, a face as cracked as Dust Bowl soil.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Bless me, father, for I have 
                        sinned. It’s been -

           Perez knows the voice.

                                 FATHER PEREZ
                        Three days.

                                 CLAIRE
                        - three days since my last 
                        confession.
                                 FATHER PEREZ
                        Are you here with the same sins?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Yes.

                                 FATHER PEREZ
                        It’s not necessary to continue 
                        coming back like this.

           They’ve been through this before. Claire waits for something, 
           anything that will help.

                                 FATHER PEREZ (CONT'D)
                        You’ve done everything I’ve 
                        instructed?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Yes.

                                 FATHER PEREZ
                        You’ve ended your affair?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Yes.

                                 FATHER PEREZ
                        This incident you won’t discuss 
                        with me – you’ve taken it to the 
                        Lord?

                                 CLAIRE
                        More times than I can count.

                                 FATHER PEREZ
                        Then you’re forgiven, Claire.

                                 CLAIRE
                             (unsatisfied)
                        So when do I start feeling 
                        forgiven?

                                 FATHER PEREZ
                        Perhaps when you decide whose 
                        absolution you’re after. Because 
                        I’m not certain it’s God’s.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Will you just say the words, 
                        father?

                                 FATHER PEREZ
                        If it’s a police matter, speaking 
                        to them may bring some relief -
                                 CLAIRE
                        Please just say the words.

           Perez gives her a pitying look. He relents, raises his hand.

                                 FATHER PEREZ
                        May God give you pardon and peace. 
                        I absolve you from your sins in the 
                        name of the Father, and of the Son, 
                        and of the Holy Spirit.

           Claire waits, but the comfort she craves doesn’t come.

           INT. CLAIRE’S CAR - MOVING - DAY

           Claire drives a BACKWOODS ROAD, eyes searching. She 
           approaches a gravel DRIVEWAY.

           A decrepit MAILBOX dangles into the road, peppered with 
           buckshot. The name “BROOKS” is barely legible on it.

           The driveway leads to a RUNDOWN HOUSE, the weather-beaten 
           look of a sharecropper shack. 

           Claire scans the property, taking it all in. Then, she sees 
           someone in the yard -

           THE TEENAGE GIRL, the one from the photo. The girl looks up 
           at Claire’s passing car.

           Suddenly self-conscious, Claire accelerates away from the 
           house. But -

           She slows to a stop.

           Behind the wheel, Claire twists her wedding ring. Her car 
           idles, waiting for her to make a decision.

           EXT. BROOKS HOME - MOMENTS LATER

           Claire’s car eases into the yard, shiny and out-of-place 
           among the scrap metal heaps and overgrown weeds.

           ADELAINE “ADDIE” BROOKS (the girl) steps forward, revealing 
           something not obvious in the news photo: She’s SIX MONTHS 
           PREGNANT, in hand-me-down maternity clothes.

           An uncertain Claire climbs out of the car.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Hi, there.
                                 ADDIE
                        You lost, ma’am?

                                 CLAIRE
                        It’s certainly possible. My name’s 
                        Claire Lewis. My husband is the 
                        senior pastor at New Dawn Church in 
                        Ransom.

                                 ADDIE
                        I thought you looked familiar. I 
                        see your picture all over.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Are you Adelaine?

                                 ADDIE
                        Only on my driver’s license. You 
                        can call me Addie.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I read about your father, Addie. 
                        And I wanted to tell you - on 
                        behalf of our church - how truly 
                        sorry we are for what happened.

           Claire tries to govern herself, but she can’t prevent real 
           emotion from escaping. Her sincerity touches Addie.

                                 ADDIE
                        It’s nice of you to come all the 
                        way out here to say that. I’ve got 
                        family just up the road who can’t 
                        even pick up the phone.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Well, our doors are always open. We 
                        have support groups, a lot of 
                        resources that can help folks 
                        dealing with a loss.

                                 ADDIE
                        Thank you.

           Addie catches Claire staring at her baby bump, grease smears 
           across her shirt.

                                 ADDIE (CONT'D)
                        I’m sorry I look a mess. I’ve been 
                        tinkerin’ with this air 
                        conditioner.

           On the ground is a disassembled window AC unit, twisted 
           coils, beyond repair.
                                 ADDIE (CONT'D)
                        If my daddy were here, he could fix 
                        it blindfolded.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Is your mother home?

                                 ADDIE
                        Nope.

                                 CLAIRE
                        When do you expect her?

                                 ADDIE
                        Three years, depending on her 
                        behavior. She’s locked up at 
                        Bassett.

                                 CLAIRE
                        You’re here alone?

                                 ADDIE
                        My boyfriend Kyle’s been staying 
                        with me.
                             (doesn’t want to 
                              elaborate)
                        You wanna come inside? It ain’t 
                        much cooler, but at least it’s out 
                        of the sun.

           INT. BROOKS HOME - DAY

           Claire sits on a tattered couch. She can’t take her eyes off -

           Addie, in the kitchen, scooping sugar into a pitcher of 
           instant lemonade.

                                 ADDIE
                        Don’t look at the place. I’m not 
                        much of a housekeeper.

                                 CLAIRE
                        You don’t need to wait on me.

           Claire scans the coffee table where NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS of 
           Ronnie’s killing are arranged in a ragged pile.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                        Have the police told you anything 
                        about the investigation?

                                 ADDIE
                        No.
           Claire carefully measures her tone -

                                 CLAIRE
                        So you don’t know if they have any 
                        suspects?

                                 ADDIE
                        Not that I’m aware of.

           Addie enters the room, hands Claire a lemonade.

                                 ADDIE (CONT'D)
                        Here you go.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Thanks.

           Addie collapses into a worn chair, turns sullen.

                                 ADDIE
                        Honestly, it could be anybody. A 
                        lot of folks hated my daddy. Around 
                        here they call my family The Brooks 
                        Crooks.

                                 CLAIRE
                        How clever.

                                 ADDIE
                        He was trying to change, though. 
                        When he found out he was going to 
                        be a granddad, he cleaned up, got a 
                        job. He was turning that backroom 
                        into a nursery. Things were looking 
                        up for the first time since mama 
                        got sent away -

           Addie cracks, tears gather. Attention turns to her belly.

                                 ADDIE (CONT'D)
                        I want to tell my boy to stay where 
                        he is. There ain’t nothing good out 
                        here.

           Claire fights her own tears.

                                 CLAIRE
                        How old are you, sweetie?

                                 ADDIE
                        I’m eighteen.
                             (moving on)
                        How’s the lemonade?
                                 CLAIRE
                        Nice and sweet.

           They sit in silence. Finally, Addie’s conscience gets her -

                                 ADDIE
                        I’m seventeen. I say eighteen 
                        ‘cause folks tend to judge. Sorry 
                        for lying to you.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I was born to a seventeen-year-old, 
                        so you’ll get no judgment from me.

           A comfort to Addie. Their moment is interrupted when -

           The front door opens and KYLE COLEMAN (20) enters, a 
           practiced swagger, a wishful dusting of facial hair.

                                 ADDIE
                        Hey, Kyle.

           Addie tenses, suddenly alert around her boyfriend.

                                 KYLE
                        Ads.

                                 ADDIE
                        This is Claire.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Hello.

           He clocks her, suspicious. A boy playing a hard-bitten man.

                                 KYLE
                        You from the bank, Claire?

                                 ADDIE
                        She’s from New Dawn Church.

                                 KYLE
                        I saw that fancy car and figured 
                        she was here to take the house.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I came to offer my condolences.

                                 ADDIE
                             (to Kyle, deflecting)
                        There’s fresh lemonade if you’re 
                        thirsty.

           Kyle stands like a guard dog next to Addie.
                                 KYLE
                        I’ll save you some trouble, Claire. 
                        There was no life insurance payout 
                        if your church is looking for a big 
                        donation.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I’m not here for money.

                                 KYLE
                             (incredulous)
                        Alright, ‘cause the funeral home 
                        already stole what it could.

           Addie is desperate to cut the tension.

                                 ADDIE
                        I pulled apart that AC unit, but I 
                        think it’s shot.

                                 KYLE
                        Then it’s another night of fans and 
                        ice packs. What time’s your shift?

                                 ADDIE
                        Four. But I can be a little late.

                                 CLAIRE
                             (gathers herself)
                        I’m sorry, I’m keeping you.

                                 ADDIE
                        You don’t have to run off.

                                 CLAIRE
                        It’s okay. I should be getting 
                        along.

           Claire stands, hands Addie her lemonade glass.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                        Like I said, if there’s anything 
                        you need.

           Addie smiles her appreciation. A prolonged look between them.

                                 KYLE
                             (not so subtle)
                        Thanks for stopping by.

           He’s at the door, holding it open for Claire.
           INT. ERIK’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           A nomad’s home. No furniture, artwork leaning against walls 
           where it’s meant to hang.

           Erik stands, drained of color, trying to take in everything 
           Claire just told him.

                                 ERIK
                        You were in his house.

           Claire busies herself, tidying Erik’s neglected mail, stacks 
           of dirty dishes.

                                 CLAIRE
                             (sheepish)
                        Yes.

           Before he can react -

                                 CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                        We left that girl with no one. 
                        Except a boyfriend that stinks of 
                        whiskey from ten feet away.

                                 ERIK
                        Claire -

                                 CLAIRE
                        She had to leave school. Six months 
                        pregnant and she’s mopping floors 
                        at the creamery to pay the bills. 

                                 ERIK
                        We didn’t do that to her. Her 
                        father did when he broke into a 
                        cabin and attacked two innocent 
                        people.

                                 CLAIRE
                             (innocent?)
                        Is that what we were?

                                 ERIK
                        Yes.

           Claire isn’t so sure. Erik moves in close.

                                 ERIK (CONT'D)
                        You have a beautiful heart and I 
                        know it aches like hell for people 
                        like her. But she’s trouble for us.
                                 CLAIRE
                        I grew up around men like her dad. 
                        His case is nothing more than a 
                        trailer trash feud to the police. 
                        No one’s looking in our direction -

                                 ERIK
                             (cuts her off)
                        So let’s keep it that way. We gave 
                        up our chance to come clean the 
                        moment I put him in the ground.
                             (catches himself)
                        I realize I’m in no place to give 
                        orders. I said I’d deal with our 
                        problem and I failed and that kills 
                        me. But please, don’t be the 
                        arsonist who gets caught coming 
                        back to watch the house burn down. 
                        Stay away from that girl.

           Claire hates to see him like this.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Okay.

           INT. ERIK’S GARAGE - LATER

           Claire’s car is parked inside. She sits behind the wheel. 
           Erik leans into her open window. A lingering goodbye.

                                 ERIK
                        Why do you have to go?

           He touches her, stirring desire in both of them.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Erik.

                                 ERIK
                        I’m sorry, I can’t just turn it 
                        off.

                                 CLAIRE
                        You think that’s what I did?

                                 ERIK
                        I’m the one begging you to stay.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I want to stay. I want to be the me 
                        I am with you. What we had was 
                        real, but it was wrong. And now 
                        we’re paying for it.
                                 ERIK
                        There’s no divine punishment, 
                        Claire -

                                 CLAIRE
                        If it were easy to turn off, I 
                        would have done it months before 
                        the cabin.

           Claire forces herself to start the car.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                        I have to go. He’s probably 
                        wondering where I am.

                                 ERIK
                        We both know he’s not.

           A comment Claire can’t refute.

           Erik moves off. Before he slips into the house, he hits the 
           automatic door opener. The garage door slides open.

           Claire backs out into the dark night.

           INT. SETH’S STUDY - LEWIS HOME - NIGHT

           Seth watches VIDEO of one of his father’s old sermons.

           Claire enters.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Seth?

                                 SETH
                        Yeah?

           Seth clicks off the video, self-conscious.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I was thinking - we haven’t done a 
                        Monday movie night in forever.

           Seth turns to the papers strewn across his desk.

                                 SETH
                        Wish I could, but - y’know -

                                 CLAIRE
                        “There’s no taking a break when the 
                        devil’s awake.”
                                 SETH
                        Nope.

           As expected. Claire turns to leave -

                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                        Hey, how you feeling?

           She turns back. He’s looking at her with genuine interest. 
           Before she can answer -

                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                        No morning sickness?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Not yet.

           A frustrated Seth returns to his work.

           Claire realizes the conversation is over. She’s dismissed.

           EXT. LEWIS HOME - DAY

           A sweltering July day, the hottest of the summer so far. An 
           oppressive sun beats down on –

           Claire, busying herself in her FLOWER GARDEN, weeding out the 
           imperfections.

           She stops, wipes the stinging sweat from her eyes.

           Unable to shake the thoughts that gnaw at her.

           INT. BROOKS HOME - DAY

           An overheated Addie sits inches from a fan, a wet rag against 
           her face. 

           There’s a KNOCK on the door. She stands, opens it -

           Claire is on the porch, a giant APPLIANCE BOX at her feet.

                                 ADDIE
                        Claire.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I’m sorry, but I can’t have you 
                        burning up in this oven. Hold the 
                        door, please.

           Addie watches as Claire wrestles the box into the house.
           INT. BEDROOM - BROOKS HOME - DAY

           Claire braces a new AIR CONDITIONER in the window. Addie sits 
           on the bed next to her.

                                 ADDIE
                        Kyle was riding bulls when we met. 
                        He was really making a name for 
                        himself. But he got stomped in San 
                        Antonio, tore his shoulder up real 
                        bad.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Phillips head.

                                 ADDIE
                             (hands her a screwdriver)
                        That pretty much ended his rodeo 
                        days.

                                 CLAIRE
                        And how about you? What do you 
                        want?

                                 ADDIE
                        Meanin’?

                                 CLAIRE
                        For your future.

           A question Addie is never asked. She’s embarrassed to be 
           voicing this -

                                 ADDIE
                        I don’t know. It sounds dumb, but - 
                        you ever been to Alaska?

                                 CLAIRE
                        No.

                                 ADDIE
                        Me neither. In fifth grade, though, 
                        I had to do a report on a state 
                        capital. I chose Juneau. I guess 
                        ‘cause of the fancy French name - 
                        and it’s about as far from here as 
                        you can get. I dunno, I’m sure it’s 
                        like any other town, but it’s 
                        always been this place I’d like to 
                        see.

           Addie’s been transported for a moment, but the reality of her  
           stuffy little bedroom rushes in.
                                 ADDIE (CONT'D)
                        If you’re asking what I don’t want, 
                        it’s my son growing up being called 
                        a Brooks Crook.

           Claire relates to the longing in her voice.

           After a final adjustment, Claire plugs in the AC power cord.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I think it’s ready. Would you like 
                        to do the honors?

                                 ADDIE
                        Sure. Just pray we don’t blow a 
                        fuse.

           Addie flips the power switch. A gust of icy air rolls out. 
           She closes her eyes, basking in the cold.

                                 ADDIE (CONT'D)
                        It’s incredible. Thank you.

           Claire watches Addie enjoy the cool relief, curls of hair 
           fluttering.

           The PRE-LAP sound of LAUGHING CHILDREN transitions us to -

           EXT. BACKYARD - JUNE & GIDEON’S HOME - DAY

           A garden party with the LEWIS FAMILY and FRIENDS. A world 
           away from Addie’s shack.

           Claire sits alone, watching the activity around her, an 
           island of solitude in the middle of it all:

           - Happy GRANDKIDS splash in the pool. 

           - Seth is in a work conversation with CHURCH EXECUTIVES.

           - Seth’s father Gideon shuffles across the grounds, followed 
           by his live-in caretaker MARIO (20s).

           Then Claire notices -

           Seth’s brother Ben, wandering the backyard, restless. He 
           lights a Marlboro and disappears into...

           EXT. SHADED CORNER - MOMENTS LATER

           Ben is on his knees, snapping dead leaves off a shrub. 
           Cigarette dangling from his lips.
           Claire approaches from behind -

                                 CLAIRE
                        Ben - ?

           A coiled spring, he spins to face her.

                                 BEN
                             (flustered)
                        Oh - hey.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I didn’t mean to sneak up on you.

                                 BEN
                        You didn’t. I’m - what’s up?

                                 CLAIRE
                        If you can spare it, I’d love to 
                        bum a smoke.

                                 BEN
                        Sure, of course.

           He fumbles out a pack, lights one for her.

           As his sleeve raises, Claire notices A TATTOO on his forearm: 
           Renaissance-inspired. A martyr tied to a tree, a dozen bloody 
           arrows driven into his body.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Saint Sebastian.

                                 BEN
                        You know him.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I was brought up Catholic. The 
                        martyrs were like comic book heroes 
                        to me.
                             (re: the tattoo)
                        That’s a brutal way to go.

                                 BEN
                        He actually survived the arrows. A 
                        woman came along and nursed him 
                        back to health. But when the Roman 
                        emperor found out, he had 
                        Sebastian’s head beaten in with 
                        clubs. That did the trick.

           Claire reacts to the violence that so casually rolls off his 
           tongue.
                                 BEN (CONT'D)
                        Sorry. I’m not good with party 
                        chitchat.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Neither am I. I suppose that’s why 
                        I’m hiding back here with you.

           They puff their cigarettes, a pair of outsiders.

                                 BEN
                        Catholic. So, you ever been to 
                        confession?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Once or twice.

                                 BEN
                        Did it help?

           Claire notes his hopeful yearning.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Why, do you have something to get 
                        off your chest?

           Ben weighs a response. Then -

           Gideon stomps past their hideout. Claire and Ben shield their 
           cigarettes like busted teenagers. When he’s gone -

           Claire notices Ben, still rigid, an old reflex.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                        It can’t be easy seeing him like 
                        this.

                                 BEN
                        He has no idea who I am, so we’re 
                        getting along better than ever.

           He chuckles, but Claire sees the ancient pain.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Honestly, I don’t know you either. 
                        Come have dinner with us some 
                        night. I promise - no party 
                        chitchat.

                                 BEN
                        You know I’m the family black 
                        sheep, right?
                                 CLAIRE
                        That still makes you part of the 
                        flock.

           A genuine kindness that Ben isn’t used to.

                                 BEN
                        Yeah, dinner sounds good. Thank 
                        you.

           The sound of a SMASHING GLASS is followed by -

                                 GIDEON (O.S.)
                        Don’t tell me to calm down!

           EXT. BACKYARD - SAME

           An agitated Gideon stands over a shattered glass of iced tea. 
           June is trying to reason with him.

                                 GIDEON
                        One of you has my car keys.

           Claire and Ben approach.

                                 JUNE
                        We’re all here, having a nice time, 
                        Gideon.

                                 GIDEON
                        And I’ve got a mountain of work to 
                        get through.

           Seth steps in to take charge.

                                 SETH
                        Dad? How about I drive you to the 
                        office a little later? After 
                        everyone’s gone home.

           Gideon studies Seth for a confused moment. Then, the bitter 
           recognition comes into focus...

                                 GIDEON
                        You’ll drive me. The piss-ant that 
                        stole my church is gonna drive me 
                        to my office.

                                 JUNE
                        Nobody stole your church, Gideon.
                                 GIDEON
                        Then why’s he on my stage? He can’t 
                        preach, he’s got no spirit. All the 
                        lights and fanfare in the world 
                        don’t make up for that.

           Seth withers. Claire sees her husband take it, pitiful.

                                 GIDEON (CONT'D)
                        You’re all lettin’ my ministry go 
                        to hell.

           Claire can’t help herself -

                                 CLAIRE
                        Gideon - ?

                                 SETH
                             (caution)
                        Claire.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I think you'd be proud of the job 
                        Seth’s doing. Attendance is up. 
                        People love his message.

           Gideon fixes his imposing glare on her. No one ever 
           contradicts him.

                                 GIDEON
                        Is that right?

                                 CLAIRE
                        And he’s bringing your ministry to 
                        an even bigger audience. National 
                        TV.

                                 GIDEON
                        He ain’t ready for TV. That’s just 
                        a bigger stage for him to fail on.

           Gideon looks to Seth.

                                 GIDEON (CONT'D)
                        This your wife?

                                 SETH
                             (deflated)
                        Yes, sir.

                                 GIDEON
                        Did you know she’s been with 
                        another man?
           Claire goes flush, all eyes on her, suddenly exposed.

                                 GIDEON (CONT'D)
                        Saw it myself.

                                 JUNE
                        Mario, I think it might be time for 
                        a rest.

                                 GIDEON
                        Tell me, how you can run a church 
                        when you can’t even keep your own 
                        wife in line?

                                 MARIO
                        Mister Lewis, why don't we go 
                        inside for a bit?

                                 GIDEON
                        Fine. It's all liars and whores out 
                        here anyhow.

           Mario guides Gideon toward the house.

           Gideon notices Ben, points an accusing finger at him.

                                 GIDEON (CONT'D)
                        That’s him. That’s the sonofabitch 
                        right there. I saw those two making 
                        eyes over cigarettes.

           Ben hardens, a stranger to his father.

           Gideon leaves, but his outburst still lingers.

           Seth moves off. He’s been carved out.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Seth -

           He exits, doesn’t acknowledge her.

           INT. BATHROOM - BROOKS HOME - MORNING

           Addie does her makeup in the mirror, wears her nicest dress.

           Kyle shambles in, hungover.

                                 KYLE
                        Where you going?

                                 ADDIE
                        Church.
           Kyle beelines for the prescription bottles littering the 
           counter. He shakes them, looking for pain relief.

                                 KYLE
                        You gonna see what’s-her-name?

                                 ADDIE
                        I don’t know. Probably.

                                 KYLE
                        You figure out her angle yet?

                                 ADDIE
                        Maybe she’s just a sweet person.

                                 KYLE
                        Nobody’s sweet to trash like us 
                        unless there’s something in it for 
                        ‘em.

           Kyle finds some pills, slurps them down.

                                 KYLE (CONT'D)
                        It’s her conscience, I bet. She’s 
                        livin’ in a mansion while her 
                        husband swindles old ladies out of 
                        their welfare checks. Buying shit 
                        for you probably helps her sleep at 
                        night.

                                 ADDIE
                        If you say so.

                                 KYLE
                             (disrespected)
                        I do. And I say we’re fools if we 
                        don’t try to get something out of 
                        it.

           Kyle calculates. Addie dreads what he’s about to propose -

                                 KYLE (CONT'D)
                        Tell her you’re gonna lose your 
                        daddy’s house if you can’t come up 
                        with - I dunno -
                             (pulls a number)
                        - ten thousand. Just to see what 
                        she says.

                                 ADDIE
                             (a laugh)
                        Ten thousand dollars?
                                 KYLE
                        Ten thousand is pocket change to 
                        those crooks.

           Addie realizes he’s serious.

                                 ADDIE
                        I barely know her, Kyle -

                                 KYLE
                        Ads, I can’t get on a bull again 
                        without surgery. Soon as I get 
                        fixed up and start bringing home 
                        some winnings, you can quit that 
                        job and raise this baby. But that 
                        takes money that we don’t currently 
                        fucking have.

           Addie’s familiar with his tone, knows better than to respond.

                                 KYLE (CONT'D)
                        Now put on your warpaint. Go sing 
                        some church songs. And get us 
                        something better.

           He holds her look. A direct order.

           INT. WORSHIP CENTER - NEW DAWN - MORNING

           Addie sits near the front, eyes glued to THE STAGE, Claire in 
           her usual seat behind Seth.

                                 SETH
                        And while the Collection Team 
                        gathers this week’s offering, I 
                        invite you to greet those around 
                        you with the peace and goodwill of 
                        Jesus Christ.

           As COLLECTION PLATES are passed around, churchgoers turn to 
           each other with smiles and greetings.

           Addie is surprised as the MAN next to her extends a hand -

                                 MAN
                        Good morning. It’s nice to see you 
                        here.

                                 ADDIE
                             (shakes his hand)
                        Thank you.
           It’s followed by more handshakes, welcoming words. Addie is 
           overwhelmed by the outpouring of warmth.

           Addie catches Claire’s eye with a wave. A beaming Claire 
           waves back from stage.

           EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY

           Claire sits on a swing, Addie in the grass beside her, still 
           in their church dresses. They eat Braum’s ice cream sundaes.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I haven’t had one of these in 
                        twenty years.

                                 ADDIE
                        That’s why you’re so skinny.

           Claire senses something troubling her.

                                 CLAIRE
                        What’s on your mind?

           Addie considers the countless replies. She goes with the 
           honest one -

                                 ADDIE
                        My dad, mostly.

           Claire tightens, pushes her ice cream around.

                                 ADDIE (CONT'D)
                        Back in his drinking days, he’d get 
                        loud and mean and I’d lie in bed 
                        listening to him fight with mama. 
                        On really bad nights, I’d hide 
                        under my covers and pray that God 
                        would strike him dead. Just wipe 
                        him off the face of the earth.

           Addie shudders, welling up with tears.

                                 ADDIE (CONT'D)
                        I was a kid. I didn’t know what I 
                        was asking for.

                                 CLAIRE
                        That’s not how God works, honey. 
                        You didn’t do that.

                                 ADDIE
                        I’m still not proud of myself for 
                        it. 
           Claire understands too well. After a moment -

                                 CLAIRE
                        Got time to take a ride?

           EXT. DIRT LOT - DAY

           Claire and Addie climb out of the car, their gaze on -

           A burned-out ROADSIDE BAR, charred black. A half-melted sign 
           reads “STARLITE TAVERN”.

                                 CLAIRE
                        See that window up there?

           She points to the CORNER WINDOW of the upstairs apartment, 
           also torched.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                        That was the bedroom I shared with 
                        my mother. She’d lock me in there 
                        at night so she could go downstairs 
                        and drink until closing. Some 
                        mornings, I’d wake up and she 
                        wouldn’t have come back. So, I’d 
                        pound the floor with a broomstick 
                        until the early bartender would 
                        come up and let me out.

           Addie follows Claire toward the bar, fixed on her story.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                        Then I found New Dawn – and Seth – 
                        and I got to feel like I was above 
                        all this.

           Claire peers into the charred ruin.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                        I left my mother here with her Wild 
                        Turkey and her big rig drivers. I 
                        didn’t even invite her to our 
                        wedding.

           She stops at the stairway that leads upstairs.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                        We were on our honeymoon when I got 
                        the call that this place burned. 
                        They figure she was too drunk to 
                        get out on her own. And there was 
                        no one here to help her.
           Addie looks at her, their kindred connection deepening.

           INT. LEWIS HOME - NIGHT

           Claire enters the silent house. She passes the LIVING ROOM 
           and jumps at the sight of -

           ERIK, staring at her from the couch.

                                 CLAIRE
                        What are you doing here?

           He doesn’t answer. Claire’s panic swells. Then -

                                 SETH (O.S.)
                        We’re working.

           Seth reveals himself, in the room with Erik.

                                 CLAIRE
                             (collects herself)
                        I just - it’s late.

                                 SETH
                        We’re making TV in two Sundays, 
                        Claire.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Even God took a day of rest.

                                 SETH
                        It’s too big a stage to fail on.

           Gideon’s words continue to haunt him. 

                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                             (back to Erik)
                        Read everything back, please.

           Claire exchanges a look with Erik before exiting the room.

           INT. BATHROOM - LEWIS HOME - NIGHT

           Claire zips her MAKEUP BAG closed, drops it into a drawer -

                                 ERIK (O.S.)
                        Claire.

           Erik stands in the doorway, wild-eyed.
                                 CLAIRE
                             (shaken)
                        You can’t be up here -

                                 ERIK
                        He took a phone call.

           He enters the room with her, pushes the door closed.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Erik -

                                 ERIK
                        I feel like I’m drowning.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Go back downstairs. Please.

                                 ERIK
                        What if there’s some trace of us on 
                        that body? During the fight - did 
                        he scratch you?

                                 CLAIRE
                        No, I don’t think so.

                                 ERIK
                        No, or you don’t think so? Which is 
                        it?

                                 CLAIRE
                        No, he didn’t. Let’s talk about 
                        this tomorrow -

                                 ERIK
                        Have you seen her again?

                                 CLAIRE
                             (holds his stare)
                        No.

           She touches him.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                        You need to get some sleep.

           Then, from the other side of the door -

                                 SETH (O.S.)
                        Hey, Claire?

           Claire and Erik freeze.
                                 CLAIRE
                        Uh-huh?

                                 SETH (O.S.)
                        Have you seen Erik?

                                 CLAIRE
                        I heard the backdoor open. You 
                        might check by the pool.

           They hear Seth GRUMBLE, shuffle away.

           Claire inches the door open, peers out. Turns back to Erik.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                        Please go.

           INT. BEDROOM - BROOKS HOME - NIGHT

           Addie sleeps in the chill of the new AC unit. Then -

           The sounds of a LOUD ENGINE and DRUNK VOICES wake her. She 
           squints out the window to see -

           Kyle stumbling out of a friend’s truck.

           Addie braces herself as she hears him enter the house. 

           The bedroom door opens. Kyle stands silhouetted against the 
           hallway light.

                                 KYLE
                        Got any news for me, darlin’?

                                 ADDIE
                        I was sleepin’.

                                 KYLE
                        You talk to her?
                             (no response)
                        Ads.

           She rolls over, faces the wall.

                                 KYLE (CONT'D)
                             (realizes)
                        I see.

                                 ADDIE
                        I have work tomorrow.
                                 KYLE
                             (a laugh)
                        You think she’s your friend. Christ 
                        almighty. Tell me why she’d want to 
                        be friends with a hillbilly halfwit 
                        like you?

           When she doesn’t answer, he kicks the mattress.

                                 KYLE (CONT'D)
                        Huh?

           Addie’s simmer goes full boil. She sits up.

                                 ADDIE
                        If you want money so bad, why don’t 
                        you get a job?

                                 KYLE
                        The fuckin’ mouth on you -

                                 ADDIE
                        But why do that if you can just 
                        loaf around my daddy’s house for 
                        free - 

           KYLE LUNGES at her. She scampers away from him.

                                 ADDIE (CONT'D)
                        Don’t touch me!

           But he catches her. She swings wildly to fight him off.

           He BACKHANDS HER across the face, then THROWS HER to the 
           floor. She slams into her childhood dresser. Old photos and 
           keepsakes rain down on her.

                                 KYLE
                        Still feelin’ superior?

           He staggers out as Addie sobs in a heap on the floor.

           SETH AND CLAIRE,

           staring directly at us.

                                 SETH
                        As the book of Psalms says, “Shout 
                        for joy to the Lord, all the Earth.

                        Worship him with gladness and come 
                        before him with joyful songs.” And 
                        y'know what, we can't think of a 
                        better way to describe the mission 
                        of our ministry -

                                 LIZ (O.S.)
                        I’m sorry, Seth. Can I stop you?

           We’re here -

           EXT. COURTYARD - NEW DAWN CHURCH - MORNING

           It’s a VIDEO SHOOT. Media Director Liz monitors from behind 
           the CAMERA CREW. Seth and Claire stand together.

                                 LIZ
                        Claire, could I get you to look at 
                        Seth while he's talking? Not the 
                        whole time, just occasionally. When 
                        it feels right.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Why am I looking at him?

                                 LIZ
                        To punctuate what he's saying. Like 
                        he’s an authority we should be 
                        listening to.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Okay, but Liz, is it weird that I’m 
                        not saying anything?

                                 LIZ
                        Just standing there supporting your 
                        husband says it all.

                                 CLAIRE
                             (bristles)
                        Right.

                                 LIZ
                        Great, let's take it from the top 
                        of Atlanta.

           Seth and Claire reset. Big smiles.

                                 SETH
                        Hello to all our friends in the 
                        Atlanta area. Claire and I are so 
                        excited to share New Dawn's message 
                        with you today.
           As Seth talks, Claire looks at him. As directed.

                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                        As the book of Psalms says, “Shout 
                        for joy to the Lord, all the Earth. 
                        Worship him with gladness and come 
                        before him with joyful songs.” And 
                        y'know what -

           The DING of a cell phone text alert. It came from Claire.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I’m sorry. Let me just -

           Claire fishes the phone from her pocket. Seth watches her, 
           struggling to mask his irritation.

           Claire’s face falls as she reads the text.

                                 SETH
                        Are we ready?

                                 CLAIRE
                        I have to - I'm sorry, everybody.

           Claire wanders from her mark.

                                 SETH
                             (losing patience)
                        What are you doing, sweetie?

                                 CLAIRE
                        I - have to go.

                                 SETH
                        What?

           Claire hurries off.

                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                        Claire.

           But she’s gone.

           INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - DAY

           An anxious Claire waits. Through the GIFT SHOP WINDOW, she 
           locks eyes with a cute PLUSH KITTEN holding a sign that 
           reads, “This Too Shall Pass.” Then -

           Addie and an OB-GYN DOC (female, 40s) enter. Claire stands to 
           meet them.
                                 DOCTOR
                        The baby’s fine. But I told 
                        Adelaine that if she feels any 
                        sharp pains in the next few days, 
                        she needs to come in immediately.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Alright.

           The doctor notes the unmistakable SWELLING on Addie’s face.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Get some ice on that bruise. 
                             (knowing)
                        And do what you can to avoid - 
                        further mishaps.

           She tosses a glance to Claire who nods her understanding.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Thank you for squeezing us in, 
                        Gail.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Of course. See you Sunday morning.

           The doctor exits, leaving Claire and Addie in silence.

           INT. LEWIS HOME - DAY

           Claire leads Addie through the house.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I don’t want you climbing too many 
                        stairs, so I’m putting you down 
                        here.

                                 ADDIE
                        This is the nicest home I’ve ever 
                        been in.

                                 CLAIRE
                             (stops, looks around)
                        Yeah, me too.
                             (continues the tour)
                        You’ll have your own bathroom, all 
                        the privacy you need -

           Addie’s cell RINGS. She checks the caller ID.

                                 ADDIE
                        It’s him.
                                 CLAIRE
                        Probably wondering where his meal 
                        ticket ran off to. Want me to 
                        answer it?

                                 ADDIE
                        Would you?

           She hands over the phone, Claire answers it.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Kyle, I hope you’re sober enough to 
                        get all this, because I’m only 
                        saying it once -

                                                         CROSSCUT WITH:

           INT. BROOKS HOME - SAME

           Kyle, on the phone.

                                 KYLE
                        Who’s this?

                                 CLAIRE
                        It’s Claire Lewis. Addie’s blocking 
                        your number, so don’t bother 
                        calling again.

                                 KYLE
                        Now hold on -

                                 CLAIRE
                        She’s done talking to you. She’s 
                        done taking care of you. She’s done 
                        being afraid of you.

                                 KYLE
                        Just put her on the goddamn phone.

                                 CLAIRE
                        And you’re done giving orders, 
                        asshole.

           Claire hangs up with authority, hands the phone back.

           A stunned Addie looks at her, then lets out an involuntary 
           laugh. The first time we’ve seen her truly joyful.

           INT. BEDROOM - LEWIS HOME - NIGHT

           Claire is in bed. Seth enters, finally home from the office.
                                 SETH
                        Why is there a pregnant girl 
                        scrubbing down our kitchen?

           Claire climbs out of bed, throws a robe on.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Her name’s Addie. She’s a new 
                        member who just lost her father. 
                        I’m letting her stay here until 
                        things quiet down for her.
                             (heads for the door)
                        And I told that girl to stay off 
                        her feet.

           Seth stops her, a million questions.

                                 SETH
                        And how old is she?

                                 CLAIRE
                             (convincing)
                        Eighteen.

                                 SETH
                        So, old enough to get her own 
                        place?

                                 CLAIRE
                        She’ll stay out of your way.

                                 SETH
                        Is Addie the reason we had to 
                        cancel the shoot this morning?

                                 CLAIRE
                        I’m sorry. I’ll call Liz to 
                        reschedule.

           Seth moves around the room, in constant motion, changing into 
           work-out clothes.

                                 SETH
                        You don’t understand what I’m 
                        dealing with, do you?

                                 CLAIRE
                        I understand better than anyone -

                                 SETH
                        I bet everything on this broadcast 
                        deal. And if we lose, we lose big. 
                        We’re selling apple pies in the 
                        park to keep the church lights on.
           He stands in front of her.

                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                        But you clearly want my attention, 
                        so here it is. Go ahead. What am I 
                        being punished for?

                                 CLAIRE
                        No one’s punishing you, Seth.

                                 SETH
                        It’s not because I wouldn’t see 
                        that marriage coach?

                                 CLAIRE
                        No.

                                 SETH
                        Then what is it? What’s been going 
                        on with you?

           Claire tries to put words together. Then she sees -

           Addie, in the doorway.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Hey, hon. Do you need something?

                                 ADDIE
                        Just saying goodnight. And thank 
                        you both.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Goodnight, Addie.

                                 SETH
                        ‘Night.

           Addie moves off. Seth’s attention is back on Claire.

                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                        If you need someone to take care of 
                        so badly, why don’t you see that 
                        fertility doctor and find out why 
                        we don’t have a baby?

           He turns, out the door.

           EXT. LEWIS HOME - NIGHT

           A VAN rattles past Claire and Seth’s mansion -
           IN THE VAN

           Kyle is behind the wheel, scoping out the property. 

           Spite rising up in him. As Seth’s words fade in...

                                 SETH (V.O.)
                        What are you hiding? What’s that 
                        dark little secret you’d never want 
                        the person sitting next to you to 
                        know? Something you did, something 
                        you desire.

           EXT. NEW DAWN CHURCH - SUNDAY MORNING

           It’s early in the day, but the heat is already unbearable. 
           Churchgoers file into the cool comfort of the Worship Center.

                                 SETH (V.O.)
                        It may be buried so deeply, it’s 
                        not even known to you anymore. But 
                        it’s known to God.

           INT. WORSHIP CENTER - DAY

           Seth glides across the stage, preaching his weekly message. 
           Claire seated behind him.

                                 SETH
                        As Hebrews 4:13 tells us, “There is 
                        nothing in all of creation that’s 
                        hidden from God's sight.” To many, 
                        that’s a terrifying thought.

           Claire scans the crowd and finds ADDIE. She’s attentive, 
           hanging on Seth’s words.

           Claire’s attention turns to A FIGURE moving through the 
           crowd, finding a seat -

           It’s KYLE.

                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                        But not to us. We know that he 
                        looks past our hidden sins and sees 
                        the potential for his work in our 
                        hearts.

           Claire squirms at the sight of Kyle.
           INT. WORSHIP CENTER - LATER

           The band hits their final chord. The service is over. 
           Worshipers shuffle to the exits. 

           Seth holds out a hand to lead Claire off, but SHE’S WATCHING -

           KYLE moving through the crowd TOWARD ADDIE.

           In a burst of resolve, Claire climbs offstage into -

           THE CROWD

           Claire weaves around worshipers, focused on getting to Addie 
           before Kyle does.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Excuse me - sorry.

           But Kyle is closing in.

           Claire is almost to Addie when an eager CHURCHGOER stops her.

                                 CHURCHGOER
                        Such a beautiful service, Mrs. 
                        Lewis. Y’know, we drove all the way 
                        up from Ada this morning -

                                 CLAIRE
                        I’m so glad you enjoyed it. Excuse 
                        me -

           She sidesteps him, just as -

           Kyle gets to Addie first.

                                 KYLE
                        Ads.

           A startled Addie turns, backs away.

                                 ADDIE
                        What are you doing?

                                 KYLE
                        I came to find out why you turned 
                        the power off on me?

                                 ADDIE
                        ‘Cause I want you out of my house.
                                 KYLE
                        That ain’t very Christian of you.
                             (reaches for her)
                        C’mon, let’s go home.

                                 ADDIE
                        No.

                                 KYLE
                        You made your point, alright? I’m 
                        sorry. Now let’s go.

           CLAIRE ARRIVES, grabs Addie’s hand.

                                 CLAIRE
                        This way, Addie.

                                 KYLE
                        Look, it’s your guardian angel.

           Claire drags Addie away from Kyle.

                                 KYLE (CONT'D)
                        Really? She can’t even talk to me?

           Kyle goes after them.

           ON STAGE

           Seth notices the commotion, his wife at the center of it.

           IN THE CROWD

           Claire and Addie push through the worshipers.

           Kyle follows faster, his anger focused.

                                 KYLE
                        Get back here, Addie!

           Claire sees BEN near the stage.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Ben?

           He peers through the crowd, sees the urgency on Claire’s 
           face, sees Kyle -

                                 KYLE
                        I got the goddamn right to speak to 
                        my baby’s mother!
           Ben waves Claire toward him -

                                 BEN
                        Over here.
                             (into his radio)
                        I need back-up, stage left.

           Kyle knocks a churchgoer to the ground.

           He’s only a few feet from them, when -

           Claire and Addie arrive at Ben. He whisks them through a 
           curtain, into a STAFF ROOM.

           Kyle tries to follow, but Ben stands in his path.

                                 BEN (CONT'D)
                        I’m sorry, but you’re not allowed 
                        back there.

                                 KYLE
                        Outta the way, big boy.

                                 BEN
                        The service is over. It’s time to 
                        leave.

           Another SECURITY GUARD joins Ben. Kyle sizes them up.

                                 KYLE
                        Motherfucker, I’ve taken on sixteen 
                        hundred pound bulls. You think I’m 
                        scared of you two.

                                 BEN
                             (done with this)
                        Alright, let’s go.

           He grabs Kyle’s arm.

                                 KYLE
                        Get your hands off me.

           Kyle HITS BEN with a sucker punch. Bad move. In a blink -

           A crazed Ben TACKLES Kyle to the ground, batters him with 
           ferocious PUNCHES.

           Shocked onlookers scatter. The guard tries to pull Ben off.

                                 GUARD
                        Ben, he’s good -

           But Ben is possessed, shelling Kyle with swinging fists.
                                 GUARD (CONT'D)
                        He’s had enough, pal.

           The guard finally rips Ben off him.

           A seething Ben looms over the bloody and groaning mess that 
           is Kyle.

           ON STAGE

           Seth stares in disbelief at the chaos in his church.

           INT. STAFF ROOM - SAME

           Claire leads Addie away from the mayhem. Staff members circle 
           them to help.

           Claire shares a look with ERIK, who realizes the truth of her 
           bond with Addie. Before he can say anything -

                                 CLAIRE
                             (a whisper)
                        I’ll try to get out tonight. I’ll 
                        explain everything.

           She moves Addie past Erik, his eyes begging for answers.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NEW DAWN CHURCH - LATER

           Claire sits across from the church’s inner circle - Seth, 
           June, David, PAULA (Communications Director), a couple 
           ATTORNEY-TYPES.

                                 DAVID
                        This young lady’s living in your 
                        house.

                                 CLAIRE
                        For the moment, yes.

           Seth sits motionless, eyes locked on Claire, fuming.

                                 DAVID
                        You know we have outreach programs 
                        for girls like her.

                                 CLAIRE
                        David, you saw what just happened.
                                 DAVID
                             (still reeling)
                        Yes I did.

                                 CLAIRE
                        A weekly counseling session won’t 
                        keep her safe from that.

           Claire scans the room of judging looks.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                        Am I in some kind of trouble?

                                 DAVID
                        No, we’re just trying to 
                        understand.
                             (looking for back-up)
                        Seth, where are you with this?

                                 SETH
                        My wife knows how I feel about it.

           The room sits with the tension until Paula chimes in, a 
           saccharine-sweet bullshitter -

                                 PAULA
                        Personally, Claire, I think it’s 
                        lovely what you’re doing for this 
                        girl -

                                 CLAIRE
                        Her name’s Addie.

                                 PAULA
                        - for Addie. But from a PR 
                        perspective, it concerns me if word 
                        gets out that you’re letting 
                        desperate strangers into your home.

                                 CLAIRE
                        The Bible I read says we’re 
                        supposed to help desperate 
                        strangers.

                                 PAULA
                        In a reasonable way, yes.

                                 CLAIRE
                        What’s a reasonable way to love thy 
                        neighbor, Paula?
                                 PAULA
                             (heated)
                        I don’t think you realize how 
                        visible this media launch is about 
                        to make you and Seth -

                                 JUNE
                        Ladies, that’s enough.

                                 PAULA
                        When there’s a line of vagrants 
                        outside your front gate looking for 
                        a place to sleep -

                                 CLAIRE
                        A line of vagrants - really?

           June SLAPS the table, barks at the room -

                                 JUNE
                        I said that’s enough.

           The room quiets, startled by this version of June.

                                 JUNE (CONT'D)
                        Everyone’s made their point. My 
                        daughter-in-law’s had a stressful 
                        morning and I don’t want her 
                        badgered any further about this. 
                        Got it?

           She stares everyone down, especially Seth.

                                 JUNE (CONT'D)
                             (to Claire)
                        Darlin’, don’t ever apologize for 
                        having a generous soul. Now go 
                        enjoy your Sunday.

           The final word.

           INT. HALLYWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Claire exits the conference room. 

           A concerned Ben is there, waiting for his turn to go in. He 
           stands to meet Claire.

                                 BEN
                        If I made it all worse, I’m sorry. 
                        I don’t always handle things 
                        correctly - 
                                 CLAIRE
                             (cuts him off)
                        If you hadn’t been there -

           When words fail, she hugs him.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                        Thank you.

           Ben takes in her sincere gratitude.

           EXT. LEWIS HOME - NIGHT

           A walled-in castle. Cozy and protected.

           INT. KYLE’S VAN - SAME

           Parked on the street outside the Lewis Home. Kyle sits behind 
           the wheel, his face wrecked from the Ben beating. 

           He lights a cigarette, violent thoughts churning. Then sees -

           The ENTRY GATE slides open, Claire drives out. Kyle watches 
           her for a moment, then -

           He turns the ignition and drives after her.

           INT. VAN - MOVING - LATER

           Kyle follows Claire’s car. He sees it pull into the OPEN 
           GARAGE of Erik’s house. The garage door closes her inside.

           A perplexed Kyle parks his van.

           EXT. ERIK’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Kyle stalks through the darkness outside the house, tracking 
           the sound of VOICES. 

           He stops at a window where he sees CLAIRE AND ERIK arguing 
           inside THE GARAGE.

                                 ERIK
                        You told me you hadn’t seen her.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I’m sorry.

                                 ERIK
                        So we’re lying to each other now?
                                 CLAIRE
                        I said that to ease your mind.

                                 ERIK
                             (dark amusement)
                        Ease my mind.

           Kyle recognizes something between them. Something to be used.

                                 ERIK (CONT'D)
                        I went there last night.

                                 CLAIRE
                        The cabin?

                                 ERIK
                        I broke in and bleached that cellar 
                        floor again.

           He’s falling apart in front of her.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Erik, please don’t be the arsonist 
                        who gets caught going back -

                                 ERIK
                        I’m not the one who adopted the 
                        guy’s daughter.

                                 CLAIRE
                        She needs me.

                                 ERIK
                        I need you!

           He explodes, ripping a wall of TOOLS to the floor.

                                 ERIK (CONT'D)
                        I need you to make what I did worth 
                        it!

           Erik sees he’s frightened her. He softens.

                                 ERIK (CONT'D)
                        Every time I close my eyes, I see 
                        it on a loop: That first shovel of 
                        dirt hitting his face, how it sunk 
                        into his mouth, like an hourglass. 
                        Like quicksand. I prayed out there 
                        that night. Can you believe that? I 
                        prayed he’d just cough it out, that 
                        God would wake him up so I wouldn’t 
                        have to keep shoveling.
           He breaks down. Claire moves in, holds him.

           OUTSIDE - A stunned Kyle can’t believe what he’s hearing.

           INT. ACTIVITY CENTER - NEW DAWN - DAY

           The room is stacked with food and clothing donations. A team 
           of upbeat VOLUNTEERS is filling Purpose Pack boxes.

           Claire is among them, staring into space, depleted.

           A RECEPTIONIST enters -

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Excuse me. Mrs. Lewis? There’s a 
                        gentleman on the phone for you.

           Claire joins the receptionist.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Did you get a name?

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        No, he just said he’s an old friend 
                        of Ronnie Brooks.

           Claire goes pale.

           EXT. RODEO TRAINING PEN - DAY

           Young BULLRIDERS take turns on training bulls. COACHES bark 
           orders at them from the sidelines.

           Claire and Erik search the perimeter of the dusty pen, wary 
           strangers to this world.

           A WHISTLE draws their attention. They turn to see -

           KYLE, perched on the fence, watching the riders. His cowboy 
           hat is pulled low to hide his beaten face. 

           Claire and Erik approach, guarded.

                                 KYLE
                        You made it.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Why are we here?

           But Kyle’s attention is on the bullriders.
                                 KYLE
                        Watch this kid. Betcha he doesn’t 
                        last three seconds.

           ACROSS THE PEN -

           A nervous YOUNG RIDER is in the chute, straddling a bull. He 
           fidgets with his rope. Finally, he gives the nod. The gate 
           opens and the bull LAUNCHES into the arena.

           The kid is immediately THROWN OFF the animal. He lands in the 
           dirt and manure, a crumpled heap.

                                 KYLE (CONT'D)
                        See that? He ate shit ‘cause he was 
                        ridin’ scared.
                             (turns to them)
                        Like you two. You been ridin’ 
                        scared for a couple months now.

                                 ERIK
                        Are we supposed to know what you’re 
                        talking about?

           Kyle laughs off his predictable ignorance.

                                 KYLE
                        Buddy, have you seen yourself? You 
                        look worse than I do.

           Kyle hops off the fence to face them.

                                 KYLE (CONT'D)
                        Y’all are being too hard on 
                        yourselves. Ronnie was no big loss. 
                        He was more fun in his drinkin’ 
                        days. ‘Course he loaned me forty 
                        bucks, which I don’t have to pay 
                        back now, thanks to you.

                                 CLAIRE
                             (poker face)
                        What do you want?

                                 KYLE
                        To the point. Okay. I want a 
                        hundred thousand dollars. 
                             (correction)
                        Minus the forty bucks. I’ll let 
                        that slide.

           Claire and Erik stand shocked. Claire manages a response -
                                 CLAIRE
                        A hundred thousand dollars. For 
                        what?

                                 KYLE
                        To keep your secret.

                                 CLAIRE
                             (sputtering)
                        Whatever secret you think you know - 

                                 KYLE
                        That cabin. It wouldn’t take much 
                        for the police to track it down. 
                        You may have cleaned it, but they’d 
                        find something that proves Ronnie 
                        was there. And as ragged as you two 
                        seem, I wouldn’t expect you to last 
                        too long under questioning. 

           They’re stunned silent.

                                 KYLE (CONT'D)
                        Everyone looks down their nose at 
                        me until they realize who they’re 
                        dealin’ with. They always end up 
                        like you: Tongue-tied with a stupid 
                        look on their face.

           Kyle relishes his newfound power.

                                 KYLE (CONT'D)
                        You have ‘til Sunday to sort out 
                        the money.

           He fixes his bloodshot eyes on Claire, amused.

                                 KYLE (CONT'D)
                        It looks like I’m back to givin’ 
                        orders.

           ACROSS THE PEN, another terrified rider is thrown off a bull.

           CLAIRE’S FACE,

           staring straight at us. Tortured.

                                 SETH (O.S.)
                        Hello to all our friends in the 
                        Nashville area. Claire and I are so 
                        happy to share New Dawn's message 
                        with you today.
           WIDER - NEW DAWN COURTYARD - DAY

           Seth and Claire are re-shooting video intros. It takes 
           everything Claire has to muster the required smile.

                                 SETH
                        As the book of Psalms says, “Shout 
                        for joy to the Lord, all the Earth. 
                        Worship him with gladness and come 
                        before him with joyful songs.”

           Seth’s voice continues under...

           INT. BEDROOM - LEWIS HOME - NIGHT

           Seth is on top of Claire, trying to impregnate her.

                                 SETH (V.O.)
                        And y'know what, we can't think of 
                        a better way to describe the 
                        mission of our ministry...

           Claire is lost in her head, worried thoughts swirling.

           INT. WORSHIP CENTER - NEW DAWN - DAY

           Final prep is underway for the broadcast taping:

           Technicians hang new lights, lay cable, set up cameras.

           A CONTROL ROOM is completed, an imposing wall of monitors.

           EXT. LOADING DOCK - NEW DAWN - DAY

           Claire and Ben smoke, hidden from sight. They watch as      
           TV PRODUCTION GEAR is wheeled into the church.

           A gloom hangs over both of them.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Do you ever wonder if you’re good 
                        enough for this place?

                                 BEN
                        I don’t have to wonder. I’ve known 
                        the answer a long time.

           They sit in silence, inhaling smoke.
           INT. ERIK’S TRUCK - NIGHT

           Parked on a service road. A FREEWAY OVERPASS roars above it.

           Erik sits behind the wheel, Claire next to him.

                                 ERIK
                        We’ll leave tonight.

                                 CLAIRE
                        And go where?

                                 ERIK
                        South. I want to show you that 
                        Mayan carving, the one with your 
                        hands. After that, we’ll make our 
                        way down to Panama.

           She looks at him, a man grasping for straws.

                                 CLAIRE
                             (incredulous)
                        Panama?

                                 ERIK
                        People can disappear in a place 
                        like that.

           The HEADLIGHTS of an oncoming car approach. Claire lies 
           across the seat to hide. Erik instinctively puts a hand on 
           her - it stirs a memory for both.

                                 ERIK (CONT'D)
                        We either run away together or get 
                        locked up apart.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Those aren’t the only options.

                                 ERIK
                        Seth controls your money. And even 
                        if you had a hundred grand to give 
                        this kid, what’s to stop him from 
                        asking for more?

           The car passes, Claire sits up. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        If you have to go, I understand. 
                        But I can’t disappear on Addie. 
                        She’d end up back with Kyle, 
                        trapped in that house with no way 
                        out.
           She grabs Erik’s hand, reassuring.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                        We’re in this because of me. And 
                        I’m deeply sorry for that. But I’m 
                        going to take care of us. I’m going 
                        to figure something out.

                                 ERIK
                        That’s what I said and look where 
                        we are.

           But Claire has made a choice.

           EXT. BROOKS HOME - DAY

           Kyle is working on his van. He looks up from the engine block 
           to see CLAIRE’S MERCEDES parking in the yard.

           Claire steps out and approaches with a BAG under her arm.

                                 KYLE
                        Got my money?

                                 CLAIRE
                        I need you to promise something 
                        first.

                                 KYLE
                        Oh, you’re making demands.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Once you have it, you vanish from 
                        Addie’s life. You never speak to 
                        her again. She learns nothing about 
                        any of this. If you can do that, I 
                        can promise you at least two 
                        hundred thousand dollars.

                                 KYLE
                        Two hundred?

           Kyle tries his best to play it cool, unsuccessfully. Pretends 
           to think it over.

                                 KYLE (CONT'D)
                        Okay, sure, I can agree to that.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Yeah, I thought you could.

           Claire tosses the bag to Kyle. He reaches in and pulls out -
           A New Dawn HAT and HOODIE.

                                 KYLE
                        What’s this?

                                 CLAIRE
                        The routine is always the same: New 
                        Dawn’s cash donations from the week 
                        are counted on Thursday mornings. 
                        That's five services worth of cash.

           She continues under...

           INT. SETH’S OFFICE - DAY

           The accounting clerk loads blocks of cash into Seth’s safe.

                                 CLAIRE (V.O.)
                        Once it's tallied, it's brought to 
                        my husband's office and placed in a 
                        cube safe - the same safe his 
                        father bought when he started the 
                        church.

           INT. SETH’S OFFICE - DAY

           The cash is strewn across Seth’s desk. 

                                 CLAIRE (V.O.)
                        After Seth recounts the cash, he 
                        prays a blessing over it.

           Seth holds a hand over the money, says a silent prayer.

           INT. SETH’S OFFICE - DAY

           Seth stacks the cash into the safe.

                                 CLAIRE (V.O.)
                        Then he locks the money back up 
                        until the next morning when an 
                        armored car comes for it.

           Seth shuts the safe door.

           EXT. BROOKS HOME - PRESENT

           Kyle interrupts -
                                 KYLE
                        Why you telling me this?

                                 CLAIRE
                        They never bothered bolting that 
                        safe to the floor. I guess they 
                        figured God had his eye on it. But 
                        you're going to walk out of New 
                        Dawn with it tomorrow night.
                             (off Kyle’s stunned look)
                        I’ve scheduled a big load-out. If 
                        you do as I say, you’ll blend right 
                        in as just another volunteer.

                                 KYLE
                        You want me to rob your husband’s 
                        church.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I want you to stay quiet when this 
                        is over. This guarantees it.

                                 KYLE
                        Sounds like I'm taking all the risk 
                        here.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Two hundred thousand. Minimum.

           It’s hard for Kyle to argue with that number.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                        But like I said, you’re gone from 
                        Addie’s life.

           Kyle picks up the hat, considers the New Dawn logo on it.

           EXT. NEW DAWN CHURCH - TWILIGHT

           Pastel-pink clouds move across the darkening sky, drained of 
           color with each passing second.

           EXT. FLOWER GARDEN - LEWIS HOME - TWILIGHT

           Claire is weeding, desperate to keep her mind occupied. Then 
           she sees –

           A JACKRABBIT gnawing a nearby vine of flowers. The little 
           bandit stares back at Claire, daring her to chase it off. 

           But she just watches the animal devour its dinner.
           INT. LOADING DOCK - NEW DAWN - NIGHT

           A team of church VOLUNTEERS loads boxes of Purpose Packs onto 
           a moving truck.

           INT. KYLE'S VAN - NIGHT

           Kyle is parked at New Dawn, his narrowed eyes watch the 
           LOADING DOCK. He wears the hat and hoodie, a fresh shave.

           He dashes a bump of crushed SPEED onto his hand, snorts it.

           Now ready, he pulls a HANDGUN from beneath the seat, tucks it 
           into his pants.

           INT. LOADING DOCK - NIGHT

           Kyle enters, pushing a two-wheeled dolly. It’s a madhouse of 
           activity in here.

           He’s spotted by the VOLUNTEER CAPTAIN - 

                                 CAPTAIN
                        Hey, buddy.

           Kyle stops, ready to fight or flee.

                                 CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                        Thanks for coming. Just head into 
                        the Activity Center and they’ll get 
                        you loaded up.

           Kyle nods and moves off.

           INT. ACTIVITY CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

           Kyle now wheels a large Purpose Pack box on his dolly. 

           He pulls his hood up to hide his face just before passing 
           under the SURVEILLANCE CAMERA Claire warned him about.

           He opens an unmarked door into a MAINTENANCE HALLWAY.

           INT. KITCHEN - LEWIS HOME - NIGHT

           Claire enters to find Addie frozen, standing at the sink.

                                 ADDIE
                             (a whisper)
                        Claire. C’mere.
           Claire joins her.

                                 ADDIE (CONT'D)
                        He’s kicking up a storm tonight.

           Addie takes Claire’s hand, places it on her belly. After a 
           moment, Claire beams. She felt it.

           The sublime moment is broken by -

                                 SETH (O.S.)
                        Hey, Claire?

           He calls out from across the house.

                                 SETH (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Can I talk to you?

           INT. SETH’S OFFICE - NEW DAWN - NIGHT

           Kyle enters the dark room through a SIDE DOOR. He clicks on a 
           flashlight, searching, until he finds -

           THE SAFE

           He dumps out the Purpose Pack contents, then slides the empty 
           box over the safe. A perfect fit.

           He wedges his dolly under the box/safe. He’s about to wheel 
           it out the door when -

           His flashlight reflects against something. The gold FLAME 
           SCULPTURE, mounted to the wall.

           Kyle ogles the sculpture. It looks really fucking valuable.

           INT. SETH’S STUDY - LEWIS HOME - NIGHT

           Claire walks in. Seth sits behind his desk.

                                 SETH
                        Close the door, please.

           She closes it.

                                 CLAIRE
                        What’s going on?

                                 SETH
                        Sit down.

           She does as she’s told, growing concern.
                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                        Do you have anything to confess?

                                 CLAIRE
                             (where to start?)
                        No.

                                 SETH
                        Nothing at all?

                                 CLAIRE
                        What’s this about?

           He holds up Claire’s MAKEUP BAG, the one seen earlier. 
           Claire’s stomach drops.

           Seth keeps his eyes on her as he unzips it, pulls out a PACK 
           OF PILLS.

                                 SETH
                        Why do you have birth control 
                        pills?

           She tries to speak, but nothing comes.

           INT. SETH’S OFFICE - NEW DAWN - NIGHT

           Kyle pulls the sculpture from the wall. It falls to the floor 
           with a CLANG. The sound wakes up -

           THE MAN that’s been asleep on the visitor couch. He sits up, 
           a ghostly shadow. 

           Kyle is unaware of him, until -

                                 GIDEON
                        I’m sorry, did we have an 
                        appointment?

           Kyle practically leaps out of his skin.

                                 KYLE
                        Jesus -

           He instinctively pulls his gun, aims at Gideon.

                                 GIDEON
                        It seems I nodded off.

           Then Gideon grows aware - the gun, the sculpture...
                                 GIDEON (CONT'D)
                        Young man, what are you doing in 
                        here?

           Time to go. Kyle abandons the sculpture. Grabs the dolly and 
           heads for the side door.

                                 GIDEON (CONT'D)
                             (standing)
                        Fella, I asked you a question.

           The FRONT DOOR opens and a SECURITY GUARD looks in -

                                 GUARD
                        Did you call for me, Mr. Lewis?

           The guard notices Kyle. Shit.

           Kyle FIRES A SHOT at him. The round shreds the drywall next 
           to the guard’s head.

           Kyle breaks for the exit. The guard calls for help -

                                 GUARD (CONT'D)
                             (into his radio)
                        We’ve got an intruder on two. He’s 
                        armed and heading down the south 
                        maintenance hall.

           INT. SECURITY OFFICE - NEW DAWN - SAME

           Ben hears the distress call. Springs to his feet.

           INT. SETH’S STUDY - LEWIS HOME - NIGHT

           Seth’s eyes bore into Claire, the pills clenched in his fist.

                                 SETH
                        How long?

                                 CLAIRE
                             (barely audible)
                        About a year.

           Seth does the math.

                                 SETH
                        So, since we started trying. Or 
                        since I started trying.
                                 CLAIRE
                        It was temporary, just until we 
                        could fix us.

                                 SETH
                        Deceiving me out of a family. That 
                        was your solution for fixing our 
                        marriage.

                                 CLAIRE
                        My solution was for us to get help.

                        We don’t need help. We have prayer.

           He stands, paces the room.

                        What else are you hiding from me?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Nothing.

           INT. MAINTENANCE HALLWAY - NEW DAWN - NIGHT

           Kyle wheels the safe as fast as he can. He throws open a door 
           and exits into -

           THE LOADING DOCK,

           where volunteers continue to fill the truck. Kyle blends in 
           with the others, all wheeling Purpose Packs.

           Ben rounds a corner, ARMED with his own gun. Frantic, he 
           searches the group. Finally, HE SEES - 

           Kyle peels off from the group and heads for the exit.

                                 BEN
                        Stop!

           Kyle turns and FIRES AT BEN. 

           Volunteers scream and scatter as Ben takes cover. He aims, 
           FIRES BACK at Kyle.

           Kyle HOWLS as one of the shots tears into HIS HAND. 

           He ducks out the exit and into -
           THE PARKING LOT,

           pulling the safe behind him. A desperate escape.

           INT. SETH’S STUDY - LEWIS HOME - NIGHT

           Seth is a thundercloud ready to rip open.

                                 SETH
                        I don’t know why I’m surprised. I 
                        married the daughter of a roadhouse 
                        whore.

           He looms over Claire, eyes damp with rage.

                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                        You should be grateful I’d even

                        That’s for damn sure.

                                 CLAIRE
                        - but you’re fast becoming your

                        Don’t talk about him.

           She levels him a sympathetic look.

                                 CLAIRE
                        And I’m sorry, but turning into the 
                        man won’t make him love you more.

           Too far. With a VIOLENT SWIPE, Seth clears the surface of his 
           desk. Framed photos shatter, his laptop crashes to the floor.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - NEW DAWN - NIGHT

           Kyle yanks open the van. His hand pours blood as he struggles 
           to hoist the safe inside.

           Ben exits the building. Kyle turns and FIRES his remaining 
           rounds at him. 
           Ben falls back behind a dumpster, RETURNS FIRE, exploding the 
           van’s rear window.

           Kyle heaves the safe into the back. Slams the door shut.

           IN THE VAN

           Kyle climbs into the driver’s seat. He floors it, speeds away 
           as BEN FIRES SHOTS.

           Out of range, Kyle pulls off the hood and hat. Gasping for 
           breath, sweat-drenched. 

           At the sight of his bloody hand, he loses all toughness, 
           scream-cries like a child.

           INT. SETH’S STUDY - LEWIS HOME - NIGHT

           Claire cowers while Seth TRASHES THE ROOM. He attacks a 
           bookshelf, sends antique books flying.

           The door opens. IT’S ADDIE, terrified and small. Claire 
           rushes to her.

                                 CLAIRE
                        It’s okay. Come on.

           Claire whisks Addie out of the room.

           Seth collects himself, surveys the wreckage. Then -

           His cell phone RINGS. From somewhere. He digs it out from 
           under a pile of rubble, answers it -

                                 SETH
                        Yes?

           INT. NEW DAWN CHURCH - VARIOUS - NIGHT

           The church is a CRIME SCENE. 

           A dazed Claire drifts through it, taking in the chaos she set 
           in motion:

           - POLICE OFFICERS take statements from witnesses, collect the 
           scattered bullet casings.

           - June and Mario try to calm an agitated Gideon.
           - Frightened volunteers console each other.

           INT. EXECUTIVE WING - NEW DAWN - NIGHT

           Seth stares into his office. Off limits. The police are 
           inside, dusting for fingerprints.

           Ben stands next to Seth, a beaten dog look.

                                 BEN
                        I’m sorry.

                                 SETH
                        For what, Ben? Letting someone cart 
                        the family safe out the door? Or 
                        turning the church into a war zone?

                                 BEN
                        All of it. Everything.

           Seth watches the investigators dismantle his office.

                                 SETH
                        Why was Dad here?

                        On bad nights, I bring him by to 
                        calm his nerves.

                                 SETH
                        And why are you here?

                                 BEN
                        What do you mean - ?

                        Back home. In our lives.

                                 BEN
                        Mom asked me to come.

                                 SETH
                        I told her you couldn’t handle 
                        this, but she begged me. She said 
                        you’re a changed man. And she’s not 
                        wrong. You’re somehow dumber and 
                        more dangerous than the day you 
                        left.

           His words open an old wound.

                                 BEN
                        You sound just like him.
                                 SETH
                        Well, I’m starting to understand 
                        why he had to be such a bastard.

           Claire joins them, lays a comforting hand on Ben’s shoulder. 
           He composes himself, quick to wipe a tear. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Can I get you anything? Water, a 
                        coffee?

                                 BEN
                        I’m alright, thank you.

                                 SETH
                             (aimed at Claire)
                        People I can trust are in short 
                        supply right now, Ben. I’d like to 
                        be able to trust my brother.

           Claire exchanges a look with Seth. She moves off.

                                 BEN
                        Tell me what I can do.

           Ben forces eye contact with Seth, years of unspoken history.

                                 BEN (CONT'D)
                        There are things I’ve done that I’m 
                        never going to make right -

                                 SETH
                        Keep your voice down.

                                 BEN
                        - but let me try with this one. 
                        Whatever you need.

           Seth considers the offer.

                                 SETH
                        I need you to keep an eye on

                             (pointed)
                        Everyone.

           Ben follows Seth’s gaze to Claire. It’s an unexpected order, 
           but one Ben dares not question.

           ACROSS THE ROOM -

           Claire watches the aftermath, never more alone.
                                 JUNE (O.S.)
                        Claire.

           June approaches, full of tender concern.

                        How you holding up?

           Claire can’t answer. A single word would break the dam.

                                 JUNE (CONT'D)
                        I know.

           June wraps a comforting arm around Claire.

                                 JUNE (CONT'D)
                        There are people out there that 
                        mean us harm. It’s never easy being 
                        reminded of that. But God’s got it, 
                        honey. His plan always prevails.

           Claire lets herself rest in June’s embrace.

                        and church officials have said very 
                        little about the incident -

                        Make no mistake, people. This was

           No answer.

                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                        Has anyone seen Erik Ray?

                                 DAVID
                        Not in a couple days.

           Seth goes dark, shoots Ben a look. A silent command.

           EXT. PORCH - LEWIS HOME - NIGHT

           Claire lies on the porch swing, adrift.

           The only sound is the distant DRUMBEAT of a basketball...

           EXT. BACKYARD BASKETBALL COURT - SAME

           Seth shoots hoops. Clearing his head.

           His cell phone RINGS. He answers it -

                                 SETH
                        Yes?

           EXT. PORCH - SAME

           Claire strains to hear Seth’s muffled conversation.

           After a moment, she hears him enter the house with a SLAM.

           INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Claire walks in to find Seth digging through his wallet.

                                 CLAIRE
                        What’s going on?

                                 SETH
                        David called. The police named 
                        their suspect. Kyle Coleman, the 
                        boyfriend of our houseguest.

           Seth finds what he’s looking for - a police department 
           business card.

                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                        It’s a helluva con, actually. She 
                        gets a gullible sap like you to 
                        take her in.

                        in Billy the Kid to haul it away.

           Seth dials his cell.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Addie had nothing to do with it.

                        7612 South Fifth. Country Club 
                        Estates.

           Claire watches, conflicted. Then, rushes out of the room.

           EXT. RANSOM - NIGHT

           CLAIRE’S CAR weaves down residential streets.

           IN THE CAR

           Claire drives, a distressed Addie next to her.

                                 ADDIE
                        I wasn’t part of it, Claire. I 
                        promise.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I know.

           Claire keeps her eyes on the rearview mirror.

                                 ADDIE
                        I didn’t mean to mess things up 
                        with you and Seth.

           Claire pats her hand.

                                 CLAIRE
                        That mess was made long before you 
                        came along.

           Claire pulls up to -
           ERIK’S HOUSE

           She notices a light on inside.

           INT. ERIK’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           A KNOCK on the front door. Erik opens, eyes widen at the 
           sight of Claire on his porch.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I thought you may have left -

           Erik tries to pull the door closed, but she won’t let him.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                        Erik. I know I don’t have the right 
                        to ask you for anything -

                                 ERIK
                        You shouldn’t be here.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Please. I need a place for Addie, 
                        just for tonight.

                                 ERIK
                             (through gritted teeth)
                        Go away.

           There’s venom in his voice like she’s never heard before. She 
           backs away.

           Erik shuts the door on her.

                                 BEN (O.S.)
                        What did she want?

           Erik turns to BEN, who glares at him from across the room.

                                 ERIK
                        Couldn’t tell you.

           Ben looks out the window, watches Claire climb into her car. 
           He moves past Erik, who tries to slow him -

                                 ERIK (CONT'D)
                        Hold on a minute.

           But he’s out the door, after Claire.
           EXT. PARISH HOUSE - SAINT MARY MAGDALENE’S - NIGHT

           A tiny cottage next to the church, the priest’s residence.

           INT. KITCHEN - PARISH HOUSE - SAME

           Perez washes his dinner dishes, a baseball game on the radio.

           He looks out the window to see -

           CLAIRE’S CAR, pulling into the empty church parking lot.

           INT. BEDROOM - PARISH HOUSE - NIGHT

           Addie sits on Perez’s twin bed. Claire is across the room, 
           finishing a phone call -

                                 CLAIRE
                             (on the phone)
                        Yes, thank you for your help.

           She ends the call, turns to Addie.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                        We’ll be on a flight to Juneau by 
                        nine a.m.

                                 ADDIE
                        You’ll miss your TV taping.

                                 CLAIRE
                        It’s not my taping. I’m just window 
                        dressing.

           Claire senses a reluctance in Addie.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                        You alright?
                             (off Addie’s shrug)
                        Hey.

                                 ADDIE
                        You don’t think I should reach out 
                        to the police? I’m sure I could 
                        help ‘em find where Kyle’s hiding 
                        out.

           After a moment of calculation -

                                 CLAIRE
                        They’ll haul you in if they think 
                        you’re involved.
                                 ADDIE
                        But I wasn’t.

                                 CLAIRE
                        It doesn’t matter. To them, you’re 
                        a Brooks Crook - and that makes you 
                        guilty of something.

           It kills Claire to manipulate her like this, but -

                                 CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                        You could do the responsible thing 
                        and tell them what you know. Or you 
                        could get your son away from this 
                        place before he’s branded with the 
                        same iron.

           A troubling thought. It’s enough to convince Addie.

           EXT. SAINT MARY MAGDALENE’S - NIGHT

           Father Perez sweeps the church’s front steps. Claire wanders 
           over, sits on the step.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Thank you for this, father.

                                 FATHER PEREZ
                        What kind of innkeeper would I be 
                        if I turned away an expecting young 
                        mother?
                             (nothing)
                        A Christmas joke.

           Claire appreciates his effort to lighten the mood.

                                 FATHER PEREZ (CONT'D)
                        That girl. It’s her absolution 
                        you’re after?

           Claire doesn’t have to answer. It’s obvious.

                                 FATHER PEREZ (CONT'D)
                        But she doesn’t know.

           Claire shakes her head - no.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I wouldn’t even know what to say.

                                 FATHER PEREZ
                        Getting God’s forgiveness is easy. 
                        Another person’s?

                        words for that.

           He finishes his sweeping.

                                 FATHER PEREZ (CONT'D)
                        There’s a cheap bottle of scotch 
                        above the stove. Help yourself.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Where will you sleep tonight?

           He cocks his head toward the church.

                                 FATHER PEREZ
                        Those old pews aren’t as 
                        uncomfortable as they look. Good 
                        night, Claire.

                                 CLAIRE
                        ‘Night.

           He opens the church’s front door, disappears inside.

           EXT. SAINT MARY MAGDALENE'S - NIGHT

           Claire sits alone on the church steps, listens to the summer 
           night. A rare moment of peace.

           As a truck rumbles past the church, its headlights reveal –

           A PARKED CAR on the road. Silent and suspicious.

           Claire stands, moves cautiously toward the car. As she nears 
           it, the door opens and -

           Ben steps out. He marches toward Claire. Not relishing this.

                                 CLAIRE
                        What are you doing here, Ben?

                        There’s something you need to know

                        Why did you follow us?

                        There’s no time. Please just 
                        listen. 

           Claire yields to his urgency.

                        The day I turned eighteen, I was 
                        driving my dad’s old Buick. I was 
                        drunk and I took a corner too fast.

           He’s trying to get it out before he loses his nerve -

                                 BEN (CONT'D)
                        There was a boy on his bike. Ten-
                        year-old kid, riding home from 
                        Little League. I didn’t know what 
                        to do.
                             (sickened by the memory)
                        So I left him there. I just drove 
                        away. 
                             (off her look)
                        I told you I don’t always handle 
                        things correctly.

                        When I told my father, he said he 
                        wasn’t going to let my wickedness 
                        ruin what he was building. So he 
                        had the car stripped down - and had 
                        me sent off to boot camp. He got to 
                        build his church and I got to keep 
                        my life - for whatever that’s

                        I owe a heavy debt to my father and 
                        his ministry. And that comes with 
                        certain obligations.

           A CAR rolls into the lot. Claire recognizes it as -

           SETH’S JAGUAR

           Claire looks at Ben, betrayed.

                                 BEN (CONT'D)
                        I’m sorry.

           Seth steps out of the car. 

                                 SETH
                        Come on, Claire. It’s time to go 
                        home.
                             (off her hesitation)
                        Help me get through tomorrow. You 
                        owe me that.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I’m not fit to be up there with 
                        you. I don’t deserve it.

           Seth fights to keep his cool.

                                 SETH
                        You’re my wife. You made a pledge. 
                        What’s it look like if you walk out 
                        on me?

                                 CLAIRE
                        It looks like we’re a struggling 
                        couple.

                                 SETH
                        We don’t get to be a struggling 
                        couple.

                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                             (out of patience)
                        I’m done with this. Let’s go.

           He reaches to grab her, she pulls away.

                                 CLAIRE
                        No.

           Seth hardly recognizes his wife. He looks around, notices the 
           parish house.

                                 SETH
                        Where’s the little thief? She in 
                        there?

           He heads toward the house. Claire goes after him. Ben 
           follows, unsure of his role here.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Leave her alone.

                                 SETH
                             (yelling out)
                        Hey, Addie!

           Claire beats Seth to the door, blocks his entry.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Seth. Please. Just go away.

           A shadow fills the screen door behind her. It’s Addie.

                                 SETH
                        Where’s my church’s money, Addie?

           A catatonic Addie doesn’t seem to hear him. 

                                 ADDIE
                        Claire - ?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Addie, stay inside. Lock the door.

           But she doesn’t move. Eggshell fragile, she stares at Claire 
           through the screen.

                                 ADDIE
                        Did you do it?

                                 CLAIRE
                        What - ?

                                 ADDIE
                        You and Erik. Did you kill my dad?
           For Claire, time seems to stop.

                                 SETH
                        What is she talking about?

           Claire’s entire focus is on Addie.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Where did you hear this?

                                 ADDIE
                        Kyle. And he said you helped him 
                        steal that money.

           Seth and Ben can’t believe what they’re hearing.

                                 CLAIRE
                             (floundering)
                        This is - no. Kyle is a liar. You 
                        know that -

                                 ADDIE
                        I can tell when he’s lying. This 
                        was different.

                                 SETH
                        What is going on?

           Claire turns to Seth -

                                 CLAIRE
                        Will you give me a minute with her?

                                 ADDIE
                        Is it true?

           Claire’s silence, her lack of denial is thunderous.

           Horrified, Addie bolts toward the bedroom.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Addie.

           Claire throws open the door, runs into -

           THE PARISH HOUSE

           Seth follows her inside.

           Claire rushes to the closed bedroom door. She tries the knob, 
           locked. She pleads through the door -
                                 CLAIRE
                        Sweetie, please.

                                 ADDIE (O.S.)
                        What was all this? What were you 
                        doing with me?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Open the door. Let me explain.

           At the sound of Addie’s SOBS, Claire falls apart. She can 
           only whisper to a closed door -

                                 CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                        I’m sorry. I’m sorry...

           Claire hears shuffling from inside, a window sliding open.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                        Addie?

           No answer. She’s gone.

           Claire turns and flies past Seth, still trying to digest 
           everything he just heard.

           EXT. PARISH HOUSE - NIGHT

           Claire sprints out of the house, sees -

           Addie, running toward the highway. Claire goes after her.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Addie!

           Addie heads for oncoming HEADLIGHTS of a truck, arms waving.

           Claire pursues - but not fast enough.

           The TRUCK slows to a stop. Addie climbs in.

           Claire watches the truck drive Addie away, taillights 
           disappear down the highway.

           Ben arrives. Grabs Claire by the arm, pulls her away.

                                 BEN
                        You’re going home.
           INT. SETH’S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

           Seth drives, but he’s not here. A lost man, reeling from a 
           punishment he can’t comprehend.

           Claire rides next to him. Broken, beyond apology.

           Neither says a word.

           INT. READING ROOM - JUNE & GIDEON’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           June sits stoic in a nightgown. Seth lies next to her, head 
           in her lap, BAWLING like a child. She strokes his hair.

           Gideon shuffles into the room.

                                 GIDEON
                        What’s all this?

                                 JUNE
                        Go back to bed, Gideon.
                             (calling out)
                        Mario!

           Gideon notices Seth’s tears.

                                 GIDEON
                        What’s he carrying on about?

                                 JUNE
                        It doesn’t concern you.

                                 GIDEON
                        If it’s happening in my house, I’d 
                        say it concerns me.

                                 JUNE
                             (snaps)
                        It doesn’t concern you!

           Gideon shrinks at her outburst.

           Mario hurries in.

                                 JUNE (CONT'D)
                        Get him out of here.

                                 MARIO
                        I’m sorry, ma’am. Here we go, Mr. 
                        Lewis. Back to bed.

           Mario leads a rattled Gideon out of the room.
           INT. HALLWAY - LEWIS HOME - NIGHT

           Claire opens her bedroom door to find - 

           A New Dawn SECURITY GUARD (NICK) waiting in the hallway.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Nick? What are you doing here?

                                 NICK
                        Is there something you need, Mrs. 
                        Lewis?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Yeah. Something to help me sleep.

                                 NICK
                             (thinks)
                        Okay, go ahead.

           Claire heads down the hall. Then, realizes Nick is following 
           her, not letting her out of his sight. 

           Shadowed, a prisoner in her own home.

                                                          FADE TO BLACK

           EXT. NEW DAWN CHURCH - SUNDAY MORNING

           Daybreak brings life to the church campus -

           Energized staff members arrive. The Greet Team straps on its 
           vests and headsets, ready to take their positions.

           The Worship Center is opened, lights come up.

           The big day begins.

           INT. BEDROOM - LEWIS HOME - MORNING

           Sunlight cuts through the blinds. Claire wakes to find -

           Seth seated at the end of the bed, bent over his Bible.

                                 CLAIRE
                        What’s he telling you?

           Seth looks up from his reading.

                                 SETH
                        That he takes care of his flock.
           He’s softer than last night, a surrender.

                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                        That he’ll keep us safe.

                                 CLAIRE
                        How do you know?

                                 SETH
                        I don’t. But I have faith. “He 
                        shall be our refuge and our 
                        fortress.”

                                 CLAIRE
                        What about you and me?

           Seth closes his Bible, sits with her question for a moment.

                                 SETH
                        I spoke to Erik last night. He told 
                        me everything: How he chased you, 
                        how he snared you in a moment of 
                        weakness. That it was all his 
                        doing.

           Claire looks away.

                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                        And I’m choosing to believe him.

           Seth stands, straightens himself.

                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                        We’ll start over. We’ll see that 
                        marriage coach, we’ll do our Monday 
                        movie nights. It can be good again.
                             (this one is hard for him)
                        And I won’t force you to have 
                        children if you’re not ready. 
                        You’ll keep all of this. As long as 
                        you’re on that stage with me every 
                        Sunday.

           Claire considers the deal he’s proposing.

                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                        If you can find a way to live with 
                        that, I’ll need you downstairs in 
                        thirty minutes.

           He exits, leaving Claire with a choice.
           INT. TOOL SHED - BROOKS HOME - MORNING

           Addie bandages Kyle’s wounded hand. He jabbers, drug-fueled 
           and feral.

                                 KYLE
                        Motherfucker’s lucky he didn’t hit 
                        my rope hand -

           Addie’s phone buzzes. She checks the ID - “CLAIRE.”

                                 KYLE (CONT'D)
                        Who is it?

                                 ADDIE
                        No one.

           She hits IGNORE on her phone and resumes her work...

           INT. BEDROOM - LEWIS HOME - SAME

           Claire’s call to Addie goes to voicemail. 

           She hangs up, dejected. So much she wants to say.

           EXT. DRIVEWAY - LEWIS HOME - DAY

           Seth buffs out a blemish on his Jaguar. Waiting, watching the 
           front door of his house. Finally -

           It opens and Claire steps out. She looks radiant in her 
           Sunday best, but there’s a dead resignation in her eyes.

           Relieved, Seth opens the car door for her.

                                 SETH (V.O.)
                        “Why does God have to test me?”

                        “I thought I was saved, Pastor

           Seth rehearses into the gold flame sculpture, mounted to the

                        It’s an exhausting and often 
                        thankless job. But if we do it 
                        well, it’s a job that promises full 
                        benefits.

           The sculpture lacks some radiance, scratches that can’t be 
           polished out.

           INT. READY ROOM - DAY

           Seth leads the team in the weekly prayer ring. Head bowed, 
           Claire holds Seth’s hand.

           Claire looks up to see June enter the room. Sheepish, Claire 
           eyes her - how much does she know?

                                 SETH (V.O.)
                        Because, if we fulfill our purpose 
                        and glorify his name, our payoff is 
                        a place in his eternal family.

           Then - June joins the circle, taking Claire’s other hand. A 
           gesture of solidarity.

           INT. WORSHIP CENTER - DAY

           On stage, the band plays an OPENING ROCK HYMN.

           The crowd is on their feet, all energy and anticipation for 
           this historic service.

           INT. BACKSTAGE - SAME

           Claire follows Seth to the stage wings, when -
           Someone grabs her wrist, pulls her into the shadows. 

           It's ERIK. Claire reacts, afraid to be caught with him.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Erik - we can’t -

                                 ERIK
                             (urgency)
                        I know, but I had to see you before 
                        I left.

           She notices his split lip, bruised cheek.

                                 CLAIRE
                        What happened to you?

                                 ERIK
                        We - negotiated my exit.

           Claire studies him, full of questions.

                                 ERIK (CONT'D)
                        Seth made a pay-off deal with Kyle 
                        and Addie. I’m taking the cash to 
                        them this morning. My last 
                        assignment.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Please be careful. I don’t trust 
                        Kyle.

                                 ERIK
                        I will.

                                 CLAIRE
                        So she went back to him.

           Erik senses the pull inside her, the need to intervene.

                                 ERIK
                        Claire, I want you to go out on 
                        that stage and smile, okay? Just 
                        play your part, don’t make trouble. 
                        Enjoy all the nice things it gets 
                        you.

           Their eyes meet for a quiet moment. Everything that’s 
           happened, everything that could have been.

           Then he sees something over her shoulder -

                                 ERIK (CONT'D)
                        My ride’s here.
           BEN has found Erik. He grabs him, yanks him away from Claire. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Ben -

           But he’s made of stone, refuses to look at her.

           Claire and Erik share a fleeting glimpse - then Erik’s gone.

                                 STAGE MANAGER (O.S.)
                        Mrs. Lewis.

           The stage manager appears, flustered.

                                 STAGE MANAGER (CONT'D)
                        We need you on your mark.

           Claire follows him, haunted by her exchange with Erik.

           INT. STAGE - DAY

           Seth and Claire step out, hand-in-hand. They’re greeted by 
           more lights, louder cheers than ever.

           Claire forces that expected smile. The loyal pastor’s wife. 
           She takes her on-stage seat.

                                 SETH
                        Who’s here for Jesus?

           The congregation ROARS.

                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                        I’d like to welcome everyone here - 
                             (to a camera)
                        - and to our new friends watching 
                        from home. It's a blessing to be 
                        part of your day. 
                             (the elephant in the room)
                        There’s no sense in ignoring it. 
                        You’ve probably seen the news. Our 
                        church was tested this week.

           He clocks Gideon in the front row, next to June. Gideon is 
           distracted by the sweeping cameras, the production lights.

                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                        But my dad had a saying: “Let God's 
                        test - ?”

           The congregation responds: “- bring out your best.”
                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                        That’s right. Let God’s test bring 
                        out your best. “But Pastor Seth, I 
                        thought I was saved. Shouldn’t my 
                        life be sweet and easy? Why does 
                        God have to test me?”

           Seth reflects, an uncomfortably long pause. Claire senses a 
           glitch in him, a vulnerability. Back on track -

                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                        God tests us to make sure we have 
                        the stomach for his work. And -

           He stops. Then takes an unplanned detour.

                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                        And scripture tells us that his 
                        work is serious business. Like  
                        here -

           Seth scrambles for his Bible, flips through it.

                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                        In Mark chapter three, we're warned 
                        that “every tree that does not 
                        produce good fruit will be cut down 
                        and thrown into the fire.” Nothing 
                        sweet and easy about that, is 
                        there?

           INT. CONTROL ROOM - SAME

           There’s confusion among the church executives.

                                 DAVID
                        What’s he doing?

                                 LIZ
                        I don’t know. He’s off-script.

           INT. STAGE - SAME

           Seth flips to another page.

                                 SETH
                        Later John says that “God's 
                        winnowing fork is in his hand, and 
                        he will clear his threshing floor, 
                        gathering his wheat into the barn 
                        and burning up the chaff with 
                        unquenchable fire.”
           Claire is unsettled by the darkness in his tone.

                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                        Are we up for the challenge? Can we 
                        be as ruthless in our faith as God 
                        is in his expectations of us? Will 
                        God’s test bring out our best? 
                        Lord, I hope so.

           The auditorium is silent. What is happening?

                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                        Please join me in prayer. Father, 
                        give us the strength to do the 
                        painful, unpleasant work so that we 
                        may bear fruit for you.

           He chokes up, barely holding it together.

                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                        Forgive us when we fail your tests. 
                        And comfort us when we pass them. 
                        Make our purpose clear, Lord. In 
                        your son's name. Amen.

           The band begins A HYMN, mercifully breaking the tension.

           Claire continues to study Seth, deep concern.

           Finally, she crosses the stage to him. Leans in, private.

                                 CLAIRE
                        What did you do?

           Seth holds his smile, their conversation covered by the song. 

                                 SETH
                        Go back to your seat.

                                 CLAIRE
                        What did you send Erik into?
                             (no answer)
                        Seth.

                                 SETH
                        God’s got it, Claire. Now go sit 
                        down.

           There’s an edge to his voice that fills Claire with dread.

           She moves off, numb. Instead of returning to her seat, she 
           changes direction and STORMS OFFSTAGE.
           ON JUNE AND GIDEON,

           Watching Claire leave the stage.

                                 GIDEON
                        And where’s she going?

           June has no answer.

           INT. CONTROL ROOM - SAME

           The production team reacts.

                                 DIRECTOR
                        What’s happening?

                                 LIZ
                        I don’t know. Can you just go tight 
                        on Seth?

                                 DIRECTOR
                             (into the com)
                        Marco, I need you to frame out the 
                        wife’s seat. Pat, can you find out 
                        if she’s coming back?

           David and Liz exchange looks.

           INT. BACKSTAGE - DAY

           Claire flies past the stage manager, his headset chattering.

                                 STAGE MANAGER
                        Mrs. Lewis, the booth would like 
                        you back on stage.

           June arrives, calls after her -

                                 JUNE
                        Claire - ?

           But Claire doesn’t hear her, heading for the exit.

           INT. NEW DAWN SEDAN - MOVING - DAY

           Ben drives. Erik sits beside him, a GYM BAG in his lap. 

           Erik unzips the bag and peers in. Full of CASH.
           INT. SETH’S CAR - MOVING - DAY

           Claire speeds, weaving between cars on the highway.

           She’s on the phone to the police -

                                 CLAIRE
                        I realize that. I don't know what 
                        I'm reporting, but I think 
                        someone's going to be hurt. 
                             (beat)
                        Can you please just help me?

           INT. BROOKS HOME - DAY

           Kyle peers through curtains, sees the New Dawn sedan pull up.

           He calls out to Addie -

                                 KYLE
                        They’re here!

           He checks his HANDGUN, confirms he has a chambered bullet. 
           Readies himself.

           INT. BROOKS HOME - MOMENTS LATER

           Addie holds the door as Erik and Ben enter. Erik carries the 
           bag of pay-off cash.

           Ben scans the room, uneasy, his soldier’s intuition buzzing.

                                 ADDIE
                        That the money?

                                 ERIK
                        This is it.

           He offers the bag, impatient to finish this. Ben stops him.

                                 BEN
                        Where’s Kyle? He’s supposed to be 
                        here.

                                 ADDIE
                             (a bad liar)
                        I haven’t seen him.

                                 BEN
                        The agreement was to give it to 
                        both of you.
                                 ADDIE
                        I don’t know what to tell you.

                                 BEN
                        Then the deal’s off.
                             (to Erik)
                        Let’s go.

           He moves toward the door.

                                 KYLE (O.S.)
                        Christ almighty. Hold up.

           Kyle enters the room, gun in his hand.

                                 KYLE (CONT'D)
                        Lift up your shirts. I don’t wanna 
                        see any guns.

           Ben and Erik lift their shirts.

                                 KYLE (CONT'D)
                        Turn around.

           They spin, clean. Kyle waves his bandaged hand at Ben.

                                 KYLE (CONT'D)
                        Hello again, old friend.

           No love lost between them.

           INT. SETH’S CAR - MOVING - DAY

           Claire rockets down the COUNTRY ROAD toward Addie’s house.

           She can see the NEW DAWN CAR parked outside.

           INT. BROOKS HOME - DAY

           Erik turns to Ben.

                                 ERIK
                        Everyone’s here. Can we do this?

           Ben nods. Erik hands the bag to Kyle.

                                 KYLE
                        You’ll excuse me while I check your 
                        work.

           He unzips the bag, begins pulling out the cash. 
                                 ADDIE
                        It looks square, Kyle.

                                 KYLE
                        Shut up while I’m counting.

           Kyle is transfixed by the most money he’s ever seen. He lets 
           his gun go lazy.

                                 KYLE (CONT'D)
                        It’s funny. Y’all can’t shut up 
                        about how “Jesus saves” and here 
                        you are paying me to save your 
                        asses.

           THEN -

           In a single fluid motion, Ben lifts a 9MM HANDGUN from his 
           ankle holster, and -

           POP! He BLASTS A BULLET through Kyle’s skull.

           His dead body collapses at Addie’s feet. SHE SCREAMS.

           One down...

           Ben pivots toward Erik, who realizes Ben’s intention -

                                 ERIK
                        Ben! No -

           Ben TAKES AIM -

           Erik scampers across the room as BEN FIRES at him. The first 
           shot misses. Erik runs for the open BEDROOM DOOR. 

           Ben pursues, FIRING SHOTS. One round finds its target -

           ERIK SHRIEKS, HIT IN THE LEG. He falls into the BEDROOM. He 
           forces the door closed as Ben stalks toward him.

           EXT. BROOKS HOME - DAY

           Claire is out of the car, hears the SHOTS and SCREAMS.

           She sprints to the front door and bursts into -

           THE HOUSE

           Claire takes in the chaos:

           - KYLE’S DEAD BODY pools blood.
           - BEN FIRES SHOTS into the bedroom door to finish off Erik.

           - ADDIE HUDDLES ON THE FLOOR, tears cascading down her face.

           Claire rushes to help Addie.

           Ben senses movement and turns. The unexpected sight of Claire 
           rips him from his killer’s daze.

                                 BEN
                        What are you doing?

           Claire shields Addie’s body with her own, eyes locked on Ben.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Addie, stand up.

           Addie climbs to her feet, cowering behind her rescuer.

                                 BEN
                        You're not supposed to be here.

                                 CLAIRE
                             (to Addie)
                        It’s okay. You’re just going to 
                        hold onto me.

           Ben trains his gun on them, conflicted.

                                 BEN
                        I was given an order.

           Claire eases Addie toward the door. Always keeping herself 
           between Addie and Ben’s barrel.

                                 BEN (CONT'D)
                        Stay away from that door.

           Claire continues inching Addie toward the exit.

           He FIRES A WARNING SHOT into the wall. Claire freezes.

                                 BEN (CONT'D)
                        Please. Stop moving.

           Claire stares into Ben, clocks his deep turmoil.

                                 CLAIRE
                        The boy on the bike. What was his 
                        name?

                                 BEN
                        I don’t know.
                                 CLAIRE
                        Yes, you do. What was his name?

           Ben relents -

                                 BEN
                        Scotty Palmer.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Does killing this girl make up for 
                        Scotty Palmer? Does it pay your 
                        debt?

           Claire notices -

           A WOUNDED ERIK

           Crawling from the bedroom toward Ben. Claire gives a subtle 
           shake of her head to wave him off. He stops.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                        I don’t know about you, Ben, but 
                        I’ve never needed one of these more 
                        than right now.

           She reaches for Kyle’s MARLBOROS on the table.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                        So here’s what’s going to happen: 
                        We’re going to let Addie walk out 
                        the door -

                                 BEN
                        That’s not how it’s supposed to go.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I don’t care what Seth ordered you 
                        to do. You’re going to give Addie 
                        the chance Scotty never got. This 
                        is one you’re going to handle 
                        correctly.

           Ben’s gun drifts, his mission growing hazy.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                        We’re going to sit down and smoke 
                        this pack and you’re going to tell 
                        me everything you’ve needed to say 
                        all these years. You’re going to 
                        get your absolution today. How does 
                        that sound?

           An appealing thought to Ben. Before he can answer -
           The door opens, sunlight pours in. Ben aims his gun at the 
           figure in the doorway...

                                 JUNE
                        Put that thing down, Benjamin.

           Ben quickly obliges, lowers his gun.

           JUNE enters. She shudders as her eyes adjust to the carnage.

                                 JUNE (CONT'D)
                        Oh, no - oh, dear -

                                 BEN
                        I’m sorry, mama.

                                 CLAIRE
                        It’s okay, June. He’s not going to 
                        hurt anyone else. Are you, Ben?

           Ben doesn’t answer. Only looks to his mother.

                                 JUNE
                        Let’s give him some space. 
                        Benjamin, I’m taking her outside.

           Claire nudges Addie toward the door. But June stops Addie 
           with a gentle touch.

                                 JUNE (CONT'D)
                        I’m sorry, dear. This isn’t for 
                        you. Claire and I have things to 
                        discuss.

           June offers a hand to a confused Claire.

           Then Claire realizes. June sees it in her face.

                                 JUNE (CONT'D)
                        It’s the last thing any of us 
                        wanted.

           Claire reels, the veil lifted.

                                 CLAIRE
                        You did this.

                                 JUNE
                        Actually, honey, you did this. Your 
                        poor judgment made it necessary. 
                        But we forgive and move on because 
                        we’re family.

           Claire backs Addie away.
                                 CLAIRE
                        No - not if this is what you are.

                                 JUNE
                        You know what we are. You see the 
                        good we do for people, all the 
                        lives we save.
                             (a rush of memories)
                        But my family paid dearly for that 
                        privilege. I stood by a man who 
                        hurt me and my children in every 
                        way. Didn’t he, Benjamin?

           Ben gives a faint nod.

                                 JUNE (CONT'D)
                        That was our investment in the 
                        Lord’s work. And I’m sorry, but I 
                        will not see it wasted.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Covering up Scotty Palmer - was 
                        that the Lord’s work?

           June shifts a glare to Ben.

                                 JUNE
                        You were never to mention that 
                        name.

           Ben looks off, scolded.

                                 JUNE (CONT'D)
                             (back to Claire)
                        I’ve prayed endlessly about that 
                        boy. What we did kept our ministry 
                        saving souls. So yes, I believe it 
                        was the Lord’s work.

           June moves to the open door.

                                 JUNE (CONT'D)
                        But his work is never done. And 
                        that generous soul of yours is 
                        going to help millions, Claire.
                             (extends a hand)
                        So come on.

           Addie clings tighter to Claire.

                                 ADDIE
                        Don’t leave me - please.
                                 CLAIRE
                        I’m not going anywhere.

           June goes inward, playing through every option. The room 
           waits for her response. Finally -

                                 JUNE
                        If it has to be.
                             (an order)
                        Benjamin.

           Her decree is clear: Claire takes a bullet too.

           Claire staggers away from her, horrified.

           Ben wavers, not what he’d planned.

                                 BEN
                        Wait - shouldn’t we talk to Seth 
                        about this?

                                 JUNE
                        He’ll have to understand. She 
                        wouldn’t be reasoned with.

                                 BEN
                        But she’s been decent to me.

                                 JUNE
                        If she’d been decent, we wouldn’t 
                        be here. We gave her everything and 
                        look how she treated us. I’ll be 
                        outside, Benjamin.

           June steps out the door, slams it shut behind her, sealing 
           the darkness inside.

           Ben looks sick, wrestling over what to do. He moves toward 
           Claire and Addie.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Ben?

           Ben checks his gun’s magazine. Four rounds remain -

                                 BEN
                        I’m sorry.

           Erik crawls toward him -

                                 ERIK
                        Hold on, Ben! Stop!

           Claire and Addie scurry to the corner, drop to the floor.
                                 CLAIRE
                        Please. Don’t -

           But he hears nothing. He pulls back the gun’s slide -

                                 CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                        Ben!

           EXT. BROOKS HOME - SAME

           June walks from the house, when -

           THREE GUNSHOTS are heard, dull and distant.

           For June, the sound offers no satisfaction. She teeters for a 
           moment, but hardens herself.

           INT. BROOKS HOME - SAME

           It’s pin-drop quiet as WE FOCUS ON -

           THE WALL that Ben shot earlier - and its THREE NEW BULLET 
           HOLES.

           Everyone’s breathing resumes...

           Claire, Addie, Erik - all still alive. 

           Ben kneels next to Claire and Addie.

                                 BEN
                        Please make sure Scotty’s parents 
                        know what happened.

           Claire accepts with a nod.

                                 BEN (CONT'D)
                        I want that absolution.

           He stands, opens the door and steps -

           OUTSIDE

           On the front porch, he pauses to absorb the daylight.

           June turns to see him.

                                 JUNE
                        You’re a good boy.
                                 BEN
                        Thank you, mama.

           He presses the gun under his chin and FIRES his last round.

           His DEAD BODY drops to the porch. 

           June lets out an unholy SHRIEK.

                                 JUNE
                        Benjamin?!

           She rushes to her son. Cranes over his body, howling.

           IN THE HOUSE

           Claire hears JUNE’S CRIES, realizes what Ben did. 

           She stands, looks back at Addie and Erik, both in need.

                                 ERIK
                        Get her out of here. Go.

           Claire lifts Addie to her feet.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Come on, stand up.

           Claire looks out a back window, a RUSTED PICKUP is parked 
           behind the house.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                        That truck. Does it run?

           Addie nods - yes.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                        Okay, we’re going out the back.

           She leads Addie toward the door.

                                 ERIK
                        Claire.

           He points across the room where the BAG OF MONEY lies next to 
           Kyle’s body.

           EXT. BACK OF HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Claire helps Addie into the driver’s seat of the truck. 
           Urgent, she hands her the bag of money.
                                 CLAIRE
                        Don’t go too long without eating, 
                        okay? Keep the gas above a quarter 
                        tank - 

                                 ADDIE
                        What about you?

                                 CLAIRE
                             (ignoring)
                        And if you end up in Juneau, 
                        promise me you’ll buy a good, thick 
                        coat before winter hits. I can’t 
                        worry about you freezing to death 
                        up there -

                                 ADDIE
                        Claire.

           Claire faces the distress in Addie’s eyes. She puts a hand on 
           Addie’s belly.

                                 CLAIRE
                        This little boy is your only 
                        concern.

           Claire reaches into the truck, turns the ignition. The engine 
           growls to life, ready for the road.

           Claire takes in the sight of Addie behind the wheel, a 
           resilient young warrior.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                        You’re going to be an incredible 
                        mother.

           They stare at each other, Claire searching for words.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                        If there were a way to give back 
                        what I took from you – 

           Addie cuts her off with an embrace. 

                                 ADDIE
                        I’ve got what I need.

           They separate, both in tears. Claire slams the door shut.

           They share a final look. Then Addie shifts the truck into 
           gear and drives away.

           Claire watches her disappear in a cloud of gravel dust.
           She heads into the house -

           INT. BROOKS HOME - MOMENTS LATER

           Claire kneels over Erik, applying pressure to his wound.

                                 ERIK
                        Why didn't you go with her?

                                 CLAIRE
                        You need my help more than she 
                        does.

           Erik gazes up at her through the blood-loss fog. She looks 
           transcendent to him.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                        You could be on a beach in Panama 
                        right now. Why didn’t you leave 
                        when you had the chance? 

                                 ERIK
                        I didn’t want to be where you 
                        weren’t.
                             (can’t believe he’s saying 
                              it)
                        You make blind devotion seem 
                        reasonable.

           Erik examines her hand, imprinting it on his mind. Their 
           wistful silence is interrupted by -

           Distant POLICE SIRENS. Erik musters a smile.

                                 ERIK (CONT'D)
                        And Panama’s too hot anyway.

                                 CLAIRE
                        You need an ambulance.

                                 ERIK
                        Stay with me. They’ll find us.

           They listen to the sirens approach. The bittersweet sound of 
           finality.

                                 ERIK (CONT'D)
                        Since when do you smoke?

           She shrugs, self-conscious.

                                 ERIK (CONT'D)
                        You’re full of secrets.
                                 CLAIRE
                        Not for long.

           The SIRENS arrive outside the house.

                                 SETH (V.O.)
                        And now, my friends, may the Lord 
                        bless you and keep you -

           EXT. BROOKS HOME - DAY

           Two DEPUTIES approach Ben’s body, an unresponsive June 
           huddled over him.

                                 SETH (V.O.)
                        May the Lord make his face shine 
                        upon you and be gracious to you -

           The deputies circle June and Ben.

                                 DEPUTY
                        Ma’am, can you hear me? Ma’am.

           No answer.

           INT. ADDIE’S TRUCK - MOVING - DAY

           Addie cruises west across the Oklahoma plains.

                                 SETH (V.O.)
                        May the Lord lift up his 
                        countenance upon you -

           She’s moving forward, eyes fixed on a hopeful future.

           INT. WORSHIP CENTER - NEW DAWN - DAY

           Seth is on stage, Claire’s chair sits empty behind him.

                                 SETH
                        - and may he give you his peace. 
                        Amen.

           The band launches into the FINAL HYMN of the service.

           Seth looks out over the sea of worshipers, cameras, and then -

           He sees a pair of POLICE DETECTIVES arrive on the stage 
           wings, waiting to talk to him. 
           Seth’s face goes blank. His greatest triumph and defeat 
           colliding in the same instant.

           But he won’t be robbed of this moment. He closes his eyes and 
           sings passionately with his congregation.

           The HYMN continues under -

           INT. DEPUTY PATROL CAR - MOVING - DAY

           Claire rides alone in the back. She’s in custody, but free of 
           the lies, weightless.

           She lets her head relax against the seat, watching the 
           countryside unspool outside her window, the Sunday morning 
           warmth on her face...

           EXT. NORTHEAST OKLAHOMA - DAY

           ...as we glide high above the patrol car, 

           the country road, 

           and the endless acres of green.

                                                               FADE OUT
