          Writ Large 

          Verve
           BREATHING... in... out... in...

           A MAN’S FACE inside the helmet of an Environmental Suit. A 
           tube connected to the chin of his visor leads to a backpack.

           This is JOEL (40) and he’s working hard on something that we 
           don’t see. Sweat drips off his nose, dotting the visor. 

           We don’t know where he is, but there is a REDDISH hue to the 
           atmosphere surrounding him. 

           TILT DOWN to a push broom in his hands as he clears dust and 
           dirt off of a solar panel. He finishes, moves on to another. 

           BLEEP-BLEEP... BLEEP-BLEEP... 

           Joel looks at a digital O2 gauge on his forearm. 20 min. He 
           silences the alert, then speaks into his helmet’s headset. 

                                 JOEL/HEADSET
                        Two minutes, then let’s head inside. 

           WIDEN OUT to reveal... 

           Joel on the roof of a BARN with a bank of SOLAR PANELS. He 
           gazes off and we get our first look at... 

           A SUN SCORCHED LAND. The ground is all dirt and rock. The sky 
           carries a red haze. And there isn’t a single soul in sight. 

           200 feet from the barn is a burnt, collapsing FARMHOUSE. An 
           entire wall is gone, exposing a ramshackle kitchen.

           A wrought iron sign reads, Garrett’s Farm.

           It’s like someone built a farm on Mars... 

           But this is not another planet... 

           This is Earth. 

           INT. FARMHOUSE/UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT

           MIKE (60’s, fit and able), also in an EV Suit, rummages 
           through a bookshelf in a dilapidated bedroom. 

                                 JOEL/HEADSET
                        Dad, you copy or what? 

           Mike speaks into his headset mic.
                                 MIKE/HEADSET
                        Quit your yapping. Perimeter’s secure. 
                        I ducked into the house for something. 

                                 JOEL/HEADSET
                        Dad, I hate when you wander off 
                        like this?  

                                 MIKE/HEADSET
                        Consider it practice for when I’m 
                        old and senile. 

           EXT. BARN ROOF - THAT MOMENT

           Joel CHUCKLES, looks at the farmhouse, and sees his father 
           through the bedroom window. 

                                 JOEL/HEADSET
                        Funny. What’re you doing in there?  

           INT. FARMHOUSE/UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Mike finds what he’s looking for. An old, frayed book, The 
           Complete Poems of Emily Dickinson. 

                                 MIKE/HEADSET
                        Just getting something for Meg. 

           Mike pockets the book, strolls to the window, and watches 
           Joel dust off the last of the solar panels.

           EXT. BARN ROOF - THAT MOMENT

           Joel places his hand over an EXHAUST PIPE, making sure air is 
           blowing out. The pipe travels down the side of the barn wall 
           and disappears into the dirt ground. 

           INT. FARMHOUSE/UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT

           Mike heads down the hall when -- CRACK -- the floor CAVES IN 
           underneath him, he PLUMMETS through the wood floor.

           INT. FARMHOUSE/LIVING ROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Mike CRASHES through the ceiling in the living room, but his 
           foot gets wedged between two wood beams.

           As his upper body continues to fall, he SMACKS his helmet, 
           the O2 tube attached to his helmet SEVERS. OXYGEN HISSES OUT.
           With his foot stuck, Mike dangles upside down from the 
           ceiling. His O2 gauge rapidly sinks, 5 min...4 min...3 min... 

                                 MIKE/HEADSET
                        Joel! JOEL!

           All Mike hears is STATIC and realizes his headset is damaged.  

           EXT. BARN - THAT MOMENT

           Joel is climbing down a ladder. 

                                 JOEL/HEADSET
                        Dad, you coming or what? 

           INT. FARMHOUSE/LIVING ROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Frantic, Mike tries to yank his leg free.  

           His O2 gauge reads 1 min. He inhales two huge lungfuls of air 
           just as, 0 min. The OXYGEN ALARM inside his helmet BLARES.

           OUTSIDE

           By the barn, Joel dusts himself off. When he doesn’t get a 
           response through his headset, he heads toward the farmhouse. 

           INSIDE

           OUT OF OXYGEN, Mike GASPS FOR AIR, his face is TURNING RED, 
           his eyes are starting to BULGE.

           OUTSIDE

           Joel jogs across the front yard.

           INSIDE

           The VEINS in Mike’s forehead look like they’re going to BURST 
           through his skin when --

           Joel runs into the living room and sees his dad, swaying back 
           and forth in a PANIC, ASPHYXIATING. 

                                 JOEL
                        OH GOD. DAD!

           Joel jumps for his dad’s trembling hands, but they’re out of 
           reach. Joel SPRINTS up the staircase. 
           ON MIKE

           HIS LIPS ARE TURNING BLUE -- BLOOD VESSELS BURSTS IN THE 
           WHITES OF HIS EYES -- HIS EYEBALLS ROLL BACK IN HIS HEAD --

           UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

           Joel grabs his dad’s legs, dislodges his foot from the beams. 
           He wrests Mike out of the hole and rolls him onto his back. 

           Mike’s BLOODSHOT EYES are WIDE and VACANT. PURPLE SPLOTCHES 
           mar his face and neck from INTERNAL HEMORRHAGES. 

           Joel just stares at his father, nothing he can do at this 
           point. Joel slumps forward, onto his dad’s body.   

           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - MOMENTS LATER

           We’re now in a dimly lit, windowless basement with cement 
           walls and a low ceiling. We don’t know where we are yet. 

           In the middle of this room is a couch and coffee table, which 
           faces a television set propped up on a dresser. 

           Metal shelving racks line the walls, full of meticulously 
           labeled storage bins: batteries, blankets, M.R.E’s. 

           One shelf has a MONITOR, which displays night vision 
           surveillance footage of a stairwell. 

           There are FOUR DOORS, one on each wall. Three of the doors 
           are normal bedroom doors. The other is a HEAVY, SUBMARINE 
           DOOR WITH THREE DEADBOLTS. 

           AMY (40), hair pulled back in a tight ponytail. Crisp white T-
           shirt tucked into jeans. She’s staring at a notebook of math 
           problems. With a red pen, she draws an “X” on an equation. 

           Waiting across from Amy is MEGAN (18). Long, unruly hair. Her 
           baggy BUFFALO BILLS sweatshirt and sweatpants are wrinkled. 
           She subconsciously bites her nails. 

                                 AMY
                        Meg, that’s distracting and 
                        unhygienic. 

           Megan glares at Amy, stops. Amy goes back to the notebook. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Good work. Fix this.  

           Amy slides the book to Megan, who looks at the equation. 
                                 MEGAN
                        Wait, but my answer’s correct. 

                                 AMY
                        But you didn’t show your work. 

                                 MEGAN
                        Mom, gimme a break. 

                                 AMY
                        Meg, it’s important for me to see 
                        how you got there? 

                                 MEGAN
                        Yeah, cause I cheated. 
                             (re: the empty room)
                        Off who? 

                                 AMY
                        Off ‘whom.’ English class is next.

           Megan MUTTERS something under her breath, starts correcting 
           her work, and biting her nails. Cleary there is some tension 
           between these two. Amy is about to protest when -- 

           We HEAR a mechanical CLICK at the submarine door. The locks 
           turn in unison. A WHOOSH of suction as the door opens... 

           Megan looks up with a smile as her dad, Joel, lumbers inside. 
           But her joy vanishes when he shuts the door. 

                                 MEGAN
                        Where’s grandpa? 

           He removes his helmet, takes a big inhalation of air. When 
           they see the despair in his face, they know the awful truth.

           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - MOMENTS LATER

           Amy, Megan and Joel sit at the table, mourning. Even in this 
           moment of loss, Amy refuses to slouch. But the sadness in her 
           eyes can’t be hidden. Megan wipes her tears on her sleeve.

                                 JOEL
                        I have to bury him tomorrow. 

                                 AMY
                        Of course... I’ll help you. 

                                 JOEL
                        No, I’m taking him to my mother. 

           Amy and Megan look at each other, huh? 
                                 AMY
                        But, your mother’s in a cemetery. 
                        Two miles away. 

                                 JOEL
                        It’s where he belongs, it’s the 
                        right thing to do.

                           MEGAN
                                                           AMY
           Dad...
                                              You need to rest. It’s not 
                                              safe--

                                 JOEL
                        We’ve been down here for three 
                        years now. When was the last time 
                        we saw anyone? 

                                 AMY
                        But you could trip, your O2 pack 
                        could break. Accidents happen, 
                        Joel, as evidenced by today. 

                                 MEGAN
                        I can go with you, Dad.

           Amy turns to Megan, looks at her like she’s nuts.

                                 JOEL
                        No, Meg, you’re staying here. 

                                 AMY
                        This is crazy. Both of you. No one  
                        is going anywhere.  

           Joel simply gets up and shuffles into his bedroom. Amy turns 
           to Megan, annoyed. Megan stands and goes into her room. 

           INT. AMY AND JOEL'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           The room is bare. A bed, dresser, wood crate nightstand, and 
           a floor lamp. Books are stacked up high against the walls.  

           Joel is resting in bed. Amy enters, still peeved, and shuts 
           the door. She lays down next to Joel. 

                                 AMY
                        Honestly, is this something you 
                        need to do? 

                                 JOEL
                        Somebody has to. 

           Amy nods to herself, places a loving hand on Joel’s chest. 
           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - THE NEXT DAY

           Joel zips up his EV suit while Megan sits on the couch. He 
           walks towards a constant WHIR...  

           A boxy, 4x3 machine encased in plexiglass. Tubes extend out 
           of the machine to a vent in the ceiling. This is an OXYGEN 
           GENERATION SYSTEM, and it’s what keeps them alive. 

           Attached to the O2 generator via a hose is an O2 cylinder. He 
           unhooks it, checks the digital O2 level: 100%/5hrs.

           He places the cylinder inside a bulky backpack and connects 
           the tubes. This is a PLSS (Portable Life Support System).

                                 MEGAN
                        What was grandpa doing up there? 

                                 JOEL
                        I don’t know, Meg.
                             (changing the subject)
                        I need you to do me a few favors. 
                        One: Check the levels on the 
                        generator. Two: Check in on your 
                        mom. And three: Try not to kill 
                        each other while I’m gone. 

           Megan chuckles. 

                                 MEGAN
                        One: yes. Two: yes. Three: maybe. 
                        You know how she can get. 

                                 JOEL
                        I know how you can get too. You two 
                        have to get along. She loves you. 
                        And you love her. 
                             (beat, dorky smile)
                        And I love both of you. 

           Joel gives Megan a hug. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           Joel is suited up. He pockets a HANDGUN. 

           He looks at Amy, who is standing in their bedroom doorway, 
           disapproving. 

           On the opposite side of the room is Megan. Joel looks at her, 
           forces a smile, and gives her a hug and a kiss. 
           He goes to the submarine door, turns the deadbolts, and pulls 
           it open. He steps out and Megan shuts the door.

           INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           Dark. Joel flips on a miner’s light attached to his helmet, 
           illuminating a twenty foot staircase leading up.  

           He grins and waves at a security camera mounted above the 
           door he exited. We notice a keypad on the door and a lever. 

           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

           Megan sees her dad on the monitor. PUSH IN on Megan... 

                                 MEGAN (V.O.)
                        I was fifteen when our planet 
                        officially turned to shit...

           Megan smirks and waves back. 

           INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           When Joel turns away from the camera, his smile fades and is 
           replaced by sadness and dread. He climbs the staircase. At 
           the top is a METAL HATCH in the ceiling with a combo padlock. 

                                 MEGAN  (V.O.)
                        We reached a tipping point. It all 
                        happened so quickly, like a virus 
                        that spreads in a zombie movie...

           Joel turns the dial and unhooks the lock. He places his back 
           against the hatch and pushes until it opens up... BRIGHT, 
           BLINDING, RED LIGHT POURS IN FROM ABOVE...

           EXT. FARM - DAY

           Joel pokes his head out of an ACCESS HATCH in the ground, 
           next to the barn. Their shelter is hidden under this barn.

                                 MEGAN (V.O.)
                        In a matter of months, trees and 
                        plant life failed to exist...  

           He pulls himself out and closes the hatch. It’s disguised 
           with rocks and dirt to blend in with the ravaged terrain. 
           EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

           The sun blasts as Joel treks across a burnt field, hauling a 
           wagon with the tarp wrapped body of his dad. Brittle trees 
           are toppled over, turning to dust.

                        Soon, you couldn’t go outside 
                        without a breathing device. 

           EXT. MAIN STREET - SUNSET

           Joel trudges down a small-town main street. Crumbling 
           storefronts are boarded up. Abandoned cars, with NY STATE 
           license plates, haphazardly clog the road.

                        People banded together, for a 
                        little while.    

           The ground is littered with the dead from asphyxiation. Skin 
           purple. Mouths wide. Bulging eyes. The fear in their final 
           moments frozen on their faces.

                        Lucky for us, in addition to my dad 
                        being an engineer, he was also a 
                        survivalist. For years people said 
                        he was a nut. And in a sense, they 
                        were right. You had to be slightly 
                        crazy to prepare like he did.

           Joel checks his O2 gauge: 4hrs, 35min. 

                                 MEGAN (V.O.)
                        So, when the shit-hit-the-fan, we 
                        were physically prepared to survive 
                        a world without oxygen. 
                        Emotionally, not so much. 

           Joel’s breathing grows faster and faster and FASTER. 

                                                          CUT TO BLACK:

           INT. SHELTER/BEDROOM - UNKNOWN

           Amy lays in bed, staring at the ceiling, thoughts elsewhere. 
           Her wristwatch BEEPS. She snaps out of it and rolls over, 
           facing an EMPTY half of the bed. 
           SUPER:            5 months later

           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - MOMENTS LATER

           Amy sits at the kitchen table, eating breakfast by herself. 
           Across the room, Megan’s door is closed. 

           EXT. FARM - DAY

           The access hatch opens. Amy, wearing an EV suit, peers out. 
           She clutches a shotgun, scans the area. 

           EXT. BARN ROOF - MOMENTS LATER

           Amy sweeps the solar panels. Working hard and fast, her 
           breath fogs up her mask. 

           EXT. SIDE OF THE BARN - MOMENTS LATER

           Amy kneels next to a patch of dried soil. She scoops up a 
           handful, studies it, then tosses it aside in frustration. 

           Amy grabs a gardening shovel, digs a one-foot hole. 

           She unzips a fanny pack, takes out a handful of SEEDS and 
           PITS, and drops them into the hole. 

           Amy unhooks a canister from her belt. As soon as she takes 
           the lid off, the liquid inside starts to fizz and evaporate. 

           She quickly pours it onto the seeds and pits and heaps dirt 
           on top of them. She stands, looks at the dirt, hopeful...

           INT. BARN - MOMENTS LATER

           Amy weaves around a TARP covered VEHICLE and places the 
           shovel on a hook, next to other gardening tools. 

           INT. STAIRWELL/SHELTER DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Amy punches in a code, then reaches for her belt and grabs a 
           BLACK KEYCARD attached to a retractable keychain. She places 
           the card against the door, six inches above the pad. CLICK. 
           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - MOMENTS LATER

           Amy peels off her EV suit and O2 backpack. Her grey T-shirt is 
           soaked with sweat. Heaving, Amy plops down on the couch.

           THUD... THUD... THUD... 

           Amy narrows her eyes at Megan’s bedroom door where something 
           is repeatedly hitting against the wall. 

           Amy ignores the noise, stands and connects her O2 cylinder to 
           the O2 generator. The oxygen level ticks up... 30%... 31%.

           But Amy notices something odd on the O2 generator. Annoyed by 
           what she sees, she turns a dial, correcting the issue. 

           She looks up at Megan’s room... THUD...

           INT. SHELTER/MEGAN’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Megan lays flat in bed, throwing a SOFTBALL at the cement 
           wall and catching it in a mitt. She is pale and thin with 
           greasy hair and dark rings under her eyes. 

           Her walls are adorn with sketches of landscapes, photos from 
           her school days with friends playing softball, and a Bob 
           Marley poster. An inmate making the best of their cell. 

           Her room is also a DISASTER. Clothes are thrown everywhere. 
           DIRTY BOWLS and crusty, EMPTY CANS of food litter the floor.  

           A KNOCK at the door. 

                                 MEGAN
                             (sarcastic)
                        Who is it? 

           Amy thrusts open the door. 

                                 AMY
                        Did you forget something today?  

           Megan sits up, scrunches her brow. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Check the ECO levels? 

                                 MEGAN
                        No, because it hasn’t been 12 hours 
                        since my last check. At least wait for 
                        me to forget before yelling at me.
                                 AMY
                        There’s the problem. If I had 
                        waited, we’d already be sick from 
                        oxygen toxicity. 

                                 MEGAN
                        Then instead of yelling at me, let’s 
                        decrease the time between tech checks. 
                        That’s the real problem, right? 

                                 AMY
                             (beat, deep breath)
                        You eat today? 

                                 MEGAN
                        I’ll get something soon. 

                                 AMY
                        Saving your appetite for tomorrow?

                                 MEGAN
                        Tomorrow? 

                                 AMY
                        Thanksgiving. 

                                 MEGAN
                        Now that I did forget. 

           Megan lays back down, resumes throwing the softball at the 
           wall. Amy lingers, eyeing the food cans and dirty laundry. 

                                 AMY
                        You know the saying ‘cleanliness is 
                        next to godliness?’ 

                                 MEGAN
                        You don’t believe in God. 

                                 AMY
                        But I can see your room is a mess. 
                        It’s been a disaster for months. 
                        Please, throw out the cans and wash 
                        your clothes. 

                                 MEGAN
                        Seriously? You’re giving me crap 
                        about my room?

                                 AMY
                        You’re being careless. 

                                 MEGAN
                        It’s my fucking room. 
                                 AMY
                        Hey. Watch your mouth. 

                                 MEGAN
                        You watch my mouth. Fuck. 

                                 AMY
                        Enough.

                                 MEGAN
                        We can only go outside for as long 
                        as we can hold our breath and you’re 
                        upset about socks on the floor. 

                                 AMY
                        It’s not just about socks and you 
                        know it. Dirty clothes means germs. 
                        Old food means bacteria. Germs and 
                        bacteria mean we can get sick. And 
                        we cannot risk getting sick.

           Amy leans in close to Megan’s face. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        But most of all, it means not 
                        giving up. Clean your fucking room. 

           Amy storms out. Megan gets up and slams the door shut.

           INT. SHELTER/AMY’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Amy lays down in bed and looks up at the ceiling. Her anger 
           gradually subsides and is replaced with guilt and regret. 

           She rolls onto her side, stares at a photo on the nightstand: 
           Amy, Joel and two year-old Megan are in front of a WATERFALL. 

           EXT. THE NIAGARA GORGE - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           A beautiful hiking path surrounded by tall, lush GREEN TREES.

           Amy (tan, fit, healthy and all smiles) treks up the mountain. 
           On her back is two year-old Megan, inside a baby carrier. 

                                 AMY
                        One of these days you’re gonna have 
                        to give dad a turn. 

           Joel, cleanly shaven, chews on a stick of beef jerky. He 
           smiles back, adjusts the heavy backpack he’s lugging.
                                 JOEL
                        I tried carrying her, but she’s 
                        definitely in a mommy mood today.

                                                                CUT TO:

           MOMENTS LATER, Amy, Joel and Megan camping and eating lunch. 
           Megan stands up. It looks like she wants to take a step. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           MOMENTS LATER, They reach a clearing overlooking a waterfall. 
           Joel takes Megan out of the baby carrier. He holds up his 
           phone and takes a selfie. As he SNAPS a PHOTO we CUT TO:

           INT. SHELTER/AMY’S ROOM - PRESENT DAY

           Amy reaches for a NOISE MACHINE on the crate nightstand, 
           switches it to the “rain” setting, and shuts her eyes.

           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - MOMENTS LATER

           Megan tiptoes out of her bedroom, puts an ear to her mom’s 
           door, and hears the “rain.”

           INT. SHELTER/MEGAN’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Megan slides a storage bin out from under her bed. She pops 
           the lid, removes a blanket, revealing a handheld HAM RADIO. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           Megan has set up the radio. She quietly talks into a mic. 

                                 MEGAN
                        Joel Reed...? Are you out there, Dad? 

           STATIC. 

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        It’s been a while since we talked. 
                        I gotta say, I’m becoming quite the 
                        artist. I think you’d be proud... 

           Megan probably knows her dad is not listening. We get the 
           sense that this is perhaps more therapeutic than practical. 

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        And, per your orders, mom and I 
                        haven’t killed each other yet. So, 
                        I’m being pretty good...
           Megan regards her messy room. 

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        Well, most of the time. 
                             (moving on)
                        Anyways, everything seems to be 
                        okay for the moment. Still alive. 
                        Still breathing--

           A CRACKLE in the static. Megan snaps her head up. 

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        Dad? Dad?!... HELLO?

           But the CRACKLE is gone. Just PURE STATIC again and no 
           response. Disappointed, Megan leans back in her chair. 

           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - THE NEXT DAY

           Amy exercises on a vertical mountain climbing machine.

           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - MOMENTS LATER

           Amy is on a yoga mat, legs crossed, eyes closed, focusing on 
           her breathing... In... Out... In...

           INT. SHELTER/HYDROPONIC GARDEN ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           A room we haven’t seen yet: Half the room has LED LIGHTS and 
           a sprinkler system on the ceiling. Underneath is a rack with 
           bins of micro-greens labeled: peas, broccoli, spinach.

           The other half is a lab. Amy is hunched over a worktable, 
           reading a textbook on “Plant Life.” On the table are test 
           tubes, beakers with chemicals, and sacks of fertilizer. 

           She combines several liquids and transfers them into the 
           CANISTER we saw her use outside on the seeds and pits. She 
           shakes up the canister and sets it down.

           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - MOMENTS LATER

           Amy exits the garden room. She’s about to walk into her 
           bedroom, but stops and looks at Megan’s closed door. 

           Amy KNOCKS. No answer. She opens the door a crack to see 
           Megan sleeping. Amy sits on the bed, stirring Megan awake. 

           Amy caresses Megan’s head. As she does, she feels Megan’s 
           greasy and stringy hair between her fingers. 
                                 AMY
                        How about a spa day before dinner? 

                                 MEGAN
                        A ‘spa day?’

           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - MOMENTS LATER

           Megan is leaning over a sink. Amy pours a pitcher of sudsy 
           water over Megan’s long hair and begins to scrub.

           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - MOMENTS LATER

           Megan sits in a chair, sporting a sour look and a garbage bag 
           for a smock. Amy is behind Megan, holding a pair of scissors.

                                 AMY
                        So tell me, ma’am. What can I do 
                        for you today? 

                                 MEGAN
                        Go short. 

                                 AMY
                        My pleasure. How short? 

           Megan thinks about it, then pulls her hair into a tight 
           ponytail, takes the scissors, and lops off the entire thing, 
           instantly giving herself a medium length “bob cut.” 

                                 MEGAN 
                        That short. 

           Amy tilts her head to the side, appraising the cut. 

                                 AMY
                        I like your work. 

           Amy grabs the scissors and cuts off her own ponytail. 

                                 MEGAN
                             (laughing)
                        Mom?!

                                 AMY
                        What? You thought I was lying?

           Megan doesn’t want to smile, but she can’t help it.

           can of CAMPBELL’S CHUNKY TURKEY DINNER soup. Amy picks micro-
           greens from the garden. Amy and Megan set the kitchen table. 
           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - MOMENTS LATER

           A red checkered tablecloth is draped over the table. 
           CLASSICAL MUSIC plays from a stereo. Amy and Megan each have 
           a bowl of soup, garnished with micro-greens. 

                                 AMY
                        Thanks for listening to this music. 
                        I know it’s not really your thing. 

           Amy uncorks a bottle of Pinot Noir and pours herself a glass. 
           Megan stares at her cup of water, drinks it, then holds out 
           the empty cup for a pour. Amy squints, “I don’t think so.”  

                                 MEGAN
                        Really? Afraid we’ll get arrested?

           Amy laughs, then gives Megan a small pour of wine. Amy raises 
           her glass. They cheers. Megan takes a sip and winces.

                                 AMY
                        Want to watch a movie tonight? 
                        Since I picked the music, you can 
                        pick the movie.  

           Megan doesn’t answer, something weighs on her mind. 

                                 MEGAN
                        Tomorrow, I want to go look for Dad. 

                                 AMY
                        We’ve been over this. I looked. 

                                 MEGAN
                        And never found him. He might still 
                        be, I don’t know... out there? 

                                 AMY
                        Meg, Dad’s gone. 

           Megan clenches her jaw, takes another sip of wine. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        We just need to keep focus on 
                        what’s important. I’m making 
                        headway in the garden. We just have 
                        to keep working it. If we can get 
                        something to grow out there-- 

                                 MEGAN
                        You’ve been trying for years. Just 
                        because you milked cows and grew 
                        corn for a living, that doesn’t 
                        make you a biologist, or whatever. 
                                 AMY
                        You know, I’m doing all this on my 
                        own here. Maybe if I had a little 
                        help from time to time--

                                 MEGAN
                        Bull crap, I’ve tried to help! And 
                        every time, you’ve gotten on me for 
                        some stupid little thing. Like 
                        today with the generator. I was 
                        gonna check it, but you didn’t even 
                        give me a chance. And that’s the 
                        way you’ve been my whole life, 
                        before we even became cellmates. 

                                 AMY
                        Megan, we can’t keep fighting like 
                        this. Really, enough already. 

                                 MEGAN
                        No, I don’t have to do everything 
                        the way you do it. You just have to 
                        trust me. 

                                 AMY
                        Believe me honey, I would love for 
                        that to be the case. 

           Stung, Megan gets up, storms into her room, and SLAMS the 
           door. Amy tries to eat, but can’t. She throws down her fork.

           INT. SHELTER/AMY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Amy lays in bed, unable to sleep. She turns on the noise 
           machine and lets it “rain.” 

           INT. SHELTER/MEGAN'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Megan is at her desk, drawing in her sketchpad. Her eyes are 
           red from crying. She looks up at the landscapes and photos. 

           She lands on a photo of her and Amy hugging at a school 
           graduation, sees how they were once happy together... 

           INT. HYDROPONIC GARDEN ROOM - THE NEXT DAY

           Amy pours another mixture of liquids into the canister. 
           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - MOMENTS LATER

           Amy is in her EV suit and O2 backpack, about to head out. 

           Megan steps out of her room. She has on an EV suit and O2 
           backpack. A BEAT as each waits for the other to talk. 

                                 MEGAN
                        Want some help?

           Amy glances inside Megan’s room and sees that it’s been 
           cleaned up. Amy smiles, touched by the peace offering. 

           EXT. BARN ROOF - MOMENTS LATER

           Megan sweeps the dirt off the solar panels while Amy kneels 
           beside the exhaust pipe, appraising the airflow. 

           EXT. BARN/DIRT PATCH - MOMENTS LATER

           Amy hovers behind Megan as she places the seeds in the dirt. 
           Megan pours the solution from the canister onto the seeds. 

           INT. BARN - MOMENTS LATER

           Megan hands Amy the push broom. She hangs it up on a hook. 

                                 AMY
                        Thanks, honey. 

           Amy’s O2 gauge BLEEPS: 15 min 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Shoot, let’s get inside. 

           Amy turns, but Megan isn’t there and the barn doors are open. 

           EXT. BARN - CONTINUOUS

           Amy walks outside, but still doesn’t see Megan. 

                                 AMY
                        Meg?

           Amy jogs around the side of the barn.

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Megan?!
           Amy is GRABBED from behind and THROWN against the barn -- 
           It’s Megan and she immediately starts SHUSHING her mother. 

                                 MEGAN
                        Quiet -- I think... I see someone.

                                 AMY
                        What? No.  

                                 MEGAN
                        Yes. Look. 

           Amy peeks around the corner of the barn. 

           ACROSS THE OPEN FIELD

           Through the wavy heat, two small dots bounce up and down, 
           cresting a hilltop one hundred yards away. 

           As the dots get closer, they take shape. TWO PEOPLE. In EV 
           suits, O2 backpacks, pushing a tarp covered shopping cart. 
           One person carries a shotgun, the other wields a rifle. 

                                 AMY
                        Shit...

           Amy looks at the access hatch on the other side of the barn. 
           If Amy and Megan make a run for it, they’ll be seen. 

                                 MEGAN
                        Maybe they’re... help? 

           Highly fucking skeptical, Amy looks back at the two figures.  

           Nearing the farmhouse, we can more clearly make them out. A 
           HEFTY MAN pushing the cart and a TALL WOMAN. They’re hunched 
           over in exhaustion, each step taking a great deal of effort. 

           The Tall Woman motions to the farmhouse. The Hefty Man racks 
           his shotgun, and enters through a back door. 

                                 AMY
                        Listen to me. When she turns away, 
                        we run for the hatch. Okay? 

           Megan nods, “yes.” Amy looks back at the Tall Woman, who is 
           heading towards the front of the farmhouse. 

           INT. FARMHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           The Hefty Man walks upstairs, gun at the ready. Through his 
           visor, we notice his left eye is permanently BLOODSHOT. He 
           moves with fluidity and precision. Maybe military trained? 
           EXT. BARN - THAT MOMENT

           Amy peers around the side. 

                                 AMY
                        She’s near the front of the house.

           Amy grabs Megan’s hand, ready to bolt.

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Get ready. 

           The Tall Woman turns her back to the barn. 

           BLEEP--BLEEP, Amy’s O2 gauge sounds: 10 min

           Amy retreats back behind the barn and silences the alert. 

           ON THE TALL WOMAN

           Hearing the alarm. She turns to the barn... aims her rifle.  

           ON AMY AND MEGAN

           Crouched behind the barn, not making a move. 

           ON THE TALL WOMAN

           Hyper-cautious, she inches toward the barn. She gets to the 
           door and taps it with the rifle muzzle.  

                                 TALL WOMAN
                        Anyone in there? 

           The Tall Woman’s voice is calm, almost sweet, and devoid of 
           any shake. Her even-keeled tone is mysterious and unnerving.

           When she doesn’t get a reply, she nudges the door open with 
           her gun to see the tarp covered vehicle and gardening tools. 

           INT. FARMHOUSE/UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT

           The Hefty Man inspects the area. He glances out the window to 
           see the barn door open and the Tall Woman nowhere in sight. 

           Then, he notices something else. On the side of the barn, he 
           spots what looks like... is that a foot peeking out? 

           He moves to get a better angle and sees Amy and Megan pinning 
           themselves up against the side of the barn. 

           The Hefty Man bangs his fists on the window. 
                                 HEFTY MAN
                        TESS! TESS! THERE THEY ARE!

           Amy and Megan startle, lock eyes with the Hefty Man. 

           ON THE TALL WOMAN (TESS)

           As she runs out of the barn and looks up at the Hefty Man, 
           frantically pointing at something down below. 

                                 HEFTY MAN (CONT’D)
                        OVER THERE! ON THE OTHER SIDE!

           Tess rounds the side of the barn and WHAM! She’s clocked in 
           the face with the shovel by Amy. Tess hits the dirt. 

           INT. FARMHOUSE/STAIRS - THAT MOMENT

           The Hefty Man flies down the steps. 

           EXT. BARN - THAT MOMENT

           Amy and Megan round the side of the barn, toward the hatch.

           ON TESS

           Shaking off the blow, picking herself up. 

                                 TESS
                        WE’RE NOT GOING TO HURT YOU!

           ON AMY AND MEGAN

           Amy throws open the hatch, they climb inside.  

           INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           Megan and Amy sprint down the steps. 

           Over their shoulders, FOOTSTEPS are heard racing after them.  

           ON TESS

           Staggering down the stairs, seeing Amy and Megan at the door. 

           ON AMY AND MEGAN

           Amy punches in the code. Uses the keycard. Opens the door. 

           They run inside the shelter and slam the door shut just as 
           Tess RAMS into the door with her shoulder.
                                 TESS
                        NO! NO! NO! 

           Tess pounds her hands on the door as the Hefty Man comes 
           bounding down the steps. 

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        They got inside.

           The Hefty Man raises his shotgun. 

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        What the hell’re you doing?!

           BAM! He FIRES at the door. The PELLETS RICOCHETS OFF. 

           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

           Amy and Megan scramble behind the couch. 

           INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           The Hefty Man racks the shotgun, aims, but Tess shoves the 
           gun up and BAM! He fires into the ceiling. Cement rains down.  

                                 TESS
                        You’ll kill us. 

           The Hefty Man comes back down to Earth. The dust settles as 
           Tess and the Hefty Man catch their breath. 

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        Hey. Can you hear me in there?

           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

           Amy peeks her head up over the couch. 

                                 TESS (O.S.)
                             (muffled)
                        I’m sorry, he shouldn’t have done 
                        that. We don’t want to hurt you.

           INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           Tess is still catching her breath.

                                 TESS
                        My name is Tess. My overreacting 
                        friend here is Lucas. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        Us, along with nine other people, 
                        have been living in a shelter fifty 
                        miles north of here at Claremont 
                        Farms. 

           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

           Amy and Megan exchange a look. 

                                 TESS (O.S.)
                        But our air filtration system is 
                        failing. We tried fixing it, but we 
                        can’t. We’re living on reserves and 
                        only have a week’s worth left... 

           INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           Still winded, Tess puts her hand on the door for support.  

                                 TESS
                        Lucas and I left our shelter three 
                        days ago... to come here. 

           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

           Amy and Megan look at each other, To come here?

                                 TESS (O.S.)
                        I know your husband, Joel Reed. 

           Megan’s eyes light up. 

                                 MEGAN
                        Maybe they found Dad?

                                 AMY
                             (ignoring Megan)
                        What -- What are you talking 
                        about?! How do you know Joel?! 

           INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           Tess spots the security camera above the door. She turns her 
           back to the camera and motions to it with her eyes for Lucas.

                                 AMY (O.S.)
                        HEY! How do you know Joel?!
                                 TESS
                        I was a colleague of his at the 
                        school. I’m an engineer, like him.  

           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

           Amy and Megan crawl to the monitor and zoom in on Tess. 

                                 AMY
                        I have no idea who you are. I knew 
                        everyone that Joel worked with. 

           INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           Desperate, Tess stares up at the security camera.

                                 TESS
                        Not everyone, because you don’t 
                        know me. But I do know what he was 
                        trying to build. And it looks like 
                        he succeeded, because you’re still 
                        breathing. I’m talking about the O2 
                        generator. 

           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

           Amy glances at the O2 generator. 

                                 TESS (O.S.)
                        That machine is unique, far more 
                        advanced than anything we have. I 
                        came here to talk to Joel. I need 
                        to learn how to replicate it. 

           Amy looks at Megan, then back at the monitor... Debating... 

                                 AMY
                        Joel’s not here. 

           INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           Tess raises her head. 

                                 AMY (O.S.)
                        He’s dead. 

           Tess processes the news when BAM! She whips around and sees 
           Lucas SLAMMING his fist into the cement walls. 
                                 LUCAS 
                        DAMNIT! Shit! FUCK!

           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

           Amy and Megan watch Lucas on the MONITOR as he has a mini-
           meltdown. Tess places a comforting hand on his shoulder, but 
           he throws it off. Tess turns back to the door. 

                                 TESS
                        Okay, Amy. That’s your name, Amy? 

           Amy is taken aback by this woman knowing her name. 

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        And that’s your daughter, what’s 
                        her name again? Megan? 

           Megan looks at her mom.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry to hear about Joel. 
                             (beat)
                        But I still need to know how to 
                        replicate that machine. And in 
                        order to do that, you have to let 
                        us in. 

           Amy’s eyes dart between the monitor and Megan. 

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        We don’t have enough oxygen to make 
                        it back home. And if we don’t make 
                        it home, there are people there 
                        that will die. Nine people. Four of 
                        them children. Children.

                                 AMY 
                        And how do I know that? 

                                 TESS
                        Claire, Thomas, Jackson, Molly. 
                        Those are their names. They’re real. 

                                 AMY
                        This room can’t fit any more 
                        people. The system could crash with 
                        more bodies in here. 

                                 TESS
                        I promise, I’ll be quick. 
                                 AMY
                        Right... And if you can’t replicate 
                        it, I’m just supposed to believe 
                        you’ll walk away? How do I know 
                        you’re not just trying to get in 
                        here and take over this space?

                                 TESS
                        Because you have my word. 

                                 MEGAN
                             (whispering)
                        What if she’s telling the truth?

           Amy glares at Megan, Are you fucking serious?

                                 AMY
                        I have no idea who this woman is.

                                 MEGAN
                        She knew your name, she knew my 
                        name, somehow she knows us. If 
                        she’s being honest, and she can 
                        potentially replicate Dad’s 
                        invention...? This could be the 
                        beginning of something... big.

                                 AMY
                        We haven’t seen anyone for a year. 
                        Your father goes out a few months 
                        ago and now these people show up? 
                        That can’t be a coincidence. 

           INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           Tess has an ear planted against the door, eavesdropping.  

                                 LUCAS
                        What’s goin’ on in there? 

                                 TESS
                        Shut up and I’ll tell you. 

           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

           Megan and Amy are still debating. 

                                 MEGAN
                        So you’re saying what exactly? 
                        These people found Dad and that’s 
                        how they know about our place? 
                                 AMY
                        I’m saying we don’t know. And we 
                        didn’t get this far by taking 
                        chances on things we don’t know. 

                                 MEGAN
                        You’re right. We don’t know. Maybe 
                        they did something to Dad, maybe 
                        they didn’t. But here’s something I 
                        do know: If we didn’t know Dad and 
                        he knocked on our door, we wouldn’t 
                        have let him in. We’d be doing 
                        exactly what we’re doing to these 
                        people right now. So it’s people 
                        like us that would’ve let him die. 

           Amy reluctantly considers Megan’s impassioned plea.

           INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           Tess is still listening at the door.

                                 AMY (O.S.)
                        Get away from the door! 

           Tess steps back and raises her hands.

                                 AMY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Now listen: I don’t know if you’re 
                        telling the truth. But that doesn’t 
                        mean you’re lying. 

           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

           Amy glances at Megan, unsure she’s making the correct choice. 

                                 AMY 
                        If we’re going to let you in, you 
                        need to follow our instructions. If 
                        you veer from those instructions, 
                        we will leave you out there to die. 
                        Understand? 

                                 TESS (O.S.)
                        Yes, I understand. We understand. 

                                 AMY 
                        First: Put down your weapons. 
           INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           Tess drops her rifle. She turns to a hesitant Lucas. 

                                 TESS
                        What’re you waiting for? 

           Lucas begrudgingly lays his shotgun on the floor. 

                                 AMY (O.S.)
                        Back away from the door until your 
                        heels touch the stairwell. 

           Tess and Lucas do as they’re told. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Now go outside, walk one hundred 
                        feet from here, get on your knees, 
                        and put your hands in the air.

                                 LUCAS
                             (whispering)
                        This is bullshit. 

                                 TESS
                             (whispering)
                        Quiet and do what she says. 

                                 AMY (O.S.)
                        Believe me when I say I’m looking 
                        for a reason not to let you in 
                        here. And you whispering to each 
                        other is giving me a good reason. 

                                 TESS
                        No, we’re sorry! We’ll do what you 
                        said. One hundred feet. Kneel. 
                        Hands in the air. We’ll be waiting.  

           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

           ON THE MONITOR: Tess and Lucas disappear up the stairwell. 

                                 AMY
                        Whatever happens outside, do not 
                        open this door unless I say the 
                        word. Understand? 

           Amy zips up her EV suit and reattaches her O2 backpack.

                                 MEGAN
                        It’s gonna be okay.   
                                 AMY
                        That’s not what I asked. Now answer 
                        me, directly for once. 

                                 MEGAN
                        Whatever happens, don’t open the 
                        door unless you say the word. 

           Amy grabs the shotgun and slings the strap over her shoulder. 
           She turns the deadbolts and cracks the door.

           The coast appears to be clear. Amy picks up the weapons Lucas 
           and Tess left behind and relays them to Megan. 

           Amy gives Megan one last look before pulling the door shut. 

           INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           Amy looks up the stairwell. All she can see is the open 
           access hatch above and the red glow of the sky. 

           AMY’S POV THROUGH HER MASK, panicked breaths fog the visor, 
           making it hard to see. She cautiously ascends the stairs. 

           She reaches the top and pokes her head outside to see: Tess 
           and Lucas on their knees, one hundred feet from the barn. 

           EXT. FARM - CONTINUOUS

           Amy climbs out and closes the hatch. She gathers herself, 
           tentatively approaches them, and stops twenty feet shy.  

                                 AMY
                        T-Tell me your names again. First 
                        and last.

                                 AMY
                        Goddamnit, slower and one at a time. 

                                 TESS
                        Tess Grainer.

                        Lu-cas. To-mek.

                                 AMY
                        Tess Grainer? Again, never heard 
                        Joel mention your name. 
                                 TESS
                        Again, we were colleagues. 

                                 AMY
                        And what’s your deal, Lucas Tomek? 

                                 TESS
                        His job was to get us here. 

                                 AMY
                        And before then? 

                                 LUCAS
                        Getting people to where they need 
                        to be has always been my job. 

                                 AMY
                        And the shelter you came from? 

                                 TESS
                        A bread mill. Built during the Cold 
                        War with a fallout shelter. On the 
                        day things turned, my car stalled 
                        and I just happened to be at the 
                        right place at the right time. 
                        Never met the family before in my 
                        life, but they let us in. 

           Amy eyes Tess, That’s a good story. Almost believable. Amy 
           shifts her gaze to Lucas who remains silent. 

                                 AMY
                        Okay Tess. Tie up Lucas. 

           Amy pulls a ZIP-TIE out of her pocket and tosses it to Tess. 

                                 TESS
                        Amy, this isn’t necessary. 

           Amy refuses to engage and keeps the shotgun leveled at them.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        Fair enough. Just be careful with 
                        that thing. You seem a little shaky 
                        and we don’t need a misfire. 

                                 AMY
                        No shit. Hands behind his back. 

           Lucas shakes his head in disgust. Tess crawls to the zip-tie, 
           then scurries back to Lucas. 
           Amy perspires inside her mask, sweat drips into her eyes. She 
           blinks it away, glances at her oxygen levels: 15 min 

                                 TESS
                        Ah shit... 

                                 AMY
                        What? 

                                 TESS
                        I messed it up. 

                                 AMY
                        Messed what up?

                                 TESS
                        The tie broke. 

           Amy stares at Tess, Are you serious?

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        I swear, I don’t know -- It was 
                        weird when you gave it to me -- 

           Amy takes out another zip-tie and throws it at Tess. 

                                 AMY
                        Mess up again, you lose your invite.

           Tess nods, fiddles with the zip-tie until ZZZZIIIIIPPP. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Owww. Shit, too tight! 

                                 AMY
                        Quiet. Show me.

           Lucas winces as he turns around and shows his tied wrists.

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Now lay down. On your stomachs. 
                        Feet facing me.  

           Tess and Lucas do as they’re told. Amy walks over to them and 
           stops by their feet. 

           Amy takes out another zip-tie. In a hurry, she pulls Tess’s 
           hands behind her back and zip-ties them. 

           Amy frisks Tess. Clean. She moves on to Lucas and pats him 
           down. Also clean. 

           Amy quickly steps back, BREATHING HEAVY and FAST.
                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Okay... Okay... Stand up. 

           Tess and Lucas stand. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        No. Just her. You sit. 

                                 LUCAS
                        What? 

                                 AMY
                        He stays out here. 

                                 TESS
                        Amy, look at his oxygen levels. 

           Amy glimpses at Lucas’s O2 gauge: 1hr 2min 

           She checks Tess’s O2 levels, also: 1hr 2min

                                 AMY
                        You’re wasting his time. Things go 
                        well inside, we’ll see about him. 

                                 TESS
                             (to Lucas)
                        It’s gonna be okay. Promise. 

           Amy stares at Lucas. Maybe these people are telling the 
           truth? Amy shakes the thought from her brain.  

           Amy digs her shotgun into Tess’s back, nudging her towards 
           the access hatch. 

           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

           Megan watches on the MONITOR: Amy and Tess come into view. 
           Amy gives a thumbs up to the security camera. 

           INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           We HEAR Megan unlatching the deadbolts. The door opens. 

           FOOTSTEPS are heard stomping down the stairs. 

                                 AMY
                        I said stay put!

           Amy whips around to see a third person in an EV suit, NOT 
           Lucas, charging down the steps with a sniper rifle. 
                                 TESS
                        MICAH! NO!

           MICAH (30) raises his gun at Amy and BANG! 

           A SHOT RINGS OUT! 

           Micah falls backwards, BLOOD BURSTS from his shoulder. 

           In the shelter doorway, Megan is clutching a SMOKING GUN. 

           Tess takes cover in the stairwell corner. 

           Megan takes aim at Micah, pulls the trigger -- CLICK.

           Realizing she’s out of ammo, Micah leaps up and TACKLES 
           Megan. They both fall into the shelter.

           TESS MAKES A BREAK FOR THE DOOR --

           AMY STICKS OUT HER LEG -- 

           TRIPPING TESS, she lands FACE-FIRST onto the cement, slightly 
           CRACKING her mask.

           Amy crawls inside the shelter as Tess clambers after her.

           Amy KICKS the door shut right in Tess’s face. 

           Tess SMACKS the door over and over again. 

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        NO! NO! NO! MICAH, YOU IDIOT!

           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

           Megan, trembling, reloads the gun, points it at Micah who is 
           on the floor, cupping his bleeding shoulder. 

           Amy shakes herself back to reality and stands with vigor. She 
           goes to a shelf, opens a bin, and grabs a roll of duct tape. 

                                 AMY
                        Against the radiator. 

           Micah squirms over to the radiator. Amy duct tapes his hands 
           to it, using up half of the roll. 

           INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           Tess, hands still zip-tied, rams her shoulder into the door. 
                                 TESS (O.S.)
                        AMY! I’M SORRY!

           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

           Amy runs up to the door. 

                                 AMY
                        What the hell was that?!

                                 TESS (O.S.)
                        I’m sorry, I should’ve told you. 
                        That’s Micah -- He was our lookout--

                                 AMY
                        ‘Lookout?!’ 

                                 TESS (O.S.)
                        You have to understand. I didn’t 
                        know if I could trust you either. I 
                        wanted someone to stay behind and 
                        watch.

                                 MICAH
                             (in pain)
                        I saw you cuffing them... I didn’t 
                        know what you were doing... I 
                        didn’t know if you were taking her 
                        hostage or what...

                                 AMY
                        ‘Hostage?’ You’re so full of shit.

                                 TESS (O.S.)
                        No! It was a misunderstanding!

                                 AMY
                        Get away from the door or I’ll 
                        shoot him. I swear.

                                 TESS (O.S.)
                        Go ahead, shoot him. Our shelter is 
                        out of oxygen, so we’re dead 
                        anyway. Remember what I said? There 
                        are kids there. Lives depend on us. 

                                 AMY
                        Bullshit! There aren’t any kids. So 
                        stop saying that.  

           Tess is about to shout back, but stops herself. Breathes. 
           Regains her composure and returns to a calm voice. 
                                 TESS (O.S.)
                        Amy, I’m sorry about what happened. 
                        But I need to see that machine. And 
                        I will see it, one way or another. 

           Amy and Megan exchange a look, What’s that mean?

                                 TESS (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Now you have the option of whether 
                        or not anyone else gets hurt. So 
                        before you answer, take a minute... 
                        think it through, think about your 
                        daughter, do the smart thing. 

                                 AMY
                             (considering, then)
                        Fuck off. 

           Tess’s face hardens, checks her O2 gauge: 48 min 

           EXT. FARM - SECONDS LATER

           Tess runs out of the stairwell and up to Lucas.

                                 TESS
                        Are you two trying to screw this 
                        up?

                                 LUCAS
                        Me? Micah’s the one who lost his 
                        shit.

           Tess sits on the ground, swoops her zip-tied hands under her 
           butt and over her feet so that her hands are in front of her. 

           Tess dashes over to the shopping cart Lucas was pushing. Two 
           bungee cords are fastened over a tarp. 

           She releases the cords, flings back the tarp revealing 
           supplies: O2 cylinders, I.V. drip bags, tools, handguns.  

           Tess pulls out a LEATHERMAN KNIFE, hands it to Lucas. He 
           slices her free. She returns the favor.

                                 TESS
                        We thought this could happen. Get 
                        to work. 

           There’s an INDUSTRIAL DRILL taking up the bottom of the cart. 
                                 LUCAS
                             (shaking his head)
                        It’s not gonna work. All I saw on 
                        that door was a keypad. No lock to 
                        drill or anything to pick.

                                 TESS
                        So what are you saying? That we 
                        lugged this heavy piece of shit all 
                        three days for nothing?  

                                 LUCAS
                        Tess.

                                 TESS
                        You said you could get us inside. 
                        That’s the whole reason you’re here.

                                 LUCAS
                        No. I said I’d get us here. And I 
                        did.

           Tess bites her tongue. 

                                 TESS
                        Okay... We both have forty-seven 
                        minutes left in these tanks. 

           Overwhelmed by their impending doom, Tess and Lucas stare at 
           each other, silently sharing the grim prospect. 

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        So how the hell do we get in there? 

           Tess scans the area, settling on the farmhouse. 

           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

           Amy digs inside a bin and pulls out a heavy pair of SCISSORS. 
           She walks to Micah, who is pale and woozy from blood loss.

           Micah recoils in fear as she leans forward with the scissors 
           and slices open his EV suit at the shoulder.   

           Blood seeps out of a bullet hole in the meaty part of Micah’s 
           shoulder. She examines his back, finds an exit wound. 

           Amy goes into her room and comes back with a belt. She ties a 
           tourniquet around his shoulder, staunching the blood. 

                                 MICAH
                        You’re not gonna let me die? 
           Amy goes to a FIRST AID KIT mounted on the wall, retrieves 
           gauze and tape, and starts dressing Micah’s wound. 

                                 AMY
                        This is your fault.

                                 MICAH
                        Sorry.  

                                 AMY
                        I wasn’t only talking to you. 

           Amy shoots Megan a harsh stare. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        I never should’ve let you talk me 
                        into going out there.  

                                 MEGAN
                        So it’s my fault? 

                                 AMY
                        And my fault for listening to you.

           Megan eats the jab.

                                 MICAH
                             (groggy)
                        Is... that it? 

           They look at Micah, who is transfixed by the O2 generator. 

                                 AMY
                        Not an engineer like your friend?

                                 MICAH
                        Locksmith. 

                                 AMY
                        ...Locksmith? 

           Micah blinks hard, focuses, realizes what he just said. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Well, I don’t know what supermarket 
                        kiosk you worked at, but you never 
                        stood a chance against this place. 

           Micah hangs his head. 

                                 MEGAN
                        Why’d you run at us out there? 
                                 MICAH
                        I told you, all I saw was my 
                        friends getting hogtied and you 
                        leading ‘em into this place. I 
                        freaked, I’m sorry. 

                                 AMY
                        Don’t listen to him. 
                             (to Micah)
                        And don’t talk to my daughter.

                                 MICAH
                        She asked me a quest-- AWW!

           Amy squeezes the gauze tight, silencing Micah.  

                                 AMY
                        Don’t talk to me, either. 

           Amy storms off, into the garden room. 

                                 MICAH
                             (whispers to Megan)
                        I talk when I’m nervous. 

           INT. FARMHOUSE/GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Tess and Lucas, HUFFING and PUFFING, tear open bins, 
           searching for anything that could help. 

           Tess’s eyes fall on something in the corner of the garage. We 
           don’t see what it is, but she reaches for it... 

           INT. SHELTER/HYDROPONIC GARDEN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Megan strides in to see Amy sitting at the worktable, staring 
           off into space.  

                                 AMY
                        You still believe him, don’t you?

                                 MEGAN
                        I want to. 
                             (beat)
                        And so do you. 

           Amy turns to Megan, confused. 

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        That’s why you bandaged him up. Just 
                        in case they’re telling the truth.
           Amy takes Megan’s hands in hers, lovingly, yet firmly. 

                                 AMY
                        Honey, we gave them a chance and 
                        they threw it away.

                                 MEGAN
                        At least hear me out. 

                                 AMY
                        I did hear you out and look where 
                        it got us. Now it’s my turn. We’re 
                        not letting them in, so get that 
                        thought out of your head.

           Megan looks off, annoyed. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        I can’t be worrying about you and 
                        them. I need us working together. 

                                 MEGAN
                             (sarcastic)
                        Together. Right, sure. 

                                 AMY
                        Please, please do not fight me on 
                        this. Not now. 

                                 MEGAN
                        But--

                                 AMY
                        But nothing! All I want to hear is, 
                        ‘Yes, mom, we’re together on this.’ 

           Megan hesitates. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Megan.

                                 MEGAN
                        Yes, yes, we’re together. 

           Amy lets go of Megan’s hands. 

                                 AMY
                        Good. Now, when I was outside, I 
                        saw they each only had about an 
                        hour of oxygen left. All we have to 
                        do is outlast them. One hour.
                                 MEGAN
                             (nodding)
                        Yeah... got it... One hour.

           BANG--BANG--BANG on the shelter door. 

           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

           Amy runs up to the MONITOR: The screen is BLACKED OUT. 

           INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           Black electrical tape covers the security camera lens. 

           Lucas swings a sledgehammer into an outer layer of sheetrock, 
           creating a hole. He keeps bashing away until -- CLANK.

           Tess peers inside the hole. He’s hit a lead wall. 

                                 TESS
                        Whole thing’s encased in a lead 
                        shell. We could throw a grenade at 
                        it and it wouldn’t make a dent.  
                             (thinking)
                        The only way inside is for them to 
                        open that door for us. 

           Tess thinks for a moment.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        Stay here. I have an idea. When 
                        they open the door, which they will 
                        do, secure them. Then get me. 

           Tess runs up the stairwell. 

           EXT. BARN ROOF - MOMENTS LATER

           Tess scales the ladder, climbs onto the roof. She grazes her 
           hands over the solar panels. 

           She crouches down, scans the roof floor, searching for 
           something in particular, until her gaze lands on something... 

           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

           Amy sits in a chair with the shotgun aimed at Micah. Megan is 
           at the MONITOR: Lucas is still standing guard. 
                                 AMY
                        She back yet? 

                                 MEGAN
                        Just the guy right now. 

           BEEP--BEEP--BEEP 

           An alarm on the O2 generator sounds and a RED WARNING LIGHT 
           blinks. Amy checks the ECO levels on the side panel.

                                 AMY
                        Shit. 

           WHAM--WHAM--WHAM

           On the ceiling, a CO2 detector BLARES and FLASHES. 

           Megan and Amy clasp their hands over their ears. In this 
           confined space, it’s like a SIREN blasting inside their head. 

           EXT. BARN ROOF - CONTINUOUS

           Tess stands over the EXHAUST PIPE that Joel checked earlier. 
           It’s CLOGGED with a tarp, obstructing the free flow of air. 

           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

           Amy silences the alarms, then looks at the digital panel on 
           the O2 generator -- THE CO2 LEVELS ARE RAPIDLY CLIMBING.  

                                 AMY
                        She’s blocking the expulsion of 
                        carbon dioxide. We’re not scrubbing 
                        it fast enough. 

                                 MEGAN
                        How long before it’s dangerous?

                                 AMY
                        At these levels? Five minutes. 
                        Quick, grab your cylinder and mask.

           The O2 cylinders are plugged into the O2 generator, refilling.  

           Amy looks at her O2 gauge: 20m 

           Megan checks hers: 22m 
                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        They’ve got at least forty minutes 
                        out there. They’ll outlast us. 

           LOUD CLANKING -- Megan and Amy whip around to see Micah 
           smashing his O2 pack with his heel until a tube is severed. 

           Amy swipes it away, frantically tries to reconnect it as the 
           O2 levels dwindle: 40m... 21m... 19m... 5m 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        You idiot! 

                                 MICAH
                        I ain’t gonna help you. Let ‘em in.

           Amy, attempting to hide her fear, turns to Megan. 

                                 AMY
                        They’re only trying to scare us. 
                             (shouts at the door)
                        YOU’RE ONLY TRYING TO SCARE US!

           INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           Lucas hears Amy shouting. 

                                 LUCAS
                        SCARE YOU? NOW YOU KNOW HOW IT 
                        FEELS! OPEN THE DOOR!

           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

           The CO2 detectors go off again -- WHAM--WHAM--WHAM.

                                 AMY
                        IF YOU KILL US, YOU’LL NEVER MAKE 
                        IT IN HERE!

           Micah bursts with laughter. 

                                 MICAH
                        If they don’t make it in here, 
                        they’re dead anyway. 

                                 AMY
                             (fuck, he’s right)
                        We have to stop her. 
                                 MEGAN
                        How? She’s on the roof and that 
                        other guy’s probably waiting for us 
                        outside the door. 

           Amy gets an idea. She pulls a bin from a shelf and spills the 
           contents onto the floor. Random knick-knacks fall out. 

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        What’re you doing? 

           Amy doesn’t find what she’s looking for, so she goes for 
           another bin, dumps out more items. 

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        Mom, answer me.

                                 AMY
                        The garage door clicker. 

                                 MEGAN
                        The garage door...? 

                                 AMY
                        It might still work.

           It dawns on Megan why she’d be looking for it. Megan helps, 
           pulling down more bins and searching. 

                                 MEGAN
                        I found it!

           Megan gives Amy the garage door clicker. She pops off the 
           back. The batteries are corroded.

                                 AMY
                        I need two double A’s. 

           Megan gets the batteries and gives them to Amy. She quickly 
           replaces them. 

           Amy moves as close to the door as possible and presses... 
           click... click... click...

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           WIDE SHOT of the farmhouse. The garage door doesn’t move. 

           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

           Amy mashes the button faster, click, click, click.
           EXT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Suddenly, the garage door on the farmhouse LOUDLY SQUEALS and 
           GROANS open as it begins to rise. 

           INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS 

           From over his shoulder, Lucas hears a loud GRINDING of GEARS 
           and METAL coming from outside. What the hell...? 

           He turns around, inches up the staircase. 

           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

           Amy plants her ear to the door, hears the faint SOUND of feet 
           shuffling away. 

           EXT. FARM - CONTINUOUS

           Lucas emerges from the access hatch to see the garage door 
           going up. Gun out and up, he approaches the farmhouse. 

           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

           Amy puts on her O2 backpack, checks the gauge: 20m

                                 AMY
                        Megan, put on your mask. 

                                 MEGAN
                        What about him? 

           Amy places Micah’s mask on his face. 

                                 AMY
                        I guess he has five minutes. 

           Amy grabs a rifle, leans in close to Megan. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Remember, do not open the door 
                        unless I use the word.

           Amy unlocks the door, opens it a crack. No Lucas. Amy steps 
           outside, Megan slams the door shut, then turns back to Micah. 
           INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           Amy quietly pads up the stairs. When she reaches the top, she 
           peeks her head out to see the open garage and no Lucas. 

           INT. FARMHOUSE/GARAGE - THAT MOMENT

           Lucas is looking around. Behind him, only we see Amy dart out 
           of the hatch and hide on the other side of the barn. 

           AMY’S POV: Looking up at the roof, not seeing Tess.

                                 LUCAS (O.S.)
                        TESS. C’MERE. QUICK.

           Lucas is standing outside the garage, waving for Tess. 

                                 TESS
                        WHAT IS IT? GET BACK DOWN THERE!

                                 LUCAS
                        THERE’S SOMEONE IN THE HOUSE.

           Lucas ducks back into the garage. Tess glances at the clogged 
           pipe, then runs to the ladder and climbs down. 

           ON AMY

           Kneeling on the other side of the barn, watching Tess rush 
           towards the garage. 

           Amy aims at Tess, the crosshairs on her back, about to pull 
           the trigger only to lose her shot as Tess enters the garage.

           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT

           Micah thrashes back and forth, checks his O2 gauge: 1 min. 

                                 MICAH
                        Please, I got a kid back there. 

           Megan sits across from him, knees nervously bouncing, the gun 
           rattling in her lap and pointed at Micah. 

                                 MEGAN
                        Yeah...? What’s their name? 

                                 MICAH
                        ...Claire... She’s six. 
           Claire. The name registers with Megan, Tess did say it 
           earlier. Megan rises up... reaches out... then: 

                                 MEGAN
                        I’m sorry.  

           Megan can’t watch what Micah’s about to go through. She 
           rushes into her room, leaving him alone.

                                 MICAH
                        YOU HEARTLESS SHIT. DON’T LEAVE ME.

           MEGAN’S ROOM

           Megan clamps headphones over her ears, presses play on a CD 
           player. Music BLARES, drowning out Micah. 

           MAIN CHAMBER

           Micah is SCREAMING like a madman when -- BLEEP-BLEEP-BLEEP. 
           His O2 GAUGE BOTTOMS OUT AT ZERO. He starts to WHEEZE. 

           MEGAN’S ROOM

           Megan sits on her bed, eyes closed tight, trying to forget 
           what’s happening on the other side of her door. 

           MAIN CHAMBER

           Micah GASPS, face turning RED, his eyes CLOSING... 

           His mask is suddenly ripped off and a new one is put on. 
           Micah’s eyes SNAP open as he inhales two lungfuls of oxygen.  

           Megan is kneeling in front of him, giving him a pull from her 
           O2 cylinder. She whisks it away and puts it to her mouth. 

                                 MEGAN
                        I want to trust you. So I’ll make 
                        you a deal. I’m going to ask you a 
                        question. For every honest answer 
                        you give me, I’ll give you one 
                        minute to breathe. 

           Micah wildly nods, Yes! Fucking yes!!

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        Did you kill my father and is that 
                        how you know about this place? 

           She puts the mask on him. He inhales, savoring every breath.
                                 MICAH
                        No... we didn’t kill your father... 
                        And no... that’s not how we know 
                        about this place...

           Megan pulls away the mask, takes some oxygen for herself. 

                                 MEGAN
                        Did that lady really work with my 
                        dad?

           Megan gives Micah a turn with the mask. 

                                 MICAH
                        Yes... We’re the good guys... Your 
                        mom is wrong... You’re right... 
                        Trust your instincts... 

           Micah’s eyes give nothing away. He seems genuine. 

                                 MICAH (CONT’D)
                        If you let Tess in here, maybe she 
                        can improve on your dad’s creation? 
                        Maybe she can do more than even he 
                        was able to do. 

           Megan starts to take away the mask. 

                                 MICAH (CONT’D)
                        No, no, no, wait! One more thing!

           Micah inhales, like it’s the last breath he’ll ever take. 

                                 MICAH (CONT’D)
                        But... if you let Tess die out 
                        there, we’ll never know what she 
                        could have done.

           Megan slowly takes the mask back. She holds his stare, 
           ruminating over his words. Then:

           WHIRRRRR -- The O2 generator starts up with a WHOOSH of air 
           rushing out the vent. The CO2 levels begin to wane. 

           Megan places her hand over the vent, feels the airflow 
           restored, breathes a sigh of relief. Looks back at Micah. 

           INT. FARMHOUSE/LIVING ROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Lucas leads the way through the room, passing under the hole 
           in the ceiling. Tess is shielded behind him, on high alert. 
                                 TESS
                        We can’t waste time in here. If 
                        they die down there we’ll never get 
                        in. Do you hear me?

                                 LUCAS
                        I do, and if there’s someone else 
                        out here, they can let us in. A 
                        garage door doesn’t open itself. 

           Then, something occurs to Tess. 

                                 TESS
                        Shit. 

           Tess races into the kitchen with the missing wall and heads 
           for the barn when -- 

           PFFFT! PFFFT! 

           Two bullets tear through a cabinet. 

           EXT. BARN ROOF - THAT MOMENT

           Amy is flat on her stomach, taking aim with her rifle at 
           Tess. The exhaust pipe has been unclogged. 

           INT. FARMHOUSE/KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT

           Lucas tackles Tess as a bullet whizzes by her head. He drags 
           her out of the kitchen, no longer exposed to the outside. 

           LIVING ROOM

           Tess picks herself up, kicks the wall. Pissed beyond words, 
           she stares at Lucas, then looks at her O2 gauge: 34 min.

                                 LUCAS
                        I’m sorry, I thought--

           Tess puts up a hand, doesn’t want to hear it. Instead, she 
           peers around a corner at the barn. 

                                 TESS
                        WELL, YOU’RE OUT HERE NOW. WHY 
                        DON’T WE TRY TALKING AGAIN? 

           EXT. BARN ROOF - THAT MOMENT

           Amy scans the house, searching for a clear shot. 
                                 TESS (O.S.)
                        I DON’T KNOW HOW MUCH TIME YOU HAVE 
                        LEFT, BUT IT CAN’T BE THAT MUCH. 

           Amy checks her oxygen gauge: 18 min. 

                                 AMY
                        Shit...

           Amy knows they have more oxygen than her. 

           INT. FARMHOUSE/LIVING ROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Lucas crawls under a window, gets the roof in his sights.

                                 TESS
                        COME ON. SAY SOMETHING. ANYTHING.

           When Tess doesn’t get a reply, she turns to Lucas. 

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        For all we know she’s got a full 
                        tank. We have to get to her. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Yeah, I know. 

                                 TESS
                        So you go around the left side of 
                        the barn. I’ll go on the right side 
                        to distract her--

                                 LUCAS
                        What? No, Tess--

                                 TESS
                        Don’t interrupt. Let me finish--

                                 LUCAS
                        I can’t let you do that. 

                                 TESS
                        Do what? 

                                 LUCAS
                        I can’t let you run out there like 
                        a sitting duck. 

                                 TESS
                        There’s no other way. We’re running 
                        out of time. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        We need to get to her, because 
                        she’s the only way we can get 
                        inside now. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Huh? 

                                 TESS
                        By coming out here, she’s given us 
                        something we can use: Her. 

                                 LUCAS
                        ‘Her?’

                                 TESS
                        We get our hands on her, what child 
                        wouldn’t open the door for their 
                        mom? She’s our ticket inside.  

                                 LUCAS
                             (beat)
                        She’ll tell her kid not to open up. 

                                 TESS
                        I know, but I heard the girl 
                        talking. She wants to trust us.

           EXT. BARN ROOF - THAT MOMENT

           Amy has the living room window in her crosshairs, just 
           waiting for Tess and Lucas to show themselves. 

           She steals a glance at her oxygen gauge: 16 min

           INT. FARMHOUSE/LIVING ROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Tess and Lucas finish discussing their plan of attack. 

                                 TESS
                        You understand what you need to do? 

                                 LUCAS
                        Uh huh.  

                                 TESS
                        Good, go do it.

           They sync their wristwatches, Lucas crawls out of the room. 

           DINING ROOM
           Lucas slinks into the dinning room and up to a screen door 
           that leads out to the backyard.

           From here, he sees the back of the BARN. If Amy keeps her 
           sights on the house, she won’t spot Lucas from this angle. 

           LIVING ROOM

           Tess eyes her watch as seconds tick by: 10... 9... 8... 7...

           DINING ROOM

           Lucas is staring at his watch: 6...5...4...

           ON TESS’S WATCH, 3... 2... 1 

           Tess raises a gun and FIRES TWO SHOTS... BANG...BANG!

           EXT. BARN ROOF - THAT MOMENT

           Amy STARTLES as two bullets hit the edge of the roof. 

           INT. FARMHOUSE/DINING ROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Lucas BURSTS out the backdoor towards the barn. 

           INT. FARMHOUSE/LIVING ROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Tess clocks Lucas SPRINTING across the yard and FIRES another 
           SHOT at the roof to keep Amy down. 

           EXT. FARM - THAT MOMENT

           Lucas bolts across the dirt field, until he makes it safely 
           to the back of the BARN. 

           EXT. BARN ROOF - THAT MOMENT

           Amy is reluctant to lift her head.

           INT. FARMHOUSE/LIVING ROOM - THAT MOMENT

           TESS’S POV: Lucas delicately places one foot on the ladder. 
           EXT. BARN ROOF - THAT MOMENT

           Amy is still keeping her head low. Only we see the top of the 
           ladder shimmy. Amy, however, is too preoccupied to notice. 

           INT. FARMHOUSE/LIVING ROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Tess watches Lucas gradually inch his way up the ladder. He 
           stops, just before reaching the top.

                                 TESS
                        AMY, I’VE HAD ENOUGH! I DON’T HAVE 
                        TIME FOR THIS SHIT!

           ON AMY

           Remaining still, trying to make out Tess’s words.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        I’M WALKING OUT. IF YOU WANNA SHOOT 
                        ME, GO AHEAD. 

           ON TESS

           Taking a deep breath, before walking out into the open. 

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        I’M STANDING RIGHT HERE.

           ON AMY

           Not believing it, but finding the courage to peek above the 
           ledge. Tess is indeed standing in the middle of the yard. 

           Amy has Tess in her sights. Her finger is on the trigger, 
           about to squeeze off a shot. 

           CREAK...

           Amy blanches, whips around just in time to see Lucas swinging 
           the butt of his shotgun into her face.

           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT

           Megan has her gun trained on Micah. She looks at the MONITOR. 
           Still a BLACK SCREEN. Amy forgot to remove the black tape. 

           In the reflection of the black screen, we see something move 
           behind her. 

           Megan turns around, but she’s grabbed by the hair and pulled 
           to the floor. She hits the cement with a hard THUD. 
           Micah towers over her. Duct tape hanging off his free hands 
           and gripping the scissors Amy used to cut open his EV suit.

                                 MICAH
                        Against the radiator. 

           Megan scurries away, but Micah grabs her foot and drags her 
           kicking and screaming across the floor, over to the radiator. 

                                 MEGAN
                        NO!! NO!!! 

           He binds her hands with duct tape, ties her to the radiator.

           Micah digs into some bins until he finds TWINE. He wraps it 
           around her neck, securing her entire body to the radiator. 

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        It’s hard... to breathe...

                                 MICAH
                        Yeah, I know the feeling. 

           Micah, a bloody mess, stands back. Megan is shaking with fear 
           when -- a KNOCK on the other side of the shelter door. 

                                 TESS
                        MEGAN. I NEED YOU TO LISTEN. 

           Megan’s head snaps up. 

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        I HAVE YOUR MOTHER.

                                 MICAH
                        Tess?  

                                 TESS
                             (surprised)
                        Micah?!

                                 MICAH
                        Yeah, I got free.

                                 TESS
                        Did you just say you got free?!

                                 MICAH
                        YEAH!

                                 TESS
                        WELL THEN WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? 
                        OPEN THE FUCKIN’ DOOR.
           Micah looks at the monitor, but it’s still blacked out. 

                                 MICAH
                        TAKE THE TAPE OFF. I WANNA BE SURE.

           ON THE MONITOR: The tape is removed, revealing Tess and Lucas 
           holding Amy hostage at gunpoint. 

           Megan SHUDDERS at the image.

                                 MICAH (CONT’D)
                        I’M COMING. 

           Micah goes to the door, unlocks the first deadbolt. But when 
           he reaches for the second lock, he starts to wildly blink 

                                 MICAH (CONT’D)
                             (to himself)
                        Whoa...

           Micah is having trouble with his balance and coordination. 

                                 MEGAN
                             (cringing)
                        Uh... Your back... 

                                 MICAH
                        Wh... what?

           MEGAN’S POV: Micah’s entire back is DRENCHED with BLOOD. His 
           tourniquet fell off during his fight.

                                 MICAH (CONT’D)
                        I’m...

           Micah steadies himself. As he reaches for the lock, his eyes 
           flutter. He falls back, SLAMMING his head into the floor. 

           He stares straight up. Eyes wide and vacant. He lets out a 
           shivering breath and goes still. 

                                 MEGAN
                        Oh my God... 

           INT. STAIRWELL - THAT MOMENT

           Lucas has his gun on Amy. Tess KNOCKS on the door. 

                                 TESS
                        Micah? What’s going on? 
           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT

           Blood rivers from the back of Micah’s head and shoulder. 

                                 TESS (O.S.)
                        MICAH?! ANSWER ME.

                                 MEGAN
                        HE’S DEAD. 

           INT. STAIRWELL - THAT MOMENT

           Tess and Lucas exchange a look.

                                 MEGAN (O.S.)
                        HE JUST, HE COLLAPSED. HE WAS 
                        BLEEDING AND... HE’S DEAD. 

           Lucas shakes his head, laughing in disbelief. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Bullshit. 

                                 TESS
                             (to Amy)
                        Tell her to open up. 

                                 AMY
                        No.

           Lucas MASHES Amy’s face into the door.

           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT

           Megan desperately tries to pull herself free, but all she 
           does is slice her wrists on the sharp zip-ties and twine. 

                                 LUCAS (O.S.)
                        I’m done with this shit! If this 
                        door isn’t open in five seconds, 
                        your mom is dead. 

                      LUCAS (CONT’D)
           One... two... 
                                                          MEGAN
                                              I can’t open it! I’m tied up! 

                                 TESS
                        Wait, what’d she say? 

                           LUCAS
                                                      MEGAN (O.S.)
           THREE!
                                              YOUR FRIEND TIED ME UP! 
                                 TESS
                        Lucas, shut up, I can’t hear what 
                        she’s saying--

                                 LUCAS
                        FOUR... FIVE...

           Tess rips the gun from Lucas.

                                 MEGAN
                        DON’T SHOOT, I’M TIED UP, I SWEAR 
                        TO GOD, I CAN’T MOVE. 

                                 LUCAS
                        She’s fuckin’ with us. She ain’t 
                        tied up. 

                                 MEGAN
                        PLEASE, BELIEVE ME. I SWEAR. I 
                        CAN’T MOVE.

           Tess looks at Amy who has concern in her eyes. 

                                 AMY
                        Megan? It’s mom. Tell me, can you 
                        really not get to the door? 

                                 MEGAN
                        I SWEAR, MOM. I SWEAR.

                                 TESS
                        What’s the key code. 

                                 AMY
                        6, 2, 9, 8, 0, 5

           Lucas goes to the keypad, but forgets the code. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Again, but slower. 

                                 AMY
                        It won’t work. It takes dual 
                        authentication from outside. You 
                        need a keycard. 

                                 LUCAS
                             (not believing)
                        Just tell me the code again. 

                                 AMY
                        6, 2, 9, 8, 0, 5

           Lucas enters the code, pulls the lever. Locked. 
                                 LUCAS
                        Where’s the keycard? 

                                 AMY
                        Inside the shelter. 

           Lucas frisks Amy, searches inside her pockets.

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        In case I was caught, I didn’t want 
                        you to get in there. 

           Lucas jams his gun into Amy’s cheek. 

                                 TESS 
                        There has to be another way in. 

           Amy shakes her head, “no.” 

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        No? Well you better figure out a 
                        way, because if you don’t, how’s 
                        your kid gonna eat, huh? It’ll only 
                        be a matter of time until-- 

                                 AMY
                        I KNOW. 

           Amy looks off, contemplating something.

                                 TESS
                        What? What’re you thinking? 

           BLEEP-BLEEP-BLEEP -- Amy’s O2 gauge sounds with an alert. She 
           completely forgot about it: 5 min 

                                 AMY
                        Oh shit.

                                 TESS
                        Amy, listen to me. Think. Is there 
                        another way inside?

                                 AMY
                        I -- I don’t --

                                 TESS
                        Think. You have five minutes to 
                        save your kid. 

                                 AMY
                        Okay, yes -- Maybe -- But -- But --
                                 TESS
                        But what? 

                                 AMY
                        But neither of us have enough 
                        oxygen to do it. 

                                 TESS
                        To do what? 

                                 AMY
                        There’s another keycard -- But it’s 
                        not here -- It’s half a day’s hike. 
                        We’d never make it with the oxygen 
                        we have left. 

                                 MEGAN (O.S.)
                        MOM? WHAT’S GOING ON? 

           BLEEP-BLEEP, 4 min

                                 TESS
                        If I can keep you breathing, can 
                        you get us that keycard?

                                 AMY
                             (beat)
                        Keeping me breathing is the only 
                        way to find out.  

           Tess races upstairs. Amy and Lucas follow. 

           EXT. FARM - CONTINUOUS

           Tess sprints to the shopping cart of supplies. Inside are 
           three oxygen cylinders. 

                                 TESS
                        Our last tanks. Each with five 
                        hours of oxygen. 

           Tess turns Amy around, disconnects her empty tank, and 
           connects a fresh tank. Amy’s O2 gauge jumps: 5hr 

                                 AMY
                        ...thank you... thank you... But...

                                 LUCAS
                        ‘But?’ Of course there’s a ‘but.’ 

                                 TESS
                        Let her talk. 
                                 AMY
                        The place we need to go is a 16 
                        hour walk, round trip. Even if we 
                        gave one person all three tanks, 
                        they still wouldn’t make it there 
                        and back... 

           Then, something occurs to Amy. She rushes into the barn. 

           INT. BARN - CONTINUOUS

           Amy slides the tarp off the VEHICLE. It’s a dented and 
           chipped hunk of metal. An ELECTRIC CAR on it’s last legs. 

                                 TESS
                        When was the last time you used 
                        this thing? 

                                 AMY
                        I make sure to check the charge 
                        once a month, but... 

           Amy removes an ALUMINUM HEAT SHIELD from the windshield. She 
           sits in the driver’s seat, presses the ignition. Nothing. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Shit!

           But she tries again... click, click, click... 

           HUMMMMMM...

           They all look at each other, excited, before the gravity of 
           the situation takes back over. 

                                 AMY
                        It’s about a thirty minute drive. 
                        We’ll see how long the car can 
                        last. The solar panels will absorb 
                        the heat, so maybe we’ll be okay. 

                                 TESS
                        Maybe...?

                                 AMY
                        Thirty minutes to get there. One 
                        hour to get the key. Thirty minutes 
                        to get back. A little over two 
                        hours in total, if we’re lucky.

                                 TESS
                        Getting lucky is our only chance. 
           Tess grabs an O2 cylinder for herself, places it in the back.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        So, where the hell are we going? 

                                 AMY
                        I’ll tell you, but only after I say 
                        goodbye to Megan. 

           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

           Megan is still fighting to get herself loose. 

                                 AMY (O.S.)
                        Megan. I’m going to take care of 
                        this. But I have to go somewhere. 

                                 MEGAN
                        What?! Where?!

           INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           Amy hesitates to answer. 

                                 AMY 
                        I can’t get into it, but, I think I 
                        know where there might be another 
                        key. But... Just... 

                                 MEGAN (O.S.)
                        WAIT! WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! 

                                 AMY 
                        It’s going to be okay. I can’t -- I 
                        just have to go -- I love you. 

           Amy can’t bear her daughter’s pleas anymore, she needs to go.

                                 MEGAN (O.S.)
                        MOM!!! WAIT!!! MOM!!!

           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT

           Megan doesn’t get an answer. She stares helplessly ahead. 

           INT. BARN - MOMENTS LATER

           Amy digs inside a storage bin and pulls out HIKING GEAR: 
           BUNGEE CORDS, ROPE, CARABINERS, and a CLIMBING HARNESS.
           Amy tosses them in the backseat, then gets behind the wheel. 
           Confused by all the gear, Tess hops into the passenger seat. 

                                 TESS
                        Where are we going with all this?

                                 AMY
                        The last place I ever wanted to go. 
                        We’re going to see my husband. 

           Tess’s head snaps up. Amy drives off. 

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           The hot sun beams down on the car as it glides down a main 
           strip. Everything is abandoned and sun-baked. 

           Fallen, brittle, and leafless trees are toppled over. Some of 
           them in the middle of the road, which Amy avoids.  

           INT. AMY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Amy cautiously navigates the terrain. 

                                 TESS
                        Is Joel still alive? 

           Amy shakes her head, “no.” 

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        But we’re going to see him?

                                 AMY
                        We’re going to see what’s left of 
                        him.

                                 TESS
                        Enough off this cryptic shit. What 
                        happened to him?

                                 AMY
                        ...Five months ago, Joel’s father 
                        died while they were outside 
                        performing maintenance on the 
                        oxygen generator. The next day, 
                        Joel left to bury him. Joel never 
                        came back. 

           Amy maneuvers around a down tree. 
                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        That night, I found a note under my 
                        pillow...

           Amy looks at Tess, debating if she should go on. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Apparently, Joel always knew his 
                        invention couldn’t sustain everyone 
                        forever. Even without his father, 
                        the system was still pushing too 
                        hard and would eventually fail. It 
                        was only a matter of time. The way 
                        Joel figured, his presence was 
                        cutting the lives of his family in 
                        half. He couldn’t figure out how to 
                        optimize the machine. 

           Amy looks at Tess, lets a glimmer of hope slip out. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Maybe when you get down there, 
                        you’ll figure out what he couldn’t. 

                                 TESS
                        Maybe.  

                                 AMY
                        But I never told Megan... 

           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT

           Megan is still tied up. 

                                 AMY (V.O.)
                        Even though I get what Joel did, he 
                        gave up. I couldn’t let Megan think 
                        giving up was ever an option. 

           Megan tries to kick over a bottle of water so she can drink, 
           but she’s unsuccessful. 

           INT. STAIRWELL - THAT MOMENT

           Lucas is sitting with his back against the wall.

                                 AMY (V.O.)
                        After burying his father, Joel 
                        decided to go to a place that 
                        reminded him of better times. In 
                        fact, one of his favorite times. 
                        That’s where we’re going. 
           INT. AMY’S CAR - THAT MOMENT

           Amy shakes her head in disbelief. 

                                 AMY
                        But, for being such a smart guy, he 
                        was also pretty stupid. He forgot 
                        he had the only other keycard on 
                        him. So... I’m hoping that keycard 
                        is still with him. 

                                 TESS
                        Or what’s left of him. 

           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT

           Megan surveys the room, her eyes land on the stereo. She 
           stretches out her toe and presses a button. The CLASSICAL 
           MUSIC she grudgingly listened to on Thanksgiving plays.

           INT. STAIRWELL - THAT MOMENT

           Lucas lifts his head after hearing the music. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Hey! D’you get free?!

           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT

           Megan STARTLES. 

                                 MEGAN
                        My toe did. I hit the stereo. 

           INT. STAIRWELL - THAT MOMENT

           Lucas shakes his head, not sure what to believe. But what 
           choice does he have? Lucas backs down, let’s the song play. 

                                 LUCAS
                        It’s good to sit at least. 

           Lucas grimaces as he massages his boot. 

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        Been on my feet for three days.

           They both sit in silence, letting the music wash over them. 
           Under normal conditions, Megan couldn’t turn this music off 
           fast enough. But right now, it somehow gives her comfort.
           EXT. ROAD - EVENING

           The sun is setting. 

           Amy and Tess pull up next to a clearing. Amy parks the car 
           and gets out. They check their O2 levels: 4hr 31min

           EXT. NIAGARA GORGE - NIGHT

           Lugging the hiking gear, they reach a clearing. The same 
           cliff we saw from earlier. Amy stares at the open space...

           FLASHBACK 

           Joel takes Megan out of the baby carrier. He holds up his 
           phone and takes a selfie. They all smile, one happy family. 

           PRESENT DAY

           Amy looks over the ledge. No waterfall anymore. Completely 
           dry. It’s a few hundred feet down and pitch black. 

                                 TESS
                        He’s down there? 

                                 AMY
                        It’s what he said in the note.

           Dubious, Tess eyeballs Amy.

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        One of us goes down there, the 
                        other stays up here with the line. 

           Amy hammers two BOLTS into the rock and threads a bungee cord 
           through. Amy tugs on the cord, then hands it to Tess.

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Careful not to get rope burn.

           Amy puts on the CLIMBING HARNESS, tethers herself to the 
           cord, and affixes a carabiner and brake strand. 

           With her back to the clearing, she makes sure the rig is 
           holding her weight. When she’s satisfied it’s secure --

           She kicks off, rappelling down, down, way down into the dark 
           until -- 

           Her boots hit the rocky bottom.  
           She flips on a light attached to the helmet of her EV suit 
           and scans the area. Nothing, just rocks and dirt. 

           AT THE TOP OF THE CLIFF

           Tess shines a flashlight down, but she can’t see anything. 

           BOTTOM OF THE CLIFF

           Amy sweeps her light over the ground...

           ...CRUNCH... 

           Amy has stepped on something... She shines her light on... 

           A MUMMIFIED CORPSE inside an EV suit. 

           Amy reels back and looks away.

           Breath hastening, she takes a moment to collect herself, then 
           slowly cranes her head back at the corpse. 

           Overwhelmed, she stares down at what’s left of Joel. Amy is 
           frozen in this moment, overcome with emotion... 

           Then, she remembers the task at hand. She fights back tears 
           and inches forward... kneels next to Joel’s corpse... 

           She spots a HANDGUN, the one Joel had when he left the 
           shelter. She pockets it, continues to search for the keycard. 

           Amy, queasy, feels inside his pockets.

           AT THE TOP OF THE CLIFF

           Tess shines her flashlight over the ledge and waves her hand 
           in front of it, creating a strobe effect. 

           BOTTOM OF THE CLIFF

           Amy notices the flickering light. She shines her light up and 
           signals back. 

           Amy continues to dig through his pockets, starting to panic 
           when she can’t find it.

           Then, Amy sees his backpack a few feet away. She tears it 
           open, supplies spill out. She fans them out when --

           She sees it. Amy snatches up the KEYCARD. She holds it, hands 
           shaking with adrenaline. She wants to cheer, shout, cry...

           But she keeps it together, puts the keycard in her pocket and 
           zips it up. Amy stands, looks down at her husband’s remains.
           Amy starts to tear up... But needs to push on... 

           WITH TESS

           The cord RATTLES, indicating that Amy is climbing up. Tess 
           shines her flashlight on Amy as she scales the mountain. 

           Amy GRUNTS LOUDLY as she pulls herself up. Rappel ascension 
           is clearly taking more muscle and focus than rappelling down.  

                                 TESS
                        You get them? 

           Amy can’t answer, keeps climbing, BREATHING FAST and HEAVY, 
           on a mission -- The CORD SNAPS. 

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        NO!

           Tess GRASPS the cord, but it SLIPS through her hands and she 
           watches it disappear over the cliff.

           ON TESS

           Cupping her mouth as she slowly approaches the ledge. She 
           looks over to see...

           AMY

           Hugging the side of the mountain for dear life. Her foot 
           wedged in a foothold and her fingertips latched onto a rock. 

           Amy shimmies over to a rock where there’s enough room to 
           stand. She lets go of the mountain. 

                                 AMY
                             (heaving)
                        I’m okay -- I’m okay -- 

           Amy squeezes her hands. She looks up at Tess, she’s at least 
           TWENTY FEET from the top. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Throw down another cord!

           Tess picks up a bungee cord.

                                 TESS
                        Did you get the key?!

                                 AMY
                        Y-yes. 

           Tess drops the cord to Amy. 
                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        You won’t be able to pull me up by 
                        yourself. I’d end up pulling you 
                        over. You need to secure it. 

                                 TESS
                        Okay. But first show me the key.

           Amy takes out the keycard. Tess can’t contain herself. 

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        You did it! Quick, tie the key to 
                        the cord, let me pull it up first. 

           Amy glares at Tess, No fucking way!

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        We can’t lose that key. If this 
                        cords snaps like the other, you’ll 
                        fall and take the key with you. 

           Amy considers the prospect.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        I promise to get you up here, but 
                        the key is most important. Think 
                        about Megan.  

           Amy lowers her head. Whether Tess is telling the truth or 
           lying, she’s right. The key is what’s most important. 

           Amy slides the cord through a keychain on the keycard. 

           Tess carefully pulls it up and unties the key. She holds it 
           in her hand, the most beautiful thing in the world. 

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        Keep holding on. 

           AMY’S POV: Tess moves out of view. Seconds past as Amy looks 
           up at nothing. All she hears is Tess SHUFFLING about. 

                                 AMY
                        HEY!

           Tess comes back into view and tosses the cord down to Amy. 

                                 TESS
                        I was securing it. Feel. 

           Amy tugs on the cord. It feels secure. Amy looks up at Tess 
           as if to say, okay, I got no other choice.
           Amy tethers herself to the cord... and climbs... Never taking 
           her eyes off Tess as she pulls herself up... 

           7 feet away... 6 feet... 5 feet... She’s within Tess’s reach.

           As Amy extends her hand, her foot slips off a rock --

           AMY SWINGS INTO THE MOUNTAIN, CRUSHING HER LEG INTO THE SIDE.

                                 AMY
                        AHHHHHH!

           Tess grips Amy’s hand. 

                                 TESS
                        Climb. C’mon! I got you!

           Amy winces when she puts weight on her LEFT LEG. 

           Tess pulls with all her strength until Amy reaches the top 
           and claws her way over the cliff. 

           Breathless, Tess and Amy look at each other, elated and 
           verging on tears. 

                                 AMY
                        Thank you. 

           Amy tries to stand, but her knee buckles under the pressure. 

                                 TESS
                        Let’s just get to the car.

           Tess lifts up Amy, and helps her to the car. Tess eases Amy 
           into the passenger seat.

           Tess gets behind the wheel and starts the car. She hits the 
           peddle, peels out, but the car stalls after going ten feet.

           Tess tries the car again, but it doesn’t start. FUCK! Amy 
           checks the battery light. Dead. 

           Amy looks at her oxygen gauge: 4hr

           Tess also checks her oxygen gauge: 4hr

           In agony, Amy looks down at her injured leg. Then, Amy looks 
           up at Tess. With resignation in her voice, Amy says:

                                 AMY
                        We made good time on the climb... 
                        So if you run, you might make it. 
                                 TESS
                        No, come on. You’re walking. 

           Tess gets out, runs to the passenger side, and pulls Amy out.

           Tess drapes Amy’s arm over her shoulder and tries to jog, but 
           Amy’s leg buckles again and they both fall. 

           Tess struggles to pick her up, but Amy throws her off. 

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        You’re not even going to try? 

                                 AMY
                        You only have four hours! You’ll 
                        barely make it as is. You can’t 
                        wait for me. I’ll slow you down and 
                        neither of us will make it. 

           Torn, Tess looks at the path ahead, then back at Amy. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Just promise me, you won’t hurt my 
                        daughter.

                                 TESS
                        ...I promise. 

                                 AMY
                        Are you a mother? 

                                 TESS
                        ...I was. 

           Pain in Tess’s eyes. 

                                 AMY
                        Now go. Fast. 

                                 TESS
                        I’ll come back for you if I can.  

                                 AMY
                        That’s nice of you to say. 

           Tess runs off, disappearing into the dark. Once Tess is out 
           of sight, Amy curls up and bawls. 

           Amy starts to SHIVER as the temperature falls. She crawls 
           into the car. Tries the ignition again. Nothing. 
           EXT. ROAD - MOMENTS LATER

           Tess is running her ass off, FOGGING up her mask. She looks 
           at her tank: 3hrs 50min 

           EXT. CLIFF SIDE - MOMENTS LATER

           Amy is still behind the wheel. She reaches into her pocket 
           and pulls out the photo of her, Joel, and Megan. 

           She props it up on the dashboard. Through the window is the 
           new, bleak mountain view. But Amy remains fixed on the photo. 

                                                          CUT TO BLACK:
                            3 HOURS LATER 

           EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

           Tess, bone-tired and FREEZING from her prolonged exposure to 
           the PLUNGING TEMPERATURE, is jogging down the road. 

           She looks at her oxygen gauge: 50 min  

           Her lungs are burning, her muscles are fucking shot. Her legs 
           give out and she drops to her knees, heaving inside her mask. 

           She scans the area, no idea where she is. She shines her 
           light into the dark and... Wait, is that the farmhouse?!  

           Tess wills herself to her feet and sprints toward it. 

           INT. STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER

           Lucas HEARS FOOTSTEPS and raises his gun as Tess comes 
           stumbling down the stairs. 

           Tess collapses into his arms out of sheer exhaustion. They 
           hug each other tight. 

                                 LUCAS
                        The keycard? 

           Out of breath, she takes the keycard out of her pocket. 

           Lucas rips it out of her hand. He punches in the code and 
           places the keycard above the keypad. CLICK. 

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        FUCK YEAH!
                                 TESS
                             (catching her breath)
                        Amy... got hurt... 

                                 LUCAS
                             (not caring)
                        That sucks. 

                                 TESS
                        I need to go back for her. 

                                 LUCAS
                        What? We need to get you in there 
                        and look at that machine.

           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

           Megan is sleeping when she HEARS the door GROAN open.  

                                 MEGAN
                        Mom? 

           Tess and Lucas hurry inside. Lucas quickly shuts the door 
           after himself and locks it. Megan’s face falls.  

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        Where’s my mom? 

           Tess and Lucas lift their masks and slip off their O2 packs. 
           After 3 days on the road, breathing never felt so damn good. 

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        Answer me! Where is she?!

           Tess kneels beside Megan, goes to untie her, but stops. 

                                 TESS
                        Your mother hurt her leg when she 
                        climbed up from getting the key--

                                 MEGAN
                             (totally confused)
                        Her leg? Climbed up? From where? 
                        What the hell are you talking 
                        about? Where the hell is she?!

                                 TESS
                        I’m trying to tell you--

                                 MEGAN
                        Wait -- That’s my dad’s key. 

           Tess follows Megan’s gaze to the keycard. 
                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        How’d you get my dad’s key? 

                                 LUCAS
                        Tess, come look at this thing. 

           Lucas runs his hand over the O2 generator, marveling at it. 

                                 TESS
                             (to Lucas)
                        Hang on. 
                             (to Megan)
                        I wish I wasn’t the one telling you 
                        this, but... your dad knew this 
                        machine couldn’t sustain all of you 
                        for as long as he wanted it to. 

                                 LUCAS
                        What? What’s that mean? 

                                 TESS
                             (ignoring Lucas)
                        He left here so you and your mom 
                        could live longer. She just didn’t 
                        want to tell you because--

                                 MEGAN
                        This is bullshit.

                                 LUCAS
                        Tess, stop wastin’ time. 

                                 TESS
                        Give me one second, Lucas. 

                                 MEGAN
                        I don’t believe you. You killed 
                        her. Probably him too. Didn’t you? 

                                 TESS
                        No. Trust me. She may still be 
                        alive. I’m going back for her. Does 
                        this thing refill tanks? 

           Tess motions to the O2 generator.

                                 MEGAN
                        Yeah.  

                                 LUCAS
                        Jesus Christ, you’re not going 
                        anywhere, Tess. 
                                 TESS
                        I promised I would. 

                                 LUCAS 
                        What about your promise to our 
                        friends back home? You’re not 
                        risking your life, again. 

                                 TESS
                        Lucas--

                                 LUCAS
                        ‘Member why we came here?! We came 
                        here so you could look at this 
                        thing and see if you can build 
                        another. And if you can’t--

                                 TESS
                        I’ll look when I come back. 

           Lucas aims his gun at Megan. 

                       TESS (CONT’D)
                                                          MEGAN
           LUCAS!
                                              OH MY GOD!

                                 LUCAS
                             (to Tess)
                        I can’t kill you, but I can kill 
                        the reason you want to go back for 
                        that bitch. Now look at that thing!

                                 TESS
                        Okay, just put the gun down. 

                                 LUCAS
                        I’m not gonna ask again. LOOK!

           Tess kneels next to the O2 generator and starts inspecting 
           it. She gently removes the protective plexiglass. 

                                 TESS
                        Screwdriver? Phillips?  

           Megan, petrified, motions with her head to a tool bin. Lucas 
           rips it off the shelf, tools spill out.  

           Tess picks up a screwdriver, unscrews a metal panel. Inside 
           is a mass of color-coded wires, a tangled mess of confusion. 

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        I need to take it apart to really 
                        figure this out. 
                                 LUCAS
                        Then take it apart. Do what you 
                        need to do. 

                                 TESS
                        But it takes time. 

                                 LUCAS
                        We have time. 

                                 TESS
                        Amy doesn’t. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Are you outta your mind? Can you 
                        replicate it? 

                                 TESS
                        I don’t know. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Holy shit. Three fuckin’ days we 
                        hike here. Three. We gave you 
                        everything. Food. Water. Air. And 
                        now that you’re here, you wanna 
                        leave? 

                                 TESS
                        It’s the right thing to do.

                                 LUCAS
                        I’m putting an end to this. 

           Lucas aims his gun at Megan. 

                                 TESS
                        I CAN’T REPLICATE IT.

           Lucas stops.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        I can’t fix it. 

                                 LUCAS
                        You barely looked at it. 

                                 TESS
                        I’m... I’m not an engineer. 

           On Lucas, “WHAT?!”

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        I’m not an engineer. 
                                 LUCAS
                        ...I heard you. Now explain what 
                        the fuck it means. 

                                 TESS
                        I lied to all of you. I lied so 
                        that I’d be able to come here.

                                 LUCAS
                        No, no, then how’d you know all 
                        this shit about her dad?

           Tess looks at Megan, reluctant to say.

                                 TESS
                        I would listen to her over a radio. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Radio? 

                                 TESS
                        I have a HAM radio. I kept it 
                        hidden from everyone. And when 
                        Megan would talk...
                             (to Megan)
                        I would listen. I waited until I 
                        had enough information I could use. 

           Megan’s face fills with anger and fear. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Everyone back home, who’s life 
                        depends on you, you lied. 

           Lucas can’t believe what he’s hearing. He slumps into a 
           chair, all hope draining from his being. 

                                 TESS
                        I’m sorry. To both of you. 

           Lucas raises his gun. 

           And shoots Tess in the head. Her body drops in front of 
           Megan. Tess’s vacant eyes stare back. 

           Megan SCREAMS. 

                                 MEGAN
                        WHOA! WHOA! OH MY GOD! 

           Lucas, like a zombie, shuffles to the couch, and plops down. 

                                 LUCAS
                        You can’t trust anyone, can you? 
           He looks at Megan who is hyperventilating. 

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        I’m not going to hurt you, but I 
                        can’t untie you just yet. You seem 
                        a little... unstable at the moment. 
                        And I just don’t want you to do 
                        anything stupid. Okay? 

           But Megan is in too much shock to answer, unable to take her 
           eyes off Tess’s lifeless body. 

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        Let me fix that.

           Lucas rips the red checkered tablecloth off the table and 
           drapes it over Tess. Splotches of blood instantly soak in. 

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        Eh, good enough... now, I assume 
                        you’re wondering, ‘What’s his 
                        plan?’ Fair question. And from my 
                        point of view, it’s pretty simple. 

           Lucas unstraps his O2 pack and unzips his EV suit. Underneath 
           is a bodysuit with cooling tubes snaking all around. 

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        The place I was staying at has a 
                        failing system. Tess was the only 
                        one who said she could fix it. Tess 
                        can’t fix it. And now I’m here, 
                        with a working system. So, it 
                        appears to me like you have a new 
                        roommate. 

           Lucas winces as he slowly peels off his blood-caked socks. 
           His bare feet are beet red, raw and full of blisters. 

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        Got any aloe? 

                                 MEGAN
                        H-hey... I--I know you’re upset...

           Lucas snickers, no shit. He stands and walks on his heels to 
           the first aid kit. 

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        But all I want, is to get my mom.

                                 LUCAS
                        Your mom’s dead...  Sorry. 
                                 MEGAN
                        Tess said she could be alive?  

           Lucas scoffs at the idea as he points at Tess. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Her? Miss Engineer over there? 
                        You’re gonna believe her? 
                             (yelling at Tess)
                        Miss Just Get Me There And I’ll Fix 
                        Everything! 

                                 MEGAN
                        Just untie me. Gimme a chance to--

                                 LUCAS
                        You’re not leaving. Besides, you’re 
                        the only one who knows how this 
                        shelter functions. I’d be a fool to 
                        let you go until I know how 
                        everything operates. You’re the tour 
                        guide and I’d be lost without you. 

                                 MEGAN
                        Please, let me--

           Lucas slams his fist on the table. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Megan! I’m trying real hard to keep 
                        things civil. Don’t make me... 
                        Just... I need quiet. I need to 
                        think and I need quiet. It’s been a 
                        long week and... 

           Lucas lays down on the couch and closes his eyes. 

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        ...and I’m fuckin’ done.

           EXT. CLIFF SIDE - MORNING

           The sun is coming up. Amy’s car is still where we left it. 

           INT. AMY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Amy stares blankly ahead. At first we think she might be 
           dead, but then she looks at her O2 gauge: 39 minutes 

           She watches the sun on the rise. Then, something on the 
           ground catches her eye outside the car. 
           She opens the door, swings her injured leg out, and limps 
           toward something. 

           TILT DOWN to a lone GREEN WEED popping out of the dirt.  

           Amy holds it gently in her hand. If there’s plant life here, 
           there might be oxygen in the atmosphere. 

           Amy takes off her mask and tries to inhale, but she starts 
           GASPING. The air is too thin to breathe. 

           But this weed means there’s hope... Maybe the planet is 
           healing and replenishing itself? 

           As the sun climbs higher in the sky, it doesn’t take long for 
           it to heat up. Amy is struck with an idea. 

           Amy crawls to the trunk of her car and pulls out an aluminum 
           heat shield that was in the windshield. 

           She holds it up to the sun and reflects the rays onto the 
           solar panels on the roof. 

           With her climbing gear and ropes, Amy rigs the shield so that 
           it will continually direct sunlight onto the solar panels. 

           She gets into the driver’s seat and presses the ignition 
           button. It turns on, but the battery level is only at 2%. 

                                 AMY
                        Come on... Get me to ten. 

           The car battery ticks up to 3%

           EXT. BARN - DAY

           The access hatch is pushed open from the inside. Lucas 
           emerges, the keycard dangling from his belt. 

           He climbs out, then reaches back into the stairwell, and 
           begins to drag something heavy. 

           He pulls Tess’s body out of the stairwell and across the 
           dirt, leaving a trail of blood. 

           EXT. BARN - MOMENTS LATER

           Lucas drops Tess’s body next to Micah’s. He has the gardening 
           shovel in his hands, then looks up at the hot sun. 

           Is it even worth the trouble of burying them? Lucas shrugs, 
           fuck it, and trudges off. 
           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - MOMENTS LATER

           Lucas stomps back inside, shuts the door, and locks it. 
           Bloody handprints are smeared on his EV suit.

           He lifts his mask and brushes dirt off himself. He looks at a 
           still tied up and stoned-face Megan.

                                 LUCAS
                        Better, right? They were shitty 
                        roommates. 

           Lucas laughs at his own joke. 

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        I have a good sense of humor. 
                        You’ll learn that about me. 

           Megan just nods. 

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        People are always telling me how 
                        funny I am. 

                                 MEGAN
                             (beat)
                        Yes, you are funny. 

                                 LUCAS
                        That’s what people tell me. 

                                 MEGAN
                        Where were you staying again, 
                        before here?

                                 LUCAS
                        Claremont Farms. You hungry? 

           Lucas opens a cupboard, pulls out a can of soup.

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        Ho-ly shit. You guys got Campbell’s 
                        Chunky style? Where’s the can 
                        opener? 

                                 MEGAN
                        Claremont Farms? That’s like, over 
                        fifty miles from here?

                                 LUCAS
                        Yes. Can opener? 

           Lucas opens a drawer. 
                                 MEGAN
                        And you feel okay about letting 
                        them die? 

           Lucas slams the drawer shut. 

                                 LUCAS
                        I’ll tell you something. And listen 
                        up, because this applies to you 
                        too. To hell with everyone else. Do 
                        I feel bad for them back there? 
                        Sure. Did anyone else raise their 
                        hand saying they’d escort that 
                        lying bitch here? No! They didn’t. 
                        So, screw everyone else. Now... 
                        where the hell is the can opener?!

           Lucas stares at Megan for a long BEAT -- 

           The LIGHTS GO OUT and the ELECTRICITY SHUTS DOWN... TOTAL 
           DARKNESS... But the WHIR of the O2 generator remains...   

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        Goddamnit. Now what?!

                                 MEGAN
                        This happens sometimes. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Where’s a flashlight. I can’t see 
                        sh-- 

           The SOUND of Lucas BUMPING into furniture. 

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        SHIT! AWWWWW! 

                                 MEGAN
                        The O2 generator is running on 
                        reserves. We have about fifteen 
                        minutes before we’re screwed. We 
                        need to go outside. It could be the 
                        solar panels.

                                 LUCAS
                             (breathing, trying to 
                              remain calm)
                        Okay... Where’s a flashlight. 

                                 MEGAN
                        There should be one by the door. 
                        Use the wall as a guide. 
           Lucas stumbles around in the dark. Eventually, we HEAR a 
           click and a flashlight go on. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Finally. 

           Lucas shines it at Megan, but she’s not there. The radiator 
           where she was tied up is empty. 

           Lucas frantically shines the light around.

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        Come on now, don’t do this. 

           Lucas creeps into the hydroponic garden room, shines the 
           lights on the plants and micro-greens. 

           He moves into Megan’s bedroom. He shines his light across the 
           room. Looks under her bed. Nothing.

           Lucas stands up. Only we see a figure come out of the dark, 
           CHARGING at him from behind. 

           At the last second, Lucas HEARS the FOOTSTEPS, turns and sees 
           Megan charging at him with her SOFTBALL BAT. 

           Megan SWINGS, he BLOCKS it with his forearm. Lucas SCREAMS. 

           She winds up and swings at Lucas’s head -- WHOOSH -- Lucas 
           ducks at the last second -- He grabs her wrist and twists. 

                                 MEGAN
                        AWWWW!

           Megan drops the bat. Lucas throws her into the wall. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Is this how it’s gonna be? Huh? If 
                        so, I swear, I’ll end it right now. 
                        More resources for me. 

           Lucas lets go of Megan. She falls to the floor, gasping. 

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        You wanna live, prove you’re worth 
                        keepin’ around. You said this 
                        blackout happens from time to time? 
                        Fix it. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           By the door, Megan is suited up in an EV suit and O2 pack. 
                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        Wait, one second. 

           Lucas abruptly unhooks a tube from her backpack. O2 SPEWS OUT. 

                                 MEGAN
                        What the hell?

           Megan’s O2 gauge plunges. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Keeping you on a leash. This way, 
                        you know I mean it when I say you 
                        only have fifteen minutes. 

           When Megan’s O2 gauge gets to 15 minutes he reconnects it. 

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        You have fifteen minutes. 

           Lucas pushes Megan out the door.

           INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           Megan runs up the staircase. 

           EXT. FARM - CONTINUOUS

           Megan hurries into the barn and grabs a ladder. 

           EXT. BARN ROOF - MOMENTS LATER

           Megan climbs onto the roof. 

           She inspects the solar panels and their connections. 

           That’s weird, one has been disconnected? 

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Honey. 

           Megan nearly jumps out of her skin. She whips around to see 
           Amy, huddled in a corner, holding her leg in pain. 

           Megan runs over to her mom and leaps into her arms. If there 
           was time to cry, they would. 

                                 AMY
                        Are you okay? 
                                 MEGAN
                        He killed Tess. You were right. She 
                        was lying to us, she was lying to 
                        him even, she wasn’t an engineer. 

                                 AMY
                        Then...? How’d she know about dad, 
                        about the generator...?

                                 MEGAN
                        The HAM radio. I would... 
                             (knows she messed up)
                        I would try to talk to Dad and... 
                        Sometimes I said too much and... I 
                        just wanted to talk to someone... 

           Amy hangs her head.  

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        I know, I screwed up, I’m sorry --

                                 AMY
                        No, it’s my fault for not listening 
                        to you. And I should’ve told you 
                        about dad. I just, didn’t want you 
                        to give up. But that doesn’t matter 
                        right now. Nothing matters except 
                        protecting our home. 

           Megan looks at her O2 meter: 3 min

           Amy checks her O2 levels: 8 min

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        I have an idea. 

           Amy reconnects the solar panel. 

           INT. SHELTER/MAIN CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT

           The lights and O2 generator turn on, making Lucas grin. 

           EXT. BARN ROOF - THAT MOMENT

           Amy gives Megan the HANDGUN she found with Joel’s body.  

                                 AMY
                        You can do this. 

           Megan nods. Her O2 gauge reads: 2 min

           Amy looks at hers: 7 min 
           Amy and Megan share a look. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        I love you, honey. 

                                 MEGAN
                        I love you, too. 

           Megan takes off running. 

           INT. STAIRWELL - THAT MOMENT

           Megan runs to the door, waves at the security camera. 

                                 LUCAS (O.S.)
                        Who is it? 

                                 MEGAN
                        Very funny. Let me in. I’ve only 
                        got two minutes. 

                                 LUCAS (O.S.)
                        Yeah, I don’t think I need you 
                        anymore. 

                                 MEGAN
                        What’re you talking about? Lemme in!

                                 LUCAS (O.S.)
                        I’m sorry, but I’d have better luck 
                        on my own then worrying about you 
                        slitting my throat in my sleep. 

           Megan POUNDS on the door. 

           EXT. FARM - THAT MOMENT

           Amy is at the top of the stairwell, peeking down. She can 
           HEAR Megan YELLING. Amy inches closer to get a better angle.

           INT. STAIRWELL - THAT MOMENT

           Megan’s O2 meter beeps: 30 seconds 

                                 MEGAN
                        Open the door. I’ll listen. I 
                        promise. 

           10 seconds...
                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        Listen to me for christ-sake. 

           5 seconds...

           Megan helplessly watches the seconds tick by... 4... 3... 
           2... 1... She takes a deep breath...

           BLEEP! BLEEP! BLEEP! 

           Eyes wide with terror, Megan BANGS her fists on the door. 

           EXT. FARM - THAT MOMENT

           Amy peers down the stairwell when a FIGURE emerges from the 
           dark, running up the stairs. It’s a fully panicking Megan. 

                                 AMY
                        W-what’s happening? 

           Megan shakes her head that she can’t talk, that she’s out of 
           O2 and holding her breath. 

           Without a moment’s thought, Amy takes off her own O2 pack and 
           gives it to her daughter. 

           Megan shakes her head, “no”, but Amy isn’t backing down. Amy 
           takes a deep inhalation of air, then gives Megan the mask. 

           Megan looks at the O2 gauge: 5 min

           Amy signals to Megan to stay put and limps to the ladder.

           ON MEGAN

           Watching Amy climb on top of the roof, using her one good 
           leg, pulling herself up by her arms.

           ON AMY

           Going for the solar panels and disconnecting them. 

           INSIDE THE SHELTER

           Lucas is still at the door when all the lights go out. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Bitch...
           ON TOP OF THE BARN

           Amy runs to the ladder, but trips and falls. She goes to get 
           up, but her EV suit pant leg is caught on a piece of metal. 

           ON MEGAN

           Moving to the bottom of the ladder. 

                                 MEGAN
                        MOM?!

           ON AMY

           In a frenzy, trying to free herself, face turning red as she 
           holds her breath. 

           Amy pulls her leg free, ripping open her EV suit. The extreme 
           heat from the sun instantly burns her exposed skin.

           Amy holds in a SCREAM, refusing to let air escape her body. 
           She covers the tear with her gloved hand.  

           ON MEGAN

           Watching Amy unsteadily place her foot on the ladder. One 
           hand is on the ladder, the other hand covers her leg. 

           ON AMY

           Halfway down the ladder she starts getting woozy. Her hand 
           slips off a rung... Amy falls backwards.. 

           She lands hard on her back. Megan runs over, unhooks the O2 
           tube from her mask and connects it to her mom’s. 

           Megan violently shakes her mother until Amy’s eyes peel open. 
           She stares up at her daughter. 

           Megan places her mother’s hand on the rip in her EV suit, 
           then runs inside the --

           BARN

           Megan races over to a gardening bin and sifts through it.

           FARM

           Megan runs back outside, holding a roll of green GARDEN TAPE. 
           She wraps tape around the rip in Amy’s EV suit when --

           They hear the SHELTER DOOR OPENING. 
           IN THE STAIRWELL

           The nozzle of a shotgun sticks out of a crack in the door.

           Lucas pokes his head out, looks up the stairwell, only sees 
           the open hatch. Lucas closes the shelter door behind him. 

           He cautiously walks up the stairs, emerging into the light. 

           OUTSIDE

           The first thing he sees is Megan, face down in the dirt. He 
           moves toward her body, reaches out to touch her -- BOOM!

           Blood bursts from Lucas’s shoulder. He whips around to see 
           Amy, firing the handgun at him. 

           Lucas raises his shotgun to FIRE -- BANG! It’s kicked up in 
           the air by Megan who is wearing the O2 pack.

           Amy moves in for the final shot and CLICK. Out of bullets. 

           Lucas raises his gun, but Megan KICKS him in the groin. He 
           rolls over in pain. 

           Amy sees the KEYCARD in his pocket and snatches it from him. 

           Amy and Megan make a break for the stairwell. 

           STAIRWELL

           Amy and Megan, both out of O2, fly down the stairs to the 
           door. Megan punches in the code -- Amy uses the keycard. 

           Megan pushes the door open, they run inside the shelter. Amy 
           turns to shut the door when it’s RAMMED OPENED by Lucas. 

           All three fall into the SHELTER. The door SHUTS behind them.

           SHELTER 

           The electricity is still out and it’s dark. The only air left 
           is whatever the O2 generator has in reserves. 

           Lucas crawls on top of Amy, wraps his hands around her neck. 
           But Megan pulls Lucas off by his O2 pack.

           Megan rips the O2 pack from Lucas and pulls off his mask. He 
           turns around, searching for Megan, but can’t see her. 

                                 AMY
                        Put on his mask. 
           Amy is by the O2 generator and claws her way up it, using it 
           to help her get on her feet. 

           Lucas stands up as well, with a shotgun aimed at Amy. But if 
           he fires, he will hit the O2 generator. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Put the gun down -- You shoot me -- 
                        you’ll hit the generator --

                                 LUCAS
                        Move away then --

                                 AMY
                        Everything you’re doing right now -- 
                        I understand it -- You’re scared --

           But behind her back, Amy turns a dial on the O2 generator. 

                                 LUCAS
                        SHUT UP. GET AWAY FROM THAT THING.

                                 AMY
                        When I was outside, I saw something 
                        growing. It was only a weed, but 
                        with time to study it, maybe I can--

                                 LUCAS
                        Bullshit. You didn’t see anything.

                                 AMY
                        I swear. And if you put the gun 
                        down, we can talk. We can, I don’t 
                        know, we can work something out--

                                 LUCAS
                        You’re so full of shit! EVERYONE, 
                        EVERYONE IS... is... 

           Lucas starts to blink and slur his speech. 

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        Wha... wha...

           He stumbles, catches himself on the couch.  

           Amy is also suddenly unsteady on her feet. She falls back 
           against the wall, slides down. 

           AMY’S POV: Staring at the dials and knobs on the O2 generator 
           It’s emitting 100 percent, pure oxygen.  

           While talking to Lucas, Amy turned up the amount of oxygen 
           being pumped into the room to its highest level. 
           Amy and Lucas, who ARE NOT wearing masks, have been inhaling 
           pure oxygen and are succumbing to oxygen toxicity. 

           Megan, who IS wearing a mask and inhaling the correct amount 
           of oxygen, emerges from the dark and sprints to her mother. 

           ON LUCAS

           Trying to stand.

           ON AMY AND MEGAN

           Amy’s body is limp. Megan shares her oxygen mask with Amy. 

           ON LUCAS

           Trying to focus, blindly groping the floor for the shotgun.

           ON AMY AND MEGAN

           Megan drags her mother out of the room as a wobbly Lucas 
           grips the shotgun. 

                                 MEGAN
                        DON’T SHOOT. THERE’S TOO MUCH 
                        OXYGEN. IT’LL EXPLODE. 

           Lucas raises the shotgun. 

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        YOU’LL KILL US ALL. 

           Lucas doesn’t seem to understand or care what is being said. 
           All Megan can do is get the fuck out of here. 

           ON LUCAS

           As he tries to follow them. 

           ON MEGAN AND AMY

           As they hobble out the door and up the stairwell. 

           ON LUCAS

           As he tries to climb the steps.

           ON AMY AND MEGAN

           Clawing their way out of the ACCESS HATCH.   
           ON LUCAS

           As he reaches the top of the steps. Blinking wildly, he sees 
           Amy and Megan are running to the farmhouse.

           He takes aim. But his eyes roll back in his head. Lucas falls 
           backwards, and tumbles down the stairwell.   

           Lucas lands HARD on his back, directly in front of the 
           SHELTER, the SHOTGUN GOES OFF --

           In a split second, the SPARK from the GUN BLAST reacts with 
           the overabundance of oxygen inside the SHELTER --

           BOOOOOOOOOM!

           EXT. FARM - THAT MOMENT

           Megan and Amy fall forward as the GROUND SHAKES from the 
           EXPLOSION under their feet. 

           Once Amy has her bearings, she stands up in pain. Sharing the 
           O2 cylinder, they trudge over to the barn. 

           INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           The door has blown off into the MAIN CHAMBER.

           INT. SHELTER - CONTINUOUS

           A smoldering, blackened shell. Like the inside of a furnace. 
           All their goods? GONE. The O2 generator? BLOWN TO SHREDS. 

           Amy staggers, has to sit. Her leg is broken and seared. She’s 
           got nothing left. Amy holds her head, nearing passing out.  

                                 MEGAN
                        Let’s get you upstairs. 

           EXT. FARM - CONTINUOUS

           Megan sets her mom down in the shade of the barn. 

           Megan looks at the O2 meter she’s wearing. It’s the one she 
           pulled off Lucas during the fight: 3hrs. 

           As they talk, they pass the oxygen mask to each other.  
                                 MEGAN
                        Is that true, about seeing a weed 
                        growing? Or were you just saying 
                        that?

                                 AMY
                             (nodding)
                        With more time, I could’ve studied 
                        it, seen how it was capable of 
                        doing that. Maybe the planet is 
                        replenishing itself, maybe it’s not 
                        and it’s a fluke... But now... 

           They look at each other, sharing the same awful thought. 

                                 MEGAN
                             (lightbulb goes off)
                        What if we go to where Tess and 
                        Lucas came from? Claremont Farms. 

           Amy considers this. 

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        It’s worth a shot. 

                                 AMY
                             (beat, then)
                        You go. Take the car. Fast. 

                                 MEGAN
                        What? You’re coming with me. We’ll 
                        be fine. We’ll share the tank. 

                                 AMY
                        How... we can’t be... passing it 
                        back and forth... the whole way... 
                        I’m... I’m done, Megan...

                                 MEGAN
                        No, just, hang on. I have an idea. 
                        I’ll be right back. 

                                 AMY
                        Just listen to me! For once!

                                 MEGAN
                        No! I’m not leaving you. This time, 
                        we’re trying things my way. Please, 
                        trust me. 

           Holding her breath, Megan runs back into the shelter. 
           IN THE SHELTER

           Megan sifts through debris, finds the FIRST AID KIT. 

           She runs into the HYDROPONIC GARDENING ROOM, digs inside a 
           bin with various garden accessories. Finds a HOSE SPLITTER.  

           BACK OUTSIDE

           Amy is fading when she sees Megan climb out of the hatch, 
           clutching the items and a GARDEN HOSE.

           Amy drops the items on the ground. With the scissors, she 
           cuts off both ends of the garden hose, giving her TWO PIECES. 

           With the two pieces of hose, she screws each of them into a 
           nozzle of the hose splitter.

           Megan indicates to her mom to take a deep breath. Amy does as 
           she’s told. Megan shuts the valve on the cylinder. Then:  

           Rips out the tube connected to her mom’s mask. In a hurry, 
           Megan attaches the loose end of the tube to the splitter. 

           She takes the end of a garden hose, puts it into the opening 
           on Amy’s mask and duct tapes around it so no air leaks out. 

           Megan opens the valve on the O2 cylinder -- An audible WHOOSH 
           of air flows into Amy’s mask. Amy gives a thumbs up. 

           Megan quickly repeats the steps for herself and takes two 
           GIGANTIC lungfuls of fresh air. 

           Megan helps Amy stand. 

           INT. AMY’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Megan speeds down the dirt road as the O2 tank dwindles. 

           SERIES OF SHOTS: As the car travels down a debris littered 
           highway, past crumbling homes and buildings. 

           EXT. ROAD - MOMENTS LATER

           Megan passes a sign, “WELCOME TO CLAREMONT FARMS”

           INT. AMY’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Megan arrives at where Tess’s place is supposed to be. 
           She drives around a corner expecting to see a house, but it’s 
           just wide open land. Dirt for as far as the eye can see. 

                                 MEGAN
                        No... 

           Amy wakes up and sees they’re in the middle of nowhere. She 
           looks at Megan who is starting to sob. 

                                 AMY
                        It’s okay. 

           They look at the O2 tank they’ve been sharing: 2 min 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay. 

           Amy holds out her hand. Megan takes it. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        I love you, honey. 

           Then, Amy takes a piece of paper from the glovebox and writes 
           the location of the weed at the Niagara Gorge as well as a 
           FORMULA. She places it on the dashboard. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        If we’re ever found... It’s to help 
                        get something to grow... with the 
                        little O2 in the atmosphere, it 
                        might be all we need. 

           BLEEP--BLEEP -- The O2 tank is going off. 

           They hug each other tight, sharing their last breath as one.

           But then, the ground opens up, like a trap door of sorts. 

           Megan can barely keep her eyes open as BLURRY FIGURES rush 
           out of the ground... Is this real? 

           And as the figures approach, Megan’s eyes gently closed... 

           FADE TO BLACK... 

           SILENCE... 

           FOR AN EXTENDED MOMENT...

           Until we wonder, is this the end...?

           WE’RE HIT WITH A BRIGHT LIGHT
           An oxygen mask is placed over Megan’s face. She opens her 
           eyes and sees a MAN dressed in grimy winter gear. 

           Megan doesn’t understand what’s happening, but is apparently 
           being dragged towards a massive hole in the ground. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           Amy and Megan are being rushed inside someplace. Another 
           UNDERGROUND SHELTER...

           BLACK

           Megan in a bed.

           BLACK

           Megan is sleeping on a cot. She opens her eyes and we’re in 
           her POV, staring up at a palm tree hanging overhead. 

           OUTSIDE the room, she hears mumbling and plates CLANKING. 

           Megan sits up and sees that the palm tree is fake. She’s in a 
           beach themed bedroom. Confused, she walks to the door.

           INT. TESS’S SHELTER - CONTINUOUS

           Megan opens the door to see NINE PEOPLE, just like Tess 
           described. Five adults, four children. 

           Amy is hovering over their air filtration system with tools, 
           attempting to fix it. 

           Megan looks around, no idea where she is. A MAN, the one who 
           dragged them inside, walks over. 

                                 MAN
                        How’re you feeling? 

                                 MEGAN
                        ...yeah... okay... 

                                 MAN
                        Your mother told us everything. 
                        Come sit. Let me show you your new 
                        home. 

           Megan isn’t sure if they’re to be trusted...

                                 MAN (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay... You’re safe...  

           Megan sits down at the table with the rest of the folks. 
                                 MAN (CONT’D)
                        This is...

           And as the man goes about introducing people, we FADE OUT... 

           INT. TESS’S SHELTER - DAYS LATER

           Amy is in a main living area, surrounded by people, laying on 
           a couch, recovering from all her injuries. 

           In the background, Megan is in the kitchen area, grabbing 
           something from the shelf. It’s a bunch of seeds and pits. 

           EXT. OPEN LAND - MOMENTS LATER

           Megan makes sure the coast is clear as she finds her way to a 
           patch of soil. Clearly attempts at planting something... 

           MOMENTS LATER

           Megan is finishing planting the pits. She stands and looks 
           around, taking in her new environment. 

           Then, she looks back at the ground where she just planted the 
           seeds... She turns around and heads back inside... 

           But we STAY WITH THE SOIL... 

           The CAMERA starts going down in the dirt where Megan planted 
           seeds earlier... we go deeper, DOWN, DOWN, WAY DOWN, until we 
           see something... something green... 

           Something that looks a lot like hope. 

           THE END
