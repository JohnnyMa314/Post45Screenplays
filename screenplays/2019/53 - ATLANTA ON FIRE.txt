           FADE IN:

           INT. NATIONAL PENCIL FACTORY - ATLANTA 1913 - NIGHT

           It’s dark. It’s dirty. NEWT LEE, a mid-50s, black, night 
           watchman makes his way down a WOODEN LADDER one rung at a 
           time -- a LANTERN in his hand providing the only light.

           He MISSES the last rung and SLIPS to the basement floor, 
           hurting his KNEE. Newt LIMPS to the “colored toilet” -- sets 
           the LANTERN on the floor as he take a piss.

           Finished, Newt PICKS UP the LANTERN -- TURNS back toward the 
           ladder when something catches his attention.

           A PILE OF RAGS in the corner of the room. To get a better 
           look, Newt RAISES the LANTERN. He approaches slowly. Newt’s 
           eyes grow big as he spots it: the BODY OF A DEAD WOMAN.

           EXT. NATIONAL PENCIL FACTORY - NIGHT

           A POLICE CAR comes to a stop outside the pencil factory. 
           SERGEANT R.J. BROWN, 49, a veteran officer, thorough to a 
           fault, and CALL OFFICER W.F. ANDERSON, 31, a nervous young 
           buck, step out of the car and approach Newt.

                                 R.J. BROWN
                        You Newt Lee?

                                 NEWT LEE
                        Yes, sir. I’m the night watchman. I 
                        was just taking a leak when I found 
                        her. She’s hurt real bad.

           Brown and Anderson follow Newt inside.

           INT. NATIONAL PENCIL FACTORY - LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

           It’s dark in here too. Brown and Anderson follow closely 
           behind Newt and his LANTERN. 

                                 NEWT LEE
                        I called the boss, Mr. Frank, but 
                        no one answered. I didn’t know what 
                        else to do.

           He guides the police toward a small SCUTTLE HOLE in the 
           floor.

                                 NEWT LEE (CONT’D)
                        She’s down there.
           Brown and Anderson PAUSE. It’s a LADDER into a PIT OF 
           DARKNESS.

                                 W.F. ANDERSON
                        Is that the only way?

                                 NEWT LEE
                        There’s an elevator on the other 
                        side of the building, but 
                        electricity is turned off.
                             (off their nervous looks)
                        I’ll go first.

           Newt disappears into the hole with the LANTERN. Brown turns 
           to Anderson.  

                                 R.J. BROWN
                        After you.

           Terrified, Anderson follows Newt into the hole. Once he’s out 
           of sight, Brown does the same.

           INT. NATIONAL PENCIL FACTORY - BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Reunited, Newt points over to where he found the body.

                                 NEWT LEE
                        She’s over there. In the corner.

           He hands Brown the LANTERN. Brown and Anderson make their way 
           over, their feet CRUNCHING something on the ground. 

                                 R.J. BROWN
                        What’s this shit on the floor?

                                 NEWT LEE
                        We a pencil company, sir. They 
                        shavings. Careful you don’t step on 
                        her. She comes out of nowhere.

                                 R.J. BROWN
                        I’m not going to--

           But then his foot HITS something. Brown and Anderson look 
           down at the BUNDLE on the floor. Brown hands the LANTERN to 
           Anderson -- BENDS DOWN to examine the woman -- sees her size. 
           So small.

                                 R.J. BROWN (CONT’D)
                        This is nothing but a child.

           The body lays on its side, facing away from Brown. He ROLLS 
           her onto her back to get a look at her. Brown GASPS.
           It’s a young, BLACK GIRL no more than 13. She has a GASH on 
           her forehead, a NOOSE made of WRAPPING CORD around her neck, 
           and BLOOD DRIPPING from her nose and ears. 

                                 R.J. BROWN (CONT’D)
                             (re: Newt Lee)
                        Keep an eye on him.

                                 W.F. ANDERSON
                        You think an old timer like him 
                        killed a girl just to get us down 
                        here and have a go at police?

           Tenderly, Brown TOUCHES the girl’s DAMAGED FACE. When he 
           pulls back, there’s a WHITE SMUDGE where he touched her. He 
           looks at his fingers. They’re covered in SOOT.

                                 W.F. ANDERSON (CONT’D)
                        What is it?

           Brown LIFTS the girl’s skirt. That’s when he sees it: white 
           skin, TORN underwear, and BLOOD around her vagina.

                                 R.J. BROWN
                        My god...

           Anderson moves closer, revealing a PIECE OF PAPER next to the 
           body -- a LEAD PENCIL is near the girl’s hand. 

           The paper reads: Mam that negro hire down here did this I 
           went to make water and he push me down that hole he did this 
           by his self I wright this while he play with me

           Brown DRAWS his gun -- WHIPS around, AIMING it at Newt.

                                 R.J. BROWN (CONT’D)
                        Don’t move!

           INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT

           BRITT CRAIG, 19, drunk off his ass, sits in the back as 
           CAPTAIN L.S. DOBBS, 49, drives. OFFICER BOOTS ROGERS, 34, 
           sits in the passenger seat. Britt HICCUPS.

                                 BRITT CRAIG
                        Sure is nice of you fellas to give 
                        me a ride home.

                                 DOBBS
                        Didn’t have much choice when you 
                        passed out in the back of my car. 
                        We have to make a quick stop, then 
                        we’ll drop you.
                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Where are we headed?

                                 DOBBS
                        The Pencil Factory. A young girl’s 
                        been murdered. 

           Boots Rogers gets quiet, but Britt Craig lights up. 

                                 BRITT CRAIG
                        You do know I work for the Atlanta 
                        Constitution.

                                 DOBBS
                        And if one word of this ends up in 
                        print, I’ll knock your block off.

                                 BRITT CRAIG
                        Hey, hey! I was just making you 
                        aware that you are chauffeuring a 
                        member of the press to an active 
                        crime scene. By the way, do you 
                        have a pencil I can borrow?
                             (off Dobbs’ look)
                        No matter. They’ll have plenty at 
                        the factory.

           Dobbs notices Boots silence.

                                 DOBBS
                        What’s eating you?

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        My sister-in-law works at that 
                        factory.

           EXT. NATIONAL PENCIL FACTORY - NIGHT

           Newt Lee, now handcuffed, gets SHOVED into the back of a 
           paddy-wagon by Brown when the police car arrives carrying 
           Dobbs, Boots, and Britt Craig. 

           Boots Rogers LEAPS out and rushes to Newt.

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Is it Grace?!?

                                 R.J. BROWN
                        Calm down--

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        -Is it Grace!?!
                                 R.J. BROWN
                        No. It’s not her. 

           Boots takes a deep breath as Dobbs joins them. Britt Craig 
           LINGERS in the shadows, taking notes on what the men say.

                                 DOBBS
                             (re: Newt)
                        Is he our guy?

                                 R.J. BROWN
                        Think so. He found the body and 
                        there’s a note next the victim 
                        saying the negro hire did it.

                                 DOBBS
                        How the hell did she have time to 
                        write a goddamned note?

                                 R.J. BROWN
                        It says... she says she was writing 
                        it as he was raping her.

           That silences the men.

           Anderson sticks his head out of the factory.

                                 W.F. ANDERSON
                        Captain? Sergeant? You need to come 
                        see this.

           INT. NATIONAL PENCIL FACTORY - BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Brown, Dobbs, and Boots Rogers are guided by Anderson. Britt 
           Craig keeps his distance, still taking notes.

                                 W.F. ANDERSON
                        Still can’t get a hold of the 
                        superintendant, but I called the 
                        mortuary to come pick up the body 
                        like you said and they asked if 
                        there was an easy way to move her. 
                        I noticed there’s a back door here 
                        that leads to an alley. That’s when 
                        I saw this.

           He shows them the door. It’s been BROKEN. Anderson holds up 
           the LANTERN -- REVEALING BLOOD on the ground and on the DOOR 
           HANDLE. There are DROPS of BLOOD leading outside.

                                 W.F. ANDERSON (CONT’D)
                        Newt Lee isn’t our guy.
                                 DOBBS
                        What the hell? Between the note and 
                        him finding the body, we’ve got 
                        that Negro cold. We’ll have him 
                        shot by morning.

                                 R.J. BROWN
                        You can hold off on the firing 
                        squad. Anderson’s right. Whoever 
                        killed that girl needed a way out. 
                        He’s covered in blood and couldn’t 
                        go upstairs because Newt Lee was on 
                        night watch. So he broke this door 
                        and escaped into the alley.

                                 W.F. ANDERSON
                        There’s also some shit in the 
                        shaft.
                             (off their looks)
                        In the elevator shaft.

           Anderson guides them over to the opposite end of the 
           basement. The elevator is two floors up, but there’s a fresh 
           PILE OF SHIT on the basement floor. 

                                 W.F. ANDERSON (CONT’D)
                        Newt said he came down here to take 
                        a leak when he found the body. 

                                 DOBBS
                        So?

                                 W.F. ANDERSON
                        So why lie? Why not just say he 
                        came down here to take a shit?

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        People lie all the time.

                                 R.J. BROWN
                        The man’s sixty and docile as they 
                        come. That shit’s a defiant act.

                                 DOBBS
                        Come on.

                                 R.J. BROWN
                        There’s a colored toilet right 
                        there. What else do you wanna call 
                        it?

           Dobbs thinks on that a minute.
                                 DOBBS
                        I still think the Negro did it.

                                 R.J. BROWN
                        Why?

                                 DOBBS
                        Gut feeling. He stays under arrest 
                        for now. I’ll question him down at 
                        the station myself.

           Annoyed, Brown turns his attention to Anderson. Without them 
           noticing, Britt Craig silently SCURRIES up the ladder.

                                 R.J. BROWN
                        You said you still can’t get a hold 
                        of the superintendant?

                                 W.F. ANDERSON
                        Mr. Frank? No. I’ve called twice, 
                        but there’s no answer.

                                 R.J. BROWN
                             (TURNS to Boots Rogers)
                        Any chance you can get Grace to 
                        meet you at the mortuary and ID the 
                        girl? I’d like to notify the family 
                        before the press gets wind of this.

           He looks around. Britt Craig is nowhere to be found.

           Britt Craig SITS at his desk  -- FEEDS paper into a 
           TYPEWRITER. A NIGHT WATCHMAN spots him.

                                 NIGHT WATCHMAN

                        Wake up Mr. Ross. A young girl was 
                        raped and murdered at the Pencil 
                        Factory. Someone’s going to swing 
                        for this.

           With the body gone, Brown and Anderson search for clues. 
           Brown finds a BLUE STRAW HAT in the trash and a GIRL’S SHOE 
           near where the body was found.

           Anderson locates a BLOODY PIPE near the broken WOODEN DOOR.

           INT. ATLANTA CONSTITUTION - NIGHT

           MARVIN ROSS, reads over the copy that Britt’s just given him. 
           He RAISES an eyebrow.  

                                 MARVIN ROSS
                        All this true?

           INT. NATIONAL PENCIL FACTORY - METAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Brown and Anderson enter the dingy factory work room.

                                 ANDERSON
                        This is where she worked?

                                 BROWN
                        Yeah.

           They look around. Anderson finds some strands of BLONDE HAIR. 
           Near the door, Brown spots something - SQUATS DOWN.

                                 BROWN (CONT’D)
                        We got blood.

           INT. BLOOMFIELD’S FUNERAL HOME - DAWN

           P.J. BLOOMFIELD, 65, LIFTS a sheet to REVEAL the DEAD GIRL’S 
           BODY to GRACE HICKS, 16, who’s nervous and scared. She takes 
           one look and hides her face in Boots Rogers’ chest.

                                 GRACE HICKS
                        That’s Mary Phagan. She works next 
                        to me at the factory.

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Do you know where she lives?
                                 GRACE HICKS
                        Over on Lindsay Street with her 
                        Mama and step-daddy. Who... who 
                        could do something like that???

           Boots Rogers comforts her -- NODS to Dobbs, who lights a 
           cigarette in the corner.

           INT. ATLANTA CONSTITUTION - DAWN

           The PRESSES work overtime, CHURNING out the morning edition 
           with the notice about the young girl’s death at the factory. 

           WORKERS hand STACKS of PAPERS to NEWSIES who RUSH out on 
           bicycles to deliver the shocking news.

           INT. JOHN & FANNIE COLEMAN’S HOME - MORNING

           FANNIE COLEMAN, 32, sits at a kitchen table in her low income 
           home -- tears STREAMING down her face. 

           The DOORBELL RINGS. Her husband, JOHN, 38, exhausted from 
           being up all night, answers the door to find Dobbs.  

                                 DOBBS
                        Sorry to bother you folks. I’m 
                        Captain Dobbs. Is this the 
                        residence of Mary Phagan?

                                 FANNIE
                             (goes to him; distraught)
                        I’m her mother. Have you found her? 
                        She’s been missing since yesterday. 
                        We’ve been searching all night.

                                 DOBBS
                        Yes, ma’am. We found her.

           The looks on Dobbs’ face crushes them. Fannie GRABS a copy of 
           the morning edition and THRUSTS it at him.

                                 FANNIE
                        Is this... is this what happened to 
                        my baby girl?

           Dobbs looks at the paper. It’s Britt Craig’s article. It 
           doesn’t name Mary, but the gruesome details are all there.

                                 FANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Funny how a little girl’s murder 
                        makes the papers before the parents 
                        even know.
                                 DOBBS
                        That was a mistake.

                                 FANNIE
                        A mistake is forgetting to bring 
                        the milk in. What kind of police 
                        are you?

                                 DOBBS
                        I promise you, Mrs. Phagan--

                                 FANNIE
                        -It’s Mrs. Coleman. Mr. Phagan’s 
                        been dead for some time. Like my 
                        daughter it would seem.

                                 DOBBS
                        Mrs. Coleman, I promise you, we 
                        will find the man who did this, but 
                        I need your help.
                             (re: SLIP of paper)
                        Is this your daughter’s 
                        handwriting?

           Fannie takes the paper -- her heart BREAKING as she reads it.

                                 FANNIE
                        Where did you find this?

                                 DOBBS
                        It was... near the body.

                                 FANNIE
                        Mary had perfect grammar and 
                        penmanship. She didn’t write that. 

           Now Fannie SLAMS the door. Dobbs looks down at the SLIP OF 
           PAPER. If little Mary Phagan didn’t write it, who did?

           INT. LEO FRANK’S HOME - MORNING

           An upper-middle class, tidy home. The DOORBELL RINGS. LUCILLE 
           FRANK, 25, pretty, demure, answers the door wearing a blue 
           housecoat. Boots Rogers GREETS her.

                                 LUCILLE
                        Yes?

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Mrs. Frank? I’m Detective Rogers. 
                        I’m looking for your husband and 
                        have been having a little trouble 
                        locating him. Is he home?
                                 LUCILLE
                        Oh, yes. Please, come in. He’s 
                        upstairs. I’ll be just a minute.

           Boots Rogers enters. Lucille CLOSES and LOCKS the door. She 
           hurries upstairs, a little nervous. Boots can hear a bit of 
           their muted conversation.

                                 LUCILLE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Leo, there’s a detective here to 
                        see you.

                                 LEO (O.S.)
                        A detective? What’s his name? Did 
                        he say what he wanted? Did 
                        something happen?

                                 LUCILLE (O.S.)
                        I don’t know. Should I serve some 
                        coffee?

                                 LEO (O.S.)
                        Yes. With cream and sugar. Do we 
                        have any biscuits? 

                                 LUCILLE (O.S.)
                        I think so.

                                 LEO (O.S.)
                        Good. Serve those. I’ll be right 
                        down.

           Boots moves from the stairs, pretending to look at a WEDDING 
           PHOTOGRAPH as Lucille comes back down.

                                 LUCILLE
                        Leo’s just finishing getting 
                        dressed. He’ll be down in a minute. 

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                             (NODS)
                        Is something wrong with your phone?

                                 LUCILLE
                        What do you mean?

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Is it broken?

                                 LUCILLE
                        I don’t think so.
                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        It’s just that a number of people 
                        tried calling this morning and no 
                        one answered.

                                 LUCILLE
                        They did?

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        You didn’t hear the phone ring at 4 
                        in the morning? At 6?

                                 LUCILLE
                        I don’t think so. 

           Boots NODS again as Lucille WRINGS her hands. 

           LEO FRANK, 30, enters, putting on his CIRCULAR GLASSES. He’s 
           a sweet, slender, somewhat manic Jewish man dressed in an 
           UNDERSHIRT, SUSPENDERS, and SLACKS. A JEWISH STAR DANGLES 
           from his neck.

                                 LEO
                        Detective?

                                 BOOTS ROGERS

                        Yes, sir. Has something happened? 
                        Has there been a fire?

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        No, sir. Not a fire.

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Mr. Frank, we really should get

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Mr. Frank, we really don’t have 
                        time. We need you down at the

                        have you seen my shirt?
                             (to Boots Rogers)
                        I can’t find my collar and tie

                        may not happen to you, but it 
                        happens to me all the time. 
                        Luckily, I have Lucille. She’s the 
                        greatest. She can find just about 
                        anything even when I’ve misplaced 
                        it and then POOF there it is. I 
                        really am a lucky man. I’m telling

                        those biscuits!

           Something seems very, very off about Leo Frank. 

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Mr. Frank, something tragic has 
                        happened. You need to come with me. 
                        Now.

           His tone is far more stern than it was before. Leo gets the 
           gravity of the situation.

                                 LEO
                        Well, of course. I just need to

                        Everything all right, Mr. Frank?

                                 LEO
                        I’m fine. Of course I’m fine. I 
                        just don’t know what’s going on and 
                        then a detective is coming to my 
                        house and ordering me to go with 
                        him. A tragedy has happened and 
                        it’s not a fire, but I don’t know 
                        what’s going on.

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        And you’d like to?

                                 LEO
                        Yes, yes of course. I’m on pins and 
                        needles here and I don’t have the 
                        constitution for it.

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                             (a beat, then:)
                        A girl was found raped and murdered 
                        in the factory basement.

                                 LEO
                        A girl? What girl?

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Why don’t we wait ‘til we get you 
                        back to the factory before--

                                 LEO
                        -I just don’t understand. Why would 
                        someone want to do that to a child? 
                        Mary’s such a lovely girl.

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Excuse me?

                                 LEO
                        Mary Phagan. I hardly knew the 
                        girl, but she was a good worker and 
                        well liked. That I can assure you.

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        That’s all good and fine, Mr. 
                        Frank, but how did you know she was 
                        the victim?
                                 LEO
                        Logic, obviously.

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        It don’t make much sense to me. You 
                        mind explaining it?

                                 LEO
                             (huffs)
                        Well, usually we pay employees on 
                        Saturdays, but because of the 
                        Memorial Day parade, we were closed 
                        on Saturday and we paid everyone on 
                        Friday instead. Mary worked in the 
                        metal room, which is just across 
                        the hall from my office.

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Is that so?

                                 LEO
                        That’s irrelevant. A shipment of 
                        metal hadn’t arrived, so Mary 
                        hadn’t been able to work this week 
                        and wasn’t aware her pay was 
                        available earlier than normal.

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Yeah, so?

                                 LEO
                        So she came by on Saturday to pick 
                        up her pay. I gave her her envelope 
                        and she went on her way.

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        How does that make her the dead 
                        girl in the factory?

                                 LEO
                        Isn’t it obvious?

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Again, no.

                                 LEO
                             (huffing again)
                        I was the only one in the building. 
                        Except for Newt Lee, the night 
                        watchman. So if a girl was found in 
                        the building, it was most likely 
                        little Mary, because we aren’t in 
                        the habit of letting employees in 
                        on days we are closed.
                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        But Mary was let in.

                                 LEO
                        Clearly, you’re not following.

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Oh, I’m following just fine.

                                 LEO
                        She needed her pay. That was a 
                        special circumstance.

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        So, what you’re saying is: if she 
                        was let in due to this “special 
                        circumstance” chances are no one 
                        else was let in.

                                 LEO
                        Yes!

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        And if no one else was let in, it’s 
                        reasonable to think that no one was 
                        let out.

                                 LEO
                        That’s exactly what I’m saying.

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        And the only two people in the 
                        building were you and the night 
                        watchman, Newt Lee?

                                 LEO
                        Yes! Finally you’re starting to get 
                        it! I was honestly beginning to 
                        worry about you, Detective. It was 
                        like you couldn’t figure anything 
                        out for yourself.

           Boots Rogers eyes Leo suspiciously as he makes a turn.

                                 LEO (CONT’D)
                        This isn’t the way to the factory, 
                        Detective.

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Change of plans.

                                 LEO
                        Well, then. Where are we going?
                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        The mortuary.

           Leo swallows hard.

           INT. BLOOMFIELD’S FUNERAL HOME - MORNING

           A small crowd has gathered in the funeral home as a MEDICAL 
           EXAMINER gets to work on Mary Phagan. Brown spots Boots 
           Rogers enter with Leo. Brown goes to them.

                                 R.J. BROWN
                        Who’s this?

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Sgt. Brown, this Leo Frank. 
                        Superintendant down at the factory.

                                 LEO
                        I’m still not sure what I’m doing 
                        here.

                                 R.J. BROWN
                        Neither am I.

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Still need an official ID on the 
                        victim. Thought Mr. Frank here 
                        could help us out with that.

           Brown’s eyes dart between Boots and Leo.

                                 R.J. BROWN
                        You got a minute?

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Sure.
                             (to Leo)
                        Don’t go nowhere.

           He WINKS at Leo as Brown pulls him off to the side.

                                 R.J. BROWN
                        You know damn well we already got 
                        an ID. What’s all this about?

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        I don’t like him. He’s been fishy 
                        the whole time I’ve been with him.

                                 R.J. BROWN
                        Fishy how?
                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Like he’s acting all nervous and he 
                        knew who it was who died before I 
                        even had the chance to tell him.

                                 R.J. BROWN
                        Maybe someone else told him.

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        No. No one’s been able to get a 
                        hold of him. He thought I was 
                        coming round about a fire.

                                 R.J. BROWN
                        Then take him down to the goddamned 
                        station. Why bring him here?

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        I wanted to get a look at his face 
                        when he saw Mary Phagan’s body.

           They both turn to look at Leo Frank. He’s standing in the 
           doorway, watching as the MEDICAL EXAMINER measures the GASH 
           ON MARY’S NECK. Tears FILL his eyes. Leo looks away. Boots 
           Rogers turns to Brown as if that’s proof of guilt.

           INT. POLICE CAR - DAY

           Leo’s in the backseat now. Brown is at the wheel with Boots 
           Rogers in the passenger seat.

                                 LEO
                        Where are we going now?

           Neither of the men say a word.

           INT. ATLANTA POLICE STATION - BULLPEN - DAY

           Leo waits in an interrogation room, fidgeting. Boots Rogers 
           WATCHES him through the glass window. Brown joins him.

                                 R.J. BROWN
                        Just because he wouldn’t look at 
                        the body, don’t mean he did it.

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        You didn’t see him before. He’s 
                        hiding something.

                                 R.J. BROWN
                        How was his wife?
                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Meek as a mouse. 

                                 R.J. BROWN
                        But she backed up his story?

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        About him being home and not 
                        hearing the phone ring in the 
                        middle of the night? Yeah, she was 
                        real convincing.  

           Captain Dobbs joins the men.

                                 DOBBS
                        We got another one?

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Leo Frank. He’s the superintendant 
                        at the factory. Went over to break 
                        the news and the guy is nervous 
                        like he done somethin’. He knew who 
                        died before I even told him.

                                 DOBBS
                        Yeah?

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        He had some crazy story about her 
                        coming to collect her pay when the 
                        building was supposed to be closed.

                                 DOBBS
                        This was yesterday?

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Yeah.

                                 DOBBS
                        And the only two people there are 
                        this guy and the night watchman? 

                                 R.J. BROWN
                        We don’t know that for sure yet, 
                        but that’s what it looks like.

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Take your pick, Captain. The nigger 
                        or the kike?

           Dobbs STARES into the interrogation room where Leo continues 
           to fidget. He holds up the LETTER from the factory floor.
                                 DOBBS
                        Mary Phagan didn’t write this. Her 
                        mother said she had perfect 
                        grammar. Perfect penmanship. The 
                        superintendant of a pencil factory 
                        would also have perfect grammar and 
                        perfect penmanship.

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Unless he was trying to cast 
                        suspicion on someone else.

                        Jesus, you really have it in for 
                        this guy. We don’t know anything 
                        yet. Captain, let me take a run at 
                        them. It’s my case. I’ll get one of 
                        them to break and then we can put 
                        this to bed. Give that little 
                        girl’s family some peace.

                                 DOBBS
                        Is Newt Lee still here?

                                 R.J. BROWN
                        Yeah. Why?

           Dobbs thinks for a moment.

                                 DOBBS
                        I have a better idea.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 

           Leo LOOKS UP as Boots Rogers HAULS Newt Lee in. He SHOVES him 
           down in a chair across from Leo.

                                 LEO
                        Excuse me? When can I go home?

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        When I fucking say so.

           Boots Rogers SLAMS the door shut -- LOCKS it.

                                 LEO
                        Looks like we’re in a bit of 
                        trouble, aren’t we, Newt?

           INT. ATLANTA POLICE STATION - SAME

           Brown, Alexander, and Boots Rogers wait with Captain Dobbs.
                                 R.J. BROWN
                        O.K. Now what?

                                 DOBBS
                        Now we wait.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - SAME

           Leo CLEARS his throat as he addresses Newt.

                                 LEO
                        Are they treating you alright?

                                 NEWT LEE
                        Yes, sir.

                                 LEO
                        You can tell me if they’re not. I 
                        can have a word with them.

                                 NEWT LEE
                        No, Mr. Frank. They’ve been decent.

                                 LEO
                        Good. They’ve been decent to me, 
                        too. Well, mostly. It’s 
                        inconvenient more than anything 
                        else. The idea that I had something 
                        to do with little Mary Phagan’s 
                        murder is, well, it’s ridiculous is 
                        what it is. I could never hurt a 
                        child. I love children.

                                 NEWT LEE
                        I know, Mr. Frank. I know.

           INT. ATLANTA POLICE STATION

           The men watch Leo and Newt with great interest.

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Is he coaching him? Is that what 
                        he’s doing?

                        Quiet.

           Leo continues to babble...
                                 LEO
                        Now I know I didn’t do it. There’s 
                        no question about that. I left the 
                        factory around 6:30 and arrived 
                        home just before 7 and had a lovely 
                        meal with my wife, Lucille. You 
                        haven’t met her, but I’m sure you’d 
                        like her.

                                 NEWT LEE
                        I’m sure I would, sir.

                                 LEO
                        Of course you would. Everyone does. 
                        She made the best brisket last 
                        night. It was delicious. Then we 
                        sat in the drawing room and 
                        listened to the radio for a bit. 
                        Well, she listened, I read, before 
                        we went upstairs to bed.

                                 NEWT LEE
                        Sounds like a lovely evening, sir.

                                 LEO
                        It was. So you can see, I couldn’t 
                        possibly have done what they’re 
                        thinking I maybe did, because I was 
                        at home with my wife having a 
                        lovely meal, followed by radio, 
                        reading and bed.

                                 NEWT LEE
                        I see that, sir.

                                 LEO
                        You were at the factory all night?

                                 NEWT LEE
                        I was, sir.

                                 LEO
                        And you didn’t let anyone in? It’s 
                        okay if you did. I know it’s 
                        against procedure, but this is 
                        important, Newt. I promise you 
                        won’t get into any trouble if you 
                        let someone in. If you did, we’ll 
                        just forget all about that. But 
                        you’ll have to tell those policemen 
                        exactly who you let in -- tell them 
                        what you saw. You hear me, Newt?
                                 NEWT LEE
                        Mr. Frank, I didn’t let nobody in. 
                        I just kept the watch. Then I went 
                        to take a leak and there she was.

                                 LEO
                        Mary. They had the audacity to show 
                        me her body at the funeral home. 
                        What purpose does that serve? She 
                        was mutilated, strangled, raped. 
                        The poor thing. Any man who did 
                        that would be covered in blood. Am 
                        I covered in blood?

                                 NEWT LEE
                        No, sir.

                                 LEO
                        Not a drop on me. And let me tell 
                        you, I saw that body. Her killer 
                        wouldn’t just have blood on him. 
                        He’d have marks on him. Do you see 
                        marks on me?

                                 NEWT LEE
                        No, sir.

                                 LEO
                        But you can’t really see, can you? 

           Leo starts to STRIP OFF his clothes.

                                 LEO
                        That’s right. There’s nothing 
                        because nothing happened. 
           He starts putting his clothes back on.

                        Why’s that, sir?

           Leo sits down, fully dressed.

                                 LEO

                        That was excellent police work, 
                        Captain. You just gave them the 
                        opportunity to get their stories 
                        straight.

                                 DOBBS
                        I was trying to get a confession.

                        giving up anything now.
                             (to Boots Rogers)
                        And I think you’re right about Leo 
                        Frank. He acts mighty strange.

                                 W.F. ANDERSON
                        He’s nervous. He ain’t even from 
                        the South. Yanks talk different, is 
                        all.

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Yeah, they sure as shit talk 
                        different after they rape and kill 
                        little girls.

           The PHONE RINGS. Anderson ANSWERS it.
                                 DOBBS
                        Everyone calm down. One of the two 
                        of them knows something. Maybe they 
                        did it together, maybe they didn’t. 
                        But my gut tells me that the man 
                        that killed Mary Phagan is sitting 
                        there in that room.

           Anderson CALLS OUT to them.

                        Hey, Captain. Your gut’s gonna have 
                        to hold on a spell.

                                 DOBBS

                        His name is Jim Conley. And he 
                        works at the National Pencil 
                        Factory.

           EXT. JIM CONLEY’S HOUSE - EVENING

           A rundown, DILAPIDATED structure. The POLICE pull up -- 
           FLANKING either side of the house. They wait in SILENCE with 
           only the sound of a RADIO coming from the house.

           Shotguns ready, Dobbs CALLS OUT.

                                 DOBBS
                        Jim Conley. This is the Atlanta 
                        Police Department. We wanna have a 
                        word with you. Come on outta there.
                             (no response)
                        Don’t make this hard on yourself. 
                        All we wanna do is talk. Jim???

           Still no response... until the RADIO gets TURNED OFF. Now 
           it’s deathly quiet. The POLICE look from one to another.

           Only one thing to do...

           Dobbs NODS to Boots Rogers who KICKS the door in. Brown, 
           Anderson, Dobbs, and Boots Rogers RUSH INSIDE...
           JIM CONLEY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           It’s an even BIGGER MESS inside. No sign of Jim Conley. 

           Step by step, the police make their way through the house, 
           careful to MANEUVER through doorways.

           Anderson STICKS his head in a bedroom. Not much there, but an 
           OLD MATTRESS on the ground. Anderson takes a step inside. 
           Nowhere to hide. He TURNS to face a CLOSET with a door that’s 
           SLIGHTLY AJAR.  

                                 DOBBS (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Where’d the fuck he go? You got 
                        anything?

                                 BOOTS ROGERS (O.S.)
                        No. Sergeant?

                                 R.J. BROWN (O.S.)
                        Negative. Anderson?

           As Anderson moves closer to the closet. He can see a WIRE 
           HANGER SWINGING on the rod.

                                 W.F. ANDERSON
                        Nothing here.

           He RAISES his SHOTGUN -- takes another STEP when JIM CONLEY, 
           27, handsome, charming, chiseled, BURSTS out of the closet, 
           TACKLING Anderson around the waist. 

           A SHOTGUN GOES OFF...

           Jim STRUGGLES against Anderson. He KICKS the SHOTGUN away and 
           RACES out the door only to come face to face with Boots 
           Rogers and a SHOTGUN leveled at his head.

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Don’t you fucking move.
                             (to Anderson)
                        You alright?

                                 W.F. ANDERSON
                        Yeah. I think so.

           Boots Rogers turns his attention back to Jim Conley.

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        On your knees. Now.

           Jim OBEYS.
           INT. JIM CONLEY’S HOUSE - LATER

           Boots Rogers and DOBBS USHER Jim outside. Brown SPOTS some 
           HANDWRITTEN NOTES when Anderson comes in with a BLOODY SHIRT.

                                 W.F. ANDERSON
                        I found this in a barrel outside. 
                        You got anything?

                                 R.J. BROWN
                        Not much. We better get moving.

           He GRABS the notes.

           INT. ATLANTA POLICE STATION - HOLDING CELL - NIGHT

           Leo SITS calmly with his head against the wall when the door 
           OPENS. Brown stands there.

                                 R.J. BROWN
                        Mr. Frank?

           INT. ATLANTA POLICE STATION - NIGHT

           Brown walks Leo out.

                                 LEO
                        I’m glad you got this sorted out, 
                        Detective. This situation has been 
                        highly disagreeable.

                                 R.J. BROWN
                        So you’ve said. We may have some 
                        more questions. Do us a favor and 
                        don’t leave the state.

                                 LEO
                        Now why would I do that?

                                 R.J. BROWN
                        Just stay local.

                                 LEO
                        May I ask, who have you taken into 
                        custody?

                                 R.J. BROWN
                        I can’t reveal that information, 
                        sir. Protocol.

                                 LEO
                        That’s odd.
                                 R.J. BROWN
                        How so?

                                 LEO
                        You locked me in a room with 
                        another suspect hoping to gain 
                        vital information and when you 
                        failed to do so, you ran out and 
                        found a better suspect whose arrest 
                        is allowing me to go free, but you 
                        won’t divulge his name because of 
                        protocol?

                                 R.J. BROWN
                             (HUFFS)
                        It’s been a pleasure, Mr. Frank.

           Before Leo can leave. Boots Rogers HAULS IN Jim Conley. Jim 
           BRIGHTENS upon seeing Leo.

                                 JIM CONLEY
                        Mr. Frank, you gotta tell them I 
                        didn’t do this. 

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Keep moving.

                                 JIM CONLEY
                        You gotta tell them! Please!

           Boots Rogers HITS Jim over the head with a BATON -- SHOVING 
           him into an interrogation room.

                                 R.J. BROWN
                        Do you know that man?

                                 LEO
                        I can’t reveal that information, 
                        Detective. Protocol. 

           Leo TURNS on his heels and walks out. Brown SHAKES his head 
           and follows after Boots Rogers and Jim Conley.

           INT. LEO FRANK’S HOME - NIGHT

           Leo enters to find a panicked Lucille waiting for him. She 
           THROWS her arms around him -- CRYING.

                                 LUCILLE
                        Leo!

                                 LEO
                        Shhh. Everything’s alright.  
                                 LUCILLE
                        I was so scared.

                                 LEO
                        I was too, but they caught the man 
                        who did this. 

                                 LUCILLE
                        They did?

                                 LEO
                        Yes. It’s over now. You can’t get 
                        rid of me that easily.

           He WIPES her tears away.

                                 LUCILLE
                        O.K. Are you hungry? I can fix you 
                        something.

           Leo NODS. With arms around each other, Leo and Lucille head 
           into the kitchen together.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

           WHITE FISTS PUMMEL BLACK SKIN. Boots Rogers is doing the 
           damage while Jim takes the beating. Brown STANDS in the 
           corner, SMOKING a cigarette.

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        You like raping little white girls? 
                        Is that what you like?

                                 JIM CONLEY
                        No! No, sir!

           Another KICK.

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        She was just too pretty, wasn’t 
                        she? You had to have her.

                                 JIM CONLEY
                        I didn’t. I’ve never seen her.

           Another PUNCH -- Jim SPITS blood, looks to Brown.

                                 JIM CONLEY (CONT’D)
                        You gonna just stand there?

                                 R.J. BROWN
                        Tell the man what he wants to know.
                                 JIM CONLEY
                        I already told you. I didn’t do it!

           Boots Rogers PULLS him close.

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        I don’t believe you.

           Boots Rogers SPITS in Jim’s face. He continues his relentless 
           BEATING -- FIST over FIST. Blood SPRAYS. Jim SCREAMS.

                                 JIM CONLEY
                        It wasn’t me. It wasn’t me. I only 
                        helped...

           The BEATING STOPS.

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        The fuck did you just say?

                                 JIM CONLEY
                        I helped him move the body, that’s 
                        all. I swear, I didn’t kill her.

                                 R.J. BROWN
                        Who??? Who did you help?

                                 JIM CONLEY
                        My boss. Mr. Frank.

           INT. LEO FRANK’S HOME - BEDROOM - MORNING

           Leo and Lucille, WARM in their bed, wake in the early morning 
           light. Leo KISSES his wife before getting out of bed.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - MORNING

           Jim Conley tells his story.

                                 JIM CONLEY
                        He’s a dangerous man -- that Mr. 
                        Frank. He don’t look like it, but 
                        he is. I’m not perfect, but I ain’t 
                        never done things like him. I’ve 
                        been working at that factory for 
                        two years and Mr. Frank, well, he 
                        made me a lookout for him. 

           INT. LEO FRANK’S HOME - BATHROOM - SAME

           Leo LATHERS his face -- uses a RAZOR to SHAVE the CREAM away.
                                 JIM CONLEY (V.O.)
                        He’d call them girls into his 
                        office and I’d stand outside until 
                        he was done doing whatever he was 
                        doing with them in there. He told 
                        me once that he wasn’t built like 
                        other men. He had urges. 

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - SAME

           Jim Conley continues on.

                                 JIM CONLEY
                        I peaked my head in his office once 
                        and I saw he had one of them girls 
                        laid out on the desk, legs spread 
                        wide open. And there was Mr. Frank, 
                        kneeling right between them. I 
                        never knew a man who preferred 
                        young girls like that. 

           INT. LEO FRANK’S HOME - KITCHEN - SAME

           Leo READS the morning PAPER. There’s a $1000 reward for any 
           information leading to the conviction of Mary’s killer. 

                                 JIM CONLEY (V.O.)
                        On Saturday, he came to find me 
                        while I was sweeping. Said 
                        something went wrong. That’s when 
                        he showed me the body in his 
                        office...

           Lucille SERVES Leo his breakfast -- REFILLS his coffee.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - SAME

           Boots Rogers and Brown can’t believe what they’re hearing.

                                 JIM CONLEY
                        I guess that girl started making 
                        noise, you know, fighting him off 
                        and he had to quiet her. He sure 
                        did a good job. 

           INT. NATIONAL PENCIL FACTORY - SAME

           It’s back to business as usual. Leo -- looking as dapper as 
           ever -- sweeps in without a care in the world. He NODS to the 
           FACTORY WORKERS.
                                 JIM CONLEY (V.O.)
                        Once everyone was gone, I helped 
                        Mr. Frank move the body into the 
                        elevator. We took her to the 
                        basement and then he asked me to 
                        write a note. I asked why. 

           He goes upstairs to his office.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - SAME

           Jim’s wrapping it up now -- bringing it home.

                                 JIM CONLEY
                        He told me he wanted the note to 
                        look like Mary wrote it and was 
                        pointing the finger at Newt since 
                        he was on watch that night.

           INT. NATIONAL PENCIL FACTORY - LEO’S OFFICE - SAME

           Leo puts down his briefcase -- HANGS his jacket. He sits at 
           his desk and gets to work without a care in the world.

                                 JIM CONLEY (V.O.)
                        I wish I could’ve stopped it, but 
                        like I said, Mr. Frank is a 
                        dangerous man. 

           INT. ATLANTA POLICE STATION - MORNING

           Brown and Boots Rogers exit the interrogation room just as 
           Dobbs comes in for the day.

                                 R.J. BROWN
                        Captain, we just got a full 
                        confession from Jim Conley.

                                 DOBBS
                        No, shit.

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        He says Leo Frank did it. That he 
                        only helped him move the body.

                                 DOBBS
                        And you believe him?

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        He’s got a pretty convincing story. 
                        Says Frank likes young girls. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BOOTS ROGERS (CONT'D)
                        This one just got out of hand.
                             (to R.J. Brown)
                        I told you that Jew was no good.

                                 R.J. BROWN
                        You really think a jury is gonna 
                        take the word of a black man who’s 
                        been in and out of jail his whole 
                        life over a white, upstanding 
                        member of the community?

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Upstanding??? Did you hear what 
                        Conley said? Frank is a danger to 
                        every girl in the city of Atlanta. 
                        We can’t just stand here and do 
                        nothing because you don’t like the 
                        skin color of the witness!

                                 R.J. BROWN
                        You calling me a racist? That’s 
                        rich, Boots. Real rich.

                                 DOBBS
                        Alright, that’s enough. Conley went 
                        on record? Full statement?

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Signed and sealed.

           Dobbs thinks on this a moment -- then:

                                 DOBBS
                        Arrest Leo Frank. Mary Phagan’s 
                        funeral is later today. Let’s go 
                        tell her mother we got the son of a 
                        bitch who did it.

           SPOTS Dobbs and Boots Rogers. He quickly JOINS them. 

                                 BRITT CRAIG
                        Captain! It’s a fine surprise to 
                        see you here this fine morning.

                                 DOBBS
                        It’s a surprise that you’re sober.

                                 BRITT CRAIG
                        A daughter of Atlanta is dead. Her 
                        story needs to be told.
                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        With your byline, no doubt.

                                 BRITT CRAIG
                        It’s a free country. Any update on 
                        the suspects, Captain?

                                 DOBBS
                        That’s none of your business.

                                 BRITT CRAIG
                        It’s the people’s business. This is 
                        the work of a mad man. All of 
                        Atlanta is terrified.

           Dobbs STOPS walking -- GETS in Britt Craig’s face.

                                 DOBBS
                        Because you’re tellin’ them to be 
                        afraid. And if you ever print a 
                        piece of police business without my 
                        say-so, I’ll pay you a special 
                        visit, off the record. 

           Britt Craig SWALLOWS hard. Dobbs and Boots Rogers head toward 
           the church. Boots Rogers SPOTS something.

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        I forgot somethin’. I’ll catch up 
                        with you inside.

                                 DOBBS
                        Leavin’ the dirty work to me?

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Something like that.

           Boots Rogers heads back to the car. Dobbs enters the church.

           INT. SECOND BAPTIST CHURCH - DAY

           MOURNERS have packed the church to say goodbye to the SMALL 
           COFFIN on the alter. Fannie and John are comforted by PASTOR 
           STEVENS, 36, who uses religion for his own personal benefit.

                                 PASTOR STEVENS
                        All of Georgia weeps for Mary, but 
                        she is with her Heavenly Father 
                        now. She knows no pain, only mercy.

           The words are of no comfort. Dobbs joins them.
                                 DOBBS
                        Mrs. Coleman? Can I have a moment?

                                 PASTOR STEVENS
                        Have you found the man who did this 
                        to our beloved Mary?

                                 DOBBS
                        I’d rather talk to Mrs. Coleman 
                        alone, Pastor.

           Dobbs isn’t budging. Neither is Pastor Stevens. Then:

                                 PASTOR STEVENS
                        Don’t be a stranger on Sundays, 
                        Captain. We’re good people here.  

           Pastor Stevens moves on. Dobbs takes a breath, not sure how 
           to deliver this news.

                                 DOBBS
                        Mrs. Coleman, I promised you we’d 
                        catch Mary’s killer. I’m here to 
                        tell you we’re arresting him.

                                 FANNIE
                        Today?

           Boots Rogers JOINS them.

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Within the hour we’ll have the son 
                        of a bitch.

                                 FANNIE
                        Who--who is it?

           That’s when GEORGE EPPS, 15, pops over. He’s an angry kid 
           with a tear streaked face.

                                 GEORGE
                        Mrs. Coleman...

           Fannie takes one look at his face and HUGS George. He SOBS in 
           the comfort of her arms.

                                 FANNIE
                        I know. I know...
                             (still holding him, to 
                              Dobbs/Boots Rogers)
                        Who did this to my baby?

           Dobbs and Boots Rogers exchange a glance. Do they really want 
           to say in front of a child? Then:
                                 DOBBS
                        Her boss. Leo Frank.

                                 FANNIE
                        The Jew?

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Yes, ma’am. He’s got a history. 

                                 FANNIE
                        I don’t understand.

                                 DOBBS
                        It seems Mr. Frank likes girls... 
                        young ones.

                                 GEORGE
                        She was afraid of him.

           That gets Dobbs and Boots Rogers’ attention.

                                 DOBBS
                        What did you say, son?

           George breaks out of Fannie’s embrace -- WIPES his eyes -- 
           his sadness giving way to rage.

                                 GEORGE
                        Mary hated him. He was always 
                        making passes at her!

                                 DOBBS
                        She told you this?

                                 GEORGE
                        Of course she did! Mary told me 
                        everything. That Jew wouldn’t leave 
                        her alone. Always staring at her, 
                        asking her to stay late, watching 
                        her change--

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        -This is very serious, son. You 
                        sure about all this--

           Boots Rogers tries to put his hand on George’s shoulder, but 
           George JERKS away.

                                 GEORGE
                        -You calling me a liar? I know a 
                        dirty kike when I see one.

                                 DOBBS
                        Calm down, kid--
                                 GEORGE
                        -Leo Frank strangled Mary on a 
                        shitty cellar floor. What are you 
                        doin’ talking to me?? Arrest him!!!

           George STORMS off. Everyone in the church heard what George 
           said. WHISPERS run rampant. Pastor Stevens takes to the 
           pulpit. He RAISES his hands. Everyone QUIETS.

                                 PASTOR STEVENS
                        Citizens of Atlanta. Let us pray. 
                        We pray to the Heavenly Father to 
                        not hold hatred in our hearts over 
                        the murder of little Mary... 

           EXT. NATIONAL PENCIL FACTORY - SAME

           SQUAD CARS SKID to a stop. A team of OFFICERS, led by Brown 
           and Anderson, RACE to the entrance with their GUNS DRAWN.

                                 PASTOR STEVENS (V.O.)
                        We pray for the detectives of the 
                        city of Atlanta...

           INT. NATIONAL PENCIL FACTORY - SAME

           The door gets KICKED open. FACTORY WORKERS FREEZE upon seeing 
           the POLICE FLOOD in. Brown and Anderson lead their team 
           through the maze of a factory.

                                 PASTOR STEVENS (V.O.)
                        We pray they bring the wretch who 
                        committed this act to justice and 
                        punish them to the fullest extent 
                        of the law... 

           Brown and Anderson make their way up the staircase. Brown 
           puts his FINGER TO HIS LIPS to silence a YOUNG WORKER as they 
           turn down a... 

           LONG HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           They keep close to the wall -- moving fast...

                                 PASTOR STEVENS (V.O.)
                        But even that would be too good for 
                        the imp of Satan who committed this 
                        crime...

           They reach Leo Frank’s office door. It’s closed. Brown looks 
           to Anderson -- HOLDS UP his hand. On 3. 1, 2, 3...
           Anderson KICKS the door open.

           INT. SECOND BAPTIST CHURCH - SAME

           Pastor Stevens continues his fiery sermon.

                                 PASTOR STEVENS
                        Oh God, I cannot see how even the 
                        devil himself could do such a 
                        thing. To one of us. To a child. To 
                        little Mary. This is the work of an 
                        outsider!

           INT. NATIONAL PENCIL FACTORY - SAME

           Leo’s in handcuffs, in disbelief, as he’s led downstairs -- 
           PARADED in front of his EMPLOYEES.

                                 PASTOR STEVENS (V.O.)
                        He is other. He is ruthless. He 
                        will come in clothes of the sheep. 
                        He will pretend to pay his bills 
                        before they’re due, tip his hat to 
                        you on Sunday, work hard to help 
                        his neighbors... 

           EXT. NATIONAL PENCIL FACTORY - SAME

           A CROWD has gathered to see Leo put in the back of the SQUAD 
           CAR. Leo’s in shock. He doesn’t resist.

                                 PASTOR STEVENS (V.O.)
                        This is all so he can get close, 
                        make you feel safe. That’s when he 
                        strikes. Like the snake in the 
                        Garden of Eden... 

           Brown and Anderson DRIVE Leo away.

           EXT. ATLANTA STREETS - SAME

           The SQUAD CAR carrying Leo SPEEDS through the streets, 
           gathering attention of the citizens of Atlanta. They begin to 
           follow after the SQUAD CAR.

                                 PASTOR STEVENS (V.O.)
                        We will find this imposter. We will 
                        root him out and string him up!
           EXT. ATLANTA POLICE STATION - DAY

           An ANGRY MOB has gathered. NEWS-BULBS FLASH as Brown and 
           Anderson HAUL Leo out of the SQUAD CAR and up the stairs. 
           Britt Craig is among them, taking careful notes. 

                                 PASTOR STEVENS (V.O.)
                        We will show the people of Atlanta 
                        that we will not tolerate these 
                        animals who seek to rape and 
                        pillage the most fragile among us! 
                        So says the scripture!!!

           Reporters SHOUT questions at Leo. Why did you kill Mary? Are 
           you a pedophile? How many other girls have you attacked?

           Leo turns to address them.

                                 LEO
                        I am not guilty. Such an atrocious 
                        crime has never entered my mind. I 
                        am a man of good character. I have 
                        a wife. I am a home-loving and God 
                        fearing man. It is useless to 
                        detain me.

           More NEWS-BULBS FLASH! Brown and Anderson PUSH Leo inside. 
           Britt Craig finishes his notes and RUNS OFF down the street.

           EXT. CEMETERY - AFTERNOON

           Everyone has gathered around the LITTLE WHITE COFFIN next to 
           an OPEN GRAVE. Fannie approaches with some flowers in her 
           hand -- EYES that hole in the ground.

                                 FANNIE
                        It’s too big a hole to put you in. 
                        It’s so big... you were so small...

           Fannie lays the FLOWERS on the coffin.

           INT. ATLANTA POLICE STATION - LEO’S CELL - AFTERNOON

           Leo sits in his cell, WRINGING his hands. Maybe for the first 
           time in his life, he doesn’t have the first clue what to do.

           INT. RESTAURANT - AFTERNOON

           It’s a fancy joint with LINEN TABLE CLOTHES and CRYSTAL WATER 
           GLASSES. NATHANIEL HARRIS, 57, a pompous old man, and HUGH 
           DORSEY, 41, handsome and ambitious, enjoy politics and food.
                                 NATHANIEL HARRIS
                        Your ambitions are too high.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        Said the man who was elected to 
                        Georgia’s House of Representatives 
                        when he was only 36. I’m a good 
                        five years behind you, Your Honor.

                                 NATHANIEL HARRIS
                        Not everyone can be me.
                             (Hugh LAUGHS)
                        You’re doing good work as the 
                        Solicitor General. Why the hell do 
                        you wanna go and give that up for 
                        the thankless task of being 
                        governor?

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        I’d like to be in the room where it 
                        happens.

                                 NATHANIEL HARRIS
                        Well, John Slaton isn’t going 
                        anywhere. He’s in his second term, 
                        everyone loves him, and he’s 
                        cleaning up the state. You don’t 
                        have the political capital to take 
                        him on.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        I might with an endorsement from 
                        the most respected judge this side 
                        of the Mississippi.

                                 NATHANIEL HARRIS
                        You do flatter me so. 
                             (a beat, then:)
                        Go on.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        Slaton is weak. He’s weak on crime, 
                        immigration. The factories in 
                        Atlanta are dangerous. Kids are 
                        working for peanuts when they’re 
                        getting paid at all--

                                 NATHANIEL HARRIS
                        -No one knows you, son. Slaton is a 
                        household name. How are you going 
                        to compete with that?

           That’s when FRANK HOOPER, 33, a torpedo of an assistant, 
           HURRIES over to their tables.
                                 FRANK HOOPER
                        Hugh, you got a minute?

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                             (annoyed)
                        Not unless Atlanta is on fire 
                        again.

                                 FRANK HOOPER
                        Captain Dobbs called. They just 
                        arrested Leo Frank for the murder 
                        of Mary Phagan.

           Nathaniel RAISES an eyebrow -- takes another bite of steak.

                                 NATHANIEL HARRIS
                        Lunch is on me.

           INT. STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL’S OFFICES - AFTERNOON

           Busy as a beehive. Hugh Dorsey weaves his way through the 
           chaos with Frank Hooper right on his heels.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        Does anybody have it yet?

                                 FRANK HOOPER
                        You kidding? Nobody wants it.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        What? Why not??

           A VOICE BOOMS over the noise of the office.

                                 THOMAS FELDER (O.S.)
                        Hugh?

           Hugh turns to see his boss, THOMAS FELDER, 65, standing in 
           the doorway to his office. Time to talk...

           INT. THOMAS FELDER’S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

           Thomas sits behind his desk. Hugh stays standing.

                                 THOMAS FELDER
                        You don’t want this one, Hugh. It’s 
                        a loser. A big one.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        A little girl is dead. That’s a big 
                        deal in my book.
                                 THOMAS FELDER
                        The eye-witness, Jim Conley, is 
                        black, confessed to helping Frank 
                        move the body. And he’s done time.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        How much?

                                 THOMAS FELDER
                        He’s spent more days as a guest of 
                        the State of Georgia than not. And 
                        Leo Frank is an upstanding member--

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        -Of the Jewish Community. Fuck.
                             (a beat, then:)
                        I don’t care. I want it.

                                 THOMAS FELDER
                        You sure?

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        Ain’t no such thing as a perfect 
                        witness. Jim Conley’s race isn’t on 
                        trial here and neither is Frank’s 
                        religion. This here is a murder 
                        trial. A young girl was savagely 
                        raped, beaten, and strangled. I’m 
                        not letting a murderer go free just 
                        because the witness doesn’t look 
                        like my Aunt Ester.   

                                 THOMAS FELDER
                        Sounds like you’ve already written 
                        your opening statement.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        I’m fairly sure I’m right about 
                        this.

                                 THOMAS FELDER
                        Either way, it’s your funeral.

           Hugh heads to the door -- turns back.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        Who’s Frank’s lawyer, anyway?

           INT. REUBEN ARNOLD’S HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           REUBEN ARNOLD, 44, equal parts handsome, charming, and smart, 
           MOANS as he fucks his wife, FRANCES, 35. She GRIPS his SWEATY 
           BODY to her as their CLIMAX builds...
                                 FRANCES
                        That’s my spot, that’s my spot...

           Reuben’s rhythm increases -- nearly POUNDING into her, but 
           Frances likes it. They cum together... LOUDLY. Reuben ROLLS 
           OFF her as their son CRIES from another room. 

           Frances LIGHTS a CIGARETTE -- SMIRKS at her husband.

                                 FRANCES (CONT’D)
                        It’s your fault he’s up, you know. 
                        You’re too loud.

                                 REUBEN
                        Yeah, like you’re some goddamned 
                        church mouse.
                             (PUFFS off her cigarette)
                        I got him.

           He HANDS her back her cig and goes off into the other room. 
           The phone RINGS. Frances takes another DRAG and answers.

                                 FRANCES
                             (into phone)
                        It’s a little late, so this better 
                        be good.

           As Frances listens, something SHIFTS in her face. Whatever 
           annoyance she was feeling is gone. She COVERS the receiver...

                                 FRANCES (CONT’D)
                        Reuben, Leo Frank is on the phone.

                                 REUBEN (O.S.)
                        Who?

                                 FRANCES
                             (sassy)
                        Oh just that man they arrested for 
                        murdering that girl down at the 
                        pencil factory.

           Reuben comes back into the room, still butt ass naked, unsure 
           he heard his wife correctly.

                                 FRANCES (CONT’D)
                        Should I tell him to call back?

           Reuben takes the phone from her. A beat, then:

                                 REUBEN
                             (into phone)
                        This is Reuben Arnold. 
           INT. ATLANTA POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Now dressed in a suit, Reuben is escorted to Leo’s cell by a 
           PRISON GUARD. He UNLOCKS the cell. Reuben EYES Leo -- scared, 
           tired, small...

                                 REUBEN
                        Mr. Frank?

           Leo looks up -- BLINKS away his tear filled eyes.

                                 LEO
                        Mr. Arnold, won’t you come in?

           Reuben enters...

           LEO’S CELL - CONTINUOUS

           The PRISON GUARD LOCKS him in -- walks off. Great. 

           Reuben turns back to Leo, who’s now on his feet. He OFFERS 
           his hand. Reuben SHAKES it without hesitation.

                                 LEO (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry to be meeting you under 
                        such unsavory circumstances. I 
                        can’t even offer you tea.

                                 REUBEN
                        I’m fine. Shall we?

           He GESTURES for Leo to sit on the bed. Reuben finds a chair -- 
           PULLS OUT a note pad and pencil to take notes.

                                 REUBEN (CONT’D)
                        Everyone treating you right?

                                 LEO
                        So far. They think I did this.

                                 REUBEN
                        Did you?

                                 LEO
                        How can you ask me that? You’re 
                        supposed to be my lawyer. Objective 
                        at the very least.

                                 REUBEN
                        That’s not how this works.
                                 LEO
                        I’m sorry for my naiveté, 
                        Counselor, but I’ve never been 
                        accused of murder before.

                                 REUBEN
                        Rape and murder. Mary Phagan was 
                        raped and murdered.

                                 LEO
                        Yes... Yes, I heard.

           A beat. Then:

                                 REUBEN
                        Look, Mr. Frank, I can’t represent 
                        you unless I have all the facts. I 
                        don’t like surprises. 

                                 LEO
                        You and me both.

                                 REUBEN
                        I just need the truth.

                                 LEO
                        No one cares about the truth. My 
                        being in this cell is proof enough 
                        of that.

                                 REUBEN
                        I’ve represented guilty people 
                        before. It won’t change the quality 
                        of my defense, if that’s what 
                        you’re worried about. 

                                 LEO
                        Why is that?

                                 REUBEN
                        Besides it being unethical, I 
                        believe that everyone is entitled 
                        to a robust defense.

                                 LEO
                        Even people who rape and murder 
                        little girls?

                                 REUBEN
                        Especially them.

                                 LEO
                        Oh? And why is that?
                                 REUBEN
                        It’s a crime that inflames the 
                        public. Without due process, 
                        there’s no telling what the people 
                        of Atlanta would do to you.

                                 LEO
                        So you’re the only thing standing 
                        between me and an angry mob? You 
                        think they want to lynch me?

                                 REUBEN
                        This is Atlanta. And you’re a 
                        Jewish man from the North accused 
                        of savagely murdering a child. Some 
                        people won’t care whether you did 
                        it or not. You’re not one of us. 
                        You’re one of them. People here 
                        have been suffering ever since the 
                        war and then the Yankees come 
                        galloping into town--

                                 LEO
                        -I did not--

                                 REUBEN
                        -You already won the war, Mr. 
                        Frank. And then you come down here 
                        with your fancy clothes, your fancy 
                        way of talkin’, and your fancy 
                        diploma. And I haven’t even gotten 
                        to the money yet. You make a good 
                        living, don’t you, Mr. Frank? 

                                 LEO
                        I’m comfortable.

                                 REUBEN
                        I’ll bet you are. 

                                 LEO
                        I don’t see what any of this has to 
                        do with whether or not I murdered 
                        Mary Phagan.

                                 REUBEN
                        Mr. Frank, it has everything to do 
                        with it. These people are going to 
                        hate your fucking guts before you 
                        ever step foot in that courtroom. 
                        So when I ask if you did it or not, 
                        I’m not trying to denigrate your 
                        good name, sir. I’m trying to save 
                        you from a noose around your neck.

                        So... did you murder the girl, or 
                        not? 

           A beat. Then:

                                 LEO
                        No. I didn’t.

                                 REUBEN
                        See, that wasn’t so hard.

                                 LEO
                        It is, though. 
                             (Reuben looks at him)
                        I woke up yesterday being a boss 
                        people respected, a son who doted 
                        on his mother, a husband who 
                        attended synagogue with his wife 
                        every Shabbat without fail. I went 
                        from that to being some kind of 
                        monster who was capable of... I 
                        know you’re not trying to denigrate 
                        my good name, but I’m still me. And 
                        I’m never going to get used to 
                        someone asking me if I am a 
                        murderer.

           Leo takes a deep breath to keep from crying. Reuben CLOSES 
           his notebook.

                                 REUBEN
                        I need you to do me a favor: Don’t 
                        refer to yourself in the past 
                        tense. People respect you, you dote 
                        on your mother, you attend 
                        synagogue. Can you do that for me? 
                             (Leo NODS)
                        Guard!

           Reuben gets up.

                                 LEO
                        So you’ll take me on as a client?

                        You’ve gotten yourself into a mess 
                        of trouble, Mr. Frank. I’ll take ya 
                        on, but I’m gonna need some help.

                                 LEO

                                 REUBEN
                        You let me worry about that. 
                        Retainer is $100. See that the 
                        money gets to my office by the end 
                        of the week.

           The PRISON GUARD comes and UNLOCKS the cell door. Before 
           Reuben leaves...

                                 LEO
                        We make those, you know?
                             (off Reuben’s look)
                        Your pencil. 

           Reuben sees the PENCIL sticking out of his note pad.

                                 LEO (CONT’D)
                        Mary worked in the metal room. She 
                        put on those grips that fasten the 
                        eraser to the wood. Funny. Maybe 
                        her little fingers touched that 
                        very one.

           Creeped out, Reuben backs out of the cell. The PRISON GUARD 
           shuts the cell door and LOCKS Leo inside again. 

                                 LEO (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be seeing you, counselor.

           INT. LUTHER ROSSER’S OFFICE - LOBBY - DAY

           Reuben walks into the relatively calm office. SARA, 24, a 
           sassy secretary, SPOTS him.

                                 SARA
                        Oh no. No, no, no, no, no. 

                                 REUBEN
                        What???

                                 SARA
                        Don’t you “what” me. You can turn 
                        right back around and go out the 
                        way you came in.

                                 REUBEN
                        Is he in?

                                 SARA
                        Yes. And I don’t need you gettin’ 
                        his blood pressure up, so--

           That’s when a BOOMING VOICE comes from an office.
                                 REUBEN
                        Sounds like it’s already up.

                                 SARA
                        Well if it’s all the same to you--

           That’s when LUTHER ROSSER, 56, tall, fat, bald, thinks he 
           god’s gift to the world -- THROWS OPEN HIS DOOR...

                                 LUTHER
                        What is all the goddamned racket?!!
                             (SPOTS Reuben)
                        I knew I smelled trash.

                                 REUBEN
                        Good to see you, too, Luther. 

           INT. LUTHER ROSSER’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Luther shuts the door, annoyed.

                                 LUTHER
                        Make it quick.

                                 REUBEN
                        Why don’t we take a walk? We can 
                        grab a drink.

                                 LUTHER
                        It’s 10 in the morning.

                                 REUBEN
                        Fine. Two drinks.

                                 LUTHER
                        Dr. McNaughton is in prison because 
                        of you. They’re going to hang him.

                                 REUBEN
                        Then he shouldn’t have poisoned 
                        Mattie’s husband with arsenic.  

                                 LUTHER
                        He was in love with her. It was a 
                        crime of passion.

                                 REUBEN
                        That argument didn’t work in front 
                        of a jury 6 months ago and it 
                        doesn’t hold water now. You like 
                        loser cases, Luther.
                                 LUTHER
                        The door’s right behind you.

                                 REUBEN
                        I got one for you.

                                 LUTHER
                        My door works just fine. Get the 
                        hell out.

                                 REUBEN
                        It’s a big, fat juicy case, Luther.

                                 LUTHER
                        I don’t care.

                                 REUBEN
                        We’d finally get to work together.

                                 LUTHER
                        I have an ulcer already, thanks.

                                 REUBEN
                        It’s gonna be front page news.

                                 LUTHER
                        That handle works best when you 
                        turn it to the left.

                                 REUBEN
                        It’s Leo Frank, Luther.

           That gets his attention.

                                 LUTHER
                        No shit. They arrested him?

                                 REUBEN
                        Yesterday.

           He TOSSES down a paper announcing Leo Frank’s arrest. Luther 
           SCANS it while Reuben talks.

                                 REUBEN (CONT’D)
                        I took him on, but I can’t do it on 
                        my own. You’re good with juries. 
                        Almost had me with Dr. McNaughton. 
                        Know why you lost?

                                 LUTHER
                        You inflamed the jury with lies 
                        about an affair that never took 
                        place?
                                 REUBEN
                        He was guilty.

                                 LUTHER
                        And Leo Frank isn’t?

                                 REUBEN
                        I didn’t say that.

                                 LUTHER
                        So he did it?

                                 REUBEN
                        Didn’t say that either.

                                 LUTHER
                        Do me a favor and tell me what the 
                        fuck you are saying.

           Reuben goes to the door -- TURNS the handle...

                                 REUBEN
                        Look at that. It really does work 
                        when you turn it to the left. 

           He WINKS at Luther and leaves. Luther goes back to reading 
           the article about the arrest of Leo Frank.

           INT. LEO FRANK’S HOME - DAY 

           The BELL RINGS. Lucille RUSHES to answer it, finding RACHEL 
           FRANK, 54, a solemn, determined woman with her suitcase. 
           Lucille THROWS her arms around her, BURSTING into tears.

                                 LUCILLE
                        Mrs. Frank...

           Rachel HOLDS her tightly -- KISSES her head.

           EXT. ATLANTA STREETS - DAY

           It’s a busy day. Everyone goes about their business, paying 
           little attention to Lucille and Rachel Frank. Lucille does 
           her best to hold it together.

                                 LUCILLE
                        They took him from work. They just 
                        took him. Leo told them everything 
                        he knew and they didn’t care.
                                 RACHEL FRANK
                        He will come home. He will. This is 
                        all a misunderstanding.

                                 LUCILLE
                        They put pictures in the paper of 
                        that little girl... Her body was... 
                        How could they think Leo is capable 
                        of doing such a thing? 
                             (SOBBING)
                        We never should’ve come here.

           Rachel dries Lucille’s tears with a handkerchief.

                                 RACHEL FRANK
                        My mother told me when I was a 
                        young girl, “Never let them see you 
                        sweat, never let them see you cry.” 
                        He needs you to be strong now. For 
                        however long this lasts, you have 
                        to be strong.

           They continue on their way when George Epps -- riding on a 
           trolley -- SPOTS them. He HOPS off and approaches them. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Y’all better get out of here.

           They ignore him, but George BLOCKS their path.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        What? Jews can’t hear no more? You 
                        all ain’t welcome here.

                                 LUCILLE
                        We don’t want any trouble.

                                 GEORGE
                        Oh, I’m sorry. Am I disturbin’ you? 
                        My apologies, ma’am.  

                                 LUCILLE
                        If you’ll excuse us...

           Again, George BLOCKS them.

                                 GEORGE
                        You going to visit him?

                                 RACHEL FRANK
                        That is none of your business.

           George turns his venom toward Rachel -- almost smiling. 
                                 GEORGE
                        And who are you? The mother? 

                                 RACHEL FRANK
                        Son, I think it’s time you went 
                        home.

                                 GEORGE
                             (SNEERS)
                        You don’t tell me what to do. Not 
                        after you birthed that baby killing 
                        kike! 

           George SPITS in Rachel’s face -- STORMS OFF. Everyone STOPS 
           and STARES at them. Now it’s Lucille’s turn to WIPE Rachel’s 
           face with that very same handkerchief. 

           INT. ATLANTA POLICE STATION - LEO’S CELL - DAY

           Rachel HUGS her son as Lucille stands off to the side, 
           forgotten. Rachel releases him, holds his face in her hands.

                                 RACHEL FRANK
                        Are they treating you well? How’s 
                        the food? I can cook you something.

                                 LEO
                        That would be wonderful. I miss 
                        your cooking.

           That pains Lucille, but she hides it.

                                 RACHEL FRANK
                        Have you retained a lawyer?

                                 LEO
                        Yes. One of the best in the state. 
                        I do need you to do me a favor.

                                 RACHEL FRANK
                        Anything.

                                 LEO
                        Can you get his retainer to him?

                                 RACHEL FRANK
                        Of course. How much is it?

                                 LEO
                        $100.

                                 RACHEL FRANK
                        $100?? Leo, you can’t afford that.
                                 LEO
                        We have to.

                                 RACHEL FRANK
                        There are other lawyers. Surely 
                        Lucille’s family must know someone.

                                 LEO
                        We tried that.

                                 RACHEL FRANK
                        Then what is the problem? Tell me. 
                        Tell me what it is.

                                 LEO
                        I don’t want you worrying about 
                        this.

                                 RACHEL FRANK
                        Leo, I’m not having some lawyer 
                        take advantage of you just because 
                        of your current situation--  

                                 LUCILLE
                        -Everyone turned us down.

           That stops Rachel. She turns Lucille, then back to Leo.

                                 RACHEL FRANK
                        Is that true?

                                 LEO
                        The factory has agreed to keep 
                        paying my salary for the time being 
                        and Lucille can get a job. Reuben 
                        Arnold wins cases. And more than 
                        that, I trust him.

                                 RACHEL FRANK
                        I see. Well, I look forward to 
                        meeting him. Now, how is this 
                        mattress?

           She goes about fussing with the pillows and mattress. Leo 
           SHRUGS at Lucille. What are you gonna do?

           INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           Pastor Stevens and George walk among rows of patient’s beds, 
           looking for someone. They find WILLIAM SIMMONS, 33, handsome 
           and charming as all giddy-up, recovering from a broken leg.
                                 PASTOR STEVENS
                        William, how ya feelin’?

                                 WILLIAM SIMMONS
                        Like I got hit by a car.

                                 PASTOR STEVENS
                        It’s dangerous out there. You seen 
                        this yet?

           He hands William the paper. It’s all about Leo Frank. William 
           looks it over...

                                 WILLIAM SIMMONS
                        It’s not bad enough those Yankee 
                        Jews come down from the North and 
                        take our jobs. They gotta kill our 
                        little girls too, huh?

                                 PASTOR STEVENS
                        I was talking to George here. We 
                        were thinking the citizens of 
                        Atlanta could use a voice in this 
                        matter. Someone with a good 
                        Christian background. 

                                 WILLIAM SIMMONS
                        Not sure I’m your man for that. Got 
                        fired from the Church.

                                 PASTOR STEVENS
                        Inefficiency, was it?

                                 WILLIAM SIMMONS
                        Somethin’ like that, yeah.

                                 PASTOR STEVENS
                        William, I don’t care what anyone 
                        else says. I always liked you and 
                        your sermons. You had a way of 
                        connecting to people that’s... 
                        special. I think this here cause 
                        could show everyone just how 
                        effective you really can be. 

                                 WILLIAM SIMMONS
                        My leg is broke, Pastor. 

           All friendly, Pastor Stevens PATS George on the back.

                                 PASTOR STEVENS
                        That’s why I brought along young 
                        George here. Figured you two could 
                        talk. Work some things out.
                                 GEORGE
                        I can be mighty helpful.

                                 WILLIAM SIMMONS
                        That a fact?

                                 GEORGE
                        Yes, sir. Mary was my friend.

                                 PASTOR STEVENS
                        Well, then. I’ll leave you two to 
                        it. Good seeing you, William.

           Pastor Stevens leaves. William looks over the paper, then:

                                 WILLIAM SIMMONS
                        You got many friends, George?

                                 GEORGE
                             (SMILING)
                        Yes, sir. Yes, sir, I do.

           INT. REUBEN ARNOLD’S OFFICE - DAY

           Reuben’s going over paperwork when there’s a KNOCK at his 
           door. He looks up to see Lucille and Rachel Frank standing 
           there. Ruben STANDS -- goes to them.

                                 REUBEN
                        Mrs. Frank and, Mrs.--

                                 RACHEL FRANK
                        -Rachel Frank. I’m Leo’s mother. I 
                        want to know what your plan is for 
                        saving my son’s life... if you have 
                        one, that is.

                                 REUBEN
                        Would you like to take a seat?

                                 RACHEL FRANK
                        I’m fine standing.

                                 REUBEN
                        Right. Well, this case should never 
                        make it to trial--

                                 RACHEL FRANK
                        -Then Leo can come home. When?

                                 REUBEN
                        -It shouldn’t make it to trial due 
                        to an extreme lack of evidence.

                        But the state’s attorney, Tom 
                        Felder, wants to make an example 
                        out of your husband. Add to it, 
                        Tom’s got an ambitious Solicitor 
                        General in his office, Hugh Dorsey, 
                        who wants to make a run at the 
                        Governorship in two years if the 
                        rumors are true.

                                 RACHEL FRANK
                        What does any of that have to do 
                        with my son?

                                 REUBEN
                        It means that some very powerful 
                        people have a vested interest in 
                        seeing Mary Phagan’s murderer 
                        brought to justice.

                                 RACHEL FRANK
                        My son did not--

                                 REUBEN
                        -I know. I’m just saying we have 
                        our work cut out for us.

                                 RACHEL FRANK
                        What are you planning to do?

                                 REUBEN
                        For starters--

           That’s when Luther Rosser walks into the office. Reuben BEAMS 
           upon seeing him -- puts his arm around Luther.

                                 REUBEN (CONT’D)
                        Speak of the devil. This is my co-
                        counsel. Luther Rosser meet Leo 
                        Frank’s mother, Rachel, and his 
                        wife, Lucille.

           Luther looks like he might explode. He’s got no choice but to 
           SHAKE the women’s hands. 

                                 LUTHER
                        Very sorry, ma’am.

                                 RACHEL FRANK
                        Will you really help us? This one 
                        looks a little young.

                                 REUBEN
                        I take that as a compliment, Mrs. 
                        Frank.
                                 RACHEL FRANK
                        Will you?

           Now Luther’s really fucking stuck.

                                 LUTHER
                        It would be my pleasure, ma’am.

           LATER

           Rachel and Lucille have left. Reuben CLOSES the door behind 
           them -- turns to a FUMING Luther.

                                 LUTHER (CONT’D)
                        Did you plan on them being here 
                        when I arrived?

                                 REUBEN
                        That was just blind luck, Luther. 
                        And we’re going to need more of it. 
                        Hugh Dorsey is going to come at us 
                        with everything he’s got.

                                 LUTHER
                        This is a sensitive situation for 
                        me, Reuben.

                                 REUBEN
                        Because I walloped your ass during 
                        the McNaughton trial? You’re going 
                        to have to get over that, Luther.

                                 LUTHER
                        Hugh Dorsey’s wife, Adair, has a 
                        sister, Sarah--

                                 REUBEN
                             (realizing)
                        -who’s married to your son. Well, 
                        shit, Luther. I’m sorry for making 
                        things awkward for you at 
                        Thanksgiving dinner, but if I have 
                        to worry about every Tom, Dick, and 
                        Harry with a forth degree 
                        connection to this case that makes 
                        someone at home uncomfortable, we 
                        might as well close up shop right 
                        now. Now are you with me or not?

           Luther HUFFS -- TOSSES down his coat.

                                 LUTHER
                        Tell me this: if Leo Frank didn’t 
                        murder Mary Phagan, who did?
           INT. HUGH DORSEY’S OFFICE - DAY

           STAFF comes in and out of the office freely as Hugh goes over 
           the case file with his co-counsel, Frank Hooper. 

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        Only one person is responsible for 
                        the murder of Mary Phagan. That man 
                        is Leo Frank. 

                                 FRANK HOOPER
                        Reuben Arnold and Luther Rosser 
                        will point to a number of other 
                        potential suspects--

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        -I don’t care if they deputize the 
                        corpse of Billy the Kid. We keep it 
                        clean and simple.

                                 FRANK HOOPER
                        And how’s that?

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        Never acknowledge another suspect 
                        or alternate theory. With one 
                        voice, we will repeat over and over 
                        again the fact that Leo Frank 
                        murdered Mary. The more we say it--

                                 FRANK HOOPER
                        -The more people will remember it.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        And it will become truth through 
                        osmosis. 

                                 FRANK HOOPER
                        We’re going to need more than that.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        I have more.

           INT. ATLANTA POLICE STATION - LEO’S CELL - DAY

           Reuben Arnold and Luther Rosser prep Leo Frank.

                                 LUTHER
                        Mr. Frank, why didn’t you answer 
                        the phone when the night watch, 
                        Newt Lee, called you after 
                        discovering Mary’s body?
                                 LEO
                        He didn’t call.

                                 REUBEN
                        No, no, no... 

                                 LEO
                        He didn’t.

                                 REUBEN
                        Leo, you can’t go on the stand and 
                        point fingers at everyone.  

                                 LEO
                        What do you want me to do? Lie?

                          REUBEN
                                                         LUTHER
           No.
                                              Yes.

                                 REUBEN
                        We don’t need you to lie. Just 
                        don’t blame everyone else in the 
                        room. Ask him again, Luther.

                                 LUTHER
                        Why didn’t you answer the phone, 
                        Mr. Frank?

           Leo thinks on that for a moment, then:

                                 LEO
                        I’m a heavy sleeper.

           INT. HUGH DORSEY’S OFFICE - DAY

           Hugh Dorsey reads over a file.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        What’s all this about shit in the 
                        elevator shaft?

                                 FRANK HOOPER
                        Detectives found a fresh pile down 
                        on the basement floor.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        Under the elevator?

                                 FRANK HOOPER
                        Yeah.
                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        Jim Conley says Leo Frank killed 
                        Mary Phagan around noon and he 
                        helped Leo take the body down to 
                        the basement in the elevator. 

                                 FRANK HOOPER
                        That’s what he said.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        So it stands to reason whoever 
                        defecated in the elevator shaft did 
                        it after Mary’s body was moved.

                                 FRANK HOOPER
                        Yeah, so?

           Hugh picks up a new file.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        Is this the doctor’s timeline?

                                 FRANK HOOPER
                        Says she was killed at night. 

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        “Victim had cabbage for lunch, 
                        which was found in her stomach to 
                        be partially digested, indicating 
                        she was killed at night. If she was 
                        killed during the day, the cabbage 
                        wouldn’t have been digested at all 
                        as the body ceases to produce 
                        stomach acid once it is deceased.”

           Hugh Dorsey SLAMS his hand down on the table.

                                 FRANK HOOPER
                        Problem?

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        So Leo kills Mary, panics, 
                        begs/threatens Jim for help. They 
                        take her down to the basement and 
                        go back upstairs in the elevator.

                                 FRANK HOOPER
                        Yeah? So?

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        So then one of them went back down 
                        to the basement using the ladder to 
                        take a shit in the elevator shaft? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HUGH DORSEY (CONT'D)
                        Then broke the back basement door 
                        and left through the alley? Leo 
                        could walk right out the front 
                        door.

                                 FRANK HOOPER
                        So could Jim Conley.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        But Mary died at night, not noon. 
                        Where the hell was she from time 
                        she was last seen alive in Leo 
                        Frank’s office for those 7 or 8 
                        hours until the doctor says she 
                        died?

                                 FRANK HOOPER
                        Maybe Leo Frank and Jim Conley held 
                        Mary captive before killing her.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        That’s not Conley’s story and if it 
                        turns out Leo Frank has any kind of 
                        alibi, our star witness is going to 
                        look like a goddamned liar.  

                                 FRANK HOOPER
                        What do you want to do?

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                             (a beat, then:)
                        Don’t bring up the cabbage leaves. 
                        If we don’t, maybe they won’t.

                                 LEO
                        About 6. I came home and had dinner 
                        with my wife and her father.

                                 LUTHER
                        And he’ll testify on your behalf?

                                 LEO
                        Of course he will, but what does 
                        that have to do with cabbage? 

                                 REUBEN
                        Everything. Emil Selig is a very 
                        well respected member of Atlanta 
                        society. Who else will testify for 
                        you, Leo?

                                 LEO
                        Lucille has been compiling a list. 
                        We have around 200 names.

                        You have 200 people who will

                        So he told the police what they 
                        wanted to hear. The Detectives had 
                        their sights on Leo Frank and 
                        Conley confirmed their suspicions. 
                        If the roles were reversed and I 
                        was that scared, I’d probably do 
                        the same thing.
           Hugh Dorsey CLOSES his eyes -- seeing his future political 
           career disappearing before him.

                        All right.

                        Leo Frank murdered Mary Phagan.

           A large CROWD has gathered. REPORTERS SNAP pictures and 
           interview those who’ve come to witness the day’s event. A CAR 
           arrives. Reuben and Luther get out -- followed by Leo Frank.  

           JEERS come from the crowd as REPORTERS shout questions.

                        Mr. Frank, why did you murder Mary? 
                        Was it for the sex? The money? Some 
                        sort of religious sacrifice?

           Leo stares at him, dumfounded, as he’s pulled along.

           INT. ATLANTA COURTHOUSE - COURTROOM - DAY

           It’s 90 degrees and there’s not an empty seat in the house. 
           Everyone FANS themselves with the latest addition of the 
           Atlanta Constitution. Hugh Dorsey sits at the prosecution 
           table with Frank Hooper, trying to keep his cool.

           Leo enters, flanked by his counsel. Everyone gets very, very 
           quiet as they make their way to the defense table. Leo hears 
           them whispering, “That’s him. That’s the Jew that murdered 
           little Mary Phagan.” Leo sits at the defense table. Lucille 
           and Rachel sit in the gallery just behind him.

           JUDGE LEONARD ROAN, 63, a man of strict moral character, 
           enters. Everyone RISES and then SITS as he does. Leo GLANCES 
           at the jury, but not one of them dares to look at him. 

                                 JUDGE ROAN
                        I see we have a number of guests 
                        this morning. That’s fine, but this 
                        is an important case and we will 
                        keep order in my courtroom, or I 
                        will clear it at once. Now, are we 
                        ready to begin?

                                 JUDGE ROAN
                         Mr. Dorsey, you’re up.

           Reuben takes his seat as Hugh Dorsey faces the jury. This is 
           the most important moment of his career. 
                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        As His Honor just said, this is an 
                        important case. It’s important to 
                        society, to the defendant, to me, 
                        and to Mary Phagan’s family. But it 
                        isn’t just important. It is 
                        extraordinary as a crime -- a most 
                        heinous crime, a crime of the 
                        demonic. Your job is to listen to 
                        all the faces and without prejudice 
                        against any man, black or white, 
                        Jew or Gentile, deliver a verdict 
                        of guilt upon Leo Frank for the 
                        murder of Mary Phagan. There have 
                        been some rumblings in the press -- 
                        small ones, because, as you know, 
                        we’ve been doing a wonderful job in 
                        preparation of this case -- but 
                        there have been small rumblings 
                        that this case is somehow tinged 
                        with prejudice. Now, I can tell you 
                        I am the least prejudice person I 
                        know. I can also tell you here and 
                        now that the race from which the 
                        defendant comes is every bit as 
                        good as our race. Just as good, 
                        just as good. But that doesn’t mean 
                        he’s innocent, because he isn’t. 
                        You’re going to hear many facts. 
                        Many, many facts. Some are more 
                        certain than others and that’s O.K. 
                        This isn’t mathematics. There’s a 
                        gray area. You can be sure of Leo 
                        Frank’s guilt based on moral 
                        certainty and you will still be 
                        fulfilling your oath.  

           Reuben and Luther are in complete and utter shock as Hugh 
           Dorsey takes his seat. Leo leans into Reuben.

                                 LEO
                        Did he just say the jury could 
                        ignore evidence based on morality?

           Reuben gives him an “I’ve got this” NOD. He STANDS, ready to 
           take Hugh Dorsey on with everything he’s got.

                                 REUBEN
                        Your Honor, Gentlemen of the jury, 
                        that was quite a speech, but I take 
                        great issue with a number of--

           That’s when a SOUND comes from outside. It’s CHANTING that 
           can’t quite be made out yet. Then it becomes clear...
                                 MOB (O.S.)
                        Frank is guilty! Guilty! Give us 
                        the Jew!!!

           EXT. ATLANTA COURTHOUSE - DAY

           A MOB has gathered. It’s four times the size of the onlookers 
           who were there at the beginning of the day. These are MEN, 
           WOMEN, and even CHILDREN -- SHAKING their fists in the air.

                                 MOB
                        Hang the Jew! Hang him! Kill him! 
                        Let him swing!!!

           INT. ATLANTA COURTHOUSE - COURTROOM - DAY

           Leo tries to hold his head high as the chanting RADIATES 
           through the building. Don’t cry, don’t cry, don’t cry...  

                                 JUDGE ROAN
                        Let’s get those windows closed.

           There’s a GROAN from the GALLERY. Hugh Dorsey STANDS.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        Your Honor, while I understand the 
                        commotion outside might be a little 
                        distracting for the defendant--

                                 REUBEN
                        -a little??

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        It is over 90 degrees and, sadly, 
                        the ventilation in this room leaves 
                        much to be desired. 

           Judge Roan looks out into the crowd. Literally everyone is 
           FANNING themselves. 

                                 JUDGE ROAN
                        Mr. Arnold, why don’t you go ahead 
                        with your opening statement?

                                 REUBEN
                        Your Honor--

                                 JUDGE ROAN
                        -The sooner you start, the sooner 
                        we’ll be done with it.

           Reuben dives on in as if the chanting isn’t happening.
                                 REUBEN
                        Leo Frank is an innocent man--

                                 MOB (O.S.)
                        -Hang that Jew!!!

           Leo STARES ahead, trying not to break.

           LATER

           Hugh Dorsey gently questions Fannie Coleman, Mary’s mother.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        What time did Mary leave your home 
                        that morning?

                                 FANNIE
                        Around 11. We had some breakfast 
                        and then Mary left to go pick up 
                        her pay from the factory. 

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        And when did you realize something 
                        was wrong?

                                 FANNIE
                        When she didn’t come home for 
                        supper. Mary was such a good girl. 
                        Her not coming home just wasn’t 
                        like her. My husband and I searched 
                        for her all night... but we 
                        couldn’t find her.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        I’m sorry to do this, ma’am, but... 
                        do you recognize these clothes?

           Hugh Dorsey shows Fannie Mary’s BLOODY CLOTHES. Fannie breaks 
           down and cries upon seeing them.

                                 FANNIE
                        That was what Mary was wearing the 
                        last time I saw her. Those were her 
                        Easter Sunday clothes.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        I’m very sorry for your loss.
                             (to Judge Roan)
                        Nothing further, Your Honor.

           Hugh Dorsey takes a seat as Reuben Arnold stands.

                                 REUBEN
                        What did Mary have for breakfast?
                                 FANNIE
                        What?

                                 REUBEN
                        You said Mary had breakfast before 
                        she left. What did she eat?

           Fannie looks to Hugh -- almost like she’s looking for help. 
           He does nothing but watch her intently.

                                 REUBEN (CONT’D)
                        Mrs. Coleman?

                                 FANNIE
                        Cabbage. Mary had cabbage.

           LATER

           Hugh Dorsey STANDS at the prosecution table.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        The state calls George Epps.
                             (nobody moves)
                        George Epps??

           Still nothing. There’s still some CHANTING going on outside. 
           That’s when Hugh Dorsey realizes...

                                 HUGH DORSEY (CONT’D)
                             (quietly, to Frank Hooper)
                        Will you go get that boy outside?

           Frank Hooper hurries out of the courtroom while Hugh Dorsey 
           tries to hide his embarrassment behind a smile.

           EXT. ATLANTA COURTHOUSE - DAY

           It may be 90 degrees, but the MOB isn’t giving up, not for a 
           second. George is indeed among them, yelling loudly.

                                 GEORGE
                        String him up!!! String. That. Jew. 
                        Up!!!

           Frank Hooper GRABS George by the back of the neck -- DRAGS 
           him into the courthouse. 

           INT. ATLANTA COURTHOUSE - COURTROOM - DAY

           All eyes are on George as he walks to the witness stand. He 
           doesn’t mind the attention. He’s mad and not hiding it. When 
           he reaches the stand, the BAILIFF swears him in.
                                 BAILIFF
                        You swear to tell the whole truth, 
                        son?

                                 GEORGE
                             (SNEERING)
                        Yeah.

           Hugh Dorsey questions him.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        What was your relationship to Mary 
                        Phagan?

                                 GEORGE
                        I was her friend. She was sweet on 
                        me, I guess you could say.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        When was the last time you saw her?

                                 GEORGE
                        On the trolley. I rode it with her 
                        to the factory so she could get her 
                        pay. She was supposed to meet me 
                        after for ice cream, but she never 
                        turned up, so I went to a baseball 
                        game.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        Did Mary ever confide in you about 
                        her work life? Her boss?

                                 GEORGE
                        You mean about Leo Frank? Yeah, she 
                        complained about him all the time.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        What did she say?

           Reuben stands.

                                 REUBEN
                        Objection. Hearsay, Your Honor.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        I’ll rephrase. George, how did Mary 
                        seem to you when she spoke about 
                        Mr. Frank?

                                 GEORGE
                        Afraid. Very afraid.

           Hugh Dorsey sits. Now it’s Reuben’s turn with George.
                                 REUBEN
                        Very afraid, huh? 

                                 GEORGE
                        Yes.

                                 REUBEN
                        Yes, sir.

           George doesn’t like that one bit.

                                 REUBEN (CONT’D)
                        I’m curious, if Mary was so afraid 
                        of her boss -- very afraid, as you 
                        said -- what did you do about it? I 
                        mean, this is your girlfriend we 
                        are talking about here. She was 
                        sweet on you and there she was 
                        pouring her heart out and you did 
                        exactly what to ease her pain? Did 
                        you tell your friends?

                                 GEORGE
                        No.

                                 REUBEN
                        Your parents?

                                 GEORGE
                        No.

                                 REUBEN
                        Her parents?

                                 GEORGE
                        No.

                                 REUBEN
                        Did you confront Mr. Frank?

                                 GEORGE
                        No.

                                 REUBEN
                        Really? I’m shocked by that with 
                        you being such a stand-up guy, 
                        hollering all kinds of vicious 
                        things at Mr. Frank through that 
                        window there. It’s easy now, sure, 
                        but why didn’t you defend Mary when 
                        she was alive?  

                                 GEORGE
                        I... I...
                                 REUBEN
                        Better run on home to your Mama, 
                        little boy. Leave the heavy lifting 
                        to the adults.

           George FUMES.

                        Newt Lee was nervous when we 
                        questioned him, but lots of people 
                        are when questioned by the police. 
                        Leo Frank was altogether a 
                        different situation.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        How so?

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        He was panic stricken. Manic. I’ve 
                        never seen someone so terrified in 
                        all my life. 

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        Did you take him to the police 
                        station for questioning?

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Not at first. We stopped at the 
                        mortuary.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        Why?

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        I wanted to see the look on his 
                        face when he saw Mary’s body.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        Which was?

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Stone cold. Like the killer he is.

           Hugh Dorsey sits. Luther Rosser stands this time.

                                 LUTHER
                        Mighty unusual to take a suspect to 
                        view a body.
                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        I wanted to be sure.

                                 LUTHER
                        And Leo Frank’s facial expression 
                        is what assured you of his guilt?

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Among other things.

                        Such as?

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        He was actin’ weird.

                                 LUTHER
                        How?

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Well he stripped naked in the 
                        interrogation room we put him in 
                        with Newt Lee.

                                 LUTHER
                        You did what?

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        We put Mr. Frank in a room with 
                        Newt Lee.

                                 LUTHER
                        Who was also a suspect?

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Yes. We were tryin’ to get a 
                        confession outta one of them.

                                 LUTHER
                        Did you?

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        No.

                                 LUTHER
                        You said Mr. Frank removed his 
                        clothes. Why’d he do that?

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        To show he didn’t have any marks on 
                        him. That his skin was clean.

                                 LUTHER
                        Was it?
                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Yes.

                                 LUTHER
                        Let me get this straight. You’re 
                        saying that Mr. Frank -- an 
                        upstanding member of Atlanta 
                        society by all accounts -- acted 
                        weird when police unexpectedly took 
                        him from his home, showed him the 
                        mutilated body of a dead child, and 
                        locked him in a room with a man 
                        suspected of murdering that child. 
                        Is that your testimony?

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                             (HUFFING)
                        Yes.

                                 LUTHER
                        Hey I might’ve removed my clothes 
                        to get away from you, too.

           LAUGHS come from the gallery. Hugh Dorsey stands.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        Objection. Counsel is testifying.

                        Withdrawn. 

                                 JUDGE ROAN
                        Let the record show. We are in 
                        recess until 9am tomorrow.

           Judge Roan BANGS his gavel. It’s so hot that everyone gets 
           the hell out of there. Rachel and Lucille approach Leo. 

                                 LUCILLE
                        You all right?

                                 LEO
                             (NODS)
                        You?

                                 LUCILLE
                        I just want all this to be over.

                                 LEO
                        Me too.

           Leo takes Lucille’s hand. It’s as affectionate as they get. 

           ACROSS THE ROOM
           Boots Rogers and George SPOT Leo and Lucille’s moment 
           together. Neither of them are happy, having gotten their 
           asses handed to them today. George SNEERS.

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Have you talked to William about 
                        tonight?

                                 GEORGE
                        Yeah. We’re ready.

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Good. It’s time we took back 
                        control of the situation.

           They GLARE as Leo says goodbye to his wife and mother.

           INT. LEO FRANK’S HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT 

           Lucille and Rachel are in their bed clothes, putting away 
           some dishes.

                                 RACHEL FRANK
                        That is not a trial. It’s a circus.

                                 LUCILLE
                        Leo says it’s going to be fine. The 
                        jury will see there’s no real 
                        evidence against him.

                                 RACHEL FRANK
                        It never should’ve gotten this far. 
                        He never should’ve moved here.

           Ouch.

                                 LUCILLE
                        My family is from here, Mrs. Frank.

                                 RACHEL FRANK
                        And where are they?

                                 LUCILLE
                        My father said he’d testify in 
                        Leo’s defense.

           Rachel realizes she’s gone too far -- takes pity on the 
           SHAKING daughter-in-law before her.

                                 RACHEL FRANK
                        It’s not you. I’m just so... how 
                        can people behave like that? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RACHEL FRANK (CONT'D)
                        Shouting horrible things at 
                        strangers.

                                 LUCILLE
                        It’s a complicated place.

                                 RACHEL FRANK
                        Well, the second this is over, the 
                        two of you are moving up to 
                        Brooklyn with Rudolph and me.

                                 LUCILLE
                        How’s he feeling?

                                 RACHEL FRANK
                        Better. He wishes he could be here, 
                        but--

           That’s when a BRICK comes SAILING through the window. Lucille 
           and Rachel JUMP. Then another BRICK and another... 

           SMASH SMASH SMASH!

           EXT. LEO FRANK’S HOME - NIGHT

           Lucille and Rachel Frank RUN out of the house to find CROSSES 
           BURNING on the lawn. Men clad in BEDSHEETS and HOODS ride 
           around on horseback, SHOUTING and FIRING SHOTGUNS.

           Terrified, Lucille and Rachel HURRY back inside.

           INT. REUBEN ARNOLD’S HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The phone RINGS. Reuben STUMBLES from the bed to answer.

                                 REUBEN
                        Hello?

           EXT. LEO FRANK’S HOME - NIGHT

           FIREMEN are just putting out the crosses when Reuben arrives. 
           He RUNS up the steps and goes into...

           LEO FRANK’S HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Reuben finds Lucille and Rachel in tears on the couch as 
           they’re being interviewed by the POLICE.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        How many were there?
                                 LUCILLE
                        15. Maybe 20. I don’t know. All I 
                        saw were bedsheets and torches.

                                 RACHEL FRANK
                        What exactly are you doing to catch 
                        these men?

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Without descriptions, I’m not sure 
                        there’s much we can do.

                                 LUCILLE
                        They were wearing hoods!

           The POLICE OFFICER moves along. Reuben approaches them.

                                 REUBEN
                        I’m so sorry. Are you all right?

                                 LUCILLE
                        They were carrying torches, so no, 
                        I’m not.

                                 REUBEN
                        Maybe we should relocate you. Move 
                        you somewhere safe. A hotel, maybe.

                                 LUCILLE
                        And then what? Someone recognizes 
                        us and we have to move again?

                                 REUBEN
                        I want you to be safe.

                                 LUCILLE
                        And I won’t be until I’m out of the 
                        state of Georgia, but I’m not 
                        leaving without my husband. Do 
                        something about that, will you?

           Lucille storms off.

           INT. ATLANTA COURTHOUSE - COURTROOM - DAY

           The SPECTATORS FAN themselves as the heat continues to 
           overwhelm them. Hugh Dorsey STANDS.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        The state calls Jim Conley.

           Everyone turns to the back of court. Boots Rogers ESCORTS Jim 
           Conley -- whose hands and feet are BOUND -- to the stand. 
                                 HUGH DORSEY (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Conley, what position do you 
                        hold at the National Pencil 
                        Company?

                                 JIM CONLEY
                        I’m a sweeper, sir.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        Do you do a good job, sir?

                                 JIM CONLEY
                        I show up on time, do my job, don’t 
                        cause any trouble.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        Ever been in trouble with the law?

                                 JIM CONLEY
                        No, sir. I keep to myself, mostly.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        What happened on April 26th, Jim?

           Jim looks to Boots Rogers, who stands nearby. He’s clearly 
           afraid -- trying to remember what to say...

                                 JIM CONLEY
                        My boss, Mr. Frank, came to me as I 
                        was finishing my shift. 

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        What time was this?

                                 JIM CONLEY
                        Around 6-7pm, sir.

           Reuben and Luther look to Leo. Jim Conley is changing his 
           story on the stand.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        Then what happened?

                                 JIM CONLEY
                        He said something bad had happened 
                        and he needed my help moving a 
                        body.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        Did you help him?

                                 JIM CONLEY
                        Yes. 
                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        Why?

           Again, Jim Conley looks to Boots Rogers for help. He’s not 
           talking about Leo Frank...

                                 JIM CONLEY
                        Because I was afraid. I was afraid 
                        he’d pin it on me if I didn’t do 
                        exactly what he said. 

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        Are you still afraid of Mr. Frank?

                                 JIM CONLEY
                        Yes, sir. I’ll be afraid of him for 
                        as long as I’m breathing.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        You don’t have to be afraid 
                        anymore, Jim. We got him.

                                 REUBEN
                        Objection.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        Withdrawn.

           Hugh Dorsey takes his seat. Reuben is ready for this one.

                                 REUBEN
                        You confessed to helping my client 
                        move the body of Mary Phagan, is 
                        that correct?

                                 JIM CONLEY
                        Yes.

                                 REUBEN
                        From where to where?

                                 JIM CONLEY
                        His office to the basement.

                                 REUBEN
                        And this was between 6-7pm?

                                 JIM CONLEY
                        Yes, sir.

                                 REUBEN
                        When you confessed, you told the 
                        police it was at 1pm. Why?
                                 JIM CONLEY
                        I didn’t.

                                 REUBEN
                        I have your signed confession here. 
                        This is your signature, is it not?

           He shows Jim the singed confession.

                                 JIM CONLEY
                        It is.

                                 REUBEN
                        So, illuminate us, Mr. Conley. Were 
                        you lying then or now?

                                 JIM CONLEY
                             (doesn’t know what to say)
                        I drink sometimes -- get confused. 
                        All I know is Mr. Frank did it. I 
                        was afraid, so I helped him. I 
                        don’t know what else to say.

           Reuben SHAKES his head, annoyed at the lies coming out of Jim 
           Conley’s mouth.

                                 REUBEN
                        Nothing further.

           Jim Conley steps down. Boots Rogers GRIPS his arm as he 
           guides him away.  

                                 JUDGE ROAN
                        Is the defense ready to call its 
                        first witness?

                                 REUBEN
                        Yes, Your Honor. We’d like to call 
                        Herbert Schiff.

           LATER

           HERBERT SCHIFF, 33, mild-mannered businessman type, is 
           questioned by Reuben.

                                 REUBEN (CONT’D)
                        What position do you hold at the 
                        National Pencil Factory?

                                 HERBERT SCHIFF
                        I’m the assistant superintendant.

                                 REUBEN
                        So you work closely with Mr. Frank?
                                 HERBERT SCHIFF
                        Every day.

                                 REUBEN
                        Do you believe him to be a 
                        murderer?

                                 HERBERT SCHIFF
                        It’s not possible.

                                 REUBEN
                        And why is that?

                                 HERBERT SCHIFF
                        His wife, Lucille, would show up 
                        unannounced. She’d bring him lunch 
                        or a clean shirt. And on Saturdays, 
                        she would help take dictation. The 
                        idea that he was romancing women in 
                        his office is absurd.  

           Reuben sits. Hugh Dorsey takes his turn.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        But Lucille Frank wasn’t there 
                        every Saturday? She wasn’t there on 
                        April 26th, was she?

                                 HERBERT SCHIFF
                        No, she wasn’t.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        Then how is it absurd to think that 
                        he could romance the factory girls 
                        in his office? Just because Lucille 
                        Frank never caught him doesn’t mean 
                        he’s not guilty. 

                                 HERBERT SCHIFF
                        That’s not why it’s absurd.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        Then why is it?

                                 HERBERT SCHIFF
                        Because my office is next to his. 

           Hugh Dorsey goes blank. Stop talking, stop talking...

                                 HERBERT SCHIFF (CONT’D)
                        We share a wall. I can hear him 
                        walking, talking, breathing. If 
                        he’d killed someone, trust me, I 
                        would’ve heard it.
           LATER

           EMIL SELIG, 66, Lucille’s father, sits on the stand.

                                 REUBEN
                        You had lunch with Lucille and Leo 
                        Frank on April the 26th? 

                                 EMIL SELIG
                        Yes. He came home for lunch and we 
                        dined from around 1-2:30.

                                 REUBEN
                        How did Leo seem?

                                 EMIL SELIG
                        Normal. 

                                 REUBEN
                        Was he nervous? Agitated?

                                 EMIL SELIG
                        No. Nothing like that.

                                 REUBEN
                        Did he have any marks on him? 
                        Scratches?

                                 EMIL SELIG
                        No, he didn’t.

                                 REUBEN
                        According to the testimony we heard 
                        from the state, Leo had to attack 
                        Mary Phagan between 12-12:45pm, 
                        subdue, but not kill her, in order 
                        for him to make it home for lunch 
                        by 1. Does that seem likely to you?

                                 EMIL SELIG
                        The man I saw at lunch was the same 
                        man who married my daughter. He is 
                        kind, he is loving, he is good. 

           LATER

           DR. HURT, 47, is on the stand now.

                                 REUBEN
                        What were the contents of Mary’s 
                        stomach when you examined her?

                                 DR. HURT
                        Not much. Fresh cabbage leaves.
                                 REUBEN
                        What does that tell you about the 
                        time of death?

                                 DR. HURT
                        It had to be in the later evening. 
                        I’m guessing around 8 at night.

                                 REUBEN
                        And we know Leo Frank was home by 
                        then.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        Objection.

                                 REUBEN
                        It’s been stated in the record that 
                        Leo Frank was at home, having 
                        dinner with his wife by 8pm. And 
                        the expert witness is confirming 
                        that the victim died when my client 
                        was at home.  

                                 JUDGE ROAN
                        Overruled.

           Boots Rogers doesn’t like the way this is going. He high 
           tails it out of the courtroom.

           EXT. ATLANTA COURTHOUSE - DAY

           The MOB is still there, but they are patiently listening to 
           the testimony. Boots Rogers comes out -- SPOTS George.

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        You better get to it.

           Boots Rogers goes back inside. George turns to his friends.

           INT. ATLANTA COURTHOUSE - COURTROOM - DAY

           Boots Rogers rejoins the gallery.

                                 REUBEN
                        Doctor, it’s also been stated that 
                        Mary entered the Pencil Factory 
                        just after noon and no one can 
                        account for her after she collected 
                        her pay. Can you explain how she 
                        could’ve gone missing for so long 
                        before her death?
           That’s when the chanting comes from outside again.

                                 MOB (O.S.)
                        Give us the Jew! Leo, Leo, can you 
                        hear us? We’re coming for you!!!

                                 DR. HURT
                        Based on the injuries--

                                 MOB (O.S.)
                        -Let him swing!

                                 DR. HURT
                        The lacerations around her wrists--

                                 MOB (O.S.)
                        -He murdered our sister!

                                 DR. HURT
                        And on her feet--

                                 MOB (O.S.)
                        -she was our daughter!

                                 DR. HURT
                        And her throat-- 

                                 MOB (O.S.)
                        -she was our friend!

                                 DR. HURT
                        I’d say she was restrained.

           The jury can barely here what Dr. Hurt was trying to get 
           across. It’s all too loud. Reuben tries to move on. 

                                 MOB (O.S.)
                        Give him to us!!!

                                 REUBEN
                        Restrained until all the employees 
                        of the National Pencil Factory had 
                        left for the night? Perhaps someone 
                        without an iron clad alibi?

                                 DR. HURT
                        That would make the most sense.

                                 MOB (O.S.)
                        Let him swing, let him swing, let 
                        him swing!!!!

           Leo can’t believe this is happening. He holds his head high, 
           as if that hate outside wasn’t happening.
           LATER

           Reuben RISES.

                                 REUBEN
                        The state calls Leo M. Frank.

           All eyes are on Leo Frank as he makes his way to the stand. 
           He’s got a notebook with him. This is it.

                                 LEO
                        Gentlemen of the jury: I was born 
                        April 17th, 1884 in Cuero, Texas. I 
                        grew up in Brooklyn, New York 
                        before attending Cornell University 
                        where I studied mathematical 
                        engineering which lead to an offer 
                        to work at the National Pencil 
                        Factory. So I moved south and 
                        married an Atlanta girl, Miss 
                        Lucille Selig. 

           Leo GLANCES at his wife. Lucille gives him a nod to continue.

                                 LEO (CONT’D)
                        I did not know Mary Phagan. On 
                        April 26th, a little girl, who I 
                        afterwards found out to be Mary, 
                        entered my office and asked for her 
                        pay envelope. I asked for her 
                        employee number and she told me. I 
                        went to the cash box, found her 
                        envelope, and handed it over. She 
                        left my office and made it to the 
                        door when she asked me if the metal 
                        had arrived. I told her no. She 
                        continued on her way out and that 
                        was it. That was the beginning, 
                        middle, and end of my relationship 
                        with Mary Phagan. I have heard a 
                        great deal, and so have you, in 
                        this trial and elsewhere, about my 
                        nervousness when Detectives arrived 
                        at my home on the morning of the 
                        27th. Gentlemen, I was nervous. I 
                        was very nervous. I was completely 
                        unstrung, I will admit it. Imagine 
                        being awakened out of sound sleep, 
                        hardly dressed, taken by police in 
                        a car without food or water. I was 
                        rushed into a room and presented 
                        with that poor little child, who 
                        had her life so cruelly snuffed 
                        out.

                        Of course I was nervous. Any man 
                        would be nervous if he were a man. 
                        Then I was taken to the police 
                        station and put in a cell with Newt 
                        Lee, who initially, was whom the 
                        Detectives believed was responsible 
                        for murdering Mary Phagan. I was 
                        told, “You are his boss and he 
                        respects you. We can’t get anything 
                        out of him. See if you can. Put it 
                        to him strong and cough up all he 
                        knows about what happened or you’ll 
                        both go to hell.” Those were the 
                        Detective’s exact words. I was 
                        nervous, so I did what I was told. 
                        I’m not a violent man. I’m not 
                        intimidating. I was unable to 
                        accomplish what they wanted and I 
                        can’t help but think that is the 
                        reason I am standing before you.

           Leo tries to hold it together the best he can. 

                                 LEO (CONT’D)
                        I know nothing whatsoever of the 
                        death of little Mary Phagan. Some 
                        news men have called me “the silent 
                        man in the tower” and I have kept 
                        my silence until the proper time 
                        and place. The time is now. The 
                        place is here. And I have told you 
                        the truth. The whole truth.

           With that, Leo returns to his seat with Reuben and Luther.  

           LATER

           The CHANTING has resumed outside. Judge Roan MOTIONS for 
           Reuben, Luther, and Hugh Dorsey to join him at the bench. 

                                 JUDGE ROAN
                        Counselors.

           Then three men do as they’re told. Very quietly, he briefs 
           them over the noise. 

                                 JUDGE ROAN (CONT’D)
                        As we turn the case over to the 
                        jury, I’m of the mind that Leo 
                        Frank should not be present when 
                        the verdict is read.

                                 REUBEN
                        Why?
                                 JUDGE ROAN
                        If Frank is acquitted, that mob 
                        outside could lynch him. They could 
                        lynch all of us. 

                                 REUBEN
                        He has a right to face the jury.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        He also has the right not to be 
                        killed by an unruly mob.

                                 REUBEN
                        That you’ve had part in stoking.

                                 JUDGE ROAN
                        That’s enough. Are we agreed?

           The men nod and return to their tables.

                                 JUDGE ROAN (CONT’D)
                        Gentlemen of the jury...

           EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

           The MOB RAGES on -- SCREAMING and THROWING BOTTLES at the 
           courthouse.  Luther PASSES R.J. Brown and W.F. Anderson as 
           they stand off to the side, SMOKING cigarettes.

                                 W.F. ANDERSON
                        How much trouble are we gonna have?

           Brown SPOTS William Simmons and George in the center of the 
           crowd -- EGGING everyone on.

                                 R.J. BROWN
                        Depends on which way they go.

           INT. HUGH DORSEY’S OFFICE - DAY

           Hugh stands at his large windows, looking down at the ANGRY 
           MOB fighting below. He SIPS a glass of WHISKEY.

           INT. LEO’S CELL - DAY

           Leo PACES, unable to get a hold of himself. Lucille is there 
           with him. So is Rachel.

                                 LEO
                        How did I do? I think I did fine, 
                        but one can never know. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LEO (CONT'D)
                        Did I talk to much? Or too little? 
                        Maybe I should’ve gone into more 
                        detail about what I was doing that 
                        day. Or about Lucille. I didn’t 
                        talk about her enough and our life 
                        together. They still don’t see me 
                        as a person. I can see it in their 
                        faces. Maybe I can go back in and 
                        try it again. I won’t let my voice 
                        tremble. I’ll be strong. They’ll 
                        see I’m not the monster they think 
                        I am...

           Reuben says nothing.

                                 LEO (CONT’D)
                        What do we do now, Mr. Arnold?

                                 REUBEN
                        We wait.

           EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

           The MOB continues their angry CHANTS and SCREAMING. Britt 
           Craig is among them, interviewing the protesters.

                                 BRITT CRAIG
                        What brought you here today, sir?

           Britt Craig gets PUNCHED in the face -- his nose GUSHES blood 
           as he gets TRAMPLED to the ground by the ANGRY MOB.

           INT. JURY ROOM - DAY

           Sounds from the ANGRY MOB drift inside... The JURORS sit 
           silently -- LISTENING to the HATEFUL SHOUTING from outside. 
           Not one of the JURORS dare to move.

                                 MOB (O.S.)
                        Murderer! String him up! Shoot him 
                        between the eyes! Justice for Mary!

           WINBURN, 38, the foreman, looks to his fellow JURORS.

                                 WINBURN
                        We ready to vote?

           INT. HUGH DORSEY’S OFFICE - DAY

           Hugh continues to stare down at the CHANTING MOB below when a 
           SECRETARY sticks her head in the door. 
                                 SECRETARY
                        Mr. Felder wants to see you.

           INT. THOMAS FELDER’S OFFICE - DAY

           Hugh enters. Thomas looks up from his desk -- leans back in 
           his chair. He doesn’t look happy.

                                 THOMAS FELDER
                        Judge Roan called. You need to get 
                        back to the courthouse.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                             (panicked, CHECKS watch)
                        It’s only been four hours.

           Thomas gets up -- goes to Hugh.

                                 THOMAS FELDER
                        I told you, you didn’t want this 
                        case. Go face it like a man. Then 
                        come back and we’ll have a 
                        conversation.

           INT. LEO’S CELL - DAY

           Leo looks out through the iron bars, waiting.

           EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

           Hugh Dorsey makes his way through the ANGRY MOB. Some PAT him 
           on the back as he makes his way up the steps. Britt Craig, 
           with his BLOODY NOSE, joins him.

                                 BRITT CRAIG
                        You got a verdict, Mr. Dorsey?

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        What happened to your face?

                                 BRITT CRAIG
                        Rough world, but I can take it. How 
                        do you feel about your odds?

           Hugh ignores him and heads inside.

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

           Everyone’s reassembled -- taken their seats. Judge Roan looks 
           over a PIECE OF PAPER just passed to him by the BAILIFF. 
                                 JUDGE ROAN
                        Has the jury reached a verdict?

           Winburn STANDS -- faces the packed courtroom. He SHAKES as he 
           speaks. Hugh Dorsey sinks into his chair, horrified by what’s 
           about to come.

                                 WINBURN
                        We have, your Honor. The jury finds 
                        the defendant, Leo Frank...

                              panicked)
                        You’ve got a phone call.

           Reuben NODS. He says nothing to Leo or Lucille or Rachel. He 
           just follows the GUARD into the...

           HALL - CONTINUOUS

           The GUARD guides him to a phone. Reuben puts the receiver to 
           his ear, takes a breath...

                                 REUBEN
                        This is Reuben Arnold.
                             (a beat)
                        O.K. Thanks for the call.

           He HANGS UP -- heads back to Leo’s cell, but STOPS short. He 
           just needs a second to collect himself. 

           1, 2, 3... 

           Then Reuben goes back to the cell. Everyone looks at him.

                                 REUBEN (CONT’D)
                        Here’s where we’re at...

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

           Everyone CHEERS! Winburn and the rest of the JURY MEMBERS 
           hurry out as the MOB lifts a shocked Hugh Dorsey into the 
           air. They carry him out of the courtroom. 

           INT. LEO’S CELL - DAY

           Leo’s panicked, talking to himself rather than his family.
                                 LEO
                        It just doesn’t add up. I’m 
                        innocent. Why can’t they see that? 
                        We had witnesses who said very nice 
                        things about me. And why wouldn’t 
                        they? I’m a kind person. It’s this 
                        mob law, that’s exactly what this 
                        is. The jury was clearly affected 
                        by it. Intimidated. We’ll have to 
                        look into that. 

                                 REUBEN
                        We’ll appeal -- all the way to the 
                        Supreme Court if we have to.

                                 LEO
                        That won’t be necessary. Once this 
                        fever subsides, calmer heads will 
                        prevail and I’ll go home.

           EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

           The ANGRY MOB CHEERS as they carry Hugh Dorsey on their 
           shoulders from the courthouse. Hats SAIL in the air.

           INT. LEO’S CELL - DAY

           Leo continues speaking with Reuben.

                                 LEO
                        Tell me, counselor, what kind of 
                        sentence did they give me?

           EXT. TOWN SQUARE - DAY

           The ANGRY MOB has carried Hugh Dorsey all the way to the 
           center of town where William Simmons awaits on a podium with 
           George Epps. Overwhelmed, Hugh shakes William’s hand.

           Everyone CHEERS as William stands before them.

                                 WILLIAM SIMMONS
                        What a day! What a day, what a day. 
                        It almost makes you believe in the 
                        American Dream again -- an America 
                        that’s safe from those Jews from 
                        the North. They will not come here. 
                        They will not take our jobs. They 
                        will not rape our daughters. They 
                        will not murder them and think we 
                        will do nothing.

                        This is our country. They will not 
                        take it from us!!! 

           The MOB CHEERS.

                                 WILLIAM SIMMONS (CONT’D)
                        But we didn’t do this alone. We had 
                        a champion on our side. An American 
                        hero if you ask me. Citizens of 
                        Atlanta. The future Governor of 
                        Georgia, Hugh Dorsey!!!

           The CHEERING reaches a crescendo as William EMBRACES Hugh.

           INT. LEO’S CELL - DAY

           Leo can hear the words from his cell. Everyone’s silent as 
           Leo moves to the window, staring out through the bars.

           EXT. TOWN SQUARE - DAY

           Hugh Dorsey has taken center stage. He’s nervous and humbled 
           to be standing before the crowd. This is his moment to shine.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        I am a simple man. I’ve tried to be 
                        a good neighbor, a good husband, a 
                        good father. I want my children to 
                        be happy and safe. But it’s not a 
                        safe world anymore, is it? 

           Nos come from the crowd.

                                 HUGH DORSEY (CONT’D)
                        It can be again, but not with the 
                        likes of men like Leo Frank being 
                        allowed to roam free. But you can 
                        rest easy tonight, because Leo 
                        Frank will walk the streets of 
                        Atlanta no more!  
                             (more CHEERS)
                        The good people have spoken. Leo 
                        Frank is guilty of murdering Mary 
                        Phagan and will hang by the neck 
                        until he is dead!!!

           The MOB erupts into THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE. Everyone CHEERS. Men 
           THROW their HATS in the air. Ladies WAVE handkerchiefs. Hugh 
           Dorsey raises a MIGHTY FIST to the sky.  
           INT. LEO’S CELL - DAY

           The CHEERING continues to permeate the scene...

           Leo’s heard it all -- every word -- but just STARES out the 
           window, keeping his back to his family and lawyer.

                                 LEO
                        They’ll change their minds. They’ll 
                        see it’s all just one big mistake. 
                        I know they will. I know it... 

           But even Leo doesn’t believe his words.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. REUBEN ARNOLD’S OFFICE - DAY

           Reuben SLAMS his FIST down on his desk.

                                 REUBEN
                        Those cowardly sons of bitches!!!

                                 LUTHER
                        Also known as the Justices of the 
                        United States Supreme Court.

                                 REUBEN
                        I’m not in the mood for your word 
                        games, Luther. How could they not 
                        hear our case?? Leo Frank is 
                        national news. Papers all over the 
                        country are covering him.

           He TOSSES down one paper after another on the desk.

                                 REUBEN (CONT’D)
                        22 states have him on the front 
                        page. Another 10 have him on page 
                        2. Every civil rights organization 
                        is on our side--

                                 LUTHER
                        -That’s why they didn’t hear it.

                                 REUBEN
                        We overplayed it?
                                 LUTHER
                        200 character witnesses. How long 
                        did Leo speak for? People are 
                        exhausted and the last thing the 
                        Supreme Court wants to do is start 
                        another Civil War in the South 
                        because they let a child killer out 
                        of prison--

                                 REUBEN
                        -He didn’t do it!!!

           That’s as loud Reuben’s ever gotten. He’s furious.

                                 REUBEN (CONT’D)
                        You know we’ve only got one option 
                        left, Luther.

                                 LUTHER
                        No, no, no, no, no.

                                 REUBEN
                        Don’t give me that shit. A man’s 
                        life literally hangs in the 
                        balance. You’re doing it. 

                                 LUTHER
                        He’s a partner in my firm. It would 
                        be political suicide. He’s not 
                        going to listen to me. 

                                 REUBEN
                        He’ll listen, but not to you, 
                        you’re right about that.

                                 LUTHER
                        Then who? Who is going to get 
                        through to John Slaton and convince 
                        him to save Leo Frank’s life?

           INT. GOVERNOR’S MANSION - BALLROOM - DAY

           All of Atlanta’s elite attend this fancy party. They DRINK, 
           DANCE, and GOSSIP as they enjoy the glitz and glamour. Luther 
           Rosser guides Lucille into the party.

                                 LUTHER
                        We only have one shot at this. Do 
                        what I say and nothing else.

                                 LUCILLE
                        I heard you before. 
                                 LUTHER
                        Be goddamned sure. These people--

                                 LUCILLE
                        -I know who they are.

           The crowd parts REVEALING GOVERNOR JOHN SLATON, 47, clad in a 
           tuxcedo, dancing with his wife, SARAH, 41. They look every 
           bit the happy couple.

           The MUSIC ends. This is their moment. Luther heads over. 
           Lucille follows close behind.

                                 LUTHER
                        Governor?

           John turns toward them -- FLASHES a glowing smile and offers 
           his hand to Luther.

                                 JOHN SLATON
                        Luther. Good to see you.
                             (re: Lucille)
                        This doesn’t look like Julia.

                                 LUTHER
                        She’s at home with the flu.

                                 JOHN SLATON
                        Britt Craig is just over there. 

           John NODS toward Britt Craig drinking heavily at the bar, 
           surrounded by BEAUTIFUL WOMEN.

                                 JOHN SLATON (CONT’D)
                        It would be quite the scandal if he 
                        sees you out with another woman.

                                 LUTHER
                        Governor, I’d like to introduce you 
                        to Mrs. Frank.

           He SHAKES her hand too -- ALL SMILES.

                                 JOHN SLATON
                        Pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Frank.

                                 LUTHER
                        Mrs. Leo Frank.

           John’s smile DROPS. He looks around, nervous. He leans into 
           Luther, his voice low and threatening.
                                 JOHN SLATON
                        You get her out of here and you get 
                        her out of here right now.

                                 LUTHER
                        We just need five minutes.

                                 JOHN SLATON
                        No.

                                 LUTHER
                        Five--

                                 JOHN SLATON
                        -I’m walking away now.

                                 LUCILLE
                        You take one step and I’ll start 
                        screamin’.

           John Slaton EYES Lucille. She’s not fucking around. John’s 
           wife, Sarah, SQUEEZES his hand.

                                 SARAH
                        John...

           John SWALLOWS his anger, considers this.

           ON BRITT CRAIG

           He’s LAUGHING at something one of the WOMEN has said. Through 
           his drunken haze, Britt SPOTS John, Luther, and Lucille head 
           out onto the balcony. What the hell is going on???

           EXT. GOVERNOR’S MANSION - BALCONY - NIGHT

           Away from the PARTY GUESTS, John Slaton FUMES.

                                 JOHN SLATON
                        You brought her to my--Do you have 
                        any idea what would happen if she 
                        were found? There’s a goddamned 
                        election coming!

                                 LUTHER
                        There is? Must’ve slipped my mind.

                                 JOHN SLATON
                        You think this is some kind of 
                        joke?
                             (to Lucille)
                        And you, Mrs. Frank! I don’t 
                        appreciate being blackmailed.
                                 LUCILLE
                        I don’t care!

                                 JOHN SLATON
                        Remember who you are speaking to, 
                        little lady.

                                 LUCILLE
                        No! 

                                 JOHN SLATON
                        Lower your voice or this is over.

                                 LUCILLE
                        It’s already over! We’ve been to 
                        the Georgia Supreme Court, the U.S. 
                        Supreme Court and they all say the 
                        same thing: my husband has to die. 
                        Not because he’s guilty, but 
                        because he’s a Jew and doesn’t look 
                        like you or pray like you. And 
                        because a mob of cowards with 
                        bedsheets over their heads began 
                        marching in the streets with 
                        torches chanting my husband’s name!
                        I’m tired of sitting back and doing 
                        nothing while you men make all the 
                        decisions that have landed my 
                        husband on death row. I will no 
                        longer be silent!

           I will not cry, I will not cry...

                                 LUCILLE (CONT’D)
                        You are all we have left.

           John Slaton GLARES at them. He’s beyond angry, but Lucille 
           going toe-to-toe with him was impressive.

                                 JOHN SLATON
                        Take her out the back--

                                 LUCILLE
                        -I’m not leaving--

                                 JOHN SLATON
                        -Go out back. Leave quietly and 
                        leave now and I’ll review the court 
                        documents myself.
                             (to Luther)
                        You can get them to me?

                                 LUTHER
                        First thing tomorrow.
                                 JOHN SLATON
                        I’m not making any promises.

           He moves past them. As he goes, John addresses Luther...

                                 JOHN SLATON (CONT’D)
                        Don’t ever try this shit again.

           INT. GOVERNOR’S MANSION - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           John and Sarah undress for bed. 

                                 SARAH
                        What did that Frank woman want?

                                 JOHN SLATON
                        Clemency for her husband.

                                 SARAH
                        I was reading about it in The 
                        Jeffersonian. William Simmons 
                        really has it out for him. 

                                 JOHN SLATON
                        Everyone’s got to have a hobby.

                        All that hollerin’ and yellin’ and 
                        screamin’ outside that courthouse. 
                        Can’t imagine what it was like to 
                        be on that jury with all that 
                        nonsense goin’ on outside. 

                                 JOHN SLATON
                        Now you’ve got an opinion on this 
                        too?

                                 SARAH
                        Little old me? Never.

           She KISSES her husband.

                                 JOHN SLATON
                        You don’t play fair.

           INT. GEORGIA CAPITAL BUILDING - DAY

           John Slaton walks through the majestic halls with his chief 
           of staff, MARTIN, 38.  

                                 JOHN SLATON
                        Confirm dinner with Judge Harris. 
                                 MARTIN
                        Nathaniel Harris? You aren’t 
                        serious.

                                 JOHN SLATON
                        I want to scare him off.

                                 MARTIN
                        Judge Harris doesn’t scare easy. If 
                        he’s gonna run against you, he’s 
                        gonna do it. No steak dinner is 
                        gonna change that.

                                 JOHN SLATON
                        I’m still Governor, Martin. I’m 
                        also not a thousand years old. Set 
                        the dinner.

                                 MARTIN
                        Will do.

                                 JOHN SLATON
                        Oh and I’m expecting some files 
                        from Luther Rosser. Let me know 
                        when they get here.

                                 MARTIN
                        They’re here.
                             (off Slaton’s look)
                        Arrived about an hour ago.

           INT. SLATON’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           TWO DOZEN BOXES line the floors. John Slaton looks at the 
           massive amount of work before him. Sighs.

           INT. LEO’S CELL - DAY

           Lucille explains what happened to Leo.

                                 LUCILLE
                        I met with Slaton. He’s going to 
                        look into your case. 

                                 LEO
                        I think it’s time we had a real 
                        conversation. 

                                 LUCILLE
                        This is a real conversation.
                                 LEO
                        I mean about my future.

                                 LUCILLE
                        That’s what I’m talking about. 
                        Didn’t you hear me? Slaton is going 
                        to reopen your case.

                                 LEO
                        A case that’s been denied by every 
                        court in the land? We lost, 
                        Lucille.

                                 LUCILLE
                        We haven’t--

                                 LEO
                        -Yes, we have.

                                 LUCILLE
                        Did you not hear me? 

                                 LEO
                        Did you not hear me?

           That STINGS Lucille.

                                 LUCILLE
                        No, you’re right as always. It was 
                        silly of me. To go and beg for my 
                        husband’s life from the only man on 
                        earth who can save him.

                                 LEO
                        Lucille--

                                 LUCILLE
                        -Smart, Leo. You’ve always been so 
                        smart. No one else could possibly 
                        have an idea that might help.

                                 LEO
                        That’s not what I--

                                 LUCILLE
                        -Maybe I should just go home and 
                        bake those biscuits you love so 
                        much until the police come and tell 
                        me you’ve been hanged.

                                 LEO
                        I’m sorry--
                                 LUCILLE
                        -Crosses are burned on our lawn! 
                        Rocks are thrown through our 
                        windows! I get SPAT on when I walk 
                        down the street! 

           He tries to touch her, but Lucille BATS his hands away. Leo 
           takes the hint. A beat, then:

                                 LEO
                        You really went to Slaton’s home?

                                 LUCILLE
                        Yes.

                                 LEO
                        Bet you scared the crap out of him.

           Lucille tries not to smile. Then:

                                 LUCILLE
                        Do you need anything? 

                                 LEO
                        No. I’m all set.

                                 LUCILLE
                        I’ll be back tomorrow.

           She GATHERS her things -- heads out. Leo SITS on his bed, 
           puts his head in his hands.

           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           High end as it gets. Nathaniel Harris SHAKES hands with John 
           Slaton as the men take their seats.

                                 JOHN SLATON
                        Thanks for taking the time, Your 
                        Honor.

                                 NATHANIEL HARRIS
                        I was surprised to get your call.

                                 JOHN SLATON
                        I wanted to pick your brain. 
                        Figured a free meal would do the 
                        trick.

                                 NATHANIEL HARRIS
                        A bottle of whiskey wouldn’t hurt 
                        either.
           Slaton LAUGHS as he opens his menu.

           INT. RESTAURANT - LATER

           A bottle’s half gone. Nathaniel SIPS his.

                                 NATHANIEL HARRIS
                        This about Leo Frank?

                                 JOHN SLATON
                        Did someone say something?

                                 NATHANIEL HARRIS
                        I’m just a good guesser. What’s on 
                        your mind?

           John Slaton eyes Nathaniel for a moment, then:

                                 JOHN SLATON
                        I’ve been reviewing the case file.

                                 NATHANIEL HARRIS
                        Who got to you?

                                 JOHN SLATON
                        The wife.

                                 NATHANIEL HARRIS
                        Begging for the life of her 
                        husband? He’s innocent, wrongfully 
                        convicted. Mob influenced the jury.

                                 JOHN SLATON
                        Something like that.

                                 NATHANIEL HARRIS
                        You’ve got a soft heart. No 
                        offense.

           Ignoring that...

                                 JOHN SLATON
                        You followed the trial?

                                 NATHANIEL HARRIS
                        Every bump and bruise.

                                 JOHN SLATON
                        And?

                                 NATHANIEL HARRIS
                        And I think a jury of his peers 
                        convicted Leo Frank.
                                 JOHN SLATON
                        Nothing about it bothers you?

                                 NATHANIEL HARRIS
                        I can’t give you permission, John. 
                        You wanna do something about Leo 
                        Frank, it’s up to you.

                                 JOHN SLATON
                        I’m aware of that. And it’s 
                        Governor. Not John.

           That annoys Nathaniel, but he NODS, accepting the correction.

                                 NATHANIEL HARRIS
                        People in this city won’t react 
                        well to a commutation.

                                 JOHN SLATON
                        I’ve gotten 15,000 pieces of mail 
                        begging for one. From state reps, 
                        college Presidents, even Judge 
                        Roan. The Governors of North 
                        Dakota, Nevada, and Arkansas. All 
                        asking the same thing. It’s been 
                        two years. The fever’s broken.

                                 NATHANIEL HARRIS
                        You also have an election to think 
                        about.

                                 JOHN SLATON
                        That isn’t a factor here.

                                 NATHANIEL HARRIS
                        For fuck’s sake.

                                 JOHN SLATON
                        It’s not.

                                 NATHANIEL HARRIS
                        Then why’s my ass in this chair? 
                        You know what you want to do. Who 
                        knows. Maybe I’m wrong. Maybe the 
                        people of Atlanta will thank you 
                        for righting a wrong against an 
                        intolerable injustice.
                             (Slaton thinks on that)
                        More whiskey?

           INT. RESTAURANT - LOBBY - NIGHT

           The men head toward the exit together. Nathaniel STOPS short.  
                                 NATHANIEL HARRIS
                        I’m gonna run to the washroom. Was 
                        good to see you, Governor.

                                 JOHN SLATON
                        Thanks for the advice.

           The men SHAKE hands. John Slaton exits. Nathaniel turns to a 
           sharp looking MAITRE D’.

                                 NATHANIEL HARRIS
                        Might I use your telephone for a 
                        quick call?

                                 MAITRE D’
                        Of course, Your Honor.

           The Maitre D’ hands a ROTARY PHONE over and leaves to give 
           Nathaniel some privacy. Nathaniel SPINS the dial. Then:

                                 NATHANIEL HARRIS
                        Hugh, Judge Harris here. Do you 
                        have a minute?

           INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. HUGH DORSEY’S HOME - SAME

           Hugh’s in his foyer, talking on the phone. His wife, ADAIR, 
           33, has dinner in the background with their two CHILDREN.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        Of course. What can I do for you?

                                 NATHANIEL HARRIS
                        I had an enlightening conversation 
                        with Governor Slaton just now.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        Is that so? What’d he say?

           Hugh LISTENS -- the look on his face says it all. He’s 
           panicked and pissed. Adair calls out to him...

                                 ADAIR
                        Hugh, your supper is gettin’ cold.

           Hugh HANGS UP -- puts on his coat and hurries out of the 
           house. Adair gets up -- FOLLOWS after him.

                                 ADAIR (CONT’D)
                        Hugh! Where on earth do you think 
                        you’re goin’?
           INT. WILLIAM SIMMONS HOME - NIGHT

           Hugh Dorsey PACES as William Simmons sits behind his desk. 
           George Epps leans against the door, smoking.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        Can you believe this? Can you 
                        FUCKING believe this!?! 

                                 WILLIAM SIMMONS
                        Calm down, Hugh.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        Slaton is getting thousands of 
                        letters a month begging for Frank’s 
                        commutation. He’s going to be a 
                        goddamned hero and all the work 
                        I’ve done--

                                 WILLIAM SIMMONS
                        -we’ve done.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        It’ll all have been for nothing. 
                        Goodbye Governorship. I’ll end up 
                        prosecuting kids like him for 
                        loitering outside the VFW Hall!!! 

           George continues to SMOKE that cigarette, pompous as hell. 
           Hugh takes a breath -- still mad as hell. 

                                 WILLIAM SIMMONS
                        Slaton won’t be a hero. He’ll be a 
                        pariah, letting kiddie killers 
                        loose left and right.

                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        And who’s going to believe that?

           William ignores that -- turns to George.

                                 WILLIAM SIMMONS
                        You think our boys got another 
                        round in them?

                                 GEORGE
                        They’ve got as many as you need.

           William turns back to Hugh Dorsey -- ALL SMILES.

                                 WILLIAM SIMMONS
                        When’s the announcement coming?
                                 HUGH DORSEY
                        A day or two.

                                 WILLIAM SIMMONS
                        I think that’ll give us enough time 
                        to be ready.

           INT. SLATON’S OFFICE - DAY

           Slaton writes at his desk -- writing his decision.

                                 JOHN SLATON (V.O.)
                        “This case against Leo Frank has 
                        been the subject of extensive 
                        comments through the newspapers of 
                        the United States and has 
                        occasioned the transmission of over 
                        100,000 letters from various States 
                        requesting clemency, many of those 
                        communications have been advocating 
                        or opposing interference with the 
                        sentence of the court. The people 
                        of the State of Georgia desire the 
                        esteem and good will of those in 
                        every State in the Union...” 

           INT. ATLANTA CONSTITUTION - AFTERNOON

           A PAGE hands an OFFICIAL DOCUMENT to Britt Craig. He looks it 
           over -- EYES go wide. Britt sits down and starts TYPING.

                                 JOHN SLATON (V.O.)
                        “To maintain that esteem, it’s time 
                        to look deeper into the facts of 
                        the case. Many newspapers have 
                        attacked the State of Georgia, 
                        because the conviction of Leo Frank 
                        was through the domination of a mob 
                        with no evidence to support the 
                        verdict...”

           INT. JOHN & FANNIE COLEMAN’S HOME - AFTERNOON

           Fannie reads the paper. Her heart breaks with every word...

                                 JOHN SLATON (V.O.)
                        “The murder committed was a most 
                        heinous one. A young girl was 
                        strangled to death by a cord tied 
                        around her throat and the offender 
                        deserves the penalty of death...” 
           INT. ATLANTA POLICE STATION - AFTERNOON

           R.J. Brown, W.F. Anderson, and Boots Rogers sit around the 
           station, reading that paper.

                                 JOHN SLATON (V.O.)
                        “The only question is as to the 
                        identity of the criminal. The 
                        responsibility is on the people of 
                        Georgia to protect the lives of her 
                        citizens and to maintain the 
                        dignity of her laws. But what if 
                        when maintaining that dignity 
                        overrides the protection of the 
                        lives of the people of Georgia?”

           INT. HUGH DORSEY’S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

           Hugh PACES around as he reads.

                        “My duty under the Constitution is 
                        a matter of conscience. I can 
                        endure misconstruction, abuse and 
                        condemnation, but I cannot stand a 
                        constant, accusing conscience, 
                        which would remind me in every 
                        thought that I failed to do what I 
                        thought to be right...”

           INT. JUDGE ROAN’S HOME - AFTERNOON

           Roan SIPS a drink as he reads.

                                 JOHN SLATON (V.O.)
                        “There is a territory ‘beyond a 
                        reasonable doubt and absolute 
                        certainty’, for which the law 
                        provides in allowing life 
                        imprisonment instead of execution.”

           Reuben, too, is reading the paper.

           Lucille can’t believe what she’s reading...

                        “In my judgement, by granting a

           With that, she’s up and out of her chair and out the door...

           EXT. ATLANTA STREETS - NIGHT

           Lucille RUNS down the street as fast as she can, DODGING the 
           CITIZENS of Atlanta as she hurries to Leo.

                                 JOHN SLATON (V.O.)

                        “And at the same time I am

           INT. ATLANTA JAIL - DAY

           Out of breath, Lucille accosts the WARDEN MAYCOMB.

                                 LUCILLE
                        I need to see my husband.

                                 WARDEN MAYCOMB
                        He’s not here, Mrs. Frank.

                                 LUCILLE
                        What??? Where is he?

                                 WARDEN MAYCOMB
                        The train station.

           EXT. ATLANTA STREETS - NIGHT

           Lucille is back to running. She KICKS OFF her shoes and RUNS 
           barefoot -- anything that will get her to the station sooner.

                                 JOHN SLATON (V.O.)
                        “Acting in accordance with what I 
                        believe to be my duty under the 
                        circumstances of this case...”

           EXT. ATLANTA TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

           Lucille ARRIVES at the crowded station. She looks around, 
           desperately trying to find her husband. 

                                 JOHN SLATON (V.O.)
                        “It is ORDERED: That the sentence 
                        in the case of Leo M. Frank is 
                        commuted from the death penalty to 
                        imprisonment for life.”

           Then Lucille SPOTS two GUARDS with a cloaked Leo. He sees 
           her, too. Tears SPRING from Lucille’s eyes as she walks those 
           last few feet and throws her arms around her husband.

                                 LEO
                        You did this. You did all of this. 

           That only makes Lucille hold Leo tighter.
                                 LEO (CONT’D)
                             (re: cloak)
                        Do you like my disguise? I’m 
                        supposed to be sick.

                                 LUCILLE
                        Where are they taking you?

                                 LEO
                        Macon. I’m convict 965 now.

           A GUARD steps up to them.

                                 GUARD
                        It’s time.

           Leo NODS -- turns back to Lucille. What could he possibly say 
           to her? How could he possibly express his gratitude? 

           Instead of words, Leo KISSES Lucille. It’s the first time 
           we’ve seen them be romantic with each another. It’s tender 
           and loving; they’re totally connected to one another... but 
           then it’s over. 

           Lucille WATCHES as the GUARDS guide Leo to the train. He 
           takes a step on board -- turns back and offers a SMALL SMILE. 
           With that, Leo gets on the train. Lucille bravely watches as 
           it pulls out of the station.

           EXT. ATLANTA STREETS - NIGHT

           Fifty members of the KU KLUX KLAN march down the streets of 
           Atlanta, clad in WHITE SHEETS. The TORCHES they carry 
           illuminate the night.

                        We want the Jew! Give us the Jew!!!

           They arrive at the jail. The CHANTING continues. Rocks get 
           THROWN, BREAKING windows.

                                 KU KLUX KLAN (CONT’D)
                        We want the Jew! Give us the Jew!!!

           Warden Maycomb and his GUARDS come out of the jail, SHOTGUNS 
           in hand. They aren’t fucking around.

                                 WILLIAM SIMMONS
                        Turn over Leo Frank!!! 

           The KLAN CHEERS.
                                 WARDEN MAYCOMB
                        You boys are making a mistake.

                                 WILLIAM SIMMONS
                        The only mistake is that son of a 
                        bitch Slaton commuting Frank’s 
                        sentence. The people of Atlanta 
                        demand justice.

                                 WARDEN MAYCOMB
                        Well, no justice is gonna happen 
                        here tonight. Frank was 
                        transferred.

                                 WILLIAM SIMMONS
                        To where?

                                 WARDEN MAYCOMB 
                        Funny the governor didn’t include 
                        me in his thinking. Go on home, 
                        boys. Or if you want... 

           The GUARDS COCK the SHOTGUNS -- AIM them at the KLAN.

                                 WARDEN MAYCOMB (CONT’D)
                        We can keep discussing the matter.

           William Simmons STANDS his ground, but sees that the WARDEN 
           isn’t messing around. George Epps SPOTS Boots Rogers among 
           the GUARDS with SHOTGUNS. He gives George a little NOD. 

           George WHISPERS something to William Simmons. Slowly, William 
           backs away and the KLAN follows. George hides in the SHADOWS 
           while all the others leave. Warden Maycomb turns to a GUARD.

                                 WARDEN MAYCOMB (CONT’D)
                        Get Governor Slaton on the phone.

           The GUARD NODS. Maycomb goes inside along with the others. 
           Boots Rogers LIGHTS a cigarette and talks a walk by himself.

           INT. GOVERNOR’S MANSION - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Clothes are THROWN into suitcases. It’s hurried, panicked. 
           Sarah tries to get her jewelry into a box.

                                 JOHN SLATON
                        Leave it! We don’t have much time.

                                 SARAH
                        These pearls were my grandmothers.

                                 JOHN SLATON
                        Well those cowards are pissed and 
                        have torches, so lets hurry it--

           That’s when they hear the CHANTING coming in the distance. 
           John and Sarah get very quiet as it gets louder and louder.

           EXT. GOVERNOR’S MANSION - NIGHT

           The KLAN has grown. TORCHES as far as the eye can see. 
           William Simmons leads the CHANTING.

                                 JOHN SLATON
                        My god...

           EXT. GOVERNOR’S MANSION - NIGHT

           William Simmons MOTIONS for the Klan to be quiet.

                                 WILLIAM SIMMONS
                        GOVERNOR!!!!!!!!!

           INT. GOVERNOR’S MANSION - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           John Slaton JOLTS away from the window as a ROCK comes 
           SMASHING through it.

                                 WILLIAM SIMMONS (O.S.)
                        Give us Leo Frank. Tell us where he 
                        is and all these fine people will 
                        go home and leave you in peace.

           Martin HURRIES in. 

                                 MARTIN
                        There are a hundred of them. We 
                        have a car out back, but you have 
                        to go and you have to go now.

                                 SARAH
                        This is crazy. This is our home!
                                 JOHN SLATON
                        Not anymore.

           EXT. ATLANTA JAIL - NIGHT

           Boots Rogers SMOKES his cigarette. George comes out of the 
           darkness -- takes off his hood.

                                 GEORGE
                        Where is he?

           EXT. GOVERNOR’S MANSION - NIGHT

           Without a response from John Slaton, there’s only one thing 
           for William Simmons to do...

                                 WILLIAM SIMMONS
                        It’s your funeral.

           He takes a TORCH and LIGHTS the house on FIRE.

           EXT. ATLANTA JAIL - NIGHT

           Boots Rogers keeps smoking that cigarette.

                                 BOOTS ROGERS
                        Rumor has it he’s in Macon. Better 
                        get to him right away. You don’t 
                        want Slaton moving that kike again.

           INT. GOVERNOR’S MANSION - NIGHT

           John Slaton and Sarah, each carrying a sleeping CHILD, RUN 
           down the stairs. Martin follows them with their SUITCASES. 
           FIRE has ENGULFED the FOYER -- SMOKE rises. John and Sarah 
           FLEE out the back of the mansion.

           EXT. GOVERNOR’S MANSION - BACKSIDE - NIGHT

           John Slaton and Sarah LOAD their children in the back of the 
           car. They, too, get in. Martin SHUTS the door.

                                 MARTIN
                        Go!!!

           John Slaton DRIVES the hell out of there as the Governor’s 
           mansion BURNS behind him.
           EXT. GOVERNOR’S MANSION - NIGHT

           As the mansion BURNS, George RUNS up to William Simmons. 

                                 GEORGE
                        We got him. He’s in Macon.

                                 WILLIAM SIMMONS
                        No kiddin’. I got a buddy doing 
                        time down in Macon.

                                 GEORGE
                        Our lucky day.

           That’s when SIRENS can he heard in the distance. The KLAN 
           disbands as help arrives.

           INT. WILLIAM SIMMONS HOME - NIGHT

           William SITS back in his chair -- dials a number. It RINGS 
           once, twice, then:

                                 WILLIAM SIMMONS
                        This is William Simmons. I’m sorry 
                        to bother you so late, but I was 
                        hoping to have a word with an 
                        inmate of yours. See, his Mama fell 
                        ill and--William Creen is his 
                        name... Yes, I’ll wait.
                             (a long beat, then:)
                        Bill Creen. Doin’ fine, thank you. 
                        I need a favor...

           INT. MILLEDGEVILLE PRISON - NIGHT

           It’s a dorm-military barracks style prison. ROWS OF BEDS with 
           INMATES sleeping. A GUARD guides Leo to his bed.

                                 GUARD
                        This is you. Get some sleep. Lights 
                        up at 6am.

           Leo NODS. He gets into bed -- closes his eyes and tries his 
           best to sleep.

           LATER

           It’s close to midnight. WILLIAM CREEN, 37, built like a bull, 
           SLIPS out of his bunk -- a PIECE OF METAL in hand. William 
           moves past the sleeping INMATES, arrives at Leo Frank’s bed, 
           who’s sound asleep by now. William RUNS his FINGER through 
           Leo’s HAIR -- PULLING it back to expose his THROAT.
           In one SWIFT MOTION, William SLASHES Leo’s throat!

           Leo SCREAMS as BLOOD SPURTS from his throat. He FALLS to the 
           floor as he tries to STOP the BLEEDING. William takes off 
           RUNNING as NIGHT WATCHMEN come RUSHING into the room, 
           FLIPPING on the LIGHTS.

           The other INMATES JOLT up in bed, annoyed at having been 
           woken by the noise and lights. The NIGHT WATCHMAN SPOT Leo in 
           a BLOODY HEAP on the floor.

                                 NIGHT WATCHMAN
                        Jesus.

           They go to Leo, unsure of what to do. There’s too much blood.

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        Give me some room.

           The NIGHT WATCHMEN part for an inmate JAMES MCNAUGHTON, 46, 
           middle-aged but handsome with kind eyes. James KNEELS down to 
           Leo -- the life is DRAINING out of him... He puts PRESSURE on 
           Leo’s neck to stop the blood from FLOWING.

                                 JAMES MCNAUGHTON
                        Get me a needle and some thread! 
                        Does anyone have a towel!?!

           INMATES SCURRY away to get James what he needs. He turns his 
           attention back to Leo.

                                 JAMES MCNAUGHTON (CONT’D)
                        You’re going to be O.K., Mr. Frank.

           Leo STARES up into his eyes, unsure of how he knows him. Can 
           this man be trusted?

                                 JAMES MCNAUGHTON (CONT’D)
                        I followed your trial. We have a 
                        few acquaintances in common.

           The NIGHT WATCHMEN return with the NEEDLE and THREAD. An 
           INMATE tries to hand him a TOWEL.  

                                 JAMES MCNAUGHTON (CONT’D)
                        Put pressure on his neck.

           The INMATE obeys as James THREADS the NEEDLE...

                                 JAMES MCNAUGHTON (CONT’D)
                        This is going to hurt. Try not to 
                        move.
           James gets to work on SEWING UP Leo’s neck. He STICKS the 
           NEEDLE into the SKIN -- Leo SCREAMS and THRASHES.

                                 JAMES MCNAUGHTON (CONT’D)
                        You’ll make this so much worse.
                             (Leo BRACES himself)
                        My trial was three years ago. 
                        Luther Rosser defended me while 
                        Reuben Arnold put me away for the 
                        rest of my life. Funny how they 
                        came together to help you and still 
                        managed to lose. We’re almost 
                        there. Just look right at me, Leo. 
                        Just one... more... and we... are 
                        all set.  

           Leo raises his hand to touch the STITCHES, but James STOPS 
           him from doing so.

                                 JAMES MCNAUGHTON (CONT’D)
                        I wouldn’t do that. It’s pretty 
                        raw, but you’ll live.

           Tears RUN down Leo’s face as the PRISON MEDICS arrive with a 
           stretcher. They LOAD Leo’s body and CARRY him away. 

           INT. LEO FRANK’S HOME - MORNING

           KNOCK KNOCK. Lucille answers to find Reuben standing there, 
           hat in hand. She tries to hold it together.

                                 LUCILLE
                        Is he... is he gone?

           Reuben SHAKES his head.

           INT. LEO FRANK’S HOME - KITCHEN - MORNING

           Lucille SIPS her coffee as Reuben explains.

                                 REUBEN
                        They got the guy. Put him in 
                        solitary for a couple months.

                                 LUCILLE
                        What happens when they let him out? 
                        He’ll just come after Leo again.

                                 REUBEN
                        One step at a time. Leo’s 
                        recovering in the medical wing. 
                        It’s private. He’s comfortable.  
                                 LUCILLE
                        I just... I thought he’d be safe 
                        out of Atlanta. We worked so hard 
                        and now... it’s like it’s never 
                        going to stop. Can we move him 
                        somewhere farther away? No one will 
                        know him if we send him to another 
                        state. I could talk to Governor 
                        Slaton again.

                                 REUBEN
                        Slaton’s gone. 
                             (off her look)
                        He fled the State of Georgia. We 
                        are without a governor until the 
                        next election. 

                                 LUCILLE
                        So there’s nothing we can do.

                                 REUBEN
                        Mrs. Frank, believe me when I tell 
                        you we’ve done everything humanly 
                        possible to help your husband. 
                        He’ll be O.K. They’ve got things 
                        under control now.

           INT. WILLIAM SIMMONS HOME - MORNING

           William reads the Atlanta Constitution with the headline: Leo 
           Frank’s Throat Cut By State Farm Prisoner.

           He POUNDS his fist on the paper. George leans against the 
           door, smoking.

                                 WILLIAM SIMMONS
                        It’s almost as if no one takes 
                        pride in their work anymore.

                                 GEORGE
                        Guess we better up our game, then.

                                 WILLIAM SIMMONS
                        Give those friends of yours a call. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Yeah? How many you think we need?

                                 WILLIAM SIMMONS
                        10 or 15 should do it.

                                 GEORGE
                        You want this thing to end?
                                 WILLIAM SIMMONS
                        I do. I really do.

                                 GEORGE
                        Maybe a few more then. Just to be 
                        on the safe side.

           George PUTS out his cigarette -- walks out of the house.

           INT. MILLEDGEVILLE PRISON - MEDICAL WARD - NIGHT

           DOCTOR JEROME, 58, cuddly grandpa type, attends to Leo Frank, 
           removing the bandage and inspecting the work done by James 
           McNaughton. Leo’s in a pissed off mood.

                                 DOCTOR JEROME
                        You’re lucky we have a doctor for 
                        an inmate. You never would’ve made 
                        it if they’d waited for me. Did a 
                        good job too.

                                 LEO
                        Will there be a scar? How long 
                        before the stitches can come out?

                                 DOCTOR JEROME
                        Normally, I’d say a week or two, 
                        but with this heat, that cut’s 
                        liable to pop right back open. 
                        Might be a couple of months before 
                        you’re fully healed.

                                 LEO
                        A couple months?

                                 DOCTOR JEROME
                        There a problem?

                                 LEO
                        Yes. How would you like all these 
                        pointy things sticking out of your 
                        neck for months on end?

                                 DOCTOR JEROME
                        It’s better than blood spurting out 
                        of my throat.

                                 LEO
                        You doctors are all the same. 
                        Always making things sound worse 
                        than they are so your patient has 
                        to come back again and again and 
                        you can get paid more.
                                 DOCTOR JEROME
                        You’re in prison. You’re not paying 
                        me a dime.

           Jerome SHAKES his head -- packs up his stuff, annoyed.

                                 LEO
                        You didn’t answer my question about 
                        the scarring, Dr. Jerome.

                                 DOCTOR JEROME
                        Contrary to your very insulting 
                        assertions, I’m not here to milk 
                        the state of Georgia for every 
                        penny I can get. I patch you up and 
                        send you off. That’s it.

                                 LEO
                        That’s not an answer.

                                 DOCTOR JEROME
                        I don’t traffic in vanity, Leo.

                                 LEO
                        I want to know.

                                 DOCTOR JEROME
                        Why do you care?!

                                 LEO
                        Because I don’t want to wake up 
                        every morning and look in the 
                        mirror and have a permanent 
                        reminder of when some monster put a 
                        knife to my throat!

           That sucks the air out of the room. Leo’s so mad he can’t see 
           straight. It all just comes flooding out...

                                 LEO (CONT’D)
                        They used to chant outside my cell. 
                        Lynch the Jew! Kill the Kike! I 
                        heard it all. Saw the glow of those 
                        torches. They wanted my blood so 
                        badly, but I believed if I kept my 
                        head up, retained an ounce of 
                        dignity, that one day the truth 
                        would come out. Now I can forget 
                        about the chanting, those god awful 
                        news headlines, and all the rest of 
                        it. I can. I will. So when I ask if 
                        there’s going to be a scar, I’m not 
                        trafficking in vanity. I’m asking 
                        because I don’t want it.

                        Not for me, not for my wife. Can 
                        you understand that, Dr. Jerome?

           Doctor Jerome NODS. He takes a beat, then:

                                 DOCTOR JEROME
                        My name is not Dr. Jerome. When my 
                        family came over from Russia, my 
                        father wanted an American sounding 
                        name and changed it from 
                        Jeromovitz. My son hates this 
                        story. See, he’s very proud of 
                        being Jewish, a bit younger than 
                        you, too smart for his own good, 
                        likes to argue about anything and 
                        everything. So when the time comes 
                        for him to apply to college, he 
                        wants to use the family name. I try 
                        to tell him, “No, no, no,” but my 
                        son, he won’t listen to reason. But 
                        he gets in without a problem, so 
                        ok. So far, so good. Then he goes 
                        to class the first day and they 
                        read the names out loud. Then there 
                        are boys waiting for him after 
                        class. They beat him. Split his 
                        lip, blacken his eye. Urinate on 
                        him. They tell him to drop out. But 
                        my son is stubborn, like you. He is 
                        not afraid. He says nothing of 
                        what’s happened and goes back the 
                        next day. After class, the boys 
                        beat him again. Day after day this 
                        goes on for two years until my son 
                        graduates top of his class. 

                                 LEO
                        Good for him.

                                 DOCTOR JEROME
                        No, it was bad for him. He lost the 
                        light in his eyes. He became hard.

                                 LEO
                        You’re telling me he should’ve kept 
                        your American name? Hid who he was?

                                 DOCTOR JEROME
                        You misunderstand. He hid what was 
                        happening from his own father. The 
                        shame of that, I think, was worse 
                        than the beatings. 
                             (a beat, then:)
                        We all have scars, my boy.
           Dr. Jerome holds Leo’s hand -- BENDS down and KISSES his 
           hair. That’s when Leo loses it. He’s held himself together 
           for so long. And there in the arms of a stranger, Leo weeps.

           EXT. ATLANTA STREETS - NIGHT

           A string of SEVEN AUTOMOBILES speed out of town...

           INT. MILLEDGEVILLE PRISON - MEDICAL WARD - NIGHT

           Somehow, Leo has managed to fall asleep...

           EXT. MILLEDGEVILLE PRISON - NIGHT

           The AUTOMOBILES come to a STOP in front of the prison, which 
           is illuminated by a scant few lights. Twenty-five KLAN 
           MEMBERS (in their SHEETS and HOODS) descend the vehicles -- 
           MOVING very quickly. They GRAB BRICKS to SMASH the lights -- 
           SHROUDING the entire prison in darkness. 

           Others SLIDE under the POLICE AUTOMOBILES -- CUTTING the gas 
           lines... KLAN MEMBERS PRY open a FUSE BOX with a CROWBAR to 
           CUT the phone lines...

           Now there’s no light. No one to call for help. And no way for 
           anyone to follow them. It’s time to storm the prison.

           EXT. MILLEDGEVILLE PRISON - ENTRANCE - NIGHT

           TWO GUARDS smoke cigarettes and LAUGH at something unheard to 
           us when the KLAN MEMBERS descend upon them. 

           Before they can scream, the KLAN BASH their heads with bats.

           INT. MILLEDGEVILLE PRISON - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           The KLAN march through the halls -- LOOKING for Leo Frank. 
           They TURN a corner... and RUN straight into a GUARD -- he 
           tries to draw his gun, but one of the KLAN KNOCKS him out 
           with the crowbar. They continue on.

           INT. MILLEDGEVILLE PRISON - NIGHT

           It’s the open dormitory where all the PRISONERS sleep (and 
           where Leo Frank was attacked). The KLAN enters -- SILENTLY 
           slipping from bed to bed, CHECKING for Leo Frank. They FAN 
           out, but soon find that he’s not there. Furious, one of the 
           KLAN wakes a PRISONER -- PUTS a KNIFE to his throat.
                                 KLAN LEADER
                        Where’s Frank?

           INT. MILLEDGEVILLE PRISON - MEDICAL WARD - NIGHT

           Leo OPENS his eyes. He JOLTS as he sees those HOODED FIGURES 
           standing over him.

                                 LEO
                        No, no, no...

           They put a BAG over his head.

           INT. MILLEDGEVILLE PRISON - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Leo STUMBLES in his nightgown as he’s led out by the KLAN. 
           From above, a GUARD SPOTS them -- hurries off.

           EXT. MILLEDGEVILLE PRISON - NIGHT

           The KLAN SHOVES Leo down the steps as an ALARM sounds. Leo 
           STRUGGLES against them as the KLAN literally PICKS HIM UP and 
           THROWS him into the back of a automobile. The KLAN vehicles 
           SPEED off into the night...

           GUARDS -- with GUNS drawn -- come RUNNING out of the prison. 
           They JUMP in their automobiles -- try to turn over the 
           engine, but there’s no gas...

           INT. AUTOMOBILE - NIGHT

           Trying to keep calm, Leo sits in utter silence between four 
           of the KLAN. Then:

                                 LEO
                        Where are you taking me?

           Nothing from them. Leo looks from one man to the next, but 
           their faces are covered with those damn sheets.

                                 KLAN LEADER
                        Pull over up ahead.

           EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT

           The lead automobile pulls to a STOP. The others follow suit -- 
           their HEADLIGHTS the only thing to illuminate our view. The 
           KLAN PULLS Leo from the car. He SHAKES in his thin nightgown.
                                 KLAN LEADER
                        We are the Knights of Mary Phagan, 
                        Mr. Frank. We’re here for your 
                        confession.

                                 LEO
                        I... can’t do that.

                                 KLAN LEADER
                        Mr. Frank, you don’t understand. 
                        Mary Phagan had a family, people 
                        that loved her. They need answers.

           Leo EYES a SHOTGUN in one of their hands. He takes a breath 
           to steady himself. Then:

                                 LEO
                        I cannot confess to something I 
                        didn’t do.

                                 KLAN LEADER
                        You sure about that?

                                 LEO
                             (trying not to cry)
                        Yes. I am.

                                 KLAN LEADER
                        Bring him.

           They head toward an old OAK TREE on a hill nearby. Leo holds 
           his head high -- unable to sink to the level of these men. 

           But then:

                                 KLAN MEMBER 
                        STOP!

           The KLAN LEADER turns to the dissenter in the crowd. He’s 
           surprised. Leo’s surprised too.

                                 KLAN MEMBER (CONT’D)
                        He don’t sound guilty to me.

                                 KLAN LEADER
                        Is that so?

                                 KLAN MEMBER
                        You’re marching him off to his 
                        death and he’s still sticking to 
                        his story. I know I’d be singing a 
                        different tune if I was him and I 
                        know a few of you would be too.
           The KLAN LEADER isn’t moved.

                                 KLAN MEMBER (CONT’D)
                        We can take him back.

           There’s a long moment of silence. Leo WATCHES the two men 
           face off -- his life in the balance.

                                 KLAN MEMBER 2
                        Or we can just leave him here.

                                 KLAN MEMBER 3
                        Yeah. Let him walk back.

           More and more MURMURS come from the crowd. Leo’s seeing the 
           hate thaw before his very eyes...

           But then:

                                 KLAN LEADER
                        Y’all should be ashamed of 
                        yourselves. Mary Phagan was family. 
                        And you wanna turn your back on her 
                        like she don’t matter.
                             (a beat, then:)
                        It’s too late now, anyway. People 
                        will come for him.

           The walk him into Frey’s woods. A ROPE gets TOSSED over the 
           branch of a tree. His hands and feet are BOUND -- a SACK TIED 
           around his waist.

           There’s a picnic table nearby. Two of the KLAN MEMBERS bring 
           it over. 

                                 KLAN LEADER (CONT’D)
                        Get on up on there.

           Leo OBEYS -- SHAKING as he CLIMBS onto the table. One of the 
           other Klan Members joins him -- PLACING the NOOSE around his 
           neck. Then comes the BLINDFOLD over Leo’s eyes.

           That’s when Leo trembles, almost unable to stand. The Klan 
           Member who placed the blindfold over Leo’s eyes gets off the 
           table. This is happening. Panicked, Leo calls out...

                                 LEO
                        Wait! Wait for one second.

           Everyone STOPS. No one moves. They await what Leo has to say.

                                 LEO (CONT’D)
                        My wedding ring. Can someone get it 
                        to my wife? 
           Again, no one moves. Not one inch.

                                 LEO (CONT’D)
                        Please...

           He looks out into the crowd of men in sheets. A sea of hate 
           before him... then:

                                 KLAN MEMBER
                        I will.

           It’s the one who tried to get the others to turn back. He 
           goes to Leo -- takes his hand and removes Leo’s WEDDING RING.

           When the act is over, the KLAN MEMBER steps back into the 
           mob. Leo’s breathing quickens...

                                 KLAN LEADER
                        Mr. Frank, we are now going to do 
                        what the law said to do. Hang you 
                        by the neck until you are dead.

                                 LEO
                             (SHAKING)
                        I love my wife... I love my wife 
                        more than I love my life...

           The KLAN LEADER KICKS the table out from beneath Frank’s feet 
           -- Leo’s body DROPS, SNAPPING his neck.

           The KLAN MEMBERS stand there as the sun begins to rise, 
           WATCHING as Leo’s DEAD BODY SWINGS before them. It’s a moment 
           of silence, a moment of shock... but then:

           The KLAN MEMBERS begin to CHEER and that CHEER turns into a 
           ROAR -- HIGH FIVES and BLACK SLAPPING.

           It becomes a celebration...

           EXT. WILL FREY’S BARN - DAWN

           WILL FREY, 48, tends to his horses on his farm, but a NOISE 
           CATCHES his attention. He turns to see FOUR AUTOMOBILES 
           RACING down the road.

           Will Frey raises an eyebrow, curious.

           EXT. FREY’S GROVE - DAWN

           The KLAN’s gone by now, but they’ve been replaced by 
           ONLOOKERS, who are there to celebrate. They RIP pieces of 
           Leo’s SLEEVES, CUT strands of the ROPE for trophies.
           Will Frey ARRIVES in his wagon -- sees the disgusting display 
           before him...

           EXT. JUDGE MORRIS’ HOME - DAWN

           KNOCK KNOCK. NEWTON MORRIS, 67, old timer who’s been retired 
           for years, answers the door -- WIPING sleep from his eyes. 
           Will Frey STANDS before him. 

                                 NEWTON MORRIS
                        Will Frey, what can I do you for at 
                        this ungodly hour?

                                 WILL FREY
                        Sorry, Judge, but I got a mob down 
                        at my grove by the old oak. They 
                        lynched a man.

                                 NEWTON MORRIS
                        That so?

                                 WILL FREY
                        Looks like it might be Leo Frank.

                                 NEWTON MORRIS
                             (a beat, then:)
                        You got a shotgun?

           EXT. FREY’S GROVE - LATER

           Will Frey arrives with Judge Morris and his friend, JOHN 
           WOOD, 55 -- SHOTGUNS in hand. They take in the scene: TROPHY 
           COLLECTORS SNAP PHOTOGRAPHS of Leo’s SWINGING BODY.

           FLASH FLASH FLASH!

           They get in the shot, smiling big and bright, like they are 
           taking a selfie.

           FLASH FLASH FLASH!

           One MAN poses next with Leo with his hand on him -- like he’s 
           some kind of big game hunter who’s proud of his catch. An OLD 
           MAN WAGS his finger at Leo’s dead body...

                                 OLD MAN
                        Now we’ve got you! You won’t murder 
                        any more little girls. We’ve got 
                        you! We’ve got you now!!!

           Judge Morris FIRES his SHOTGUN into the air. Everyone turns 
           their attention toward them.
                                 JUDGE MORRIS
                        That’s about enough. You all are 
                        trespassing! Go on home now.

           No one moves. Not one inch. Judge Morris NODS to Will Frey 
           and John Wood. They get out of the wagon -- WEAVE their way 
           through the mob. Frey and Wood reach Leo’s SWINGING BODY. 
           Frey holds on to Leo as Wood uses a KNIFE to CUT him down. 
           Together, Frey and Wood carry Leo’s DEAD BODY to the wagon.

           The TROPHY HUNTERS are pissed at their fun having been ruined 
           and SPIT on Leo’s body. 

           Frey and Wood quickly LOAD Leo onto the wagon while Judge 
           Morris keeps his SHOTGUN TRAINED on the mob. Without another 
           word, they back the wagon up and get the hell out of there. 

           But the mob isn’t finished. They get on their horses and into 
           their automobiles and give chase...

           INT. WAGON - MORNING

           Judge Morris WHIPS the horses to go as fast as they can. Frey 
           and Wood have SHOTGUNS ready.

                                 JUDGE MORRIS
                        They following us?

                                 WILL FREY
                        You bet your ass.

                                 JUDGE MORRIS
                        Ain’t no way we’ll make it to town.

                                 JOHN WOOD
                        Head to my place. I got an idea.

           EXT. JOHN WOOD’S HOME - MORNING

           The wagon comes to a HALT. John Wood and Will Frey JUMP out -- 
           CARRYING LEO’S BODY to Wood’s automobile, which is hidden in 
           a barn. They LOAD him in before turning back to Judge Morris.

                                 JUDGE MORRIS
                        Get him to the Coroner. I’ll hold 
                        that mob off as long as I can.

           Judge Morris WHIPS his horses -- SPEEDING off. Frey and Wood 
           hide with Leo’s body in the backseat of the automobile as the 
           ANGRY MOB ROARS past, continuing after Morris’ wagon. Once 
           they’ve gone, Frey and Wood speed in the opposite direction. 
           INT. BLOOMFIELD’S FUNERAL HOME - MORNING

           Wood and Frey arrive with the body. Frey JUMPS out and BANGS 
           on the door of the funeral home. P.J. BLOOMFIELD answers.

                                 WILL FREY
                        We need your help.

           INT. BLOOMFIELD’S FUNERAL HOME - MOMENTS LATER

           Leo’s body is wheeled down a hallway. Bloomfield and John 
           Wood transfer Leo from a stretcher to a metal table.

                                 WILL FREY
                        I need your phone. The mob will 
                        come for Leo when they find he’s 
                        not in Morris’ wagon.

                                 P.J. BLOOMFIELD
                        My office.

           INT. ATLANTA POLICE STATION - MORNING

           R.J. Brown answers a RINGING phone.

                                 R.J. BROWN
                        This is Sergeant Brown.
                             (a beat, then:)
                        Shit... Yeah, we’ll be right there.

           He HANGS UP -- PUTS ON his jacket. W.F. Anderson comes in, 
           SPOTS him getting ready to leave.

                                 W.F. ANDERSON
                        What is it?

                                 R.J. BROWN
                        Leo Frank’s at Bloomfield’s. 

           That says it all.

                                 R.J. BROWN (CONT’D)
                        A mob’s on the way. We gotta go.

                                 W.F. ANDERSON
                        Anybody told the wife yet?

           INT. LEO FRANK’S HOME - MORNING

           KNOCK KNOCK. Lucille answers to find a YOUNG MAN, late 20s, 
           standing on her porch. He’s no one we’ve ever seen before.
                                 LUCILLE
                        Can I help you?
                             (he HANDS her an ENVELOPE)
                        What’s this?

           The YOUNG MAN NODS, turns, and takes off RUNNING down the 
           street. Lucille WATCHES him go. Then she turns her attention 
           back to the ENVELOPE -- OPENS it up. 

           It’s Leo’s WEDDING RING.

           Lucille TREMBLES as the phone RINGS. It RINGS and RINGS -- 
           like an ALARM going off. Somehow, she makes it to the phone.

                                 LUCILLE (CONT’D)
                             (her voice BREAKS)
                        Yes?

           There’s a long, long pause. Then:

                                 REUBEN (ON PHONE)
                        Lucille, I’m sorry to call so 
                        early... something’s happened...

           She SQUEEZES her eyes tight as the tears begin to flow...

           EXT. BLOOMFIELD’S FUNERAL HOME - DAY

           The MOB has found them. Hundreds of them. They CHANT and 
           CHEER -- desperate for the flesh and blood of Leo Frank. 
           Fifty OFFICERS stand guard to fend them off. R.J. Brown and 
           W.F. Anderson are among them...

                                 MOB
                        GIVE US THE JEW! THEY WILL NOT 
                        REPLACE US! GIVE US THE JEW! THEY 
                        WILL NOT REPLACE US!!!

           The SCREAMS grow LOUDER and LOUDER until it reaches a 
           crescendo as we...

                                                         FADE TO WHITE.

           FADE IN:

           INT. REUBEN ARNOLD’S OFFICE - DAY

           Reuben’s going over paperwork -- can’t find what he needs.

                                 REUBEN
                        Marta, do you have the Corrigan 
                        file...?
           He looks up to see Lucille Frank standing in his doorway. He 
           gets up -- goes to her.

                                 REUBEN (CONT’D)
                        Lucille. I lost track of the time.

                                 LUCILLE
                        I can come back if you’re--

                                 REUBEN
                        -No, no. This is just fine. 

           He GRABS his coat -- USHERS Lucille out.

           INT. REUBEN ARNOLD’S AUTOMOBILE - DAY

           Reuben DRIVES. Lucille STARES straight ahead as they approach 
           Bloomfield’s Funeral Home.

                                 REUBEN
                        I spoke to Gov. Slaton. He and 
                        Sarah... they wish they could be 
                        here, but with things as they are--

                                 LUCILLE
                        -I understand. Thank them for me.

                                 REUBEN
                        You takin’ him home?

                                 LUCILLE
                        To Brooklyn. Leo never really liked 
                        it here, but he stayed for me. Now 
                        it’s time I go for him.
                             (a beat)
                        I was reading a story in the paper. 
                        The same day Leo died, there was a 
                        young black man named John Riggins 
                        who was shot near Bainbridge. Did 
                        you read about that?

                                 REUBEN
                        No. I didn’t.

                                 LUCILLE
                        It seems a white woman accused Mr. 
                        Riggins of attacking her. The 
                        police brought him before her, she 
                        identified him as her assailant, 
                        and then he was shot a hundred 
                        times. No trial, no appeal, no 
                        pleas to the Governor. Gone. Just 
                        like that.
                                 (MORE)
                                 LUCILLE (CONT'D)
                             (a beat, then:)
                        Makes you wonder: What the hell 
                        kind of world are we living in?

           He doesn’t have an answer for that. They focus on the road 
           ahead...

           EXT. BLOOMFIELD’S FUNERAL HOME - DAY

           There’s no crowd here today. The fever has died down. Lucille 
           gets out of the car. Reuben does too. 

                                 LUCILLE
                        I won’t be long.

           She goes inside -- SHUTS the door. Reuben SMOKES a cigarette, 
           NOTICES a wagon nearby. It’s filled with SUITCASES. A DRIVER 
           tends to the horses.

           Another moment and Lucille reemerges with P.J. Bloomfield 
           who’s PUSHING a COFFIN on a cart. A couple of his MEN LOAD 
           the COFFIN into the wagon with the SUITCASES.

                                 P.J. BLOOMFIELD
                        I’m very sorry for your loss, Mrs. 
                        Frank.

           She NODS. Reuben helps Lucille into the wagon, gets in after 
           her. The DRIVER WHIPS the horses to get moving...

           EXT. ATLANTA STREETS - DAY

           It’s a day just like any other. Everyone has gone back to 
           their lives. But not Lucille. She SITS with her head held 
           high. No more tears left to cry.

           They PASS...

           R.J. Brown (Sgt first on the scene) STANDS with W.F. Anderson 
           (call officer with Brown) outside of the POLICE STATION with 
           Captain Dobbs (who told Mary’s family of her death).

           Lucille looks into the window of the ATLANTA CONSTITUTION. 
           She sees Britt Craig (the ambitious journalist) and Marvin 
           Ross (Britt’s boss) STARING right back at her.

           Boots Rodgers (racist officer) hangs out with his buddy, 
           George Epps (Mary’s radicalized boyfriend), William Simmons 
           (1915 KKK founder), and Pastor Stevens (preacher) outside the 
           VFW Hall. They SNEER at her, but Lucille is beyond caring.

           Newt Lee (the first suspect) SHUFFLES out of the post office.
           From above, Lucille SPOTS Hugh Dorsey (prosecutor) looking 
           down on her from his office with Frank Hooper (Dorsey’s right 
           hand man) and Thomas Felder (states attorney).

           Adair Dorsey (Hugh’s wife) comes out of the GENERAL STORE 
           with her children. Frances Arnold (Reuben’s wife) SHOPS for 
           dresses with some friends.

           Nathaniel Harris (Judge who wants to be Gov.) SHARES a joke 
           with Warden Maycomb (local Warden) and Judge Roan (Leo’s 
           judge) as they take a stroll. They STOP talking upon seeing 
           Lucille with that casket...

           Jim Conley (the star witness) UNLOADS a wagon. He can’t bring 
           himself to look at Lucille.

           Luther Rosser (Leo’s lawyer) comes out of his office -- STOPS 
           short upon seeing them. He NODS to Lucille in sympathy.

           Mr. Winburn (Leo’s jury foreman) HOISTS his daughter on his 
           shoulders, without a care in the world...

           Lucille SPOTS Herbert Schiff (Leo’s co-worker) hitching a 
           saddle to his horse.

           Will Frey (grove owner where Leo was lynched), Judge Morris 
           (ordered Leo Frank’s body cut down), and John Wood (drove 
           Leo’s body back to Atlanta) SHARE a drink outside a SALOON. 
           Lucille NODS to them -- mouths “thank you.”

           Dr. Hurt (Mary’s coroner) and Dr. Jerome (patched up Leo 
           after attack) look out at Lucille from the hospital.  

           And last, but certainly not least, Lucille sees Fannie 
           Coleman (Mary’s mother), John Coleman (Mary’s step-father), 
           and Grace Hicks (friend who identified Mary’s body). Lucille 
           and Fannie LOCK eyes... they’ve both lost so much... 

           Lucille looks back at everyone. Some have blood on their 
           hands. Others tried to help... 

                                 REUBEN
                        Lucille...?

                                 LUCILLE
                        I’m ready now.

           ... but today, everyone watches in silence until Lucille and 
           Leo Frank are out of sight...

                                                              FADE OUT.
