                               THIS IS GOING TO HURT

           EXT. HOUSE - DAWN

           First rays of daylight blanket suburban northern Virginia... 

           After a beat of silence, KIAN KEATING, 37, comes bounding out 
           the front door of his modest single-level house-- carrying a 
           LARGE HIKING BACKPACK and FOOD SUPPLIES. 

           He’s loading his not-so-new JEEP CHEROKEE. We get the sense 
           that although he’s doing well enough, newer hiking gear and 
           whatnot, he’s struggling at the moment. The five o’clock 
           shadow and heavy bags under his eyes are the giveaways. 

                                 KIAN
                             (yelling back)
                        Come on, Hanna! 

           HANNA KEATING, 13 years old, emo vibe, dry wit, appears in 
           the doorway, in full protest, still in a t-shirt and boxers. 
           She’s barely awake-- and her lack of enthusiasm in this 
           moment is undercut by a sense of rage that goes beyond simple 
           teen angst-- although, to be clear, she’s got that too. 

                                 HANNA
                        Why are you yelling? You’re gonna 
                        wake up the neighbors.

                                 KIAN
                             (whisper-yelling)
                        Hurry up and I won’t have to yell.

                                 HANNA
                        I told you, I’m not going.

                                 KIAN
                        I thought we were gonna have some 
                        father/daughter time this weekend?

                                 HANNA
                        That was before Maddy decided to 
                        have a pool party.

           Kian COUGHS a bit, grabbing a TISSUE from his pocket and 
           spitting in it. 

                                 KIAN
                        You have a lifetime of pool parties 
                        ahead of you.

                                 HANNA
                        The fuck does that mean?
                                 KIAN
                        Hey-- I don’t mind you saying 
                        “shit” from time to time, but no F-
                        word. Come on, grab your bag. 

                                 HANNA
                        You grab it. 

                                 KIAN
                        I don’t want to force you to go on 
                        this trip with me--

                                 HANNA
                        -- Thank you. 

                                 KIAN
                        But that’s what I’m gonna do. Be in 
                        the car in 10 or you’re grounded 
                        til you’re 20. 

           Hanna opens her mouth to rebut--

           INT. JEEP CHEROKEE, DRIVING - MORNING

           “Home” by Phillip Phillips blasts from the car’s speakers. 

           Kian’s devouring a DONUT while he drives. Hanna’s in the 
           passenger seat, staring at him with disgust. 

                                 KIAN
                        You don’t know what you’re missing. 

                                 HANNA
                        An early heart attack?

                                 KIAN
                        ... I mean, yes. But man, nothing 
                        beats a glazed. 
                             (beat)
                        Remember we used to dance around 
                        the living room to this song? That 
                        was fun, right?

                                 HANNA
                        That was a long time ago. 

                                 KIAN
                        Doesn’t mean it wasn’t fun.

           She shakes her head, embarrassed for him. 
                                 KIAN (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t want to rush you out the 
                        door, it’s not how I wanted to 
                        start this trip-- We just gotta get 
                        up there before sunset.  

           More silence from Hanna. Kian coughs again, spitting out the 
           window.

                                 HANNA
                        You gonna be able to make it?

                                 KIAN
                        Yeah. Are you?

           She just stares forward blankly, not answering. 

                                 KIAN (CONT’D)
                        I made this climb a million times 
                        with your grandpa. 

                                 HANNA
                        A million? 

                                 KIAN
                        ... It was a lot. Maybe a hundred 
                        if we’re in a literal mood.  

           EXT. MOUNTAIN TOP - DUSK

           Kian, now just TEN YEARS OLD, sits with his father, JERRY 
           KEATING, who’s 40 at the moment. 

           They’re sharing a BOX OF DONUTS, sitting on a rock that juts 
           out from the top of the mountain, providing 360 degree views 
           of the surrounding Shenandoah Valley. 

                                 YOUNG JERRY
                        Can you see it, Kian?

                                 YOUNG KIAN
                        See what?

                                 YOUNG JERRY
                        The reason we came up here. The 
                        bigger picture. Can you see it? 

           Kian squints, not fully understanding what his dad is talking 
           about--
           INT. CAR, DRIVING - MORNING (BACK TO PRESENT)

           Hanna looks back at the BAGS and GEAR Kian packed. Shakes her 
           head. 

                                 KIAN
                        Sure you don’t want a donut? We 
                        gotta save some for the top, but 
                        you can have one now if you want.

                                 HANNA
                        They’re full of carbs.

                                 KIAN
                        Carbs are good.

                                 HANNA
                        Carbs are fat. 

                                 KIAN
                        I mean, if you don’t burn them off, 
                        they could turn into fat, but we’re 
                        gonna burn it all off, trust me. 
                             (beat)
                        Also, you’re young. Don’t worry 
                        about that stuff. You want a donut, 
                        eat a donut.

           Kian reaches out to hold his daughter’s hand. She ignores it. 

           He then turns down the radio, trying a a different tactic:

                                 KIAN (CONT’D)
                             (tune of “How sweet it is 
                              to be loved by you”)
                        How sweet it is to be loved by poo.

                                 HANNA
                        Please don’t--

                                 KIAN
                        I needed the shelter of someone's 
                        poo... there you were...

           Hanna breaks, chuckling despite herself. Kian smiles, 
           connecting with his daughter for a moment.

           EXT. STRICKLER KNOB TRAIL, TRAIL HEAD - MORNING

           Kian and Hanna gear up. He’s doing the heavy lifting, full 
           hiking backpack and tent slung over his shoulders. 
           Hanna’s just got on a regular backpack, like a school 
           bookbag, which is half-full at best.  

                                 HANNA
                        Okay, we saw it, can we go home?

                                 KIAN
                        It’s not that hard. You can do it.

                                 HANNA
                        I know I can. That’s not why--

                                 KIAN
                        It’s not easy either. I remember 
                        the first time your grandpa took me-

                                 HANNA
                        Seriously, can you stop?? Can you 
                        just turn it off??

           Kian bends down, gets in close. On her level.

                                 KIAN
                        I know you don’t want to be here. 
                        But there’s gonna be a day where we 
                        can’t do this anymore... 

           She stares at him, relenting a hair. Breathing heavy. Angry 
           still. 

           He nods, feeling like he got through to her just enough and 
           starts his way up the mountain. She reluctantly follows.  

           They stride in silence for a few beats, just the crunch of 
           their boots against the dirt trail.  

           Kian’s trying to find the words. To get through to his 
           daughter, who he can feel slipping away from him.  

                                 KIAN (CONT’D)
                        You know your grandpa Jerry lived 
                        in Japan for six years?

                                 HANNA
                        Yeah, that’s where you got the name 
                        Hanna. 

                                 KIAN
                        I know you know a lot about him, 
                        and love him, but there’s one part 
                        I haven’t told you... He got sick 
                        too. And I was there with him. To 
                        help him get better. It had a huge 
                        impact on my life. And yours...
           INT. METRO CAR - DUSK

           KIAN, now 23 years old, rides the METRO from Reagan National 
           AIRPORT to the King Street Station in Alexandria, Virginia. 

           He leans against his MASSIVE SUITCASE for support. His mind 
           heavy and racing. He’s put together, but only because he 
           wants you to think his life is going better than it is. 

           EXT. STREETS OF ALEXANDRIA - DUSK

           Kian drags his suitcase over the brick sidewalks of Old Town 
           Alexandria, surrounded by quaint colonial row houses and 
           cobblestone streets. The wheels of his suitcase are being put 
           to the test, click-clacking as he goes.

           EXT. ZORA KEATING’S HOUSE - DUSK

           The front door to a modest ROW HOUSE swings open and Kian is 
           met by his PERSIAN MOTHER, ZORA KEATING, 51.  

                                 ZORA
                        Kian jan...

           (Note: “jan” means “dear” in Farsi) 

           She kisses him incessantly on both cheeks as Persians do. 

           INT. ZORA KEATING’S HOUSE - DUSK

           Zora scurries about the place, classic two bed/two bath 
           layout, finishing setting it up for Kian--

                                 ZORA
                        You can take the sofa out here and 
                        your father can have the guest 
                        bedroom. Or if you want, you can 
                        have the guest bed and he can sleep 
                        out here--

                                 KIAN
                        No, he should have the bedroom. 

                                 ZORA
                        You need to be comfortable too. Do 
                        you want to sleep in my bed?

                                 KIAN
                        What?
                                 ZORA
                        Not with me in it. I can sleep on 
                        the sofa. I like the sofa.  

                                 KIAN
                        No, mom, the sofa’s good for me. 

                                 ZORA
                        I know it’s good, I love it. I can 
                        sleep on it. Please, take my bed.  

                                 KIAN
                        I’m not taking your bed.  

                                 ZORA
                        I don’t mind.  

                                 KIAN
                        Mom, please.  

                                 ZORA
                        Are you hungry? You want some 
                        Kashkeh Bademjan?  

                                 KIAN
                        I just want to go to the hospital 
                        before it gets late. I flew here to 
                        be with him-- make sure he gets 
                        through this. You ready to go?

                                 ZORA
                        Yeah. I just have to finish some 
                        work.  

                                 KIAN
                        It’s Friday night.

                                 ZORA
                        My job never stops. They’re slave-
                        drivers. They don’t care if you’re 
                        dead, you have to meet your quota.  

                                 KIAN
                        They’re slave drivers at the Patent 
                        & Trademark Office? 

                                 ZORA
                        Yes. They’ll fire you if you don’t 
                        meet the quota. My friend Zora--

                                 KIAN
                        You have a friend named Zora?
                                 ZORA
                        Yeah, from work. I didn’t tell you 
                        about her?

                                 KIAN
                        No.  

                                 ZORA
                        Are you sure?

                                 KIAN
                        Yes. I think I’d remember the 
                        friend who has the same Persian 
                        name as you.  

                                 ZORA
                        Well she had breast cancer and they 
                        fired her because she didn’t meet 
                        her quota. And now she’s dead.

                                 KIAN
                        She’s dead?

                                 ZORA
                        Yeah. They fired because she took 
                        time off for chemo.    

                                 KIAN
                        Pretty sure that’s illegal.

                                 ZORA
                        She was stealing some stuff too, 
                        but she had cancer. They should’ve 
                        let her steal. 

           INT. CAR, DRIVING - EVENING

           Kian drives with his mom in the passenger seat, heading up 95 
           North towards Baltimore. It’s silent, both in thought...

           INT. JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - EVENING

           Kian and Zora wind through the halls of the Sydney Kimmel 
           Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins. There’s a clash of 
           architecture-- colonial history mixed with modernity.  

           Zora spots someone up ahead, calls out to him:

                                 ZORA
                        Dr. Gladstone! This is Jerry’s son.  

           DR. GLADSTONE, mid-40s, balding, short, stout, deadly 
           serious, barely nods before heading the other way.  
                                 ZORA (CONT’D)
                        He can be a bit difficult, but he’s 
                        the best.  

                                 KIAN
                        He seems like a dick.  

                                 ZORA
                        He was named one of the top 10 
                        oncologists on the East Coast... If 
                        he cures your father, who cares if 
                        he’s a “dick” or whatever. Also, 
                        don’t say that word. It’s not a 
                        nice word.

           They get to Jerry’s door. Zora stops Kian before entering:

                                 ZORA (CONT’D)
                        When we go in there, he might look 
                        a little frail, but we have to be 
                        strong. I don’t want him freaking 
                        out about how he looks, so we have 
                        to seem happy and smile and say how 
                        great he looks, okay? 

                                 KIAN
                        Yeah, sure.  

           They walk into the room and find JERRY KEATING, now 53, 
           having seen better days. But we can see he possesses some 
           definition and muscle, as if he was in great shape before 
           getting sick. He lights up when he sees his son.

                                 JERRY
                             (western Virginia accent)
                        Holy shit, my boy! I can’t believe 
                        you’re really here... 

                                 KIAN
                        Of course I’m here. You look great. 
                        Doesn’t he look great, mom?

           Kian looks over to see his mom sobbing because of how frail 
           Jerry looks.  

                                 KIAN (CONT’D)
                             (whisper to Zora)
                        What are you doing?  

                                 ZORA
                             (through the tears)
                        You look... great, Jer. So good... 

           She can barely get that out without crying harder.
                                 ZORA (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to get a soda... you guys 
                        want anything...?  

           They both shake their heads, “no.”

                                 ZORA (CONT’D)
                        ... I’ll be right back...

           Zora exits the room. After a beat, they hear her BAWLING 
           UNCONTROLLABLY right outside the room, not getting a soda.  

                                 JERRY 
                             (acting oblivious)
                        Why’s she crying like that?  

                                 KIAN
                        She’s having a hard time at work.  

                                 JERRY
                        I bet. That Patent Office is like a 
                        fuckin labor camp. 
                             (changing the subject)
                        By the way, I’ve been listening to 
                        this really cool band called Maroon 
                        5. You know them?

                                 KIAN
                        Yeah, they’re not new.

                                 JERRY
                        Oh and James Blunt-- he’s new. He’s 
                        cool. Know him?

                                 KIAN
                        Sure.

                                 JERRY
                        You gotta hear this one...

           Jerry grabs his phone and starts playing “Goodbye My Lover” 
           by James Blunt.  

           Kian listens while looking down at his father-- A shell of 
           his former self. But in this moment, Jerry seems happy.  

                                 KIAN
                        Dad, this song is super depressing.   

                                 JERRY
                        Depends on how you look at it.  

           Just then, DR. GLADSTONE enters.  
                                 DR. GLADSTONE
                        Good evening, Mr. Keating.  

                                 JERRY
                        Hey, doc. This is my son.  

                                 DR. GLADSTONE
                        We’ve met. 

                                 JERRY
                        He’s a writer. Movies and stuff. He 
                        knows Meg Ryan.

                                 KIAN
                        Barely. I met her once.

                                 DR. GLADSTONE
                             (nodding, unimpressed)
                        Could you turn down that music?  

           Jerry lowers it.

                                 JERRY
                        It’s James Blunt, you know him?

           Dr. Gladstone nods, checking the last remaining IV bag of 
           CHEMO that’s going directly into Jerry’s CHEST PORT.  

                                 DR. GLADSTONE
                        This bag will be done shortly. You 
                        should be able to head home 
                        tonight. How’s your pain?

                                 JERRY
                        Not so great. Might need a little 
                        kick of the ‘phine.

                                 KIAN
                        “The ‘phine?” Does that mean 
                        “morphine?” Is he on morphine???

                                 DR. GLADSTONE
                        That last podunk hospital in 
                        Winchester had him on a heavy drip 
                        while they were trying to figure 
                        out what was wrong with him. We’ve 
                        been tapering him off of it.  

           This is all news to Kian. He tries to refocus--

                                 KIAN
                        How’s his treatment going?  
                                 DR. GLADSTONE
                        I can’t answer that. 

                                 KIAN
                        Why not?

                                 DR. GLADSTONE
                        Your father has requested not to 
                        know anything about his prognosis.  

                                 JERRY
                        That’s true. I don’t wanna know 
                        shit. Knowing my odds ain’t gonna 
                        change them. 

                                 KIAN
                        That’s insane. You’re not even 
                        remotely curious?

                                 JERRY
                        I don’t see this as me fighting 
                        against cancer so much as learning 
                        from it. I have it. I can’t change 
                        that. So I’m gonna learn as much as 
                        I can so it makes me stronger. 
                        Ganbatte.

                                 KIAN
                        Ganbatte...

           Gladstone leaves with a nod, not saying goodbye. Kian follows 
           him into the HALLWAY...

                                 KIAN (CONT’D)
                        Can you tell me how he’s doing?   

           Gladstone doesn’t slow down, forcing Kian to stay with him. 

                                 DR. GLADSTONE
                        He has diffuse large B-cell 
                        lymphoma. Not follicular small-cell 
                        like he had in the 90s. He was in 
                        remission-- actually, from his old 
                        scans, he was cancer-free. But when 
                        it came back, it transformed into 
                        large B-cell.  

                                 KIAN
                        Large B-cell? Is that bad?

                                 DR. GLADSTONE
                        It has a 70% cure rate.  
                                 KIAN
                        That’s pretty good. 

                                 DR. GLADSTONE
                        It is.   

                                 KIAN
                        And he doesn’t know any of this?   

                                 DR. GLADSTONE
                        No. I’m telling you because I think 
                        you should know. But we need to 
                        honor his wishes...

           INT. JERRY’S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           They’re packing up Jerry’s belongings. Zora has FOUR EMPTY 
           SPRITE CANS beside her on the table.  

           Jerry gingerly slips on a pair of beaten up COWBOY BOOTS.  

                                 KIAN
                        I talked to Dr. Gladstone. Do you 
                        want to know what he--

                                 JERRY
                             (plugging his ears)
                        Lalalalalalalalala...

           While singing “lalala,” Jerry glances up at his son, reading 
           his face. He can tell by Kian's confident demeanor that he’s 
           going to be okay. 

           They share a smile, connecting.

           EXT. STREETS OF BALTIMORE/INT. CAR - NIGHT

           Kian drives with his mom in the passenger seat, eyes red from 
           crying all day. Jerry’s in the back, watching the city go by.

                                 KIAN
                        Dad, I can’t believe I still have 
                        to tell you this, but can you 
                        please put on your seat belt?

           Jerry does.

                                 JERRY
                        I usually do.  

                                 KIAN
                        So you just forget when I’m in the 
                        car?
                                 JERRY
                        Yeah.

                                 KIAN
                        Every other time you remember?

                                 JERRY
                        Yeah.  

                                 KIAN
                        That’s hard to believe.

                                 JERRY
                        You saying I’m lying???

                                 KIAN
                        I’m saying it’s super odd that you 
                        only forget to put on your seat 
                        belt when I’m in the car with you.  

                                 ZORA
                        Can you two not fight right now? 
                        It’s been a long day.  

           They stay silent for a beat. Then, Kian's phone rings. He 
           struggles to fit his headphones into his ears... Finally, he 
           answers. His agent GRETA JACOBS, 40s, paces her Beverly Hills 
           office. INTERCUT.

                                 KIAN
                             (into phone)
                        Hey Greta... 

                                 GRETA
                        Good news, they like your initial 
                        take on that rewrite for “Monster 
                        in the Mail” and want to hear your 
                        whole pitch. 

                                 KIAN
                        But I already gave them my whole 
                        pitch.

                                 GRETA
                        That’s not what they said. They 
                        said you just give them a nugget. 
                        They want the whole meal. 

                                 KIAN
                        Okay. I’m back east with my dad--
                                 GRETA
                        Awesome! Work on it there. I’ll set 
                        a time for you to go in and pitch 
                        your full take. I gotta jump!

           Greta hangs up before Kian can get another word in.

                                 ZORA
                        What’d she say?

                                 KIAN
                        I may have a little work to do on 
                        this monster rewrite thing while 
                        I’m here.

                                 JERRY
                        You should be focusing on your own 
                        shit. You’re too talented to go up 
                        for jobs rewriting garbage--

                                 KIAN
                        No one currently pays me to write 
                        my stuff. This is the only way I 
                        can make a little money.  

                                 JERRY
                        You should be writing novels. 
                        You’ve got talent. You’ve got a 
                        voice. You should be pursuing that, 
                        not trying to rewrite monster 
                        movies--

                                 KIAN
                        It’s not a “monster movie.” It’s a 
                        charming film about a monster who 
                        comes in the mail and brings a 
                        family together. Like “Down and Out 
                        in Beverly Hills,” but with a 
                        monster instead of a homeless guy.

                                 JERRY
                        What?

                                 ZORA
                        Yeah Kian, I’m not following that.

                                 KIAN
                        Whatever. I didn’t come here to get 
                        lectured. If you don’t want my 
                        help, I’ll just leave-- 

                                 JERRY
                        I didn’t say that--
                                 KIAN
                        Then let me handle things my way.

           Jerry nods. They all sit in silence for a bit. And then Jerry 
           lets out a fart. And it’s bad. They all roll down the 
           windows. Zora can’t help but laugh. Neither can Kian. 

                                 JERRY
                        Chemo farts man, they’re deadly...

           EXT. STRICKLER KNOB TRAIL - MORNING

           Kian and Hanna begin the climb. Hanna puts on her headphones.  

                                 KIAN
                        Hey, no, come on, no headphones. 
                        Listen to nature.

           She shakes her head, “I can’t hear you.”

                                 KIAN (CONT’D)
                        Can you please take them off? 

           She continues to shake her head. He grabs for the headphones, 
           but she takes a step back, pulling them off.

                                 HANNA
                        What the hell???

                                 KIAN
                        Do you have to listen to music 
                        right now?

                                 HANNA
                        I’m barely fucking here--

                                 KIAN
                        Stop with the F--

                                 HANNA
                        -- IT’S JUST A WORD!

                                 KIAN
                        Yeah! And words have MEANING! 

                                 HANNA
                        Says the “writer.”

                                 KIAN
                        Why’d you air quote that?
                                 HANNA
                        What?

                                 KIAN
                        You air-quoted “writer.” I am a 
                        writer. 

                                 HANNA
                        Yeah? What’s the last thing you 
                        wrote?

                                 KIAN
                        I’m taking a break--

                                 HANNA
                        And who forced that break? Your 
                        friends Jack Daniel and Jim Beam? 

                                 KIAN
                        ... It’s “Daniels” not “Daniel.” 

                                 HANNA
                        You’re teaching me how to properly 
                        say the name of the alcohol?

                                 KIAN
                        No, I just-- Look, I got help.

                                 HANNA
                        Yeah. Lotta good that’s gonna do. 

                                 KIAN
                        Can you chill? Come on, breathe in 
                        that fresh mountain air.

           Kian takes a deep breath in. Hanna reluctantly does the same:

                                 HANNA
                        Smells like shit.

                                 KIAN
                        Yeah, the horse trail is just up on 
                        the right. 

                                 HANNA
                        Look, I get what you’re doing, and 
                        I appreciate it. I really do. You 
                        want bonding time. What if we did 
                        it another weekend? 

                                 KIAN
                        We’ve been saying that for weeks. 
                        We’re here. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 KIAN (CONT'D)
                        And sure, it smells like shit in 
                        this specific moment, but the climb 
                        is really amazing. 

           He can tell she’s softening, but isn’t fully sold. 

                                 KIAN (CONT’D)
                        I know I haven’t been perfect, but 
                        I don’t have control over 
                        everything, Hanna. 

                                 HANNA
                        You haven’t had control over 
                        anything, dad.

                                 KIAN
                        It can feel that way sometimes...

           INT. ZORA KEATING'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Kian helps his father into bed. They’re in Zora’s GUEST 
           BEDROOM. Jerry finishes taking down some PILLS with water.

           Kian spots a framed picture of the SERENITY PRAYER hanging on 
           the wall:

                           God grant me the serenity to accept 
                               the things I cannot change; 
                         the courage to change the things I can; 
                          and the wisdom to know the difference.

                                 JERRY
                        It keeps me grounded. Focused.

                                 KIAN
                        That’s cool. 

                                 JERRY
                        When I beat this thing, we gotta 
                        take our trip to Japan. No more 
                        putting it off.  

                                 KIAN
                        You got it.  

                                 JERRY
                        Promise?

                                 KIAN
                        For sure. 
                             (beat)
                        You need anything else?
                                 JERRY
                        Coke with ice.

                                 KIAN
                        Before bed? You’re not gonna be 
                        able to sleep.  

                                 JERRY
                        Caffeine knocks me out.  

                                 KIAN
                        That’s not how caffeine works.  

                                 JERRY
                        Plus, I’m still coming off the 
                        morphine, so I’ll be fine.  

           Kian's not going to fight that logic. As he turns to exit:

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        You upset your mom and I aren’t 
                        together anymore?

                                 KIAN
                             (turning back)
                        What?

                                 JERRY
                        You upset that I’m in here and not 
                        in her room?  

                                 KIAN
                        I don’t really think about it. I 
                        was 8 when you guys got divorced. 
                        You’re friends. Best friends. I 
                        have it good compared to most kids.  

                                 JERRY
                        I’d get back together with her in a 
                        heartbeat if she wanted to.  

                                 KIAN
                        I know.  

                                 JERRY
                        You do?

                                 KIAN
                        Everyone knows.

                                 JERRY
                        What?? Are you kidding?
                                 KIAN
                        It’s kinda obvious.  

                                 JERRY
                        Fuck. Are you serious?

                                 KIAN
                        Yeah.  

                                 JERRY
                        Does she know?

                                 KIAN
                        Probably. You gave her earrings 
                        from Tiffany’s for her birthday.  

                                 JERRY
                        So? They were nice.  

                                 KIAN
                        Friends don’t get friends presents 
                        like that.  

                                 JERRY
                        Sure they do.

                                 KIAN
                        She got you a Starbucks gift card.  

                                 JERRY
                        I love Starbucks. That was a 
                        thoughtful gift.   

                                 KIAN
                        It was for twenty-bucks.

                                 JERRY
                        Exactly. That’s a week’s worth of 
                        coffee. Man, she’s too good to me.  

                                 KIAN
                        I won’t argue with that. 

           Kian smiles. But Jerry doesn’t, in his head, reliving a 
           painful memory.  

                                 JERRY
                        This is my payback for the 
                        drinking. Being in this bed instead 
                        of in hers. Having my son take care 
                        of me. Drinking or cancer, you’ve 
                        always had to worry about me.  
           Kian looks down at his Dad, at this crumpled up version of 
           the man he used to be... 

                                 KIAN
                        Don’t do that. People get cancer 
                        because... who knows. It’s a car 
                        accident inside your body. We just 
                        gotta get you fixed up. And we 
                        will. I promise.

           Jerry smiles at Kian, his only kid, so glad to have him here.  

           Kian exits the bedroom... heading into the KITCHEN, pouring a 
           glass of Coke with ice for his dad, swirling the ice...  

           ... He takes a deep breath, suddenly overwhelmed--  

           QUICK FLASH TO: A FIVE-YEAR OLD KIAN watching a rerun of 
           “Night Court” with his Dad. He glances over to see his dad 
           pour some more RUM into his Coke, swirling the ice. Jerry’s 
           eyes are getting heavy, head swaying a bit-- young Kian's 
           expression turns to worry...

           BACK TO 2005: Kian takes a couple more calming breaths before 
           heading back towards the guest bedroom...

           ... Only to find Jerry’s fallen sleep. Kian sets the Coke on 
           the bedside table. 

           He glances down, spotting SWEAT BEADS starting to form on 
           Jerry’s face. He’s having NIGHT SWEATS.  

           INT. ZORA’S LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Kian's on the couch, on his computer, researching NIGHT 
           SWEATS. Reading: they’re common for people with lymphoma 
           where the disease is PROGRESSING... 

           He clicks out of it, moving over to a Word Document to work 
           on his rewrite for the “Monster in the Mail” movie. 

           But he just stares at the screen, no idea what to write...

           EXT. ZORA KEATING'S HOUSE - MORNING

           Kian and Jerry head out the door at a slow pace. Jerry’s 
           breathing is labored.

                                 KIAN
                        You sound like you just ran a 
                        marathon.  
                                 JERRY
                        Just out of breath... we’ll ask 
                        Gladstone about it...

           Zora’s neighbor, SHELLY, 40s, super chipper, comes out of her 
           house at the same time, heading for her car. She sees Kian 
           and Jerry and heads over to them--

                                 SHELLY
                        Kian! Jerry!  

                                 JERRY
                        Oh, hi, Shelly... 

                                 SHELLY
                        Zora told me you were sick.  

                                 JERRY
                        Yeah, I’ve got AIDS, unfortunately. 

                                 SHELLY
                        What?? Oh dear--

                                 KIAN
                        He has lymphoma--

                                 SHELLY
                        Oh, that’s awful.

                                 JERRY
                        And AIDS. I have both. It sucks.

                                 KIAN
                        He’ll be fine. We’re just headed to 
                        the doctor. 

           Kian and Jerry reach their car, but Shelly is still standing 
           close, LEANING against the driver’s side door.  

                                 SHELLY
                        My ex-husband’s sister had cancer. 
                        Didn’t make it. 

           Kian's trying to figure out how to open the car door with 
           Shelly leaning against it. 

                                 SHELLY (CONT’D)
                        You know what’s crazy, her cat also 
                        had cancer. Actually, I think the 
                        cat got it first. I didn’t think 
                        cancer could be transferred from 
                        cats to humans, but maybe it can?  
                             (beat)
                        Wanna see a picture?
                                 KIAN
                        Oh that’s okay, we’re running late--

           She pulls out a PICTURE on her phone of her bald, cancer-
           stricken ex-husband’s sister holding an equally sick cat. 

           Kian and Jerry take in the picture, so desperate to get out 
           of this conversation. 

                                 SHELLY
                        His sister and I didn’t get along, 
                        and the cat never really liked me, 
                        but I was still sad when they died. 

                                 KIAN
                        Sure, sure. We just need to get--

                                 SHELLY
                        Funny huh? You can think someone’s 
                        a real bitch, but then they get 
                        sick and you just forgive them for 
                        everything--

           Jerry suddenly starts FAKE COUGHING VIOLENTLY in Shelly’s 
           direction. She backs up enough for Kian to open the car door.  

                                 KIAN
                        Good seeing you, Shelly. Take care! 

           Kian jumps in while Jerry quickly moves around to the 
           passenger side, getting in as well. 

                                 SHELLY
                        Keep your chin up! Take lots of 
                        probiotics!

           Kian waves, pulling away in a hurry. As they’re driving:

                                 KIAN
                        That was brilliant.

                                 JERRY
                        Who says cancer doesn’t have its 
                        advantages?

                                 KIAN
                        Everybody. 

           They share a laugh. Kian glances at his dad, smiling...

           INT. JOHNS HOPKINS HOSPITAL, EXAM ROOM - DAY

           Jerry sits on the exam table, nervous, but swinging his legs 
           in an attempt to keep it casual. Dr. Gladstone enters...
           He’s looking down at his clipboard, no handshake, no 
           cordiality. No nod to Kian.  

                                 DR. GLADSTONE
                        Mr. Keating... looks like your red 
                        blood cell count is down, which is 
                        completely normal. I want you to 
                        get some blood before you leave.  

                                 KIAN
                        That why he’s been out of breath?

                                 DR. GLADSTONE
                        Yeah. Probably.  

                                 KIAN
                        Probably? Could it be something 
                        else?

                                 DR. GLADSTONE
                        If it’s spread to his lungs.  

                                 KIAN
                        Has it?

                                 JERRY
                        I don’t want to hear this shit. 

                                 KIAN
                        Well plug your ears, cause we need 
                        to know.  

                                 JERRY
                        Don’t talk to me like I’m a child.

                                 KIAN
                        If you’re gonna act like a child, 
                        I’m gonna treat you like one.

                                 DR. GLADSTONE
                        No need for anyone to plug their 
                        ears. I don’t think it’s spread to 
                        your lungs. I think we’re going to 
                        get you some blood and you’ll be 
                        breathing a lot better. If you’re 
                        not, we’ll run some scans.  
                             (beat)
                        Other than that, all your markers 
                        look good. Seems like the chemo is 
                        doing its job--
                                 JERRY
                             (covering his ears)
                        Lalalalalalalala-- I don’t want to 
                        know anything-- lalalalalala...

                                 KIAN
                        Oh Jesus-- He’s just saying things 
                        are looking good.   

           Jerry’s still not listening, but knows things are positive 
           and is milking it for all it’s worth...

           INT. ONCOLOGY WARD - LATER

           Jerry’s in a recliner, getting a BAG OF BLOOD transfused. 

                                 KIAN
                        Breathing better?

           He nods, sending Kian a Hawaiian “shaka” sign, feeling good.

           INT. ZORA KEATING'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Kian, Jerry and Zora sit around the dining table, eating 
           spaghetti. Jerry’s scarfing down his food.  

           Jerry’s playing Maroon 5’s “This Love” from an iPod.

           Kian's sending a text to someone named “Mal”: Hey, I’m in 
           town for a bit... you around?

                                 JERRY
                             (singing)
                        “... her heart is breaking in 
                        froooont of me...”

                                 ZORA
                        Someone’s in a good mood.

                                 JERRY
                        I got blood.  

                                 ZORA
                        What???

                                 KIAN
                        Yeah, they gave him a blood 
                        transfusion.

                                 ZORA
                        And you didn’t call me???

                                 KIAN
                        Why would we call you?
                                 ZORA
                        Because people get diseases from 
                        blood transfusions.

                                 KIAN
                        He has cancer.

                                 ZORA
                        Different diseases. 

                                 KIAN
                        Well if you were there--

                                 ZORA
                        -- I have to work!  

                                 JERRY
                        “... she said goodbye too many 
                        times befooooooore...”

                                 ZORA
                        Turn that off!  

                                 JERRY
                        Why, I--

           Zora slams her utensils down. Gets up, grabbing her plate, 
           storming into the kitchen. But we can still see her from the 
           dining room because it’s open-concept. She’s trying hard not 
           to break down right there over the sink. 

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        Z? What’s wrong?  

           She doesn’t answer, instead striding away for her bedroom.

                                 KIAN
                        Probably just stressed with work.

                                 JERRY
                        Yeah, that place is fuckin brutal. 

           INT. ZORA'S LIVING ROOM - THAT NIGHT

           Kian tosses and turns on the couch, unable to sleep. He hears 
           his dad get up and go to the bathroom.  

           He sneaks into his Dad’s room, checking to see if there’s a 
           sweat spot in his dad’s bed. There isn’t. He smiles...

           INT. ZORA KEATING'S HOUSE - DAY

           Jerry relaxes on the couch, watching HGTV. He looks up to see 
           Kian fixing his hair in a hallway mirror, looking polished.
                                 JERRY
                        Who you trying to impress?

                                 KIAN
                        Everyone.

                                 JERRY
                        In this specific moment?

                                 KIAN
                        Just you, pop.

           He kisses his dad on top of his head on his way out.  

                                 KIAN (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be back in a couple hours, 
                        call me if you need anything.

                                 JERRY
                        There’s a House Hunters marathon 
                        on, so I’ll be good for a while.

           An Irish pub on King Street in Old Town, Alexandria.  

           Kian sits across from MALLORY LAIDLER, 24, casual but 
           conservative. She’s trying to look put together, but is out 
           of practice. There’s an ease to their conversation, the type 
           that old friends possess...  

                                 MALLORY
                        ... Remember when you got me a 
                        thong for my birthday junior year?  

                                 KIAN
                        Was it your birthday? 

                                 MALLORY
                        Wait, shit, was it Valentine’s Day?  

                                 KIAN
                        It was. Sadly.

                                 MALLORY
                        I remember being like, ‘oookkaay, 
                        is this a joke?’  

                                 KIAN
                        When you said that, I just went 
                        with it.
                                 MALLORY
                        So you gave me a thong for 
                        Valentine’s Day in earnest?

                                 KIAN
                        I have no idea what I was thinking.

                                 MALLORY
                        You liked me. If you asked me out, 
                        I probably would’ve said yes. 

                                 KIAN
                        Probably?? I’ll take that. Man.  
                        Too bad I was a massive pussy in 
                        high school.  

                                 MALLORY
                        Pussies are tough. You were a 
                        delicate set of balls. 

                                 KIAN
                        That’s a really good point. I was a 
                        pair of fragile baby balls.

           They share a laugh. There’s a beat between them. Kian notices 
           her spinning her WEDDING RING around her finger.

                                 KIAN (CONT’D)
                        ... How are you doing with Clayton? 

           She shrugs, not really answering.

                                 KIAN (CONT’D)
                        Been getting any better?

                                 MALLORY
                        Yeah. For sure.  

           Kian waits for more. But she doesn’t offer anything else.

                                 KIAN
                        Sorry, I won’t press it. 

           After a beat...

                                 KIAN (CONT’D)
                        Wow, I feel like I really killed 
                        the mood here. Did I kill the mood?

                                 MALLORY
                        No, not at all. 

                                 KIAN
                        I didn’t mean to strike a nerve.  
                                 MALLORY
                        You didn’t. Don’t worry about it.
                             (beat)
                        What color was that thong?

                                 KIAN
                        Don’t act like you forgot.

                                 MALLORY
                        I really did. Blue?

                                 KIAN
                        Blue??? Shit, I actually don’t 
                        remember. Pink?  

                                 MALLORY
                        I think it was! Pink lace. Holy 
                        shit, you were a creep in high 
                        school.  

           They’re both laughing, but we can tell Mallory’s still in her 
           head about her husband, Clayton. Kian reads this too. So:

                                 KIAN
                        Chug!

           They start chugging, something they clearly did back in the 
           day. She slams her glass down right before he does.

                                 MALLORY
                        Have you ever beaten me?

                                 KIAN
                        One of these days, my friend. 

           INT. ZORA KEATING'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Kian creeps into the house, making his way over to his dad’s 
           room. He peaks through the crack in the door to check on him, 
           catching him sleeping peacefully. He smiles, looking at his 
           pop. But his smile starts to fade as we--

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. ZORA’S OLD HOUSE - DAY

           A worried TEENAGE KIAN knocks on a locked GUEST BEDROOM door--  

           CUT TO: Kian pops the lock with a BOBBY PIN, opening the 
           door, finding his father passed out drunk on the floor, a 
           nearly empty bottle of VODKA by his side.  
           He runs to his dad, trying to wake him up... fumbling for the 
           phone to call 911...

           EXT. ZORA’S OLD HOUSE - DAY

           Kian watches an AMBULANCE take Jerry away...

           INT. ALEXANDRIA HOSPITAL, DETOX CENTER - NIGHT 

           Kian wears a worried expression as he stares down at his dad 
           who sleeps in a hospital bed, shivering from withdrawals.  

           A DOCTOR talks to a younger Zora a few feet away.  

                                 DOCTOR
                             (to Zora)
                        This is his 5th time here. We can’t 
                        admit him again. He’s either gotta 
                        get clean or go somewhere else...

           EXT. STRICKLER KNOB TRAIL - DAY

           Kian stares at triple fork in the trail. He pulls out a map, 
           studying it. 

                                 HANNA
                        You lost?

                                 KIAN
                        No. No... just double checking 
                        something. 

                                 HANNA
                        “Million times” huh?

                                 KIAN
                        Hundreds, yeah. Or tens. Definitely 
                        tens of times. I just-- I always 
                        get tripped up here. Your grandpa 
                        knew it by heart, so I just went 
                        with it. 

           He looks at the map some more. 

                                 KIAN (CONT’D)
                        It’s just... only one of them will 
                        get us there by sunset.  

           Kian coughs a bit while looking at the map. He takes a load 
           off, resting on a rock.  

           Hanna shows some concern, sitting next to him.
                                 HANNA
                        You good?

                                 KIAN
                        ... Yeah. 

           Kian takes a long pull from his CANTEEN. 

                                 HANNA
                        Mind if I check that?

                                 KIAN
                        Check what?

                                 HANNA
                        Your bottle.

                                 KIAN
                        Why?

           Hanna shots him a look.

                                 KIAN (CONT’D)
                        You don’t have to worry about me. 
                        That’s not your job.

                                 HANNA
                        It’s been my job my whole life.

           It pains Kian to hear that. He hands her the canteen. She 
           unscrews the top, smelling it, confirming it’s just water, no 
           alcohol. Hands it back to him.

                                 KIAN
                        You really think I’d do that on our 
                        trip?

                                 HANNA
                        I don’t know. You’ve done some 
                        pretty messed up things.  

                                 KIAN
                        That’s an exaggeration.

                                 HANNA
                        Like fuck it is.

                                 KIAN
                        Come on! Please. Can we not fight? 
                        I know you love your mom more than 
                        me. You’ve always got along better 
                        with her-- But can you just give me 
                        this weekend? Please...
           Kian stands up, ready to hit the trail, asking her to follow 
           him. She reluctantly stands up, following...

                                 HANNA
                        You know the difference between you 
                        and mom? Mom would never make me go 
                        on a trip like this...

           INT. ROCK IT GRILL - NIGHT

           Kian and Mallory play pool at this local dive bar. She’s 
           sinking shots left and right. 

                                 KIAN
                        Hold up, are you some kind of pool 
                        shark? I don’t remember you being 
                        good at pool. 

                                 MALLORY
                        I come here a lot now.  

                                 KIAN
                        Fuck. We could make bank. I can be 
                        the person that beats you to make 
                        you look bad and then you can bet 
                        someone else and take them to the 
                        fucking cleaners.  

                                 MALLORY
                        You just got really into this.  

                                 KIAN
                        I’m unemployed at the moment.

           They cheer to that, an energy building between them.  

                                 MALLORY
                        Is it hard being a writer?

                                 KIAN
                        The writing part comes easy to me. 
                        The hard part is the uncertainty. 
                        You never know where your next job 
                        is coming from. If what you write 
                        will resonate with anyone. 

                                 MALLORY
                        Uncertainty is the only certainty 
                        there is-- I didn’t come up with 
                        that... but I like it.
                                 KIAN
                        Yeah, but most people are smart 
                        enough to set up some type of 
                        stability or constant. 
                             (beat)
                        Like, you’re a lawyer.

                                 MALLORY
                        Barely.

                                 KIAN
                        That job’s not going anywhere. 
                        People aren’t gonna suddenly stop 
                        suing people. You’ll be fine 
                        forever. 

           Suddenly, Kian's cell rings. It’s his MOM... He ignores it. 
           But it rings again...  

                                 KIAN (CONT’D)
                        Just gonna grab this, feel free to 
                        sink the rest and finish me off. 

           Kian steps OUTSIDE, taking the call. INTERCUT...

                                 KIAN (CONT’D)
                             (into phone)
                        Hey mom--

                                 ZORA
                        Your father’s complaining about 
                        pain in his back.  

                                 KIAN
                        Did he take some Motrin? 

                                 ZORA
                        Yeah, but it’s not working... 

           Jerry paces by in the background like a pregnant woman going 
           into labor.  

                                 KIAN
                        Okay, I’ll be right there.

           INT. ZORA’S LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Middle of the night. Jerry paces. Kian by his side... 

                                 JERRY
                        It’s bad. I need something.   

                                 KIAN
                        Like what?
                                 JERRY
                        Maybe... Dilaudid?

                                 KIAN
                        I thought you didn’t want to take 
                        any narcotics? 

                                 JERRY
                        I need something.  

                                 KIAN
                        Wanna go to the hospital?

                                 JERRY
                        And get some shit ass emergency 
                        room doctor? Fuck that. I’ll wait 
                        til the morning and see Gladstone. 
                        I just need something to get me 
                        through the night. Come on, son. 
                        Help me out.

           Kian’s torn, hating to see his father in this much pain. He 
           heads upstairs to his MOM’S BEDROOM...

           ... Zora’s in bed, wide awake, concerned.  

                                 KIAN
                        He wants Dilaudid. 

                                 ZORA
                        He told us to not give him any.  

                                 KIAN
                        I know, but he says he needs it.  

           Zora glances over to a DRAWER in her dresser. Kian opens it, 
           spotting some BOTTLES of harder PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.  

                                 KIAN (CONT’D)
                        What do you think we should do?

                                 ZORA
                        I can’t decide that.  

                                 KIAN
                        So it’s on me?

                                 ZORA
                        I have a lot of work tomorrow. I 
                        need to get some sleep. 

                                 KIAN
                        What does that mean?? I need help, 
                        mom. I don’t have anyone else. 
                                 ZORA
                        I... just can’t. 

           Zora slumps back down in bed. Not wanting to take this on. 

                                 KIAN
                        Fine. I’ll decide whether or not to 
                        give my addict father narcotic pain 
                        killers.
                             (beat)
                        You’re unbelievable.

           Frustrated, Kian heads back downstairs to the LIVING ROOM.

                                 KIAN (CONT’D)
                        What do you think’s going on?

                                 JERRY
                        Don’t know. It’s just so painful. 

           Kian debates a bit longer... then finally decides to hand him 
           the Dilaudid. Jerry pops a pill. Immediately relaxing, even 
           though it hasn’t taken effect yet.  

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        Thanks, son. I don’t know what I’d 
                        do without you... 

           INT. JERRY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Jerry’s with some FRIENDS in the den, getting drunk, 
           listening to music. A 10 year-old Kian peeks out of his room 
           and watches his dad, unable to sleep due to the noise.

           Jerry grabs a BOTTLE OF DILAUDID off the table, pops some 
           pills, sharing them with his friends.  

           He then glances over and spots Kian watching him. So he gets 
           up and closes the den door...

           INT. JOHNS HOPKINS HOSPITAL, EXAM ROOM - DAY

           Kian and Zora watch as Dr. Gladstone taps various points on 
           Jerry’s lower back.

           Jerry winces when he taps a specific point. Gladstone nods 
           knowingly.  

                                 DR. GLADSTONE
                        You pulled a muscle.
                                 JERRY
                        What? For real?

                                 KIAN
                        He’s in a lot of pain.

                                 DR. GLADSTONE
                        Throwing your back out can be 
                        painful. We’ll do a scan to be 
                        sure, but I’m not worried about it. 

           Jerry breathes a huge sigh of relief. 

           INT. CT SCAN - DAY

           A TECH loads Jerry into the CT MACHINE. 

           INT. JOHNS HOPKINS HOSPITAL, OPEN EXAM AREA - EVENING

           A large OPEN AREA with many PATIENTS on beds or recliners, 
           getting chemo, blood, or waiting to be seen. 

           Kian, Jerry and Zora have been here all day. They’re 
           exhausted. Jerry is on an exam bed, still in a bit of pain.  

           Dr. Gladstone enters with a young RESIDENT, DR. KIM REISS-
           BINDER, hair pulled back, kind eyes, but serious demeanor. 

                                 DR. GLADSTONE
                        Mr. Keating, this is Dr. Reiss-
                        Binder, she’s a resident who will 
                        be helping us out.  

                                 JERRY
                        Okay. Hi...

           She sends him a warm smile. Much warmer than Gladstone. This 
           job hasn’t beaten her down yet. 

                                 DR. GLADSTONE
                        I’ve got to head into surgery, so 
                        she’ll go over next steps with you.  

                                 ZORA
                        Did you say she’s a resident? No 
                        offense, but is she a doctor?

                                 DR. GLADSTONE
                        A resident is a doctor. She’ll be 
                        taking care of you while I’m 
                        unavailable.   

           As Gladstone turns to leave--
                                 KIAN
                        Was it a pulled muscle?

                                 DR. GLADSTONE
                        Pardon me?

                                 KIAN
                        Was it a pulled muscle in his back?

                                 DR. GLADSTONE
                        ... No.

           That’s it. Gladstone turns and is gone. Everyone looks at 26 
           year-old Kim Reiss-Binder.  

                                 DR. KIM REISS-BINDER
                        So um, I know this is not the news 
                        you were hoping for, but it seems 
                        your lymph nodes have grown.

                                 JERRY
                        What? I thought the treatment was 
                        working? I was feeling better til 
                        this back thing popped up.

                                 DR. KIM REISS-BINDER
                        Yes well, sadly, we were wrong. In 
                        fact, the biopsy came back-- We had 
                        to double check it-- seems you 
                        actually have T-Cell lymphoma, not 
                        B-Cell like we first thought.

                                 ZORA
                        Are you sure you’re not mixing him 
                        up with another patient? His name 
                        is Jerry Keating. Can we have Dr. 
                        Gladstone back? 

                                 DR. KIM REISS-BINDER
                        I know I’m dropping a lot on you 
                        right now, but I assure you, if Dr. 
                        Gladstone were here, he’d be saying 
                        the same thing. 

           Jerry has gone into a bit of a catatonic state, utter shock.  

                                 KIAN
                        Is having T-Cell better or worse?

                                 DR. KIM REISS-BINDER
                        It’s... rarer. And therefore 
                        tougher. There are less treatment 
                        options from what I understand.
                                 ZORA
                        From what you understand???

                                 KIAN
                        Easy, mom.

                                 ZORA
                        Where’s Gladstone?

                                 JERRY
                        I felt better. It’s just a back 
                        thing. A pulled muscle...

                                 ZORA
                        Gladstone is his doctor.

                                 JERRY
                        What are my chances now?

                                 DR. KIM REISS-BINDER
                        I have a note here to not discuss 
                        that with you.

                                 JERRY
                        I changed my mind. I wanna know. 
                        Just hit me. 

                                 KIAN
                        Dad--

                                 JERRY
                        Hit me. I don’t fuckin care. I want 
                        to know!

                                 DR. KIM REISS-BINDER
                        ... Probably 10-20%.  

                                 JERRY
                        Oh God. I shouldn’t have asked... 

                                 KIAN
                        That can’t be right. Gladstone said 
                        it was 70%, he said--

                                 DR. KIM REISS-BINDER
                        Diffuse large B-Cell lymphoma is 
                        more treatable than peripheral T-
                        Cell. T-cell is usually quite 
                        aggressive...    

           Jerry breathes heavy, weathering a panic attack. Kian looks 
           at his Dad, his hero, and hugs him. 
           The other patients in the area are taking notice. There’s no 
           privacy during the delivery of this brutal news.

                                 DR. KIM REISS-BINDER (CONT’D)
                        We’ve seen people have success with 
                        the ICE treatment you’d receive 
                        next.  

                                 JERRY
                        No. I’m done. No more chemo.

                                 KIAN
                        You can’t give up, dad. Not yet. 

                                 JERRY
                        You know what it feels like? It’s 
                        like fuckin lava running through 
                        your veins. I hate it. I’m done.

                                 KIAN
                        I’ll be right here with you. Doing 
                        whatever I can to make sure you 
                        beat this. Come on, pop. I know you 
                        can do it. Ganbatte...

           Jerry stares at his son... debating... softening.

                                 JERRY
                        What’s ICE? What’s that mean?

                                 DR. KIM REISS-BINDER
                        It’s a type of chemo combination. I 
                        um... I honestly don’t remember 
                        what the letters stand for. The “E” 
                        is Etoposide. I think the “C” is 
                        Carboplatin... I can’t remember the 
                        “I.” But I’ll find out and get back 
                        to you.   

                                 ZORA
                        Unbelievable. So you’re just 
                        Jerry’s doctor now and you don’t 
                        know what the letters stand for??? 
                        That’s good. That’s encouraging.

                                 DR. KIM REISS-BINDER
                        Dr. Gladstone will still be 
                        administering the treatment if you 
                        decide to go forward with it. 

           Jerry’s head is in his hands, not wanting to live in this 
           reality.
           Reiss-Binder rubs Jerry’s back. This is the most compassion 
           he’s received from anyone at this hospital. 

           INT. CAR, DRIVING - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Kian rides with his mom in the passenger seat. Both in 
           silence. After a beat, Zora SCREAMS. Releasing everything 
           she’s kept in throughout the day. 

           INT. ZORA KEATING’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Kian stares at his computer, trying to work on his pitch for 
           the Monster movie rewrite. His mind races, unable to focus.  

           Suddenly, his phone rings. He sees it’s his agent, Greta. He 
           hesitantly answers. She’s in her office. INTERCUT.

                                 KIAN
                             (into phone)
                        Hey, Greta.

                                 GRETA
                        Hey! Guess what? They want to do 
                        your pitch on that monster movie 
                        tomorrow before Peter flies out for 
                        Sundance. 

                                 KIAN
                        Tomorrow? I’m still back east. My 
                        dad’s not... fully better yet. 

                                 GRETA
                        Back east? Did you tell me this?

                                 KIAN
                        Yes.

                                 GRETA
                        Hmmm. Okay. Let me see what they 
                        can do. Hang tight.

           INT. JERRY’S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Kian sits at his father’s side. Dr. Reiss-Binder checks the 
           bag of CHEMO running into Jerry’s port. Gladstone observes, 
           making sure she’s doing everything correctly. 

                                 DR. KIM REISS-BINDER
                        Last bag. Once this is done, we’ll 
                        do a quick check and you should be 
                        good to go home. 

                                 JERRY
                        Thanks, Dr. Reiss-Binder--
                                 DR. KIM REISS-BINDER
                        Hey, look at that, most people 
                        don’t get my name right.

                                 JERRY
                             (winking playfully)
                        I’ve been doing my homework.  

           Reiss-Binder smiles as she exits. Gladstone goes with her, 
           not smiling. Kian rushes out after them, into the HALLWAY.

                                 KIAN
                        How’s he looking?

                                 DR. KIM REISS-BINDER
                        It’s early, but his markers are 
                        good. The ICE seems to be working.

                                 DR. GLADSTONE 
                        The PET scan next week will be the 
                        real test.  

           Gladstone heads off without saying goodbye. Reiss-Binder 
           hangs back with Kian:

                                 DR. KIM REISS-BINDER
                        So far so good. He may end up in 
                        that 10-20%...  

           They share a connective smile... 

           INT. ZORA’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           All the lights are off. Everyone’s asleep except for Kian, 
           who’s on his LAPTOP, researching peripheral T-cell lymphoma. 
           Looking at various prognosis odds and risk factors. Doing 
           anything he can to help his dad.  

           He hears Jerry get out of bed, entering the bathroom. Kian 
           creeps into the bedroom and checks the sheets. No night sweat 
           stains. 

           He creeps out before his dad sees him, heading back to the 
           living room. He closes his laptop, laying down on the couch, 
           staring up at the ceiling...

           INT. CAR, DRIVING - DAY

           A YOUNGER JERRY drives through WINCHESTER VIRGINIA, on the 
           phone with a TEENAGE KIAN, who’s in his room. INTERCUT. 
                                 JERRY
                             (into phone)
                        Your mom’s too good to me, paying 
                        for rehab and shit. 

                                 KIAN
                        She just wants you to get better. 
                        We all do.  

           Jerry slows to turn into the parking lot for EDGEHILL 
           RECOVERY CENTER, but instead drives right past it...

                                 JERRY
                        I’ll call you once I’m checked in.  

                                 KIAN
                        Okay pop. Love you as big as the 
                        Universe.  

                                 JERRY
                        Love you too-- As big as the 
                        Universe.  

           Jerry hangs up, pulling into a different PARKING LOT. Across 
           from him is a mini-strip mall, containing a LIQUOR STORE and 
           a BARBERSHOP. He takes out his WALLET... $60 to his name.

           INT. LIQUOR STORE - DAY

           Jerry grabs some VODKA. Cheap stuff. Big jug of it. He takes 
           a deep breath, debating...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CAR, PARKING LOT - LATER

           Jerry gets back in his car, sporting a new HAIRCUT. No bottle 
           of vodka. He puts the car in gear... heading back up the 
           hill, pulling into the lot for EDGEHILL...

           EXT. OLD TOWN ALEXANDRIA - DAY

           Back to 2005.

           Kian, Jerry and Zora walk the cobblestone streets, ice cream 
           in hand. Jerry’s savoring every bite.

                                 KIAN
                        How’s your mojo?

                                 JERRY
                        I don’t want to jinx it, but...
           He sends him a “shaka” sign. Feeling good. He puts his arm 
           around Kian, letting Zora walk ahead of them...

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        Do you think your mom would come to 
                        Japan with us?

                                 KIAN
                        I dunno. Maybe. 

                                 JERRY
                        I was thinking of asking her. We 
                        could all go, the three of us. I 
                        want to show her how great I can 
                        be. How great we can be again...

           Kian smiles at the thought of that. Zora turns back, shooting 
           them a look, wondering what they’re conspiring about.

           EXT. STRICKLER KNOB TRAIL - LATE DAY

           Kian and Hanna have hit a sharp incline. There are a set of 
           boulders blocking their way. 

                                 KIAN
                        I don’t remember this. 

           Hanna pulls out her phone, looking for a signal, not finding 
           one.  

                                 HANNA
                        We’re gonna die. This is how we--

                                 KIAN
                        -- Relax. Give me a minute. 

           Kian studies the map, looking at it from different angles.  

                                 KIAN (CONT’D)
                        I think we took the wrong folk. 

                                 HANNA
                        Then it’s safe to say we’ve hit the 
                        end of the line. 

                                 KIAN
                        I don’t think we can make it down 
                        the mountain or to the top by 
                        sundown.  

                                 HANNA
                        What are you saying?
                                 KIAN
                        Might be best if we find a spot to 
                        camp for the night. 

                                 HANNA
                        No. No way. Fuck no. 

                                 KIAN
                        Hey! Can you just rela--

                                 HANNA
                        Stop telling me to relax! You took 
                        me here against my will! You 
                        kidnapped me!

                                 KIAN
                        I’m your dad! I can’t kidnap you!

                                 HANNA
                        Uh... Parents kidnap their kids all 
                        the time! 

                                 KIAN
                        Well that’s what not what I’m 
                        doing! We hit a snag. Doesn’t mean 
                        we can’t hunker down, regroup in 
                        the morning. We just have to go 
                        back to the fork and pick the left 
                        path. I see where we went wrong. 

                                 HANNA
                        I’m not doing it. 

                                 KIAN
                        You don’t have a choice. 

           He takes a beat, softening.

                                 KIAN (CONT’D)
                        You gotta be able to roll with 
                        things, Hanna. You gotta be able to 
                        adapt. See the bigger picture.  

           Hanna’s breathing heavy, annoyed as fuck. She takes some deep 
           breaths, trying to calm herself. 

                                 KIAN (CONT’D)
                        Come on, help me with this tent...

           EXT. STRICKLER KNOB TRAIL - THAT NIGHT

           The TENT is set up. A small CAMPFIRE flickers nearby.  
           Hanna sits by the fire, staring at it, or more so through it, 
           deep in thought. Kian lays in the tent, eating some food. 

                                 KIAN
                        You should eat something. 

           She shakes her head. They suddenly hear a loud HOWL.

                                 HANNA
                        What was that?

                                 KIAN
                        Coyote. Or maybe a lion. Or a bear. 
                        Or a pack of lions and bears that 
                        are traveling together. You should 
                        get in here before they eat you.

                                 HANNA
                        I can’t tell if you think you’re 
                        being funny or not.  

                                 KIAN
                        I do think I’m being funny, yes. 
                        But seriously, that didn’t sound 
                        too far away, you should get in 
                        here. Like, for real.

           Hanna gets up, heeding her father’s advice, getting in the 
           tent with him.  

                                 KIAN (CONT’D)
                        This is nice, right? Just the two 
                        of us. Hanging out. Camping again.

           She shrugs. It’s silent for a beat. Then he FARTS. 

                                 HANNA
                        Dad!

                                 KIAN
                        That wasn’t me! There must be a 
                        frog in here. We gotta get it!  

                                 HANNA
                        That’s nasty! It’s burning my eyes! 
                        I can’t breathe! I’m gonna die!

                                 KIAN
                        It’s a farting frog! We gotta catch 
                        it before it kills us all!

           Kian makes a big show of it, throwing everything around in an 
           attempt to catch the “frog.”
           Hanna can’t help but laugh at her dad’s theatrics...

           INT. BATHROOM - DAY

           Kian fixes his hair in the mirror. Fidgets with his shirt. 
           Checks his teeth. Breath. Decides to mouthwash...

           INT. BLACKWALL HITCH - DUSK

           An upscale seafood restaurant on the Potomac River. Kian sits 
           across from Mallory, having just ordered. 

                                 KIAN
                        His treatment seems to be working. 

                                 MALLORY
                        That’s so great.

                                 KIAN
                        He’s excited about going to Japan. 
                        Him and my mom are getting closer. 

                                 MALLORY
                        Your dad’s so strong. I always felt 
                        a connection with him.

                                 KIAN
                        You did?

                                 MALLORY
                        Yeah but I feel like that’s what 
                        everyone says. He has that effect 
                        on people. 

                                 KIAN
                        He does...

                                 MALLORY
                        He taught me how to make the best 
                        steak.

                                 KIAN
                        He gave you his marinade recipe? He 
                        doesn’t hand that out casually. 

                                 MALLORY
                        We were tight.

                                 KIAN
                        Apparently. 

           A WOMAN sides up to their table selling ROSES.
                                 WOMAN
                        A rose for the lady?

                                 KIAN
                        Oh, no thanks. We’re just friends. 
                             (leans into whisper)
                        Also... she’s not a lady.

           He winks at the rose saleswoman, who heads off confused.  

                                 MALLORY
                        Charming.

                                 KIAN
                        Thank you.

                                 MALLORY
                        Even without the rose, this is the 
                        fanciest restaurant I’ve been to in 
                        a while. 

                                 KIAN
                        Oh yeah?

                                 MALLORY
                        Clayton and I used to go out a lot. 
                        Now it’s more about staying in, 
                        getting Taco Bell--

                                 KIAN
                        Taco Bell is so good. I don’t care 
                        if their meat isn’t meat.  

                                 MALLORY
                        Oh I’m not complaining. It might be 
                        the best food on the planet. 

                                 KIAN
                        Shit, if I knew you still loved 
                        Taco Bell, I wouldn’t have 
                        suggested this place. 

                                 MALLORY
                        You implying you’re paying for 
                        dinner?

                                 KIAN
                        Fuck no. I’m just saying, even my 
                        half is gonna be like 50 bucks. 
                        Which would equal a feast fit for a 
                        king and queen at Taco Bell.
                                 MALLORY
                        Should we just bail and go get a 
                        fuckton of Fourth Meal?

                                 KIAN
                        Can we do that? Isn’t that rude?

                                 MALLORY
                        Yeah, but who gives a shit?

                                 KIAN
                        That’s a really good point.

           EXT. STREETS OF OLD TOWN ALEXANDRIA - NIGHT

           Kian and Mallory stroll the sidewalk, going to town on some 
           TACO BELL, savoring every bite. 

                                 KIAN
                        I’d say we could continue the party 
                        at my place, but my mom’s sleeping 
                        and my dad has cancer, so...

                                 MALLORY
                        I’m only a couple metro stops away.

           INT. METRO CAR - NIGHT

           Kian and Mallory ride the crowded metro to Mallory’s place,  
           sitting side-by-side... bag of Taco Bell on their laps. 

           INT. MALLORY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Music blasts. They dance in her living room. Taking sips from 
           DRINKS, bites from more Taco Bell... 

                                 MALLORY
                        What sauce do you put on yours?

                                 KIAN
                        Mild.

                                 MALLORY
                        Pathetic.

                                 KIAN
                        What do you do?

                                 MALLORY
                        Medium, son! 

                                 KIAN
                        There’s like barely a difference 
                        between mild and medium.
                                 MALLORY
                        You know not what you speak of.

           They’re getting closer... Faces inches from each other as 
           they dance...

                                 MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        You have Taco Bell breath.

                                 KIAN
                        So do you...

           But they don’t pull apart, lips flirting with one another...

           ... Until she lets go and kisses him...

           ... dancing and kissing, bodies pressed against together... 
           moving for the BEDROOM--

                                 KIAN (CONT’D)
                        Is Clayton coming home soon?

                                 MALLORY
                        No.

           She kisses him again. Passionately. Just full on hands 
           through the hair, heavy teenage make-out kissing...

           ... Fumbling into bed... clothes start coming off... 

           She rips off his boxers, and starts going down on him like 
           she hasn’t done this in a long time...

           ... She then jumps on top of him... Riding him... His eyes 
           widen... this escalated rapidly--

           They’re catching a rhythm, something that’s been building 
           inside of them since Kian's been in town, and probably even 
           before that, all the way back to high school...

           ... But suddenly she seems to be getting in her head, slowing 
           down. Kian can feel it. 

           He opens his mouth to say something, ask if she’s okay:

                                 MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t say anything. Don’t stop. 

           She needs this. He does too. They continue, passions rising--

           MINUTES LATER-- Kian and Mallory lay there, post-coital 
           bliss. The build up of so much tension being released for 
           both of them... 
           But her euphoria starts to fade as she sobers to what they’ve 
           just done. He can read it on her face--

                                 KIAN
                        Oh God, I’m on his side of the bed, 
                        aren’t I?

           She shakes her head, “no.” Kian puzzles... 

                                 MALLORY
                        Year and a half ago, I got 
                        pregnant. We’d been trying crazy 
                        hard for a while, seeing 
                        specialists and shit, so when it 
                        finally happened, we were so 
                        excited. We started a name list and 
                        Pinterested baby room shit-- and 
                        then one day, a couple months in, I 
                        started bleeding. Like, a lot. Went 
                        to the doctor and they said it 
                        happens-- don’t worry-- doesn’t 
                        mean we lost the baby... but then 
                        they did an ultrasound and couldn’t 
                        find a heartbeat. We just sat 
                        there, waiting for it-- Trying to 
                        find it. But they couldn’t. We lost 
                        the baby, and it just-- I guess it 
                        just broke him.

           Kian sits there in shock...

                                 KIAN
                        Fuck. I-- I’m so sorry. I--

                                 MALLORY
                        I came home from work one day and 
                        Clay was gone. Like, GONE. No trace 
                        of a single thing of his. I called 
                        him and he didn’t answer. I emailed 
                        him, texted-- nothing. 

                                 KIAN
                        Holy shit. I knew you guys were 
                        having some trouble, but-- Why 
                        didn’t you tell me any of this??

                                 MALLORY
                        I’ve hardly told anyone! I just 
                        shut down. It’s so much easier to 
                        act like it didn’t happen. 

                                 KIAN
                        This is such a mountain of a secret 
                        to just be carrying around! 
                                 MALLORY
                        It gets worse... 

                                 KIAN
                        How???

                                 MALLORY
                        A few months ago, my emails to him 
                        started bouncing back. And he 
                        changed his number. He’s not on 
                        Facebook anymore. I just want to 
                        talk to him. Know what happened... 
                             (beat)
                        I’ve tried moving on... Like, I 
                        tried taking this ring off, but I 
                        can’t-- I mean, I literally can’t, 
                        I think it’s stuck. But also, not 
                        sure I’m ready to... I feel like he 
                        could still come back.

           He comforts her as she buries her head in his chest, letting 
           her guard down. Letting him in a little.

           INT. MALLORY’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Kian's dressed in last night’s clothes, standing in the 
           doorway. Mallory is in her pajamas.  

           They stare at each other for a beat, unsure how to leave it, 
           the sobriety of the moment sinking in.

                                 MALLORY
                        No pressure on this? 

                                 KIAN
                        Yeah. Of course.  

           INT. ZORA KEATING'S HOUSE - MORNING

           Kian enters to find his Dad laying on the couch in the living 
           room, rubbing his temples. 

                                 KIAN
                        Hey pop, what’s up? You okay?

                                 JERRY
                        Just exhausted. Couldn’t sleep last 
                        night.  

                                 KIAN
                        Why?

                                 JERRY
                        I was worried. You didn’t call.
                                 KIAN
                        You were worried about me? I’m an 
                        adult.

           Kian sits down next to his Dad, rubbing his hands through 
           what’s left of his hair.  

                                 JERRY
                        You’re my boy. I’m always gonna 
                        worry about you.  

                                 KIAN
                        You have enough to think about.  

           Kian notices his dad rubbing his temples.  

                                 KIAN (CONT’D)
                        You got a headache?

                                 JERRY
                        Yeah. 

                                 KIAN
                        I’ll get you some Tylenol.  

                                 JERRY
                        Thanks. I’m gonna get some rest. We 
                        got that PET scan tomorrow, right?  

                                 KIAN
                        Yeah...

           INT. ZORA KEATING'S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

           Kian's phone alarm goes off. He gets up from the couch, 
           heading for his Dad’s room, finding him sitting on the edge 
           of the bed, slumped, looking tired.  

                                 JERRY
                        I’m up.  

           Jerry shuffles into the bathroom to take a shower. Kian 
           checks the bed, finding a LARGE SWEAT SPOT.

           INT. EDGEHILL, JERRY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           A younger Jerry packs up his room in the rehab center, phone 
           to his ear, talking to a 16 YEAR-OLD KIAN, who’s driving to a 
           soccer game with his mom. INTERCUT.
                                 JERRY
                             (into phone)
                        -- I got along so well with 
                        everyone over the past 30 days, 
                        they’re offering me a job here. 
                        Receptionist, but hey, it’s a 
                        start. Maybe I can work my way up.  
                             (beat)
                        I know I’ve said it before, but I’m 
                        gonna make it stick this time...   

           Silence from Kian... he nods, cautious with his optimism.

           INT. ADMINISTRATIVE ROOM - MORNING

           Kian, Jerry and Zora sit across from COURTNEY, an 
           ADMINISTRATOR at the hospital, and in general, a real bitch 
           of a human being. Dr. Gladstone sits beside her.

                                 COURTNEY
                        Mr. Keating, unfortunately, we 
                        won’t be able to administer your 
                        PET scan today. You have an 
                        outstanding debt--

                                 JERRY
                        Debt?

                                 COURTNEY
                        For your treatments thus far. You 
                        currently owe $10,438.  

                                 KIAN
                        We haven’t been coming here that 
                        long. The bills are probably being 
                        sent to his house in Winchester.  

                                 COURTNEY
                        You’re over a month behind.  

                                 JERRY
                        But we’re here for the PET scan 
                        today. We need it done. There’s a 
                        timeline--

                                 COURTNEY
                        Dr. Gladstone has explained that 
                        you’re potentially headed for a 
                        bone marrow transplant depending on 
                        your PET results and that your 
                        insurance only covers 80% of that. 
                        You don’t have secondary coverage. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 COURTNEY (CONT'D)
                        It’s a $400,000 procedure, so you’d 
                        need to cover the remaining 20% up 
                        front, which is $80,000... on top 
                        of the bills that are owed. 

                                 JERRY
                        Can we discuss this after the scan? 
                        We’re here now. I’m ready to do 
                        this thing. 

                                 COURTNEY
                        Mr. Keating, you won’t be getting a 
                        PET scan today. 

                                 JERRY
                        You gotta be fuckin kidding me. You 
                        gotta be FUCKIN--

                                 ZORA
                        Dr. Gladstone, can you talk to 
                        them? We can figure out a way to 
                        pay, we just didn’t know.  

                                 DR. GLADSTONE 
                        I’m actually on the board, that’s 
                        why I’m here. We’ve had to take a 
                        serious stance with payments 
                        because so many people were getting 
                        treatment but not surviving. The 
                        families don’t usually pay once 
                        their loved one doesn’t make it.

           Jerry puts his head down, burying it in his arms, taking deep 
           breaths. This is not how he wanted this important day go to. 

           Kian sees this and steps up for him...

                                 KIAN
                        We need to get the scan today. 
                        We’ll figure out how to pay his 
                        bills.  

                                 DR. GLADSTONE
                        I think it’s important for you to 
                        consider that there are much 
                        cheaper hospitals than ours. You 
                        may want to look into those so you 
                        don’t go into serious debt.  

                                 KIAN
                        We can’t start over at a new 
                        hospital. It’ll take time to 
                        transfer all the files, get an 
                        appointment. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 KIAN (CONT'D)
                        They’ll have to do their own tests 
                        and biopsies. We can’t that. We’re 
                        here today. Please...

           He motions to his Dad, who’s head is still down on the desk, 
           “look at what this is doing to him.”

           Gladstone shares a look with Courtney...

                                 COURTNEY
                        If you pay the full balance today, 
                        we can go forward with the PET. But 
                        I think what Dr. Gladstone is 
                        saying is it may not be worth going 
                        into debt over.  

                                 KIAN
                        What’s not worth it???? His life??? 

                                 DR. GLADSTONE
                        There’s no guarantee any of this 
                        will work.  

           Everyone can hear Jerry silently sobbing into his sleeves.

                                 KIAN
                        What’s wrong with you?? Can we stop 
                        talking about money??? 

           Zora pulls out a FEW CREDIT CARDS, handing them over.

                                 ZORA
                        Here. Run these. But I’m surprised 
                        at both of you. Washingtonian 
                        Magazine said you were a top 10 
                        oncologist, Dr. Gladstone. And it 
                        said Hopkins was number three in 
                        the country. You’re not acting like 
                        it. You should be ashamed. 

                                 DR. GLADSTONE
                             (unmoved)
                        We’ll see what we get from the PET 
                        and go from there. But if we move 
                        to bone marrow transplant, you’ll 
                        need to pay up front.  

                                 KIAN
                        Are you a hospital or a fucking 
                        bank???  
                                 JERRY
                             (picking up his head)
                        Kian, let it go. Look at the bigger 
                        picture...

           QUICK FLASHBACK-- 1994. Jerry stands with a 12 year-old Kian 
           atop the mountain, out of breath, looking out. He hands him a 
           donut...  

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        See it, Kian? See the bigger 
                        picture?

           Kian's trying so hard, but still doesn’t know what he should 
           be looking for. He shakes his head, feeling embarrassed.  

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay, son. You will.  

           INT. JOHNS HOPKINS HOSPITAL, HALLWAY - MORNING (BACK TO 2005)

           Kian and Zora walk Jerry down the hallway towards the PET 
           scan room. Jerry’s in a hospital gown, going slow, feeling 
           weak. None of them wear hopeful expressions.  

                                 KIAN
                        Hey, pop... Ganbatte.  

           Jerry nods, absorbing that...

           INT. PET SCAN MACHINE - MORNING

           Jerry’s loaded into the machine...

           INT. DR. GLADSTONE’S OFFICE - DAY

           The three of them wait outside Gladstone’s personal office, 
           post-scan.  

           Jerry takes down some Tylenol. He looks at the clock on his 
           phone, 5:46pm. He exhales, growing impatient.  

                                 JERRY
                        We’ve been here all day. If it was 
                        good news, they would’ve told us.  

                                 KIAN
                        Maybe they’re just busy. 

                                 JERRY
                        Yeah but if they knew it was 
                        nothing, they’d come out and say, 
                        “you’re all good, go home!”  
           Kian and Zora can’t argue with that. Kian can tell his dad is 
           spiraling, fear starting to get the best of him...

                                 KIAN
                             (lying through his teeth)
                        I’ve been writing a novel.

                                 JERRY
                        What? Since when?

                                 KIAN
                        ... Since I’ve been back. Something 
                        real. In my voice. It’s going well. 

                                 JERRY
                        Why didn’t you tell me?

                                 KIAN
                        I didn’t want to get your hopes up-- 

                                 JERRY
                        I’m just proud of the pursuit. Can 
                        I read it?

                                 KIAN
                        Yeah. Soon.

           Kian can tell his dad is happy to hear this. It’s almost as 
           if a weight is slightly lifted from Jerry’s chest-- his son 
           is heading in the right direction, or so he thinks...

           Finally-- Gladstone and Reiss-Binder enter:

                                 DR. GLADSTONE
                        Mr. Keating, let’s head back. 

           INT. GLADSTONE'S OFFICE - EVENING

           Jerry, Zora and Kian sit on pins and needles across from 
           Gladstone and Reiss-Binder.

                                 DR. KIM REISS-BINDER
                        Sorry for the delay, but we wanted 
                        to confirm with our colleagues what 
                        we were seeing on your scan.  

                                 JERRY
                        Okay...

                                 DR. GLADSTONE
                        Mr. Keating... your tumors have 
                        shrunk 30-50%.  
                                 JERRY
                        Shrunk?

                                 DR. GLADSTONE
                        All of them. Across the board.  

                                 DR. KIM REISS-BINDER
                        It’s incredible. 

                                 DR. GLADSTONE
                        If we continue in this direction, 
                        you’ll be getting that bone marrow 
                        transplant, which is the only 
                        realistic “cure” in your scenario.

           Jerry smiles, obviously happy to hear this. But he’s also so 
           drained and weak that he can barely muster the strength to 
           show it. Kian picks up on this.

                                 KIAN
                        We’re obviously thrilled about the 
                        news, but do you know why he’s been 
                        feeling weaker recently?

                                 DR. GLADSTONE
                        Could be lasting effects of the 
                        chemo. We did notice some bright 
                        spots in his brain, that’s partly 
                        why we took so long, but we don’t 
                        think it’s spread.  

                                 KIAN
                        You don’t?

                                 DR. GLADSTONE
                        PETs light up in the brain and give 
                        false positives all the time. We go 
                        off the size of the tumors. And 
                        they’re all down--  

                                 DR. KIM REISS-BINDER
                        It’s amazing.

                                 DR. GLADSTONE
                        So we can get you in here next week 
                        to do a scan of your brain, but I 
                        wouldn’t worry about it.

           EXT. STRICKLER KNOB TRAIL - NEXT MORNING

           Sunrise. Kian and Hanna pack up their tent, heading back the 
           way they came, towards the fork they were at before...
           EXT. STRICKLER KNOB TRAIL - DAY

           Kian consults the map, picking the far left fork this time. 

                                 KIAN
                        This is the right way, we’re good 
                        now. Ganbatte.

           Kian puts his hand out for her to grab, but she doesn’t 
           accept it.

                                 HANNA
                        What’s it mean? We always say it, 
                        but I don’t know what it literally 
                        means. I think I’ve just filled in 
                        the blank with my own shit.

                                 KIAN
                        Depends on the context. It’s 
                        Japanese for “good luck,” or “do 
                        your best.” Or “be your best.” Or, 
                        in this case, “let’s go for it.”  

           She thinks about that, then stops, sitting down on a large 
           boulder, looking down the mountain, down the way they came. 
           Kian turns to her.

                                 HANNA
                        Can we just take a sec and talk as 
                        adults?

                                 KIAN
                        As adults??

                                 HANNA
                        If we head back down now, we can 
                        easily get to the car before dark.  

                                 KIAN
                        But if we keep going, we’ll make it 
                        to the top by sunset. Trust me, 
                        you’re gonna love the next part. 
                        We’re almost there, kinda....

           INT. EDGEHILL RECOVERY CENTER, GROUP ROOM - DAY

           Kian, 19, sits in the back of a large meeting room with about 
           30 recovering addicts.  

           Jerry, 49, lords over the room-- having worked his way up to 
           HEAD COUNSELOR-- the clients hanging onto his every word. 
           He’s handsome, vibrant and in top shape...
                                 JERRY
                        Why do we relapse? There’s a list 
                        of reasons there in your workbook. 
                        I want you to circle the ones that 
                        resonate with you. Everyone’s 
                        different. For me, it was being 
                        ungrateful. I had so much in my 
                        life, but I was pissing it away 
                        cause I wanted more. Ignoring the 
                        good right in front of me...

           Jerry locks eyes with his son for a beat.

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        If you’re here, you still got a 
                        shot. You just gotta hunker down. 
                        Cause I can tell you, as someone 
                        who was sitting right where you are-
                        - as someone who has come out the 
                        other side-- there’s no drug on the 
                        planet as potent as the feeling you 
                        get when you know you’re living 
                        your best life.

           Kian smiles at his dad, so proud of him for turning it all 
           around, and now helping others...

           EXT. ZORA HOUSE - NIGHT

           The three of them get out of the car, walking up to the 
           house. Kian notices his father swaying a bit as he walks.

                                 KIAN
                        You okay, pop?

                                 JERRY
                        Yeah. A little wobbly. Just tired.  

                                 ZORA
                        He’s been up since 5:30 in the 
                        morning. Who wouldn’t be tired?

           They get to the front door, entering...

                                 ZORA (CONT’D)
                        You just need a nice dinner. Want 
                        me to make some Kebab?

                                 JERRY
                        That sounds good, Z. But I think 
                        I’m just gonna head to bed.  
           Kian watches his dad head towards his guest bedroom-- 

                                 KIAN
                        It’s good news, dad. It was a good 
                        day.

           Jerry smiles, then heads into his room, closing his door.  

           INT. MALLORY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Kian and Mallory lay in bed, once again basking in a post-
           coital glow--

                                 MALLORY
                        We’re getting better at that.

                                 KIAN
                        You saying it wasn’t good before?

                                 MALLORY
                        No, I’m saying it was even better. 
                        You insecure or something?

                                 KIAN
                        Every guy is to an extent. 

                                 MALLORY
                        Where’s it come from?

                                 KIAN
                        My ex said I lasted too long.

                                 MALLORY
                        Whaaaat?

                                 KIAN
                        I know! 

                                 MALLORY
                        I don’t think you last too long. If 
                        anything--

                                 KIAN
                        -- Don’t.  
                             (beat)
                        I guess she was over us, so even a 
                        moderate amount of time felt long.  

                                 MALLORY
                        Clayton and I had such good 
                        chemistry in bed.

                                 KIAN
                        Oh cool--
                                 MALLORY
                             (laughing)
                        Sorry.  

                                 KIAN
                        No, I love thinking about that. 
                        That’s fun. How big was he?-- I’m 
                        kidding, don’t answer that. 

           She smiles at a memory. He can tell she’s thinking about her 
           husband. And this is accentuated by the smile’s fade, into a 
           deeper thought. 

                                 KIAN (CONT’D)
                        I was just joking. We can talk 
                        about it if you want. It’s probably 
                        good to. Catharsis and shit.

                                 MALLORY
                        No... It’s better like this-- just 
                        having fun. 
                             (beat)
                        Which is why it’s so hard for me to 
                        say... I gotta go to bed.

           She gets up, starts putting on her pajamas.  

                                 MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        I start a new case tomorrow, gotta 
                        get a full eight. 

                                 KIAN
                        Oh sure, totally. Wanna practice 
                        your oral arguments on me?

                                 MALLORY
                        Was that a sexual joke?

                                 KIAN
                        It wasn’t. But we can make it one. 

           She smiles, letting her guard down for a moment. But she’s 
           still distant. He can read it. She’s not good at hiding it.  

                                 MALLORY
                        I gotta get ready for tomorrow.

           Kian nods, getting it, grabbing his pants and shirt to leave.

           INT. ZORA KEATING'S HOUSE - MORNING

           Kian sits at the dining room table, on his laptop, 
           researching “dizziness associated with lymphoma.” Jerry 
           stands over the sink, eating a pastry.  
                                 KIAN
                        Still feeling dizzy?

           Jerry walks into the dining room area, testing his balance.  

                                 JERRY
                        A little, yeah. Nothing crazy. I’m 
                        gonna take a nap.  

                                 KIAN
                        You just woke up.

                                 JERRY
                             (not seeing his screen)
                        You working on your novel?

                                 KIAN
                        Uh, yeah. Yup.

           Jerry smiles, heading away.

                                 KIAN (CONT’D)
                        Oscars are on tonight. We watching?

                                 JERRY
                        ... You bet.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Kian, Jerry and Zora watch the Oscars. Zora half-watches 
           while working from the dining table. Kian sits on the end of 
           the couch with Jerry laying across it, feet on Kian's lap.  

                                 JERRY
                             (point at the TV)
                        Who’s that?

                                 KIAN
                        Jake Gyllenhaal.

                                 JERRY
                        Who?

                                 ZORA
                        He was the Bubble Boy.

                                 KIAN
                        He’s been in other things too. 

                                 ZORA
                        I never saw him in anything but the 
                        Bubble Boy.    
                                 JERRY
                        He any good?

                                 KIAN
                        Yeah, not bad.  

                                 ZORA
                        I thought he was excellent as the 
                        bubble boy.  

                                 JERRY
                        When I’m better, I’m gonna come 
                        visit you in LA and you gotta take 
                        me to some Hollywood parties.  

                                 KIAN
                        You got it.  

                                 ZORA
                        And mama is coming too!  

                                 JERRY
                        Three peas in a little fucked up 
                        pod together in LA. Maybe I’ll 
                        become friends with the bubble boy. 
                        Live the Hollywood party life.   

           Jerry starts bobbing his shoulders, trying to look like 
           someone he thinks is cool. It’s hard to tell what he’s doing. 
           Kind of swaying like a rapper would in a music video, but 
           looking like a white guy with no hair battling cancer.  

                                 KIAN
                        You look really cool there, pop.

                                 JERRY
                        I’m cool like Adam Levine.  

                                 KIAN
                        Who?  

                                 JERRY
                        Are you kidding??? 

                                 ZORA
                        Kian jan, how have you not heard of 
                        Adam Levine? He’s very cool.  

                                 JERRY
                        The lead singer of Maroon 5!

                                 KIAN
                        Oh, yeah. You just had to say that. 
                        I didn’t really know his name. 
                                 JERRY
                        He’s so good. You gotta hear this-- 

           Jerry walks over and presses play on the home stereo 
           (remember, it’s 2005). It starts playing “Harder to Breathe” 
           by Maroon 5... Jerry’s bobbing his head, getting into it.  

                                 KIAN
                        This song is so old.

                                 JERRY
                        This is my jam. This is my shit.

           Jerry starts dancing, slapping his knee to the beat. He loses 
           his balance, but plays it off. He meant to do that.

           The three of them dance around the living room to the Maroon 
           5 song... a happy little family... 

           EXT. STRICKLER KNOB TRAIL - DAY

           Kian pulls himself up over a set of boulders. You don’t need 
           to be an expert to do this, but it isn’t easy either. He’s 
           breathing heavy, completely exhausted. 

           He then reaches down for Hanna’s hand, but she doesn’t take 
           it, pulling herself up with her own strength. 

           They both turn and look upon a beautiful set of WATERFALLS. 

           After a beat, Kian launches into a coughing fit. 

           Hanna hands him some water. He smiles down at his daughter, 
           thanking her, too out of breath to verbalize it.  

           They both catch their breath, taking in the beauty of it all. 
           Side by side. Father and daughter. 

           He shoots her a look, “not bad, right?” She nods, letting her 
           guard down a bit more... 

           INT. ZORA KEATING'S HOUSE - MORNING

           Kian has his laptop set up in the living room, SKYPING a 
           studio exec, PETER, 30s. 

           Kian’s in the middle of his pitch for “Monster in the Mail”--
                                 KIAN
                        ... so at the end of the second 
                        act, the family has bonded with the 
                        monster, but the dad doesn’t want 
                        it around because he thinks its 
                        been ruining his life--

                                 PETER (ON SKYPE)
                        Hold up, where does this happen?

                                 KIAN
                        At the end of the second act. 

                                 PETER (ON SKYPE)
                        The dad doesn’t want the monster to 
                        live with them anymore at the end 
                        of the second act?

                                 KIAN
                        Yeah. Um... so he calls the FBI 
                        anonymously, but...

           Suddenly, JERRY comes out of his bedroom, zigzagging, 
           staggering, using nearby furniture for support. Kian notices-- 

                                 KIAN (CONT’D)
                        Dad?

                                 JERRY
                        I can’t catch my balance. 

                                 KIAN
                             (to Peter)
                        Hey man-- I gotta go. Sorry--

                                 PETER
                        Everything okay?

           Kian closes his laptop, ending the skype call abruptly. He 
           jumps up to help his dad, stabilizing him. But as he does, 
           Jerry THROWS UP on the carpet.  

                                 JERRY
                        I threw up in the bathroom too. 
                        Everything’s spinning.  

           Kian looks into his father’s eyes. Jerry’s scared...

           INT. JOHNS HOPKINS HOSPITAL, EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY

           Kian and Zora kiss Jerry as he’s wheeled off to get an MRI.  
           Kian watches him go, then turns down the hallway... breaking 
           down, no idea what’s wrong with his dad.  
           He glances around at all the other people in the WAITING 
           AREA, worried about their loved ones.

           He finds a quiet corner, slumps onto the floor. He’s a small 
           man in this moment. A boy. Terrified of losing his father.   

           He suddenly gets a call from Mallory. She’s at her place, 
           pacing in the living room. INTERCUT. 

                                 KIAN
                        Hey...

                                 MALLORY
                        Hey, I have something to tell you. 
                        I’m just going to say it--
                             (hearing sounds in the 
                              background)
                        Wait, where are you?

                                 KIAN
                        The hospital. My dad couldn’t walk 
                        straight this morning. He was 
                        throwing up.

                                 MALLORY
                        Do they know what’s going on???

                                 KIAN
                        He’s getting an MRI now.   

                                 MALLORY
                        Maybe he ate something bad?

                                 KIAN
                        Yeah... maybe. Probably, yeah.  

                                 MALLORY
                        Well... I wanted to call because... 
                        I don’t know how to say this and 
                        would obviously rather do it in 
                        person, but um, I didn’t know how 
                        you’d take it. So I felt like over 
                        the phone was the best option...  

                                 KIAN
                        ... Okay. 

                                 MALLORY
                        I was feeling off-- And... I missed 
                        my period. So I took a pregnancy 
                        test and it was... not negative. 

           They sit in heavy silence for a beat...
                                 KIAN
                        ... Are you sure it was accurate?

                                 MALLORY
                        I’ve taken six more.

                                 KIAN
                        Oh fuck. Wow. Okay, you’re 
                        definitely pregnant. Unless they 
                        were 99 Cent Store brand or--

                                 MALLORY
                        They were the fancy $10 kind.

                                 KIAN
                        Okay. Yeah. That confirms it. 
                        And... it’s mine?

                                 MALLORY
                        No, I’m just calling to let you 
                        know I’ve been fucking a bunch of 
                        other dudes, so it’s probably one 
                        of theirs.

                                 KIAN
                        ... Uh, what?

                                 MALLORY
                        YES. Kian. It’s yours. 100%.

                                 KIAN
                        So that’s... good, right?

                                 MALLORY
                        I-- I never pictured having a kid 
                        with anyone but Clayton. Plus, last 
                        time this happened, it didn’t go...

           She can’t finish, on the verge of breaking down.  

                                 MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        -- And what if, like, Clayton comes 
                        back and sees me pregnant and that 
                        scares him off? 

                                 KIAN
                        Mal--

                                 MALLORY
                        What if he wants to get back 
                        together but realizes I’ve moved on-

                                 KIAN
                        Mal--
                                 MALLORY
                        What if he--

                                 KIAN
                        Mal! He’s... not coming back.

                                 MALLORY
                        The fuck did you just say?

                                 KIAN
                        He changed his number. His email. 
                        He doesn’t want to be found... He’s 
                        not coming back.

                                 MALLORY
                        Why would you say something shitty 
                        like that???

                                 KIAN
                        I’m saying, maybe this is a good 
                        thing. We can make this work. I’m 
                        gonna be a dad. My dad’s gonna be a 
                        grandpa. That’s gonna make him so 
                        happy. Maybe we should try to see 
                        the positive in this. 

           They sit there in heavy silence. Mallory is trying to keep it 
           together. Trying to let go... But she can’t. Wiping the 
           tears. Putting on a strong face.

                                 MALLORY
                        Sorry about your dad. I know you’re 
                        going through a lot. I hesitated 
                        calling you--

                                 KIAN
                        I’m glad you called me.

                                 MALLORY
                        I gotta go. I’ll let you know what 
                        I’m thinking...  

                                 KIAN
                        Mal, wait-- 

           Mallory hangs up before he can continue, leaving Kian there, 
           frustrated with himself for pushing so hard.

           INT. ER, PATIENT ROOM - DAY

           Kian, Jerry and Zora anxiously wait for the MRI results.  
           Jerry’s rubbing his forehead like he has a headache.  
                                 JERRY
                        ... They kept me in that damn MRI 
                        tunnel forever. Listening to that 
                        jackhammer with a headache. Fuckin 
                        nightmare, man.  

                                 KIAN
                        That’s brutal, dad. Hopefully we’ll 
                        know more soon.

                                 JERRY
                        I can’t take more of this shit. The 
                        pain, the tests, the fuckin chemo. 

           Jerry looks beat-- like he’s lost hope. Kian reads this--

                                 KIAN
                        I know something that might cheer 
                        you up... Mallory’s pregnant.

           It just hangs there for a beat...

                                 JERRY
                        Who?

                                 KIAN
                        Mallory. My friend from high 
                        school. We were like best friends. 

                                 JERRY
                        Oh yeah. She was sweet. You were 
                        obsessed with her.

                                 KIAN
                        Don’t know if I’d say “obsessed,” 
                        but yes, that’s the same person.  

                                 JERRY
                        You were so obsessed. 
                             (beat)
                        Wait, so what’s going on with her?

                                 KIAN
                        Well... like I just said, she’s 
                        pregnant. 

                                 JERRY
                        Oh, good for her.

                                 KIAN
                        Good for us, dad. She’s pregnant 
                        with my kid. 
                                 JERRY
                        Wait, what? I’m confused. You guys 
                        together or something?

                                 KIAN
                        Since I’ve been out here, we’ve 
                        been--

                                 ZORA
                        Isn’t she married, Kian?

                                 KIAN
                        She was, yeah. But he left her.

                                 ZORA
                        Oh God, that’s awful. When???

                                 KIAN
                        Not super recently. Over a year 
                        ago. Doesn’t matter.

                                 ZORA
                        Are you sure it’s yours?  

                                 KIAN
                        Yes. Yes. Look, I think we’re 
                        focusing on the wrong things here-- 
                        Mallory is having the baby and I’m 
                        going to be a dad. 

           These last words land with Jerry and Zora. They light up. 

                                 JERRY
                        Come here.

           Jerry puts out his arms, hugging Kian. Zora joins in.  

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                             (overjoyed)
                        I’m gonna be a grandpa!  

                                 ZORA
                        I’m too young to be a grandma, so 
                        I’ll just say she’s my niece.

           INT. ER, PATIENT ROOM - NIGHT

           It’s later that night and the three of them are still 
           waiting. Jerry’s trying to get some rest.  

           Kian is on the floor, staring up at the ceiling. 

                                 ZORA
                        Kian jan, don’t lay on the floor.  
                                 KIAN
                        Why?

                                 ZORA
                        It’s filthy. You could get sick. 

                                 KIAN
                        Good thing we’re in a hospital.  

                                 ZORA
                        Don’t be difficult.

           Suddenly, Dr. Kim Reiss-Binder pops in..  

                                 DR. KIM REISS-BINDER
                        Hey, everyone--
                             (to Kian)
                        You really shouldn’t lay on the 
                        floor like that. 

           Kian listens, getting up.  

                                 DR. KIM REISS-BINDER (CONT’D)
                        I looked at your MRI and didn’t see 
                        anything in your brain. So it 
                        hasn’t spread there at least.  

                                 ZORA
                        Thank God.  

                                 KIAN
                        So what’s going on with him?

                                 DR. KIM REISS-BINDER
                        We’re still figuring that out.  
                        Obviously, our oncology radiologist 
                        has to take a look. I think he’s 
                        going to do that this evening. But 
                        so far, so good. Hopefully it’s 
                        just an inner-ear infection 
                        throwing off your balance and we 
                        can get it taken care of and send 
                        you home in the morning. 

           Everyone smiles, this is the best possible scenario.  

           Dr. Reiss-Binder exits. Kian gives his dad a kiss on the 
           forehead, happy he’s going to be okay.

                                 JERRY
                        You guys should head home. They’re 
                        just gonna clean out my ears. I’ll 
                        see you in the morning.
           INT. CAR, DRIVING - NIGHT

           Kian and Zora head down 95 South. They listen to some Maroon 
           5, jamming out, feeling good... 

           INT. ZORA KEATING'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

           Kian brushes his teeth in the mirror, closing his eyes, 
           exhausted.  

           He comes out of the guest bathroom to see his father’s empty 
           bed. He lays down on it...

           Pulls out his phone and calls Mallory. It just rings and 
           rings before going to voicemail. 

           He hangs up before leaving a message, opting to text her: You 
           up? Can we talk?

           He puts his phone down beside him on the bed, waiting for her 
           to respond, closing his eyes...

           EXT. STRICKLER KNOB TRAIL - DUSK

           The sun’s getting low again. In the distance, they can see 
           the summit...

                                 HANNA
                        Okay, there’s the top. We see it. 
                        We’re good. 

                                 KIAN
                        Almost there... Just gotta push 
                        through. 

                                 HANNA
                        What’s the point?

                                 KIAN
                             (pointing at the summit)
                        That. That is the point. Getting to 
                        the top. Looking out on everything. 

                                 HANNA
                        Come on, can we please turn around? 

                                 KIAN
                        Are you hungry? Is that it?

                                 HANNA
                        Yeah! And tired! And all fuckin 
                        sweaty!  
                                 KIAN
                        Look, I’ve given in on the F-bombs. 
                        I’ve lost that fight. But let’s get 
                        there. It’s just a little further.

                                 HANNA
                        Farther.

                                 KIAN
                        What?

                                 HANNA
                        It’s farther. Not further. 

                                 KIAN
                        Some parents would get annoyed at 
                        being corrected by their teenage 
                        daughter, but I love that you’re 
                        smarter than me. 

           Kian smiles and keeps going, but Hanna doesn’t. She digs in. 

                                 HANNA
                        I’m done, dad. 

           She’s not saying this as defiantly as the past times. She’s 
           saying it calmly. Truly done.  

           He turns around, goes back to her.

                                 KIAN
                        You’re so much like your mom-- Have 
                        a snack, you’ll feel better.

                                 HANNA
                        If you want to keep going, you can. 
                        But I’m heading back down. 

                                 KIAN
                        Not alone. It’s not safe. 

                                 HANNA
                        Then come with me! You can just 
                        come with me, dad. You don’t have 
                        to force this...

           She turns, starts heading down the mountain. 

           Kian’s so frustrated. But he hides it. He takes a deep breath 
           and sits down. Giving in. Letting go.  

           She turns back, spotting him sitting there.  
                                 HANNA (CONT’D)
                        Come on, don’t guilt me. That’s not 
                        fair. This trip was for you!

                                 KIAN
                        No it wasn’t. It was for you.
                             (beat)
                        Okay, and me. It was for us.  

           She comes back and sits down next to him, seeing how 
           important this is to him.    

                                 KIAN (CONT’D)
                        I had this whole trip worked out. 
                        But things don’t always go 
                        according to plan. 
                             (beat)
                        Actually, they hardly ever do...

           INT. ZORA KEATING'S HOUSE - NEXT MORNING

           Kian sleeps in his dad’s bed. He’s suddenly awoken by his 
           cell RINGING. He fumbles for it. Doesn’t recognize the 
           number, but notices that it’s a Baltimore area code.  

                                 KIAN
                             (answering, half-asleep)
                        Yeah?

                                 DR. KIM REISS-BINDER (O.S.)
                        Hi, Kian? It’s Dr. Reiss-Binder--

           Kian sits up a bit, gaining his bearings. 

                                 DR. KIM REISS-BINDER (CONT’D)
                        The radiologist saw a tiny 
                        something in your dad’s spine on 
                        the MRI so we’re going to perform a 
                        lumbar puncture to figure out what 
                        it is.

                                 KIAN
                        I thought you said his MRI was 
                        clean?

                                 DR. KIM REISS-BINDER (O.S.)
                        His brain is clear. I personally 
                        didn’t see the thing in his spine, 
                        but our radiologist did. It might 
                        just be something he’s had his 
                        whole life. But we need to double-
                        check the fluid to be sure.  
                                 KIAN
                        Uh, okay. Have you talked to him?

                                 DR. KIM REISS-BINDER (O.S.)
                        Yeah. He’s fine with it. It won’t 
                        hurt. Super easy procedure. We do 
                        it all the time.  

                                 KIAN
                        So you think he’ll be okay?

           There’s a long pause. 

                                 DR. KIM REISS-BINDER (O.S.)
                        I think there’s a chance it’s 
                        nothing. I also-- I’m-- Let’s see 
                        what it is and go from there. 

           This is not as reassuring as Kian was hoping for...

           INT. CAR, DRIVING - MORNING

           Sitting in traffic on 95 North. Kian is trying to remain as 
           calm as possible, kind of rocking back and forth, as if 
           attempting to will the traffic to part ways.

           Suddenly, his phone rings. He answers--

                                 KIAN
                        Hello?

                                 GRETA
                        Yo, it’s Greta. Just heard that 
                        monster movie’s not going your way. 
                        I spoke to Peter. He said you hung 
                        up on him? What happened??? 

           Kian opens his mouth to respond, but instead just hangs up on 
           her, continuing to breathe, rocking, about to lose it...

           INT. JOHNS HOPKINS HOSPITAL - MORNING

           Kian and Zora enter Jerry’s room to find a NURSE cleaning 
           LARGE AMOUNTS OF BLOOD off the floor.  

           Jerry’s laying on his side, eyes closed.

                                 KIAN
                        What the hell happened in here???

                                 NURSE
                             (nonchalant)
                        It’s just some blood from the 
                        lumbar puncture.
                                 KIAN
                        What???

                                 NURSE
                        They had trouble pinpointing it. A 
                        few failed attempts.

                                 JERRY
                        Six. Six failed attempts.

                                 KIAN
                        What the fuck??? 

                                 ZORA
                        This hospital is the worst. 
                             (looking at all the blood)
                        Plus, Kian remember when I said the 
                        floor’s not clean and you gave me a 
                        hard time?  

           Kian looks at his dad’s back, seeing it’s been BANDAGED.  

                                 KIAN
                        These motherfuckers, man.  

                                 JERRY
                        It’s okay, Kian. Let it go. Let it 
                        flow through you.

           Kian tries to breathe through it.  

           Just then, Dr. Gladstone and Dr. Kim Reiss-Binder enter.  

                                 DR. KIM REISS-BINDER
                        Mr. Keating... How are you feeling?

                                 JERRY
                        Back’s sore. Kinda got a headache.  
                        But okay, I guess...  

           Gladstone and Reiss-Binder share a look-- Gladstone takes the 
           reigns.  

                                 DR. GLADSTONE 
                        The results of your lumbar puncture 
                        came back... it seems your lymphoma 
                        has spread to your spinal fluid. 
                        The proliferation of cancer in your 
                        spine has caused your meninges to 
                        become inflamed, which is why 
                        you’re getting the headaches and 
                        dizziness.  
                                 JERRY
                        Oh, okay... so... what’s that mean?

                                 DR. GLADSTONE
                        We just sat down with the entire 
                        oncology team here and came to the 
                        conclusion that there’s nothing 
                        else we can do, unfortunately--

                                 JERRY
                        You mean, like... ever?

                                 DR. GLADSTONE
                        That’s correct.

                                 KIAN
                        Wait, what about Methotrexate? I 
                        Googled that you could put a port 
                        in his skull and--

                                 DR. GLADSTONE
                        We discussed it. It’s too risky and 
                        there’s no real upside. There’s no 
                        beating this, unfortunately--

                                 KIAN
                        Of course there’s a way to beat it.  
                        We’d like to discuss all options--

                                 DR. GLADSTONE
                        There are no more options for him 
                        at this hospital. Or any hospital, 
                        I’d imagine.  

                                 KIAN
                        That’s not true, I read--

                                 DR. GLADSTONE
                        You might be able to extend his 
                        life by an extra few weeks, maybe a 
                        month or two with some highly 
                        invasive procedures, but his 
                        quality of life would be so low, it 
                        wouldn’t be worth it... 

           To put this conversation to bed, Dr. Gladstone turns away 
           from Kian and towards Jerry, looking right at him:

                                 DR. GLADSTONE (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Keating, you are going to die.  

           This completely sucks out whatever air was left in the room.  
           Jerry attempts to process what Gladstone just said, putting 
           on a brave face.  

                                 JERRY
                        We all gotta go. How much time do I 
                        got?... A year?

                                 DR. GLADSTONE
                        ... I’d say days to weeks.

           Jerry was not prepared for this. He’s frozen. Catatonic.

           Kian looks up at Gladstone, who wears a blank, cold 
           expression on his face--

                                 KIAN
                        You’re a fucking asshole.

                                 DR. GLADSTONE
                        I understand this isn’t easy--

                                 KIAN
                        That has nothing to do with it, I 
                        just think you’re a FUCKING 
                        ASSHOLE!

           Kian rushes Gladstone, about to take a swing at him, but 
           Jerry reaches up, grabbing his arm, pleading for him not to. 

           Begging him to see “the bigger picture.”  

           Kian takes a breath, relenting, at a loss.  

           Gladstone turns and exits, without shaking Jerry’s hand.  

           Dr. Kim Reiss-Binder bends down to Jerry’s level-- this 
           helpless man in a hospital bed.  

                                 DR. KIM REISS-BINDER
                        You’re a brave man, Mr. Keating. 
                        But embedding a port into your 
                        cerebrospinal space to administer 
                        chemo would be brutal. And it 
                        wouldn’t treat the rest of your 
                        body, which would still have 
                        cancer. We just ran out of options. 
                        It’s about the quality time you 
                        have left now. Spend it with your 
                        family. Not with us.

           Jerry puts his hand out to thank her. She gets in close and 
           hugs him instead. 
                                 DR. KIM REISS-BINDER (CONT’D)
                        We’ll move to a more comfortable 
                        room. Get you talking to Dr. Smith, 
                        our director of Palliative Care. 
                        Make sure you’re taken care of. 

           Jerry nods. Dr. Reiss-Binder gets up, somberly shaking Kian 
           and Zora’s hands before exiting.  

           Once she’s gone, Kian hugs his dad, emotions gushing forth.

                                 KIAN
                        I’m so sorry, dad. I--

                                 JERRY
                        You didn’t do anything wrong.   

                                 KIAN
                        You’re the best father a kid could 
                        ask for...  

                                 JERRY
                        I know. 

           They smile through the tears...  

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        But I have a feeling you’re gonna 
                        be better... if you’re not, I’ll 
                        kick your ass. 

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - LATE DAY

           A NURSE is wheeling Jerry to his new room. His mind is 
           racing. Kian and Zora flank him.  

           INT. JERRY’S NEW HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           This room is a bit bigger, but it’s not “nicer.” It’s the 
           type of drab and dated room they give someone who they don’t 
           want to spend much more money on.  

           DR. SMITH, short, older, kind of has the vibe of a gentle 
           garden gnome, stands with them, holding various FORMS. 

                                 DR. SMITH
                        Kian, since your father doesn’t 
                        have an Advanced Directive or Will, 
                        I’m going to leave this paperwork 
                        with you. It’s important to get 
                        everything in order before it’s, 
                        you know, too late.  

           Dr. Smith hands the forms to Kian, who’s overwhelmed.  
                                 DR. SMITH (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Keating, I know this isn’t the 
                        outcome you were hoping for, but 
                        with the right palliative care 
                        plan, you can really enjoy the 
                        remaining months of your life.  

                                 JERRY
                        Gladstone said I had days to weeks.

                                 DR. SMITH
                        Oh. Yes. Well... 

           Dr. Smith smiles and exits before putting his foot in his 
           mouth again.  

           Kian leafs through the forms. He reads a section on “BURIAL 
           PLANS” and it really starts to hit him.   

                                 KIAN
                             (trying to be casual)
                        Dad, um, I don’t know if you’ve 
                        ever mentioned it, but... do you 
                        have a preference as far as... 
                        like, um, burials and stuff?

                                 JERRY
                             (beat)
                        ... My parents were cremated. That 
                        sounds better than being buried.  

           Kian starts to make a note of that--

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        But, being burned is kinda scary.

                                 ZORA
                        I don’t want to be burned or 
                        buried.  

                                 KIAN
                        Those are the only options, mom.

                                 ZORA
                        I want to be put in a tomb above 
                        the ground.

                                 KIAN
                        A tomb?

                                 ZORA
                        A mausoleum. I want a mausoleum.
                                 JERRY
                        That’s too flashy and expensive for 
                        me.

                                 ZORA
                        I don’t mind the expense. Kian, 
                        promise you’ll put me in a 
                        mausoleum.

                                 KIAN
                        Sure thing, mom.  

                                 JERRY
                        I’m gonna get some sleep. You guys 
                        should head home.

                                 KIAN
                        No, we’re staying here with you.

                                 JERRY
                        Here? Where? I’m in the only bed. 
                        You’ll just keep me up. Go home.  
                        Get some rest. Come back in the 
                        morning and get me.  

           Kian shares a glance with his mom who agrees.  

                                 KIAN
                        We’re gonna do what we can to fight 
                        this, dad. 

                                 JERRY
                        Let’s do what we can to learn from 
                        it instead, okay?

           Kian and Zora hug Jerry before heading for the door. Before 
           getting there, Kian turns back.  

                                 KIAN
                        Love you, Dad. Big as the Universe.  

                                 JERRY
                             (distant)
                        Love you too. 

           INT. ZORA KEATING'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Kian beats the shit out of the couch pillows, letting out all 
           the emotion that he was trying to hold in at the hospital. 
           Zora rubs his back in an attempt to calm him.  

                                 ZORA
                        Yes, do that, Kian jan. That’s 
                        good. That will help...
           Kian runs out of steam, panting, exhausted. 

                                 KIAN
                        I’m gonna go for a walk.

           Kian gets up and exits. After he’s gone, Zora starts BEATING 
           THE SHIT out of the pillows as well.  

           EXT. STREETS OF ALEXANDRIA - NIGHT

           Kian paces the sidewalks with an anger about him. On the 
           verge of breaking down.  

           EXT. MALLORY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Kian buzzes Mallory’s apartment repeatedly. Finally, her 
           voice comes through the call box. 

                                 MALLORY (O.S.)
                        Kian what are you doing???

                                 KIAN
                        How’d you know it was me?

                                 MALLORY (O.S.)
                        There’s a camera.

                                 KIAN
                        Oh shit. I didn’t see that. 

                                 MALLORY (O.S.)
                        It’s so late, man. Can we--

                                 KIAN
                        -- We can’t. I can’t wait. Please 
                        come down so I don’t have to yell 
                        up at your window.

                                 MALLORY (O.S.)
                        Yeah, definitely don’t do that. 
                        I’ll be down in a sec. 

           Kian paces, trying to take deep breaths, calm himself. But 
           he’s losing the battle. 

           After a few beats, Mallory opens the main front door. Kian 
           notices she’s still wearing her WEDDING RING. 

           She can tell he’s been crying, on the verge of losing it 
           again, so she lets him in. 
           INT. MALLORY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           They sit on the floor, leaning against the foot of her bed.  
           Kian struggles to find the words...

                                 KIAN
                        My dad... He’s not... everything’s 
                        slipping through my fingers... 
                             (beat)
                        I can’t lose him and you at the 
                        same time... I can’t. Can I stay 
                        here tonight? I’m not saying we 
                        have to make any big decisions, I 
                        just want to be with you. 

           She hesitates, debating. After a few, she nods, hugging him. 

           INT. CAR, DRIVING - NEXT MORNING

           Kian and Zora drive up 95 North, back towards Hopkins for 
           what feels like the fucking millionth time. They’re both 
           drained, nothing left in the tank.

           INT. JERRY'S NEW HOSPITAL ROOM, HOPKINS - MORNING

           Kian and Zora sit with Jerry as he laughs at a rerun of 
           “Seinfeld.”

           As Kian pulls out the Advanced Directive from his bag:

                                 JERRY
                        -- I’m hungry. Can you grab me some 
                        food?

                                 KIAN
                        Oh, sure. What do you feel like?

                                 JERRY
                        Soup.

                                 KIAN
                        Okay. Any specific kind?

                                 JERRY
                        Chicken noodle or something. But 
                        not fuckin clam chowder. I’m puking 
                        enough as is. 

           INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

           Kian stares at the soups. There are an array of options, but 
           oddly, no chicken noodle... He debates. 
           INT. JERRY'S HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Meanwhile, Jerry mutes the TV, turning to Zora.  

                                 JERRY
                        I’m sorry, Z. I wish I was going to 
                        be around to help raise our boy.  

                                 ZORA
                        Our boy is a man now.

                                 JERRY
                        Yeah, but he’s still a boy. He 
                        still needs a father. I never 
                        taught him how to tie a bow tie. Or 
                        change the oil.  

                                 ZORA
                        That’s because you don’t know how 
                        to do those things.  

           They both smile. 

                                 JERRY
                        I’m sorry I’m not going to be there 
                        to watch him grow up. Get married. 
                        Meet that baby. I would’ve been one 
                        hell of a grandpa.

           Zora gets up and hugs him, sitting in close now. 

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        You gotta be strong, Z. You gotta 
                        be enough parent for the two of us.  

                                 ZORA
                        There’s no way I can do that.  

                                 JERRY
                        Sure you can. You’re stronger than 
                        you give yourself credit for.  
                             (beat)
                        I never thought I wouldn’t be 
                        around for all the years you two 
                        have ahead together. 
                             (beat)
                        I was hoping to beat this so I 
                        could show you how great I could 
                        be. How great we could be again...

           Zora’s emotions get the best of her. Jerry’s attempting to 
           hold back, but it’s no use. 
           Just then, Kian enters, walking in on his parents clutching 
           each other. 

                                 KIAN
                        What’s... going on?

           They both straighten up. 

                                 ZORA
                        Nothing. Just chit-chatting.

                                 JERRY
                        What kind of soup did you get me?

                                 KIAN
                        ... All of them. 

           We see that the tray Kian’s holding does in fact have 6 
           DIFFERENT TYPES OF SOUP on it. Jerry smiles at his boy, 
           sharing a moment with him.

           INT. JERRY'S HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER THAT DAY

           Jerry has taken bites from all the soups, but didn’t finish 
           any of them.  

           He looks up at the clock on the wall. 4:34pm. He struggles 
           out of bed, growing agitated. 

                                 JERRY
                        What the fuck is taking so long?? 

                                 ZORA
                        Maybe they realized they were wrong 
                        and have some options for you?

                                 KIAN
                        Mom--

                                 JERRY
                        We’re gonna hit fuckin traffic now.

           Suddenly, a NURSE comes in to check vitals.  

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me, do you know when I’m 
                        getting discharged?

                                 NURSE
                        Shouldn’t be too long.

                                 KIAN
                        Doesn’t he still need to get his 
                        line cleaned out and removed?
                                 NURSE
                        Nah, they can clean it next time. 
                        They ain’t gonna remove it til he’s 
                        done with his chemo. When’s your 
                        next appointment?

           They all share glances, clearly this nurse has not been 
           informed that Jerry’s not getting any more treatment.  

                                 JERRY
                        Um... I don’t know. Kian?

           Jerry throws it to Kian, not wanting to tell her himself.

                                 KIAN
                        Um... we... there probably won’t be 
                        any more appointments.  

                                 NURSE
                        What do you mean? Like, ever?

           Kian pleads with his eyes for her to understand him. After a 
           beat, she finally gets it. 

                                 NURSE (CONT’D)
                        Ohhh. I’m so sorry. I’m new.

           The nurse hurries out the door, embarrassed.

           This exchange has added to Jerry’s pain. He’s getting worked 
           up. Pacing. He wants to be heard. Seen. He’s still alive. 
           Still kicking.

           He drags his IV out the door and down the HALLWAY:

                                 JERRY
                        FUCKING HELLO??? ANYONE AT THIS 
                        HOSPITAL HAVE HALF A FUCKIN BRAIN?? 
                        CAN SOMEONE GET THIS FUCKING LINE 
                        OUT OF ME SO I CAN GO HOME?? WE’RE 
                        GOING TO HIT RUSH HOUR NOW!! 

           Jerry starts ripping at the port in his chest. 

                                 KIAN
                        Dad, stop!

           A DOCTOR making rounds rushes over to him.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Sir, please. We’ll get it out ASAP. 
                                 JERRY
                        They told me I’ve got “days to 
                        weeks” to live and I’m stuck in 
                        this fuckhole! 
                             (beat, exhausted)
                        I just wanna go home, man. 

           This doctor, who has never met him, looks into his eyes with 
           a profound sense of empathy. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        I know. I would too. I’m going to 
                        personally take out your line now 
                        so you can get out of here and 
                        spend some time with your family.  

                                 JERRY
                        What if it’s like 3 days and I just 
                        spent one of them in here?

                                 DOCTOR
                        I can’t even imagine what you’re 
                        feeling right now. How bout you lay 
                        down and I’ll take care of you?...

                                                               JUMP TO:

           This kind doctor takes out Jerry’s line permanently. He won’t 
           be getting treatment ever again. He knows it. Everyone in the 
           room knows it...

           INT. CAR, DRIVING - LATE DAY

           Kian drives. Zora in the passenger seat. Jerry in the back. 
           All look defeated.  

           Kian reaches back for his dad’s hand. Jerry grabs it and 
           holds it tight. Tighter than he’s ever held it before.

           Kian steals glances at Jerry in the rearview mirror. He can 
           tell his dad’s scared. Not wanting to let go...  

           INT. ZORA'S HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Everyone’s asleep. Kian's in the living room on his laptop, 
           WRITING SOMETHING.  

                                 KIAN (V.O.)
                             (hearing what he’s typing)
                        ... This is by far the hardest 
                        thing I’ve ever had to write...
           EXT. POTOMAC RIVER - DAY

           Kian, Jerry and Zora sit on a bench looking out at the 
           Potomac River. It’s a cold, gray day.  

           Jerry’s looking weak. Wearing a puffy winter jacket and 
           sunglasses, even though it’s not sunny.  

                                 KIAN
                        I was doing some research and I 
                        read about this thing called the 
                        “Abscopal Effect.” I emailed Reiss-
                        Binder about it last night and she 
                        wrote me back. It’s basically this 
                        theory-- 

                                 JERRY
                        -- Theory? Nope.

                                 KIAN
                        -- If you get local irradiation of 
                        a tumor in one spot, it could lead 
                        to cancer cells dying in other 
                        parts of the body.  

                                 ZORA
                        This really happens? It’s not some 
                        Dr. Oz shit?

                                 KIAN
                        No it’s not Dr. Oz shit. It really 
                        happens. Rarely-- It’s a Hail Mary, 
                        but... Reiss-Binder said they could 
                        see you a week from today for the 
                        irradiation session. Thursday.  

                                 JERRY
                        Will I even be alive then?

                                 KIAN
                        Yeah. I-- of course.  

                                 JERRY
                        ... I’m not going back to that 
                        place. I’m done.

                                 KIAN
                        Can you not let your emotions get 
                        in the way right now?  

                                 JERRY
                        I can do whatever the fuck I want!!
                                 ZORA
                        It’s worth a shot, Jerry jan.  
                        Maybe just try it.  

                                 JERRY
                        Okay. Sure.  

                                 KIAN
                        Wait, just like that? I’m begging 
                        you and you give me nothing. She 
                        says one sentence and you’re like, 
                        “Okay sure.”

                                 ZORA
                        I have the golden touch.  

                                 KIAN
                        If you don’t want me busting my ass 
                        to figure this stuff out for you, 
                        just tell me. 

                                 ZORA
                        Kian jan--

                                 KIAN
                        No, let him talk. You don’t have to 
                        answer for him.

                                 JERRY
                        Watch your tone with your mother.

                                 KIAN
                        I’m literally trying to find ways 
                        to save your life and you’re asking 
                        me to watch my fucking tone?!  

                                 JERRY
                        Kian--

                                 KIAN
                        I’m sick of taking care of you! 
                        Worrying about you. I’ve been doing 
                        it my whole fucking life! The 
                        drinking... the never wearing a 
                        seat belt... the fucking cancer!

           Kian storms off. Jerry musters some energy to follow him.  

                                 JERRY
                             (calling after him)
                        Kian! You know I can’t chase you. 
                        Come on. Please.  

           Kian turns back, storming up to him.  
                                 KIAN
                        I have no brothers or sisters. I 
                        have no one. I’m doing all of this 
                        on my own! 

                                 JERRY
                        I know you’ve hated worrying about 
                        me. I wish you didn’t have to. I 
                        wish I had my shit together. But I 
                        appreciate all you’ve done for me.  
                             (beat)
                        You won't have to worry much more, 
                        son. Just stick with me a little 
                        longer and then you’ll never have 
                        to worry about me again. You have 
                        this whole beautiful life ahead of 
                        you. One with a child of your own. 
                        And the only solace I take in dying 
                        now is knowing that I’ll give you 
                        one less thing to worry about.

           Kian hates the thought of this, shaking his head, not wanting 
           to think about a life without his dad...

           EXT. ZORA’S FRONT DOOR - DAY

           Kian opens the door to find Mallory holding GROCERIES and 
           FROYO. 

                                 MALLORY
                        You’re not losing me and your dad 
                        at the same time... 

           He smiles, kissing her. He then glances down noticing she’s 
           no longer wearing her wedding ring, showing she’s ready to 
           move forward. He grabs her hand, holding it. 

           He then bends down and rubs her stomach, speaking into it:

                                 KIAN
                        Hey baby, this is your papa.  
                             (up to Mallory)
                        Can it hear me? Does it have ears 
                        yet?

                                 MALLORY
                        I don’t know. I doubt it.

           INT. ZORA’S HOUSE - DAY

           Kian, Zora and Mallory go through OLD PHOTOS with Jerry. 
           They’re all eating FROYO. Listening to Maroon 5. It’s a party 
           atmosphere. Zora keeps rubbing Mallory’s belly.  
                                 ZORA
                        Are you taking prenatal vitamins? 

                                 MALLORY
                        Uh, not yet. I just--

                                 ZORA
                        You have to get the kind that’s 
                        high in folic acid, otherwise the 
                        baby’s brain won’t form properly.  

                                 MALLORY
                        Oh, okay... good idea.
                             (holding up a PHOTO to 
                              change the subject)
                        Where was this one taken?

                                 JERRY
                        That was in Tokyo, where I taught 
                        before Kian was born. 

                                 MALLORY
                        So handsome.

                                 ZORA
                        Hey, don’t get any ideas. 

                                 JERRY
                        You had your chance, Z. I’m single. 
                        Do they have dating sites for 
                        people in hospice? Hey, that’s a 
                        good idea! One final hook up before 
                        you go. Call it “Ho-Spice.”

           They’re laughing. 

                                 MALLORY
                        How long did you live in Japan? 

                                 JERRY
                        Went for one year, stayed for six.  

                                 KIAN
                        What were your favorite spots? 

           Jerry knows what Kian's doing, making up for lost time and 
           questions unasked. He obliges.  

                                 JERRY
                        I taught at the International 
                        School of the Sacred Heart in 
                        Tokyo. It’s such a beautiful 
                        country. Everyone’s so kind.

                        Meiji Shrine was my favorite place 
                        in Tokyo. Great place to relax and 
                        recharge. Also Todai-ji Temple in 
                        Nara. Man, I miss it.  
                             (beat)
                        Wish I could’ve shown you guys... 

           INT. JERRY’S GUEST BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Jerry lies in bed with Kian by his side. Jerry’s looking 
           through a STACK OF LETTERS-- hundreds of them that have been 
           sent to him from all around the country.

                                 KIAN
                        What do they say?

                                 JERRY
                        People just wishing me well. 
                        Thanking me for helping them get 
                        sober. Telling me I’m going to beat 
                        cancer...

           Jerry pauses, thinking about what he just said. 

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        ... Guess the joke’s on them.

           Kian notices a slight SLURRING in Jerry’s speech when he 
           speaks, but he doesn’t say anything about it. 

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        In 100 years, no one’s gonna know 
                        my name. 

                                 KIAN
                        That’s not true. I’m gonna make 
                        sure people know it. Your grandkid 
                        will know it...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Kian's the only one awake, WRITING:

                                 KIAN (V.O.)
                             (while typing)
                        Some of the things I will always 
                        remember and cherish... our trips 
                        up the mountain...  

           QUICK FLASH-- A young Kian and Jerry looking out on the 
           spectacular view at the top of the mountain, both eating a 
           DONUT--
                                 KIAN (V.O.)
                        ... Hanging out at Gravelly Point, 
                        watching the planes...

           QUICK FLASH-- Young Kian and Jerry watch the planes take off 
           and land at National Airport, just outside DC...

                                 KIAN (V.O.)
                        ... You picking me up after my 
                        first day of pre-school...

           QUICK FLASH-- A three year-old Kian BAWLS his eyes out, not 
           wanting to be at this pre-school. Then, out of the corner of 
           his eye, he sees his dad, his hero, walking across the field 
           towards him. He immediately bolts in his direction.

           Jerry picks up his boy, hugging him tight. 

           EXT. STRICKLER KNOB TRAIL - DUSK

           Kian sits in the same spot we left him. Hanna’s beside him, 
           looking at her dad, this crumpled up man--

           EXT. HANNA’S CHILDHOOD HOME - NIGHT

           -- A 10 year-old Hanna cradles her father’s head as Kian half-
           hangs out of his CAR, passed out DRUNK, his car parked 
           diagonally across the front lawn-- 

                                 YOUNG HANNA
                        Dad! DAD!!!

           MALLORY rushes out of the house, frantically dialing 911 on a 
           cordless phone--

           INT. HOSPITAL, DETOX CENTER - DAY

           Kian shivers, going through heavy withdrawals. Mallory is 
           right by his side, holding a wet cloth to his head, running 
           her hands through his hair.  

           Hanna pretends to play a game on her mom’s phone, but keeps 
           peaking up at her dad, worried for him--

           EXT. STRICKLER KNOB TRAIL - DUSK

           Hanna runs her hand through her father’s sweaty hair like we 
           just saw Mallory do. 
                                 HANNA
                        Let’s go, dad. Let’s get to the 
                        top.

                                 KIAN
                        No. It’s okay. We don’t have to. 
                        This is good enough.

                                 HANNA
                        ... No it’s not. 

           Hanna looks at her father, determined. The same look he’s had 
           throughout. Although she’s a lot like her mom, she’s also her 
           father’s daughter...

           Kian coughs a few times, taking some breaths, reaching down 
           deep for some strength. 

           They get up together, ready to finish the climb...

           INT. ZORA’S GUEST BEDROOM - MORNING

           Jerry lays in his bed. Kian, Zora, Mallory and a HOSPICE 
           NURSE named BARB sit by his side. She’s calm and 
           professional, in her 50s.  

                                 JERRY
                             (slurred)
                        I’m having trouble forming words. 
                        You can hear it, right?

                                 HOSPICE NURSE BARB
                        Yeah. I can see about upping your 
                        Prednisone. And if you want 
                        something stronger for the pain--

                                 JERRY
                        No narcotics. I’m in recovery-- I 
                        intend on seeing it out to the end.  

                                 HOSPICE NURSE BARB
                        That’s admirable, but it may get 
                        pretty bad.  

                                 JERRY
                        I don’t want them, just something 
                        for my head and the slurring.  

                                 HOSPICE NURSE BARB
                        Of course. I’ll talk to the doctor.
           INT. JERRY'S GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Kian watches his father sleep as he TYPES on his laptop:  

                                 KIAN (V.O.)
                        ... I’ll never forget you taking me 
                        to Redskins games. Orioles games. 
                        Wizards games. Caps games!

           QUICK FLASH of them cheering at various games.

                                 KIAN (V.O.)
                        Letting me steer the car while 
                        sitting in your lap.  

           QUICK FLASH OF YOUNG KIAN DRIVING FROM JERRY’S LAP--

                                 KIAN (V.O.)
                        The nights of you rocking me to 
                        sleep as a little kid. Reading 
                        Berenstain Bears... 

           QUICK FLASH OF JERRY READING TO HIS SON--

                                 KIAN (V.O.)
                        The day you brought home Pepper, 
                        you picked me up and showed her to 
                        me through the kitchen window-- 

           A young Jerry holds up a five year-old Kian so he can peek 
           through the kitchen window to see a cute Beagle puppy 
           (Pepper) sleeping on a doggy bed.  

           INT. JERRY'S GUEST BEDROOM - MORNING

           Jerry has no sense of balance. He’s trying to walk to the 
           bathroom. Kian is spotting him.  

                                 JERRY
                             (stubborn, slurred)
                        I can do it!

                                 KIAN
                        The nurse said I need to spot you. 

           Jerry reaches the door and tries to slam it on Kian, but Kian 
           holds it open, attempting to come in. 

                                 JERRY
                        Get the fuck out!

                                 KIAN
                        I’m not gonna look, I just need to 
                        get you to the toilet.  
           Jerry starts to physically push Kian out of the bathroom. 

                                 KIAN (CONT’D)
                        How are you so strong????

           With some freakish strength, Jerry pushes Kian out of the 
           bathroom and slams the door on him.  

           A beat later, Kian hears Jerry FALL, HITTING HIS HEAD on the 
           TILE FLOOR.  

           Kian flings the door open to find his father knocked out 
           cold, eyes open, staring through Kian, up at the ceiling.

                                 KIAN (CONT’D)
                        Dad! DAD!!!   

           Zora and Mallory rush in--

                                 ZORA
                        What happened?
                             (seeing Jerry)
                        Oh God!

           Mallory calls 911. We stay with Kian and Jerry-- his eyes 
           rolling back in his head.  

                                 KIAN
                        Come on, Dad... come on... 

           Kian cradles his dad’s head--  

           EXT. STREETS OF ALEXANDRIA - MORNING

           It’s SNOWING. Kian, Zora and Mallory are driving, following 
           an AMBULANCE to the hospital...

           INT. ALEXANDRIA HOSPITAL - MORNING

           It’s chaos. Jerry’s screaming on a hospital bed in a NECK 
           BRACE. He’s unable to verbally communicate to them...

                                 ALEXANDRIA HOSPITAL NURSE
                        We need to sedate him.  

                                 ZORA
                        He’s trying to say something!

                                 ALEXANDRIA HOSPITAL NURSE
                        Doesn’t matter. He can’t be yelling 
                        like that. 

           More unintelligible screaming from Jerry.
                                 MALLORY
                        Can you just wait a minute?

                                 ALEXANDRIA HOSPITAL NURSE
                        Mr. Keating, last chance... 

           More screaming. Kian realizes something--

                                 KIAN
                        Wait-- his neck brace is pinching 
                        him.  

           The nurse loosens the brace, and Jerry calms down.  

                                 ZORA
                             (to nurse, condescending)
                        Good job. Really good job there. 

           DR. STEIN, too old to be working in an ER, comes up to them.  

                                 DR. STEIN
                        Hi, I’m Dr. Stein, I understand 
                        he’s in hospice care.  

                                 KIAN
                        Yeah.  

                                 DR. STEIN
                        Can I see his Advanced Directive?

                                 KIAN
                        He doesn’t have one. 

                                 DR. STEIN
                        Really recommend he get one for 
                        moments like this.   

                                 KIAN
                        Well, too late. 

                                 DR. STEIN
                        Makes moments like this a lot 
                        easier.

                                 KIAN
                        Train’s left the station, buddy. 
                        What’s the plan??

                                 DR. STEIN
                        We’ll get him some food, send you 
                        guys home. How’s that sound?
                                 KIAN
                        Super.

                                                               JUMP TO:

           Jerry’s in a hospital bed, going to town on some YOGURT.  

                                 ZORA
                        Good job, Jerry. Keep eating. Get 
                        your strength back up.  

           Kian grabs his father’s hand. Jerry grips it tight and looks 
           into his son’s eyes in a moment of lucidity.  

           He “boops” Kian's nose. Kisses his cheek. Showing him more 
           affection than he has since he was told he wasn’t going to 
           make it.  

           He points to his eye, his heart, and then at Kian... “I love 
           you.”

           INT. ZORA’S CAR - DAY

           It’s still snowing. Jerry is pointing the way home, WHISTLING 
           when they make each turn-- his way of communicating now. 

           INT. ZORA KEATING'S HOUSE - DAY

           Kian and Mallory carry Jerry from his wheelchair to his bed.  
           He’s unable to stand up on his own anymore.  

           Kian kisses his father’s forehead. Jerry just rolls over, not 
           acknowledging him, running hot and cold minute-to-minute...  

           INT. JERRY'S GUEST BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           ... Kian and Mallory attempt to put a DIAPER on Jerry, who 
           fights it with everything he’s got, moaning and swinging 
           while unable to actually sit up or speak on his own. He’s 
           taken a turn for the worse from just earlier in the day...  

           INT. GUEST BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING

           Kian, Zora and Mallory attempt to sit Jerry up and put him in 
           his wheelchair. Jerry has a confused look on his face, like 
           he has no idea why he can’t sit up on his own.  

                                 KIAN
                        Come on, Dad. You can do this. 
                        We’re gonna take you to Hopkins so 
                        you can get some radiation. It 
                        might even help the cancer 
                        throughout your body.

                        The Abscopal Effect I told you 
                        about... Come on, pop. Use your 
                        legs. 

           Kian is determined, desperately trying to get him up and into 
           his wheelchair.  

           Jerry looks at his son, pleading for him to stop. 

           Jerry guides Kian’s eyes over to the framed picture of the 
           Serenity Prayer hanging on the wall...

                           God grant me the serenity to accept 
                               the things I cannot change; 
                         the courage to change the things I can; 
                          and the wisdom to know the difference.

           Kian nods, getting what his dad’s trying to tell him. He 
           finally gives in. Letting go. Accepting that nothing will 
           save his dad...

           INT. JERRY'S GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT

           ... Jerry’s breathing is starting to have a bit of a RATTLE 
           to it. Kian sits with his dad, holding his hand.  

                                 KIAN
                        I’m not leaving your side, pop...

           LATER THAT NIGHT:

           Kian has made a bed on the couch in Jerry’s room. He lies 
           down, watching his dad sleep, rattled breathing getting more 
           pronounced.  

           He absorbs the seconds, watching his Dad for as long as he 
           can, knowing he won’t be able to do this ever again...

           He sits up, leaning in to whisper:

                                 KIAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna learn from this like you 
                        would want me to. I’m letting go so 
                        you can too. When you’re ready. 
                        I’ll be okay. I’ll look for the 
                        bigger picture...

           INT. JERRY'S GUEST BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING

           ... Kian wakes up and looks at his father. He gets up, sits 
           in close...
           ... and Jerry takes a breath in. It’s a short breath. 
           Shallow. With a long exhale. Then another long pause, short 
           breath in... long exhale.   

           Mallory comes into the room, hugging Kian, rubbing his back.  

           She opens the blinds, letting the SUNLIGHT pour in. It’s been 
           gray for a few days in a row, but today it’s sunny.  

           The sun hits Jerry’s face. And he soaks it up, slightly 
           smiling as he absorbs every ray.  

           Zora enters and her emotions overflow, wearing the TIFFANY’S 
           EARRINGS Jerry got her...  

                                 ZORA
                        Oh Jerry... I love you. I’ve always 
                        loved you... I will always love 
                        you... I hope you can hear me... my 
                        sweet Jerry.

                                 KIAN
                        Hear that, pop? Your plan of faking 
                        getting cancer so she’d fall back 
                        in love with you worked! You can 
                        wake up now!  

           They all laugh through the forming tears. 

           Kian grabs his father’s hand, gripping it tightly...

           And they just sit with him. Watching him breathe. Absorbing 
           as many seconds as they can...  

           ... And as the seconds tick away, Jerry’s breathing gets more 
           and more shallow... longer pauses between the breaths... 

           ... Kian runs his hand through Jerry’s remaining hair... 
           gliding it across the scruff of his cheeks... 

           And in this moment, something miraculous happens. 

           Jerry’s eyes shoot WIDE OPEN.

           Kian stands up, looking down at his Dad. 

           Jerry takes in as much air as he can and summons his last bit 
           of strength to mouth these words up to his boy...

                                 JERRY
                             (barely audible)
                        I love you, son... as big as the 
                        Universe.
           Jerry’s eyes connect with his son’s, then widen further, 
           looking past Kian... at something beyond...

           And then Jerry Keating takes his last breath on this Earth.  

           He’s gone.  

           And his family, the ones he loves more than anyone, are right 
           by his side. He is not alone. 

           There’s pain. Heartbreak. And there’s also a slight sense of 
           relief. Of relief in knowing he doesn’t have to suffer 
           anymore. None of them have to.  

           Even though the fight has been lost, they will go forward and 
           learn from this, as Jerry would’ve wanted. They will find 
           ways to become better versions of themselves. They don’t know 
           it yet, but they will. 

           Right now though, they grieve. They bawl. They hug him and 
           kiss him and hold him.  

           They struggle to breathe themselves, but they find a way.  

                                 MALLORY
                        I’ll call Barb...

           Mallory heads out of the room to make the call. 

           Zora bends down and kisses Jerry’s forehead, before following 
           Mallory.  

           Kian stays with his Dad, still holding his hand. He puts his 
           head on his father’s chest... looking at him...

                                 KIAN
                        You will live on through me. 
                        Through your grandkid...

           EXT. ZORA’S HOUSE - DAY

           Kian walks outside with TWO FUNERAL PARLOR WORKERS, who wheel 
           Jerry on a stretcher, covered by a sheet.  

           Shelly, Zora’s neighbor from earlier, is exiting her house at 
           the same time. She spots them--  

                                 SHELLY
                        Oh no, is that...? Did your dad...? 
                        Oh God no... no... no...

           Shelly breaks down, weeping right there in her front yard.   
           Kian ignores her, watching as his dad is loaded into a 
           funeral home VAN.  

                                 FUNERAL HOME WORKER
                        Sorry for your loss.

           INT. ZORA’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Kian stands in his dad’s bedroom... The bed is still there. 
           So is all the medical equipment. And his clothes. Shoes. 
           Pills. Toiletries in his bathroom. His razor. Toothbrush. 

           Kian closes his eyes, wishing he could roll back time-- Back 
           to when his dad wasn’t sick.  

                                                               JUMP TO:

           Kian sits on his father’s bed, typing on his laptop:

                                 KIAN (V.O.)
                        I regret not answering your calls 
                        more often. Sometimes I wouldn’t 
                        answer, or would only talk for a 
                        minute. Now I can’t get those 
                        calls. I’m going to learn from 
                        this... I’m so honored I got to be 
                        your son. I wish I got married. I 
                        wish you got to meet your 
                        grandchild. He or she will know 
                        your name. I promise I’ll teach my 
                        kid all about you...  

           INT. CUNNINGHAM FUNERAL HOME, DIRECTOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           It’s calm and creepy in this place. Like each pattern was 
           selected with specific colors because they had been tested as 
           the most calming combination. 

           Kian, Zora and Mallory sit across from EVELYN, the funeral 
           home director. She’s in her 40s, just a super sweet, kind-
           faced individual.

           An URN rests on her desk between them.

                                 EVELYN
                        ... I think the urn is perfect. 
                        It’s very Japanese-looking. 

                                 ZORA
                        Do you know if it’s authentic?  
                                 EVELYN
                        It’s made from a top quality.

                                 ZORA
                        But is it authentically from Japan?

                                 EVELYN
                        I don’t think any of our urns are 
                        “from Japan” per se, but this one 
                        definitely has that energy.  

           Everyone nods, good enough for them. Evelyn goes over the 
           final paperwork.

                                 EVELYN (CONT’D)
                        Looks like we have everything here. 
                        We just need someone to identify 
                        the body.  

                                 KIAN
                        What?

                                 EVELYN
                        To make sure we’re cremating the 
                        right person. We’re very careful 
                        about that for obvious reasons... 
                        Just need one of you. 

           Kian takes a breath, debating what he’d like to do... 

                                 KIAN
                        ... Can we all go?

                                 EVELYN
                        Oh yeah, for sure. Great idea.  

           Evelyn stands up, PULLING BACK AN ACCORDION WALL DIVIDER that 
           just seemed like a regular wall until this moment. And right 
           there on the other side is JERRY.

                                 KIAN
                        Oh God. He’s just been there the 
                        whole time?

                                 EVELYN
                        Yeah.  

           Jerry’s arms are crossed along his chest, wearing an outfit 
           they picked for him.  

           They walk into the room, which is a chapel of sorts. There 
           are pews and Jerry’s at the front of the room.   
                                 KIAN
                        Oh, pop... I’m so sorry. I’m sorry 
                        I didn’t make sure you got better. 

                                 MALLORY
                        You never had control over that. 
                        But you were there for him, and 
                        that’s what he needed most. 

                                 KIAN
                        He was a good person. Why did this 
                        happen to him??

                                 MALLORY
                        So much of life makes no sense. And 
                        it never will... Our lives are so 
                        annoyingly out of our control. 

           These words carry heavy significance for Mallory. Kian takes 
           a breath. They continue to mourn and hold each other tightly. 

           Evelyn awkwardly waits by their side.  

                                 EVELYN
                        So if you could confirm that’s him?

           Kian shoots her a “are you fucking kidding me?”  

                                 EVELYN (CONT’D)
                        Okay, seems like it’s him. Thanks. 
                        I’ll just leave you to visit.  

           Evelyn walks back over to her office, closing the accordion 
           divider wall.  

           Kian leans in close, whispering to his dad:

                                 KIAN
                        I told you I was writing something 
                        new to take your mind off the 
                        cancer and make you proud of me. 
                        Well, I was lying. But I’m writing 
                        a novel for real now. And it starts 
                        with a letter from me to you. This 
                        is that letter. I love you, pop...

           Kian tucks the letter between his father’s hands, knowing 
           this will be the last time he sees him... 

           EXT. STRICKLER KNOB TRAIL - DUSK
           Kian and Hanna reach the summit just as the sun is setting... 
           and fuck is it beautiful. 360 degree views of the Shenandoah 
           Valley as far as they can see, the sun’s final rays smacking 
           them in the face. 

           They’re out of breath, exhausted, drained-- physically and 
           emotionally--  

           They take it all in. Kian coughs a bit more, trying to catch 
           his breath...

                                 KIAN
                        Do you see it, Hanna? Can you see 
                        the bigger picture?

           She absolutely breaks down here, tears streaming down her 
           face, nodding “yes.” 

           He looks down at his daughter and loses it as well, wrapping 
           an arm around her... 

           INT. CHURCH - DAY

           Kian stands at a podium, wearing a black suit, looking out at 
           a large group of people who are in deep mourning. He 
           addresses the crowd, emotions raw:

                                 KIAN
                        I’m 37 and I feel like I’ve given 
                        too many of these damn eulogies...

           We pull out revealing an URN resting next to a picture of 
           MALLORY.

           Hanna sits in the front row with her grandma Zora, who is now 
           65. They’re both sobbing. 

           INT. EDGEHILL RECOVERY CENTER, GROUP ROOM - DAY

           Kian’s standing at a different podium, giving the eulogy for 
           his father... Mallory is in the front row, pregnant with 
           Hanna, sitting next to Zora, who has lost her best friend.

           EXT. STRICKLER KNOB TRAIL, SUMMIT - DUSK

           Kian reaches into his large BACKPACK and pulls out an URN 
           containing MALLORY’S ASHES. 
                                 HANNA
                        No. Stop... please. I can’t do 
                        this. I don’t want to do this.

           Now we know why Hanna didn’t want to go on this trip. Why she 
           didn’t want to face the finality of getting to the top...

           Kian bends down to her level. 

                                 KIAN
                        My sweet girl, she’s not gone. You 
                        know how I know? Because I’m 
                        looking right at her-- I see her in 
                        you...

           QUICK FLASHBACK-- To Kian standing with Mallory in the same 
           spot on the mountain. She’s got the same eyes as Hanna. Same 
           shape. Same color. Same look. 

           BACK TO PRESENT--

                                 KIAN (CONT’D)
                        She’s a part of you. And she always 
                        will be. She’ll always be with us 
                        because of that. Because of you.
                             (beat)
                        I’ll be around for a while. I quit 
                        smoking-- I know I still got the 
                        cough, but it’ll go away. Stopped 
                        drinking. You don’t have to worry 
                        about me-- That’s not your job 
                        anymore. I’m gonna be here. You and 
                        I gotta stick together. We only got 
                        each other.

                                 HANNA
                        What about grandma?

                                 KIAN
                        Yeah and her too. She’ll probably 
                        never die.

           Hanna lets out a slight smile. Kian stands up, walking to the 
           edge with Mallory’s ashes, Hanna right by his side.  

           QUICK FLASH-- Kian, Mallory and Zora toss Jerry’s ashes off 
           the same cliff--

           BACK TO PRESENT-- 

           Kian and Hanna hold Mallory’s urn together...

                                 KIAN (CONT’D)
                        Ready?
           Hanna hesitates... then finally nods.  

                                 KIAN (CONT’D)

           They reach back and toss the ashes out over the cliff, but in 
           the process, lose their grip on the urn and it goes flying--

                                 KIAN (CONT’D)
                        OH FUCK--

                                 HANNA
                        MOM! 

           They both peer over the edge, watching Mallory’s ashes fly 
           and spread across the Valley, while the urn itself tumbles 
           all the way down...

                                 KIAN
                        ... We’ll get it on the way back 
                        down tomorrow.

                                 HANNA
                        Okay yeah.
                             (beat)
                        You said “fuck.”

           Kian laughs through the tears. Hanna does too, laughing, 
           crying, allowing herself to feel the range of emotions...

           They step back, taking some calming breaths...

           ... as the sun finally dips over the horizon...

                                 KIAN
                        We can come here whenever you want. 
                        Whenever you want to connect with 
                        your mom...
                             (beat)
                        Any time you need help seeing the 
                        bigger picture.

           Hanna smiles, looks up at her dad--

           QUICK FLASHES--

           Hanna as a little kid being pushed on the swings by 
           Mallory... 

           Playing soccer in the living room with her mom...

           Laying in bed next to her mom while she reads her a book...

           Cheering on the Caps at a hockey game with her...
           And as we continue with these memories, we notice 
           something... KIAN is also there with them. The more we go 
           through these flashes, the more we notice Kian right there, 
           with Hanna, with his family...

           And we see Kian and Mallory racing down the street against 
           their daughter...

           And jumping on a trampoline with her...

           And making faces with food stuck in their teeth...

           And dancing together...

           And singing...

           And laughing... so much laughing... the three of them...

           FLASH BACK TO PRESENT--

           Hanna and Kian stand there, looking out, facing the 
           uncertainty that lies ahead, each eating a DONUT. 

                                 HANNA
                        Love you mom, as big as the 
                        Universe...

           Hanna reaches for her father’s hand, holding it tight. 

           Finally.

                                                           CUT TO BLACK
