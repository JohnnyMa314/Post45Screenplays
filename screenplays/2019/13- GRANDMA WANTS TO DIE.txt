           INT. A FUNERAL HOME - MID FUNERAL

           PEOPLE are scattered about wearing all black, smudged make up 
           and various stages of grief.

           At the front of the room are TWO WOODEN CASKETS. In the 
           middle, an easel with various pictures of a happy 
           couple...now deceased. 

           I know. But strap in. It gets worse.

           We settle on a couple in their late 50s. MINNIE (the type of 
           person who could destroy you with one syllable) and FRANCIS 
           (the type of person commonly destroyed by one syllable).

           They’re mid-argument, staring at something we don’t yet see.

                                 MINNIE
                        Will you stop him please?

                                 FRANCIS
                        Go easy.

           We snap around to see what they’re looking at - an 8-year-old 
           boy named BEN playing with a hot wheels car on the hood of 
           one of the closed caskets. It’s not out of disrespect. This 
           little fucker just has no idea what he’s doing.

                                 MINNIE
                        That’s your son in there.

                                 FRANCIS
                        It’s also his father. And his 
                        mother.
                           (a beat)
                        I got a great deal on those 
                        caskets.

                                 MINNIE
                        You can tell.

                                 FRANCIS
                        What’s the problem?

                                 MINNIE
                        You bought them at Costco.

           Francis holds - careful not to make a scene. Ben has started 
           to gain some attention. Minnie notices the mostly horrified 
           looks spread throughout the room.

                                 MINNIE (CONT’D)
                        Just do something about that.
                                 FRANCIS
                        You don’t have to be so hard on 
                        him. 

                                 MINNIE
                        And you didn’t have to buy their 
                        caskets a row over from the 
                        Twizzlers and Diet Cola.

                                 FRANCIS
                        You buy everything at Costco.

                                 MINNIE
                        NOT A FUCKING CASKET.

           The room silences, but they all know better than to stare. 
           Minnie collects herself and pace races over to Ben. 

           She holds out an open hand in which the car should be 
           cooperatively placed.

                                 MINNIE (CONT’D)
                        Give me that.

           Ben closes he fist around the little car. Option B.

                                 BEN
                        No.

           Minnie grabs him by the arm, prying at his fingers. But he 
           just grips it tighter.

                                 MINNIE
                        Benjamin.

                                 BEN
                        No! It’s mine! 

           Minnie wraps around his arm, digging deeper and pulling him 
           away, but Ben anchors himself on the casket. 

           The casket’s rickety holder wobbles under the tension. The 
           others have started to look on- Minnie settles them with a 
           smile.

                                 MINNIE
                        You’re making a scene.

                                 BEN
                        You’re making a scene.

           Minnie gives him one last look as if to say “you sure you 
           wanna do this?”
           Ben grits his teeth. Yup. He does.

           Minnie with all her might - RIPS at his arm - but with his 
           other arm still anchored it RIPS the casket off its holder 
           and ONTO BEN who falls to the ground. The casket lands right 
           on his knee.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        OW!

           There’s exchanged horror around the room now as Minnie and 
           Ben try to push the casket off - but it’s too heavy.

           Francis races over, but in his old age, it’s too heavy to 
           lift more than a corner. 

           Another MAN races over to help too but the shitty Costco wood 
           torques under the pressure-

           And torques-

           And then SNAPS OPEN-

           A MALE ARM TUMBLES OUT AND LANDS ON BEN’S FACE! Minnie 
           screams. Francis screams. Ben screams - he’s being crushed 
           and facepalmed by the body of his dead father as we-

           TITLE CARD: GRANDMA WANTS TO DIE

           SUPER: Like, 20 years later...

           EXT. RETIRED MINDS - MORNING

           A four-story corporate building that’s seen better days. 
           Bushes are dying, lawns are browning, and the sprinklers are 
           definitely not sprinkling. 

           On the side of the building, a sign: RETIRED MINDS.

           A GREEN PRIUS rolls up the driveway and pulls into the mostly 
           empty parking lot. From the driver side, steps BEN (Now 
           30s/button down, tie, bagged lunch, messenger bag. The little 
           boy from our opening, all grown up). 

           Ben smiles, then beeps his car locked and walks into the 
           building.
           INT. RETIRED MINDS - FRONT DESK

           The interior is even more of a shit hole. The fluorescent 
           light shades are hanging off or gone all-together. Ben climbs 
           the last step, tapping on the front desk. Sitting behind it, 
           is a cardboard motion sensing CUTOUT of an assistant wearing 
           a headset.

                                 BEN
                        Morning, Barbar-

                                 CUTOUT
                        GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME TO-

                                 CLEARLY SOMEONE ELSE
                        RETIRED MINDS.

           Another employee DARREN (40s/black dude, heavyset) wanders 
           by, drinking a cup of coffee. 

                                 BEN
                        What is this?

                                 DARREN
                        Layoffs. 

                                 BEN
                        Who’s gonna answer the phones?

                                 DARREN
                        Who knows man. We got budget cuts 
                        all over the place. They already 
                        took the good coffee machine. 
                        Without that french vanilla 
                        squirter I honestly don’t think 
                        this shit would be drinkable.

           Darren sips his coffee.

                                 BEN
                        What french vanilla squirter?

                                 DARREN
                        The one in the kitchen, in between 
                        the coffee machine and the sink.

                                 BEN
                        That’s a soap dispenser. 

           Darren sips again... thinking over this new info. 

           The front desk phone rings. Ben and Darren look at 
           eachother...a stand off.
           It rings again.

           Darren walks off, sipping his coffee. Ben picks it up.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Retired Minds, Insurance for the 
                        ages...one moment I’ll transfer 
                        you.

           This is not the defiant little kid we once met.

           INT. RETIRED MINDS - SALES BAY - LATER

           Most of the cubicles are empty. This is a life insurance 
           company on the outs. 

           We settle on Ben in his cubicle who logs in to the Bank of 
           America portal.

           Checking: $2,452.76

           Savings: $1,105.45

           Ben refreshes the page - a new charge pops up “Refresh fee - 
           10.00” 

           Checking $2,442.76

           Savings: $1,095.45. 

                                 BEN
                        What the f-

           ALYSSA (30’s/fellow salesman - picture Tiffany Haddish) pops 
           her head over the cubicle divider.

                                 ALYSSA
                        Hey man have you heard anything 
                        about this buyout?

                                 BEN
                        What buyout?

                                 ALYSSA
                        Some place called Lifeco is 
                        apparently making an offer.

                                 BEN
                        For what? We have like 3 clients.

           On his desktop, Ben googles “Lifeco” - clicking the first 
           link to lifeco.com, a little talking umbrella pops up 
           (BRELLY).
                                 BRELLY
                        Hey heyyyy there - how can I keep 
                        you dry today?

                                 BEN
                        Do they even have salesmen?

                                 ALYSSA
                        That place comes in here- we’re the 
                        first to go. 

           Ben picks up a LITTLE BLUE STRESSBALL and begins squeezing it 
           while eyeing Brelly on the computer screen. 

                                 BOB (O.S.)
                        Suck my ass, boy.

           We turn to see BOB (60’s/decaying salesman, high pants) is 
           mid argument with DARREN (Vanilla syrup guy) over a desk 
           chair. 

                                 DARREN
                        You know I need this chair, man. 
                        I’ve got back issues.

                                 BOB
                        You know in my day, when one of you 
                        had back issues, we shot em. 

                                 DARREN
                        What does that mean?

           Bob raises his eyebrows.

                                 BEN
                        Can you guys keep it down?

           Bob flips him off.

                                 BOB
                        Fuck your mother. How’s that, Ben?

                                 BEN
                        That’s great. Thanks, Bob.

                                 ALYSSA
                        Who wouldn’t want this sales staff?
                           (then)
                        At least you got that wedding to 
                        look forward to. How far out are 
                        you?

                                 BEN
                        It’s a month from Thursday.
                                 ALYSSA
                        Your family must be jacked. My 
                        mom’s been trying to marry me off 
                        since I could walk. 

           Ben is a little more focused on the website he’s scrolling 
           which reads “No Salesmen. Just chatlines 24/7.”

                                 BEN
                        Yeah. Mary’s family is really 
                        excited.

                                 ALYSSA
                        You and her family tight?

           In the background, we see the Bob, Darren situation escalate. 
           Bob immitates Darren’s bad back.

           Ben realizes his rudeness, turning to re-engage with Alyssa.

                                 BEN
                        I’m um- We’re all having dinner 
                        tonight so hopeful I can- you know, 
                        chip away.

                                 ALYSSA
                        Your family’s coming too?

           BG: Bob shoves Darren who stumbles back catching his footing.

                                 BEN
                        I don’t really have any family.

                                 ALYSSA
                        What? Wait, were you one of those 
                        test tube babies? You got a 
                        barcode?

           BG: Darren shoves Bob- HARD. He stumbles back and falls over. 

                                 BEN
                        My parents died when I was kid. 

                                 ALYSSA
                        What about a grandmomma? 
                        Everybody’s got a grandmomma.

           BG: People have crowded around Bob to make sure he’s ok.

                                 BEN
                        We don’t really keep in touch.
                                 ALYSSA
                        Does she know you’re getting 
                        married?

                                 BEN
                        I hope not.

                                 ALYSSA
                        What?? Dude my grandmomma would 
                        shit her pants if she found out I 
                        was getting married. I mean she 
                        shits her pants 3 times a day 
                        anyways but that one...that one 
                        would be mine.

           BG: Bob jumps up, lunge-kicking Darren right in the face, 
           knocking him out cold. Bob pops the knuckle in his neck then 
           spits on him.

                                 ALYSSA (CONT’D)
                        Holy shit! 

           Ben doesn’t even notice - he clicks on BRELLY again.

                                 BRELLY
                        Hey heyyyy there - how can I keep 
                        you dry today?

           EXT. OAK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - LATER

           Ben’s Prius pulls up outside a school with a sea of children 
           outside. 

           Ben checks his watch when out of the front door comes MARY 
           (30s/Social butterfly with an edge). Ben smiles as she climbs 
           into the Prius. They kiss.

                                 MARY
                        How was your day?

                                 BEN
                        Lost a couple clients, a coworker 
                        got kicked in the face and our 
                        receptionist is a cardboard cutout. 
                        You?

                                 MARY
                        A child spit into my naked eyeball.

                                 BEN
                        So not bad, then.

           Mary looks him up and down.
                                 MARY
                        You nervous?

                                 BEN
                           (lying)
                        No. 

           Ben puts the car into gear and they pull away.

           EXT. MILLER HOUSEHOLD - LATER

           A beautifully maintained 2 story Colonial home. Perfectly 
           landscaped, with a mint, Black 1968 Ford Mustang convertible 
           sitting in the driveway. 

           The Prius pulls in the parking lot right next to it. He pops 
           his door open, scuffing the Mustang. Blood drains from his 
           face right away.

                                 BEN
                        Ffuuuuu-

                                 MARY
                        Did you just ding my dad’s mustang?

                                 BEN
                        Nope. Definitely not.

           Ben brushes at the scuff. Mary pokes her head around to see 
           it.

                                 MARY
                        Ok relax. It’s fine. You’re going 
                        to be fine. Just remember what we 
                        talked about. Remind my mother that 
                        you’ve been studying with Father 
                        Johnson, talk to my dad about golf.

                                 BEN
                        I don’t know anything about golf. 

                                 MARY
                        Oh and don’t ask Hank about his 
                        wife.

                                 BEN
                        Has Trina still not taken him back? 

                                 MARY
                        Oh yeah no she did, that’s why I’m 
                        telling you not to bring her up.
                                 BEN
                        Can you not sarcasm me right now?

                                 MARY
                        You need to relax. They’re going to 
                        be your family soon too and they’re 
                        going to love you. They have to.

           Mary and Ben smile at one another before Mary leads him into 
           the house.

           INT. MILLER HOUSEHOLD - LIVING ROOM - SLIGHTLY LATER

           Ben eyes a family photo/Christmas card on the wall. 

           - Front and center is Mary (pictured: 20s) next to HANK (late 
           20s/looks 40, over the hill jock) next to his wife TRINA 
           (early 30s/extremely pregnant). Above them all is GEORGE and 
           WANDA (50s/from another generation - both have hands on 
           Mary’s shoulder). Ben smiles at Mary in the photo.

                                 HANK (O.S.)
                        Eyein’ in the shots, Benji?

           HANK approaches (now 30s w/ TWO 12-month-old sleeping twins 
           JAY and LEO strapped to his chest in a reverse backpack type 
           holder).

                                 HANK (CONT’D)
                        Look at that. Family picture before 
                        that whorebag took her trip to 
                        whoretown.

                                 BEN
                        Je-sus-Christ, Hank.

                                 HANK
                        I’m sorry man. I haven’t slept 
                        since Trina left. They sleep 2 
                        hours a night and shit 3 times a 
                        day.

                                 BEN
                        I’m sorry man.

                                 HANK
                        And now Leo is doing this thing 
                        where he just smashes shit...all 
                        the time. I swear, nobody tells you 
                        how hard being a parent is.

                                 BEN
                        I mean-...
           Hank takes a pull from his beer but a little splashes out and 
           onto one of the babies’ heads. He squeaks awake. Hank doesn’t 
           move a muscle.

                                 HANK
                        Did one of ‘em just wake up?

           Ben nods. Hank still stiff, silently just starts rocking side 
           to side until eventually... the baby nods back off. 

                                 HANK (CONT’D)
                        Close call, Benji.

           Ben and Mary make eye contact across the room and share a 
           smile.

                                 BEN
                        I’m gonna go check on Mary.

           Ben exits.

           ANGLE ON: Ben makes his way over to Mary who’s chatting with 
           WANDA (60s/Mary’s stiff, conservative mother) by the wetbar.

                                 MARY
                        We were just talking about you.

                                 BEN
                        Hi Wanda so great to-

                                 WANDA
                        We were discussing your sessions 
                        with Father Johnson. Every 
                        Saturday, right?

                                 BEN
                        Yup. They’ve been going great. He 
                        says I’m on track to be all 
                        ‘Christian-ed’ up by the wedding.

           Ben laughs. Wanda does not. Mary cringes.

                                 WANDA
                        Catholicism is a path, Benjamin.

                                 BEN
                        Right. Well that’s why they call me 
                        the pathfinder.

           Strike two. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        ...Or Nissan.
           Strike three.

                                 WANDA
                        I’m going to check on dinner.

           Wanda scowls then walks away leaving Ben and Mary. Before she 
           can speak-

                                 MARY
                        I need you to reel it in.

                                 BEN
                        Yeah, thanks.

           INT. MILLER HOUSEHOLD - DINING ROOM 

           Mary and Ben sit across from Hank (now attempting to feed Jay 
           and Leo in a high-chairs - food is going everywhere), with 
           Wanda and GEORGE (60s/Mary’s country club father) at each 
           head of the table. 

                                 MARY
                        Is this your first time feeding 
                        them?

                                 HANK
                        Trina always handled this stuff.

                                 MARY
                        What stuff?

                                 HANK
                        Baby stuff!

                                 GEORGE
                        So glad you could join us, 
                        Benjamin.

                                 BEN
                        Yeah. This looks great! 

                                 WANDA
                        Would you like to say grace?

                                 BEN
                        Oh. Sure yeah of course.

                                 WANDA
                        Something nice for my mother.

                                 BEN
                        I’m sorry?
           Wanda turns our attention to the mantle where an URN rests 
           peacefully next to a picture of WANDA’S MOTHER. Mary grips 
           Wanda’s hand.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Oh right. Meemaw was it?

                                 WANDA
                        Mimoo. She’d be so proud of you, 
                        Mary.

                                 GEORGE
                        Oh shoot. Benjamin, could you come 
                        help me with the tenderloin?

                                 BEN
                        Sure.

           George walks back towards the kitchen door, Ben follows.

           Wanda rolls her eyes. We hold on the urn.

           INT. MILLER HOUSEHOLD - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           George holds the kitchen door open for Ben. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Oh there it is. Grab it would ya 
                        Benny boy?

           Ben grabs the metal pan holding the tenderloin then turns to 
           see George has just slid the door closed. It’s just the two 
           of them now.

                                 BEN
                        Everything ok, George?

                                 GEORGE
                        Ben... men have a code in this 
                        world. Are you familiar with that?

                                 BEN
                        Sure. Bros before hoes.

           Ben chuckles uncomfortably. The pan is starting to feel hot, 
           but he can’t drop it. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Bros before hoes. Wow I like that. 
                        Can I use that?

                                 BEN
                        I think anyone can.
                                 GEORGE
                        Things haven’t been exactly booming 
                        around here. I’m out of work and 
                        the stock market’s in the shitter 
                        and well- cash isn’t going to be 
                        flowing like it used to.

           Ben struggles with the pan, eyeing the counter as an escape. 

                                 BEN
                        Why don’t you just sell the 
                        mustang?

                                 GEORGE
                        Why don’t I just give Wanda my 
                        testicles in a little glass jar 
                        that she can keep on her knitting 
                        table?

                                 BEN
                        Um. Ok. 

                                 GEORGE
                        I can handle that part. But- well 
                        there are a few wedding costs we’re 
                        not going to be able to cover. I’ve 
                        pushed them off as long as I could, 
                        but if some of these vendors don’t 
                        get their cash- this wedding isn’t 
                        going to be one. Know what I’m 
                        saying?

                                 BEN
                        We’re a month out.

                                 GEORGE
                        It would really be a big favor, 
                        Ben.

           George digs his pupils into Ben’s. And off that moment-

                                 BEN
                        Right. Yeah I could probably handle 
                        that. How much are we talking?

                                 GEORGE
                        Well there’s the back half of the 
                        venue.
                           (off Ben’s nod)
                        Then there’s the caterer’s final 
                        10%, the florist and the valet guys 
                        who only take cash. All told it’s 
                        probably no more than 20 or 25k.
           Ben loses his breath.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Now as much as I appreciate this, I 
                        can’t just lay down and let you be 
                        the big man in my house you know? 
                        So we’ll have to put on a bit of a 
                        show out there.

           The pan is burning Ben’s skin off. Ben eyes a glass bowl 
           icing down some wine.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        The last thing I need is Wanda 
                        finding out is that we’ve been 
                        using Mary’s wedding fund to keep 
                        the heat off the credit card 
                        companies.

                                 BEN
                        Got it heat is bad. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Good man.

           George slaps Ben’s shoulder who almost drops the pan but 
           grabs it even tighter, searing the hot pan into his palms. 
           Ben eyes the condensation dripping down the bowl.

                                 BEN
                        Hah! You can count on me.

           The door slides open, drawing their attention. Ben slams the 
           pan down on the counter then plunges his hands in the bowl - 
           sweet relief. 

                                 WANDA
                        Have you found it yet? It’s the 
                        thing that looks like a tenderloin.

                                 GEORGE
                        Yep found it! Just having a little 
                        guy chat. Ya know, bros before 
                        hoes. Ben taught me that.

                                 WANDA
                        Oh did he?

                                 BEN
                        No- that’s not-

           Wanda just leaves.
           George feels the hot-pan, then grabs some oven mitts and 
           lifts the pan to bring back in.

                                 GEORGE
                        Oh sure, let’s have beef tenderloin- 
                        $32 a pound.
                           (then)
                        Don’t get married, Ben.

           George steels himself, then exits. Ben sighs. 

           INT. MILLER HOUSEHOLD - DINNER TABLE - LATER

           Everyone eats. Hank tries to feed the two babies. Jay (quiet 
           and docile) kindly takes his food while Leo (nightmare) grabs 
           the spoon out of Hank’s hand and starts violently smashing it 
           against the table.

                                 HANK
                        Stop it, Leo! Be more like your 
                        brother!

                                 MARY
                        Hank let me help you.

                                 HANK
                        I do not need your help.

           Ben rubs his burnt hands on his pants. Mary takes note.

                                 MARY
                        Everything ok?

                                 BEN
                        Yeah. Fine! 

                                 GEORGE
                        So Ben. Still no family to invite, 
                        huh?

                                 MARY
                        Can we not do this right now?

                                 WANDA
                        It is awfully sad, Mary. We can’t 
                        just dance around it. 

                                 HANK
                        Wait, Benji you have no family 
                        alive? Like zero? I know your folks 
                        died but like- no cousins or 
                        anything?
                                 BEN
                        Not really.

                                 GEORGE
                        How can you not really have any 
                        cousins? You either have ‘em or you 
                        don’t.

                                 BEN
                        Well I have a grandmother, but-

                                 MARY
                        Wait, really?

                                 BEN
                        Sort of.

                                 MARY
                        You told me on our first date you 
                        have no family.

                                 BEN
                        Yeah. Technically I do but- yeah. 
                        It’s not important.

           Ben smiles to Mary who, after a moment, returns it. She 
           doesn’t push.

                                 HANK
                        I used to have a family too, Benji.
                           (to Jay)
                        Then your bitch mother, cheated on-

                                 WANDA
                        Hank. Language.

                                 HANK
                           (to the urn)
                        Sorry Mimoo. 

                                                           CUT TO:

           EST. BEN AND MARY’S HOUSE - THAT NIGHT

           Small single-family home in a decent neighborhood. Out front 
           we’ll see Ben’s Prius parked for the night.

           INT. BEN AND MARY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM

           Mary looks through credit card statements on her computer 
           while we hear Ben brushing his teeth in the bathroom.
                                 MARY
                        We’re spending a lot out.

                                 BEN (O.S.)
                        Well then let’s go out less.

                                 MARY
                        Yeah.

           Mary closes her laptop.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        So, you definitely never told me 
                        you had a grandmother.

           The brushing stops. Then we hear a spit. And a sink. And Ben 
           comes out. Ben hops in bed. 

                                 BEN
                        Pretty sure I did.

                                 MARY
                        I wouldn’t just forget that.

           Ben takes a deep breath then-

                                 BEN
                        We haven’t spoken in a really long 
                        time and I’d kind of like to keep 
                        it that way. 

                                 MARY
                        You’re getting married. Don’t you 
                        think you should at least tell your 
                        grandmother? I actually would love 
                        to meet her.

                                 BEN
                        No you really wouldn’t. We just 
                        need to live our lives and wait for 
                        her to die. Best case scenario is 
                        that she already has.

                                 MARY
                        I’m just saying. When Mimoo died I 
                        always wished I had more time with 
                        her. Although she still left me 
                        some money so...it’s up to you.

           Ben thinks on this.

           Mary rolls over and flips off the light.
           Ben, sort of alone now, opens his phone - goes to the Bank of 
           America app. Still the same shitty numbers... now with a new 
           lens of impending doom.

           Ben takes a deep sigh and we HARD CUT TO:

           INT. BEN’S CAR - MOVING - THE NEXT MORNING

           On the dash is a bouquet of grocery store flowers. Ben drives 
           with Mary riding shotgun.

                                 MARY
                        So she goes by Minnie?

                                 BEN
                        People call her all sorts of stuff.

                                 MARY
                        We really don’t have to go if you 
                        don’t want to.

                                 BEN
                        No no, you were right. She’s my 
                        grandmother. My only living 
                        relative and she should at least be 
                        invited.

           EXT. SUNNY ACRES NURSING HOME - DAY

           A nursing home. Tightly trimmed lawns, tennis courts etc. 
           It’s a nice place to eventually die. 

           Ben and Mary’s Prius pulls in the driveway. 

           INT. BEN'S CAR - MOVING - SAME TIME

           Mary takes in the landscape as Ben drives slowly through the 
           campus grounds. 

                                 BEN
                        Welcome to Sunny Acres Nursing 
                        Home.

                                 MARY
                        It’s beautiful. So why have you 
                        never even told me about her? 

           They roll to a stop.
                                 BEN
                        Ok listen. When my parents died she 
                        took me in. Only we didn’t get 
                        along then and, and we probably 
                        won’t get along now. We had a big 
                        fight when I left her and my 
                        grandfather here 10 years ago 
                        and... Well we haven’t spoken since 
                        then.

                                 MARY
                        You have a grandfather too?

                                 BEN
                        He died. Don’t bring him up. 
                        Basically all you need to know is, 
                        don’t tell her anything, don’t ask 
                        her anything and don’t look her 
                        directly in the eyes.

           Ben exits the car. Mary holds for a moment then follows. 

                                 MARY
                        Wait, what?

           INT. SUNNY ACRES NURSING HOME - LOBBY

           A NURSE (20s) sits behind a check-in counter. Ben and Mary 
           approach. 

                                 BEN
                        Ben Becker, here to see Minnie 
                        Becker.

                                 NURSE
                        Hah. Go ahead. 

                                 BEN
                        You don’t need my ID or anything?

                                 NURSE
                        Not if you’re here to see her. You 
                        can take her anywhere.

           Ben and Mary push through a set of doors.

           INT. SUNNY ACRES NURSING HOME - HALLWAY

           Mary and Ben walk through linoleum floored hallways housing 
           individual rooms. People are as happy as they can be in a 
           nursing home.
           Ben hesitates upon reaching a set of double doors.

                                 MARY
                        You ok?

                                 BEN
                        Yeah.

           Ben takes a deep breath then pushes through it into-

           INT. SUNNY ACRES NURSING HOME - COMMON ROOM

           There’s a group of very old people hovered around a table. In 
           the middle of it we hear:

                                 MINNIE (O.S.)
                        Why in God’s name would you do such 
                        a stupid thing?

           ANGLE ON - Minnie (From our opening. Now 70s) who at the 
           moment is ripping someone a new one. 

           They’re playing the board game Risk - a war strategy game and 
           on the other end of her thrashing, is DALE (90s/wheelchair, 
           pipes from the nose...you get the picture). It should be 
           noted she’s a good 10+ years younger than everyone else.

                                 DALE
                        I’m fortifying.

                                 MINNIE
                        Fortifying what?

                                 DALE
                        Australia! It’s a continental high 
                        ground in case you hadn’t-

                                 MINNIE
                        You’ve been fortifying Australia 
                        for the last 6 turns. Do you think 
                        I want an ally who’s just going to 
                        sit on the other side of the world 
                        while I’m being demolished by 
                        Rose’s army?

                                 ROSE
                        Minnie, I can take the troops out 
                        of-

                                 MINNIE
                        You leave them.

           Rose retracts her hand.
                                 DALE
                        I can’t advance on Siam until I 
                        have enough troops to-

                                 MINNIE
                        To what? What the hell do you know 
                        about advancing troops?

                                 DALE
                        I was on the beaches of Normandy!

                                 MINNIE
                        That was 70 years ago! And I’m sure 
                        you didn’t survive by sitting on 
                        the goddamn boat and fortifying. 

                                 DALE
                        Oh fuck you, Minnie! You weren’t 
                        even alive 70 years go.

                                 BEN
                        Ma!

           Everyone freezes. Minnie turns to see Ben and Mary have been 
           standing there the whole time. Ben raises his palms.

                                 MINNIE
                        Benjamin.

           It’s been a while.

                                 MINNIE (CONT’D)
                           (re: Mary)
                        Who’s this?

                                 BEN
                        This is Mary. My fiancee.

                                 MINNIE
                        Oh.

           Minnie looks her up and down. One syllable -she’s still got 
           it. 

                                 MINNIE (CONT’D)
                           (to group)
                        I’m going to speak with my 
                        grandson. When I come back there 
                        better be a horse in Siam or I’m 
                        gonna blow one of those cannons up 
                        your ass.

           Minnie walks off.
           EXT. SUNNY ACRES NURSING HOME - QUAD

           Ben and Mary sit across from Minnie on a park picnic table in 
           the middle of a grassy quad looking area. 

                                 MARY
                        So Mrs. Becker, this place is 
                        gorgeous.

                                 MINNIE
                        It’s Ms., dear. My husband died 9 
                        years ago thank you for reminding 
                        me. What’d you say your name was 
                        again?

                                 MARY
                        It’s Mary.

                                 MINNIE
                           (to Ben)
                        What are you doing here? Have you 
                        come to replace my Steven Tyler 
                        scarf? You know... the one you set 
                        on fire.

                                 BEN
                        You mean when I was 12?

                                 MINNIE
                        Oh please. I had a mortgage when I 
                        was 12.

                                 BEN
                        Why would I set something on fire 
                        from my own favorite band??

           Mary puts a hand on his arm. Minnie checks it.

                                 MINNIE
                        So then why are you here?

                                 BEN
                        We’re getting married and we’d like 
                        you to be there. 

                                 MINNIE
                        Why?

                                 BEN
                        Because we would. What does it 
                        matter? This is a good thing. Your 
                        grandson is getting married. 
                                 MINNIE
                        To some girl I’ve never met.

           Mary takes it on the chin.

                                 BEN
                        She’s right here, you know.

                                 MINNIE
                        What if I don’t want to go?

                                 BEN
                        Then don’t come.

                                 MINNIE
                        Well, I think I should be there, 
                        Benjamin.

                                 BEN
                        Jesus f-

                                 MARY
                        Ben. Ms. Becker. You’re his only 
                        family. And we just came here 
                        because we thought you might like 
                        to come and at the very least I 
                        thought it’d be nice to actually 
                        meet you.

                                 MINNIE
                        But you don’t think that anymore?

                                 MARY
                        What?

                                 MINNIE
                        You said “thought.” As in you 
                        previously thought it’d be nice to 
                        meet me but now...no?

                                 MARY
                        No. It’s um- it’s very nice to-

                                 MINNIE
                        What do you do for work, Miranda?

                                 MARY
                           (brushing it off)
                        It’s Mary. I’m a speech 
                        pathologist.
                                 MINNIE
                        And yet- speechless. Hm.
                           (to Ben)
                        When is it? The wedding. 

                                 MARY
                        August 8th.

                                 MINNIE
                        I can’t make it. 

                                 BEN
                        What’re you predicting that you’ll 
                        be dead in a month?

                                 MINNIE
                        Actually yes.

           Beat.

                                 BEN
                        ...I’m sorry.

                                 MINNIE
                        It’s ok. I’ve made my peace with 
                        it.

                                 BEN
                        If I had known, I wouldn’t have-

                                 MINNIE
                        How would you? I only decided a 
                        couple weeks ago.

                                 BEN
                        Wait, what do you mean you decided?

                                 MINNIE
                        I’m having an assisted suicide in a 
                        couple days. Your timing is great 
                        actually, as it turns out I need a 
                        signature from a relative. 

                                 BEN
                        You just let me sit there like you 
                        were dying?

                                 MINNIE
                        You were still right.

                                 BEN
                        What is happening right now?
                                 MINNIE
                        Why do you even care? I seem to 
                        remember you leaving me and your 
                        grandfather saying... what was it? 
                        Stay out of my life?

                                 BEN
                        Stay out of my fucking life, I 
                        believe it was.

                                 MINNIE
                        Yes, well I’m doing just fine in 
                        this shithole without you, thanks.

                                 MARY
                        Maybe I should give you guys a 
                        minute.

                                 MINNIE
                        Yes thank you, Meredith.

                                 MARY
                        It’s Mary.

                                 MINNIE
                        Right.

           Mary collects her ego and exits.

                                 BEN
                        Why didn’t you tell me?

                                 MINNIE
                        Why didn’t you tell me you were 
                        getting married?

                                 BEN
                        That’s totally different.

                                 MINNIE
                        How?

                                 BEN
                        Well for starters, one of them is 
                        legal.

                                 MINNIE
                        It’s completely legal...in Montana, 
                        Oregon, Vermont, Washington, 
                        California, Colorado and D.C.

                                 BEN
                        We’re in Maryland.
                                 MINNIE
                        Yes that reminds me, I’ll need a 
                        ride too. The doctor is in D.C.

                                 BEN
                        So just so I’m clear- not only have 
                        you chosen to skip my wedding, but 
                        you’ve done it so you can kill 
                        yourself, and you’d like me to take 
                        you there and sign off on it.

                                 MINNIE
                        I don’t know about skip. I mean by 
                        that logic, the rest of the family 
                        is skipping as well. 

           A beat.

                                 BEN
                        It was great to see you.

           Ben stands to leave - making it a full 2 steps away.

                                 MINNIE
                        Aren’t you going to ask me? 
                           (off Ben’s pause.)
                        You know you may have grown up but 
                        you still beg like a child outside 
                        the arcade. The flowers, the 
                        compassion and eventually the 
                        concession. You need money.

           Ben freezes.

                                 BEN
                        I don’t need your money.

                                 MINNIE
                           (leaning in)
                        You sure about that?

           Ben takes a moment to swallow his pride.

                                 BEN
                        I’m a little short on some wedding 
                        payments.

                                 MINNIE
                        What? Why isn’t Melanie’s father-

                                 BEN
                        Mary.
                                 MINNIE
                        Why isn’t Melanie’s father, Mary 
                        paying for the wedding?

                                 BEN
                        He basically cornered me, told me 
                        the family is broke and if I don’t 
                        pay for the wedding there isn’t 
                        going to be one.

                                 MINNIE
                        And you just said yes?

                                 BEN
                        What was my other option?

                                 MINNIE
                        Growing a pair of testicles and 
                        telling him no. How short are you?

                                 BEN
                        Like twenty...five thousand.

                                 MINNIE
                        Jesus, Ben. And I assume Mary 
                        doesn’t know.
                           (off his reaction)
                        Look at you.

                                 BEN
                        Are you going to help me or not?

           Mary comes back.

                                 MARY
                        Everything ok, Ben?

           A beat.

                                 MINNIE
                        Oh we’re just fine. Ben and I were 
                        just discussing my ride on 
                        Thursday. The appointment is at 2. 
                        So we should probably leave here by 
                        12? 12:30? 
                           (narrowing)
                        Maybe I could even kick you a few 
                        bucks for the lift.

           Ben and Minnie share a look. Do we have a deal?

           Ben walks away.
                                 MARY
                        Nice to meet you.

                                 MINNIE
                        Mhmm real treat, dear. 

           INT. BEN AND MARY’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT

           They’re both in bed. Mary reads a book as we pan over to Ben 
           who is just staring at the ceiling. 

                                 MARY
                        Why did she say you ‘left her?’

                                 BEN
                        I think I’m gonna take her.

                                 MARY
                        I thought you didn’t want to see 
                        her again?

                                 BEN
                        Yeah you know. I didn’t-

                                 MARY
                        But now you’re ok to just take her 
                        to kill herself?

                                 BEN
                        I mean, it’s her life. Her 
                        decision. If she wants to do this, 
                        who am I to stand in the way?

                                 MARY
                        Is it even legal?

                                 BEN
                        It’s legal where we’re going. I 
                        would assume that’s enough.

                                 MARY
                        OK. If this is what you want, then 
                        we’ll take her.

                                 BEN
                        Oh, you don’t have to come. You’ve 
                        got enough to worry about you don’t 
                        need this on your plate too. It’s 
                        gonna be a long drive and it’ll be 
                        all traffic and-
                                 MARY
                        If you don’t want me there, that’s 
                        all you have to say.

                                 BEN
                        No. What? I do. It’s just- Minnie 
                        is really particular and you know 
                        how those last moments are with 
                        people and- yeah. I’ll just take 
                        her.

           Ben breaks eye contact. Mary leaves it alone as we CUT TO:

           INT. SUNNY ACRES NURSING HOME - COMMON AREA

           Minnie, bag-in-hand delivers a final “fuck you” speech to the 
           rest of the nursing home who are all spread throughout the 
           room, watching her go. Ben stands behind her.

                                 MINNIE
                        I would say I’ll miss you all but I 
                        think we all know that’s just not 
                        the case. So many of you found 
                        yourselves in this black hole by 
                        way of chance, but I’d like to be 
                        the first to tell you that you will 
                        all die here. Maybe not today. 
                        Maybe not tomorrow...but it will 
                        happen. And I will not.

           Minnie takes one last look around.

                                 MINNIE (CONT’D)
                        See you all in hell.

           Minnie walks out.

                                 BEN
                        Do you think they got all that?

           Ben follows.

                                                           CUT TO:

           EXT. SUNNY ACRES NURSING HOME - PARKING LOT

           Ben and Minnie climb into the Prius and pull away.

           EXT. MARYLAND/D.C. LINE / INT. BEN’S CAR

           The Prius breezes past the sign: WELCOME TO WASHINGTON D.C.
           EXT. DOCTOR BLACK MEDICAL OFFICES - PARKING LOT - LATER

           The Prius pulls into the empty, cold lot and parks. 

           The building is an exact replica of the medical office you 
           grew up visiting. Concrete, stale and shared with dental 
           offices who by the smell of it, only cater to the urine-
           soaked.

           Ben looks to Minnie who focuses her eyeline on the building. 
           The reality of it all, settling in for him.

                                 BEN
                        This is it?

                                 MINNIE
                        Can’t get anything past you.

           Minnie exits. Ben follows her into the building, leaving the 
           now emotionless car. 

           INT. DOCTOR BLACK MEDICAL OFFICE - EXAM ROOM

           Minnie sits on a steel examination bed with Ben on the 
           doctor’s stool beside her.

                                 BEN
                        How does this work? I sign 
                        something and then what?

                                 MINNIE
                        I’ll write you a check when you 
                        sign the forms.

           A beat.

                                 BEN
                        How about you do it now.

                                 MINNIE
                        You really think I’m that evil? To 
                        drag you up here and not follow 
                        through?

                                 BEN
                        When I was 8 you put me up for 
                        adoption because I wouldn’t floss. 

                                 MINNIE
                        That’s a common parenting 
                        technique.
                                 BEN
                        Yeah most parents don’t actually go 
                        through with it. I spent 3 weeks 
                        with the Lopez family in South 
                        Baltimore. 

                                 MINNIE
                        And look at your gorgeous teeth 
                        today. 

           The door swings open to reveal DOCTOR BLACK (50s/Male. All 
           smiles. Loves his job.)

                                 DOCTOR BLACK
                        Hello Ms Becker! I’m Dr. Black. 

                                 MINNIE
                        Please call me Minnie.

                                 DOCTOR BLACK
                        And who are you, handsome?

                                 BEN
                        Ben. I’m her grandson. 

           They shake hands then Black looks to the stool Ben’s sitting 
           in.

                                 DOCTOR BLACK
                        That’s my chair.

           Ben sours at Doctor Black’s still all smiles attitude before 
           forfeiting the chair to find a new spot against the wall.

                                 DOCTOR BLACK (CONT’D)
                        So we’re ready to take the leap 
                        into the afterlife?

                                 MINNIE
                        Yes, Doctor.

                                 DOCTOR BLACK
                        Great. Well you’ve made my job very 
                        easy. From here, I write the 
                        prescription then you just come 
                        right back in 30 days with the 
                        release letter and we’re good to 
                        go.

                                 MINNIE
                        Great.

                                 BEN
                        I’m sorry, 30 days?
                                 DOCTOR BLACK
                        Oh and he, or a relative, will need 
                        to sign that release.

                                 BEN
                        Right. I know that but- wait what 
                        do you mean in 30 days?

                                 DOCTOR BLACK
                        D.C. law requires a 30 day waiting 
                        period in between the consultation 
                        and the procedure. This is just a 
                        consultation.

                                 BEN
                           (to Minnie)
                        Did you know this?

                                 MINNIE
                        I’m pretty sure I told you that.

                                 BEN
                        Um. Pretty sure you didn’t.
                           (to Black)
                        No no. I’m getting married- this- 
                        there has to be a way around that. 
                        Maybe there’s like a suicide 
                        express option or something?

                                 DOCTOR BLACK
                        I can’t fudge the law. I’m just 
                        shocked that-

           Black continues to smile. 

                                 BEN
                        Shocked that what?! Will you wipe 
                        that fucking smile off your face!?

                                 MINNIE
                        Benjamin, relax.

                                 BEN
                        You relax!

                                 DOCTOR BLACK
                        Why don’t I give you guys a minute. 

                                 BEN
                        Yeah why don’t you. We’ll be in 
                        here smiling away! All smiles!

           Black exits.
                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Are you shitting me?

                                 MINNIE
                        Calm down.

                                 BEN
                        You knew about this.

                                 MINNIE
                        Do you think I wanted to spend my 
                        last days in hell’s waiting room?

                                 BEN
                        We had a deal. 

                                 MINNIE
                        We still do. 

           Ben stares down Minnie - is she saying what I think she is?

                                 BEN
                        You’re not staying with me and 
                        Mary.

                                 MINNIE
                        The home was covered by insurance, 
                        once I’ve checked out you can’t 
                        check back in.

                                 BEN
                        This was not part of the deal.

                                 MINNIE
                        Fine. I’m sure the Boys and Girls 
                        club could use a donation. They’d 
                        probably even name a basketball 
                        court after me.

           Ben takes a deep breath-

                                 BEN
                        You’re a sick old woman.
                           (shouting)
                        Hey Smiley?!

           Doctor Black pops back in.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        What’s the soonest date you have?
           INT. BEN AND MARY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Ben and Mary speak in the living room.

                                 MARY
                        What do you mean she’s coming to 
                        live with us?

                                 BEN
                        I wasn’t going to just stick her 
                        back in the nursing home. She’s 
                        only got 30 days to live, Mary.

                                 MARY
                        I just feel like this is something 
                        we probably should have talked 
                        about. 

                                 BEN
                        We’re talking right now. This is 
                        it. We’re doing it.

                                 MARY
                        When’s the appointment?

                                 BEN
                        August 8th...

                                 MARY
                        August 8th as in the day of our 
                        wedding?

                                 BEN
                        Yes. 

                                 MARY
                        Is she coming?

                                 BEN
                        God no.

           Mary takes it all in, trying to be a good partner.

                                 MARY
                        Ok. Should we pick her up or 
                        something? How does this work?

                                 BEN
                        Oh, she’s outside. 

           Ben turns to the door.
                                 MARY
                        Wait, what?

                                                      HARD CUT TO:

           EXT. MILLER HOUSEHOLD - FRONT DOOR

           Ben, Mary and Minnie stand waiting for the door to open. Ben 
           looks miserable, Mary is putting on a brave face, and 
           Minnie... is just coasting.

           The door rips open - it’s Hank (w/ two sleeping babies 
           strapped on).

                                 MARY
                        Hello, Hank.

                                 HANK
                        Heyooooo. Oh check this out.

           Hank balances a beer on a baby’s sleeping head.

                                 WANDA (O.S.)
                        Hank don’t do that with the beer 
                        bottle.

                                 HANK
                        I didn’t! But they said they really 
                        wanna see it.

           Hank walks off with Mary. Ben smiles to Minnie who just gives 
           him a look like “seriously?”

                                 BEN
                        The Millers are very conservative. 
                        So don’t mention the suicide or the- 
                        budget stuff.

           Minnie just smiles and heads in.

           INT. MILLER HOUSEHOLD - DINING ROOM - LATER

           We’re at dinner - same setup as last night plus one added 70-
           year-old bonus.

                                 GEORGE
                        It’s such a pleasure to finally 
                        meet you, Minnie. Thank you for 
                        joining us. 
                                 MINNIE
                        Oh no problem. It’s George, right? 
                        I understand you and my Benjamin 
                        have become quite close. 

           George eyes Minnie, wondering if she knows. But before either 
           can speak, Leo slams his plastic plate on the table over and 
           over. It’s aggressive. 

                                 HANK
                        Does anyone know how to fix this?!

                                 WANDA
                        Leo, control yourself.

           Hank rips the plate out of Leo’s hands. 

                                 WANDA (CONT’D)
                        So Minnie I assume you’ll be 
                        joining us on walkthrough tomorrow?

                                 BEN
                        No. Minnie has a lot of knitting to 
                        get done. Right? Maybe catch some 
                        Antiques Roadshow.

                                 MINNIE
                        I would love to come. Thank you.

                                 MARY
                        It’s a beautiful church. 

                                 MINNIE
                        Oh, it’s at a church?

                                 WANDA
                        Where else would one get married?

                                 MINNIE
                        ...Preferably somewhere an altar 
                        boy hasn’t had his holes blessed.

           George and Wanda freeze. Hank chokes on his beer.

                                 BEN
                        Ooohkay.

                                 WANDA
                        Henry.

                                 HANK
                        Did you hear that?
                                 WANDA
                        It’s a traditional wedding in a 
                        traditional venue.

                                 MINNIE
                        Well from what Benjamin tells me, 
                        there’s nothing traditional about 
                        it.

           Minnie and George lock eyes again, George realizing that she 
           does know. Ben almost chokes.

                                 WANDA
                        Excuse me?

                                 BEN
                        She means because- and I was going 
                        to say this tonight. Thanks for 
                        ruining the surprise... Mary and I 
                        wanted to pitch in on some of the 
                        final payments.

                                 MARY/WANDA
                        What?

                                 GEORGE
                        That’s great, Ben but you really 
                        don’t have to-

                                 MARY
                        Yeah, Ben what are you talking 
                        about?

                                 BEN
                        I didn’t tell you? Yeah I got a um- 
                        a nice little bonus and-

                                 GEORGE
                        That may be, but we can’t just let 
                        you pay for your own wedding.

           George and Ben lock eyes - the dance has commenced.

                                 BEN
                        I insist.

                                 GEORGE
                        Well if you insist, we’d be 
                        honored.

           Aaand it’s over.

                                 MINNIE
                        Well that was easy.
                                 WANDA
                        George.

                                 GEORGE
                        Wanda. The man insisted.

                                 MINNIE
                        What was it you said you do for 
                        work, George?

                                 GEORGE
                        I’m retired. Spend most of my time 
                        on the golf course these days. 

                                 MINNIE
                        I hear it can get pretty expensive 
                        out there.

           George shoots a quick look at Ben who avoids eye contact. 

                                 GEORGE
                        It can be. Rising greens fees, 
                        expensive equipment, then of course 
                        you’ve gotta be careful who you 
                        decide to go toe-to-toe with. There 
                        are some sharks out there for sure.

           Horns. Locked.

                                 MINNIE
                        Is that right? I know if someone 
                        tried to take advantage of me I 
                        wouldn’t be so pleased about it. 
                        Especially if someone were to take 
                        advantage of say... my grandson.

                                 GEORGE
                        Oh don’t worry. We’re looking after 
                        him just fine.

                                 MINNIE
                        That’s quite a comfort, George 
                        thank you.

           George sits back, thinking he’s won this subtextual standoff. 
           But Minnie narrows in her response, growing in the intensity 
           of every word as we pull in closer and closer on them both.

                                 MINNIE (CONT’D)
                        But I’m watching as well. And I 
                        always will be. And someday when I 
                        move on to another place, I would 
                        still be watching. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MINNIE (CONT’D)
                        And at that time, if someone did 
                        try to take advantage of my 
                        Benjamin again, I would dig myself 
                        out from the grave in which I’m 
                        buried, and with the rotten bones 
                        of my lifeless carcass I will fuck 
                        you raw.

           Everyone is speechless while George (broken) and Minnie 
           (smoke wafting from her intellectual gun) are locked on 
           eachother. Wanda seems unphased. Minnie gives a pointed 
           smile.

                                 MINNIE (CONT’D)
                        Know what I mean?

                                 WANDA
                        We’ll have to find a nice place by 
                        the bar to seat you for the 
                        wedding. 

                                 MINNIE
                        I won’t be attending.

                                 WANDA
                        And why is that?

                                 BEN
                        Don’t.

                                 MINNIE
                        I’ll be killing myself in a month.

           Wanda spits up her wine. George chokes on salad. Hank spits 
           up beer directly onto Leo’s face who immediately starts 
           crying. 

                                 MARY
                        Jesus, Hank.

                                 MINNIE
                        But don’t worry. I’ll be helping 
                        out with the last little... loose 
                        ends. Seems like there might be a 
                        few more than I thought.

           Minnie eyes Ben who avoids eye contact. Leo continues to cry.

                                 MARY
                        Hank! Take him to the sink and 
                        clean him off.

                                 HANK
                        OK!
           Hank takes Leo out of his high chair but he squirms like 
           crazy and Hank lowers him to the floor, where he crawls off 
           into the unknown.

                                 WANDA
                        Benjamin I think your grandmother 
                        has had enough wine for tonight.

                                 MINNIE
                        Wow you really are a tight ass.

                                 WANDA
                        Please watch your language around 
                        my mother.

           Minnie looks to the urn atop the mantle.

                                 MINNIE
                        She’s dead.

                                 BEN
                        Ok.

                                 HANK
                        Leo?

                                 BEN
                        What are you doing?

                                 MINNIE
                        What?

                                 HANK
                        Ok. Code blue Leo is somewhere 
                        under the table.

                                 MARY
                        Ben could we chat outside?

                                 MINNIE
                        Yes Benjamin, could we?

                                 WANDA
                        I’m finished.

                                 HANK
                        Ok CODE RED - LEO!!??

           Wanda pushes her chair out. Mary drops her napkin down, then 
           makes for the door, pissed. Ben shoots a look to Minnie 
           before chasing-

                                 BEN
                        Mary, wait-
           But as Ben rushes after her, he trips over Hank’s leg, 
           bumping the URN--

           It begins to teeter and totter-- all eyes on it in slow 
           motion as it--

           Begins to fall- careening towards the ground only for it to-

           BOUNCE OFF THE FLOOR.

           What?

                                 GEORGE
                        Hah. Got that after Hank showed me 
                        that Meet the Parents movie.

           Mary and Wanda stand in front of the huge white church while 
           Ben and Minnie talk in the car.

                                 MARY
                        You didn’t have to speak to her 
                        like that either.

                                 WANDA
                        It’ll take weeks to get your Mimoo 
                        out of that carpet.

                                 MARY
                        It’s only a month.
           ANGLE ON - Ben and Minnie inside the car.

                                 MINNIE
                        Remind me why we’re at a church?

                                 BEN
                        WE are at a church because I am 
                        getting married here in a month and 
                        YOU are going to shut your mouth 
                        and pray to whoever you pray to 
                        that he gives me the strength to 
                        not drown you in the bird bath.

           Minnie looks at the bird bath.

                                 MINNIE
                           (leaning in)
                        I am here because I am paying. And 
                        if you thought I was going to just 
                        write you a check and disappear 
                        then this is going to be a very 
                        rough 30 days.

           INT. CARDINAL FRANCIS LAW PARISH - MAIN CHURCH AREA

           The crew takes in the main church area - glistening wooden 
           pews, big beautiful columns, perfectly stained glass allowing 
           light to shine in perfectly and illuminate the crucifix above 
           the altar. 

                                 MARY
                        It’s a beautiful church, Mom.

                                 WANDA
                        Every woman in our family has been 
                        married in this church.

           They share a smile.

                        And now, so shall you.

           A priest, FATHER JOHNSON (60s) comes out from a confessional 
           booth.

                                 FATHER JOHNSON
                        Millers! And Mary. Are we ready for 
                        this beautiful occasion?
                                 BEN
                        Oh she’s just marrying me, Father. 
                        It’s not that beautiful.

           Everyone but Minnie laughs.

                                 MINNIE
                           (to Ben)
                        Who are you?

           FJ hugs Wanda, Mary and Ben. He shakes hands with Minnie who 
           sizes him up.

                                 BEN
                        This is my grandmother, Minnie. 
                        She’s just tagging along. Shall we 
                        um-

                                 MINNIE
                        He’s Jewish. You can’t marry a Jew 
                        in a Catholic church.

                                 MARY
                        Father Johnson has been working 
                        with Ben over the last few months.

           Minnie eyes Ben.

                                 BEN
                        It’s really not a big deal. People 
                        switch all the time.

                                 MINNIE
                        It’s a religion, not a pair of 
                        shants.

                                 BEN
                        How are you giving me religious 
                        advice?

                                 WANDA
                        We’d feel more comfortable with Ben 
                        as a practicing Catholic. Also this 
                        way Mary can be married in a 
                        church.

                                 MINNIE
                        Who gives a shit? Get married on a 
                        goddamn beach with a Justice of the 
                        Peace. I got my certificate online, 
                        I could marry you and that plant 
                        right now. 
                                 BEN
                        Also the fee is a fraction of what 
                        it would be at any other venue.

                                 MINNIE
                        See! He’s so Jewish!

                                 WANDA
                        She won’t be present for the 
                        ceremony, Father.

                                 BEN
                        Yes, thank God. 

                                 MINNIE
                        Do you even know who your new God 
                        is?

           All eyes on Ben.

                                 BEN
                        Of course... The father and son and 
                        you know... the um- the ghost- of 
                        Christmas past.

                                 WANDA
                        ...He’ll be ready on the day of the 
                        wedding. 

                                 MARY
                        It’s the father, the son and the 
                        holy ghost, Ben. 

                                 WANDA
                        The holy trinity. Not one but three 
                        coeternal consubstantial persons. 

                                 MINNIE
                        He still doesn’t understand.

                                 FATHER JOHNSON
                        They’re all one being, Ben. You 
                        remember from our class last week.

                                 BEN
                        Right. Yeah I got it.

                                 MINNIE
                        Explain it.

           Ben’s the kid in class who didn’t read the textbook.
                                 WANDA
                        Mary, I thought you said he’s been 
                        training.

                                 MINNIE
                        Whose choice was this church?

                                 BEN
                        It’s confusing! How can one thing 
                        live in 3 things. I didn’t think it 
                        was gonna be this hard. I thought I 
                        was just gonna learn how to 
                        apologize and move on and you 
                        know... accept Jesus as my lord and 
                        savior.

           Ben...bows? Mary raises her eyebrows in shock.

                                 FATHER JOHNSON
                        If this isn’t something you’re 
                        dedicating to then-

                                 MARY
                        What? No no he’s fine.

                                 WANDA
                        Father, we have a long standing 
                        relationship with this Parish.

                                 MINNIE
                        Benjamin also just threatened to 
                        drown me in the bird bath.

                                 BEN
                        Shut the fuck up!

           There’s a silence and an awkward look from FJ. Mary wants to 
           rip Ben’s head off. 

                                 FATHER JOHNSON
                        We do have a long waiting list for- 
                        dedicated members.

                                 MARY
                        Father. Please.

                                 FATHER JOHNSON
                        Perhaps another venue would be 
                        best.

           A shocked beat.

                                 WANDA
                        I’ll be in the car.
           Wanda exits first, followed by Mary, followed by Ben who eyes 
           Minnie on the way out.

           INT. BEN AND MARY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - THAT NIGHT

           Ben and Mary have a hushed discussion in the kitchen.

                                 BEN
                        I’m really sorry.

                                 MARY
                        Thank God the Vineyard was still 
                        available. We need to leave by 8am 
                        tomorrow and...

                                 BEN
                        I know.

                                 MARY
                        She’s just-

                                 BEN
                        I will handle this. 

           Mary feigns a wishful but doubting smile when- Minnie enters 
           and they disengage. Mary breezes past her.

                                 MARY
                        Night, Minnie.

           Minnie feigns the same smile. 

                                 MINNIE
                        So we found a Vineyard? When’s the 
                        tour?

                                 BEN
                        You think you’re coming?

                                 MINNIE
                        We need a venue, Benjamin.

                                 BEN
                        Because you lost it.

                                 MINNIE
                        I lost it? You’ve been praying to a 
                        Charles Dickens character.

           A beat.
                                 BEN
                        What are you doing?

                                 MINNIE
                        I’m having tea.

           Minnie grabs the kettle, but it’s empty. She replaces it back 
           on the stove.

                                 BEN
                        You embarrassed me.

                                 MINNIE
                        Do you know how many toy stores I 
                        had to drag you out of, because you 
                        decided to throw a tantrum?

           Minnie marches out.

                                 MINNIE (CONT’D)
                        Throw some more water on. It’s 
                        empty.

           Ben, alone now grabs the kettle, filling it up with water. 
           Then on the shelf he spots a bottle-- SLEEP-AID XXTRA.

           Ben cracks open the bottle, breaking more than a few capsules 
           into the kettle before putting it back on the stove.

           EST. HIGHWAY OUTSIDE MARYLAND - THE NEXT MORNING

           We’re settled in the dying fescue of a highway an hour 
           outside Baltimore. 

           There’s not much around except for this highway and the WHITE 
           MERCEDES approaching our view. It slows, then turns onto a 
           dirt road which we can now see leads through vineyard, up to 
           a red barn. A sign reads:

           “CROSSROAD VINEYARD - Est. 2007.”

           EXT. CROSSROAD VINEYARD / INT. WANDA’S MERCEDES

           Wanda (driving) Mary and Ben roll up the dirt road towards 
           the barn.

                                 MARY
                        That’s too bad Minnie didn’t want 
                        to come.
                                 BEN
                        Yeah she caught some terrible 
                        stomach bug. You know old people - 
                        they get sick all the time. I told 
                        her to just sleep it off.

                                 WANDA
                        I’m sure we’ll be just fine without 
                        her.

           We roll to a stop. The crew exits the car to: 

           EXT. CROSSROAD VINEYARD - CONTINUOUS

           We park in front of the barn to take a look at the expansive 
           vineyard. Grapes are almost fully grown ready to be picked.

                        This is beautiful.

                                 WANDA
                        The church was beautiful. 

                                 BEN
                        Again, I’m really sorry about that. 
                        I still intend on finishing the 
                        program with Father Johnson.

                                 WANDA
                        We’ll be lucky be allowed back in 
                        for Sunday Mass.

                                 MARY
                        We got really lucky here. They have 
                        a slot on August 8th so we could 
                        keep everything right how it is. 
                        We’d just have to alter the flower 
                        wall and make some menu adjustments 
                        but otherwise-- everything should 
                        stay on track.

           A Vineyard hand/Tour Guide approaches us. BRANDON (20s/plaid 
           shirt, boots, Carthartt overalls). 

                                 BRANDON
                        Are you the Beckers?

                                 WANDA
                        Only one of us.

                                 MARY
                        Are you, Brandon?
           Ben and Mary smile at one another. They hold hands. But as 
           soon as the nice moment arrived, it is gone.

           We hear the roar of an engine burning up the dirt driveway. 
           When it comes into focus, we realize it’s a YELLOW CAB 
           hauling ass.

                                 BRANDON
                        Someone’s in a hurry.

                                 BEN
                        Ssshit.

           The cab stops right next to us - out steps Minnie. 

                                 MINNIE
                        Good morning everyone! Apologies 
                        for the delay.

                                 WANDA
                        Feeling better?

           Minnie eyes Ben.

                                 MINNIE
                        Oh, so much better. 

           The TAXI DRIVER rolls down the window.

                                 TAXI DRIVER
                        That’ll be 125.80. 

                                 BEN
                        Did you take a cab all the way from 
                        Baltimore?

                                 MINNIE
                        Missed my ride. 

           A Ben and Minnie stand off.

                                 MINNIE (CONT’D)
                        Well? Pay the man. Mr big salesman 
                        with the big bonus.

           Ben drags himself to the cab, handing over a credit card.

                                 MARY
                        So glad you could join us, Minnie.

                                 MINNIE
                        Oh how could I miss out on the 8th 
                        wonder of the world... Northern 
                        Maryland’s wine country. 
           Ben returns as the cab rolls off. 

                                 BRANDON
                        Shall we start the tour?

           Brandon takes us to the edge of the parking area where we 
           overlook the big illustrious vineyard.

                                 MINNIE
                        What kind of grapes are you growing 
                        here?

                                 WANDA
                        Wine.

                                 MINNIE
                        Which type.

                                 BRANDON
                        We grow mainly Merlot here but a 
                        decent amount of Pinot as well.

                                 MARY
                        Amazing.

                                 MINNIE
                        Isn’t harvesting season for a 
                        Merlot, August in this region?

                                 BRANDON
                        Yes that’s correct.

                                 MINNIE
                        And do you hand-pick or machine 
                        roll?

                                 BRANDON
                        ...we machine roll.

                                 WANDA
                        Thinking about throwing yourself 
                        in?

                                 BEN
                        How about we chat this over inside 
                        with some wine?

                                 MINNIE
                        Why? This is a waste of time.

                                 MARY
                        What’s the problem?
                                 WANDA
                        Where to start?

                                 MINNIE
                        The problem is that while your 
                        ceremony is happening in a few 
                        weeks, there will be big huge grape 
                        harvesters rolling in the 
                        background, and if they’re not the 
                        dust will have barely settled from 
                        the harvesters having to work 
                        overtime the days leading up to the 
                        ceremony. Isn’t that right, 
                        Brandon?

                                 BRANDON
                        We can reschedule the harvest.

                                 MINNIE
                        For a cost I assume....

                                 BRANDON
                        Well, yes.

                                 WANDA
                        How much could it possibly be?

                                 MINNIE
                        Oh what a surprise. Mrs Pearl 
                        Necklace has no concept of money.

                                 WANDA
                        You know what? I’ve had enough of 
                        your schtick. 

                                 MINNIE
                        Tell us Brandon, how much would it 
                        be to push the harvest?

                                 BRANDON
                        Well we’d need to buy out half the 
                        crop for loss of product. We 
                        usually pull in about 40 thousand 
                        on a good-

                                 BEN
                        Holy shit.

                                 MINNIE
                           (to Wanda)
                        Just wine though, right?
                           (to all)
                        Why did you think the space is 
                        available?
           Mary and Wanda head back to the Mercedes. Minnie hangs back 
           for a moment with Ben.

                                 MINNIE (CONT’D)
                        Next time you want to slip 
                        something in my tea, make sure it 
                        kills me. 

           Ben bites his tongue. Minnie moves to the Mercedes, opening 
           the door.

                                 WANDA (O.S.)
                        Oh she’s riding with us, then. 
                        Wonderful.

                                 MINNIE
                        Benjamin, why don’t you let us gals 
                        ride alone on the way back. We’ve 
                        got a lot to catch up on.

                                 BEN
                        How will I get home?

           Minnie hops in the car, making eye contact with Ben as she 
           slams the door shut.

                                 MINNIE
                        Call a cab.

           INT. RETIRED MINDS - FRONT DESK

           Ben trudges up the stairs, passing the front desk... to no 
           sound.

           He stops to look back and the front desk is just completely 
           barren. No cutout. No nothing. Could this be the day that-?

           INT. RETIRED MINDS - SALES BAY - CONTINUOUS

           Everyone is huddled around listening to one guy speak. We’ll 
           call him BOSS because well...he’s the new boss. He wears a 
           LIFECO polo shirt with a little “Brelly” pin on it.

                                 BOSS
                        So by the end of the day somoene 
                        will be coming around to meet with 
                        each of you, but in the meantime, 
                        just grab some coffee and relax.

           Boss’ SECOND HAND MAN (smiling earnestly) hands out a stack 
           of pamphlets to pass around.
           Ben, worried, settles in next to Alyssa. 

                                 BEN
                        What’s going on?

                                 ALYSSA
                        Lifeco bought us out.

                                 BEN
                        Layoffs?

                                 ALYSSA
                        Worse.

           A pile of packets make it to us. On the front:

           “LET’S CHAT - A STARTER GUIDE”

           Clipped to it also is a little BRELLY KEYCHAIN. Darren 
           appears.

                                 DARREN
                        They’re turning us all into 
                        chatroom operators.
                           (shouting)
                        This is bullshit, sir. I’ve been 
                        working here since 2008.

                                 BOB
                        You haven’t sold a policy since 

                                 DARREN
                        Fuck you, Bob.

                                 BEN
                        This is a good thing. We get to 
                        keep our jobs.

                                 DARREN
                        Yeah with no commission. It’s a 
                        demotion and a pay decrease. 

                                 SECOND HAND MAN
                        You’re more than welcome to seek 
                        other employment. But should you 
                        quit, you will not be offered 
                        severance. 

                                 DARREN
                        Fuck this, man.

           Ben clicks his little umbrella thing-
                                 BRELLY
                        Hey heyyy, how can I keep you dry 
                        today?

           Darren HUCKS his across the room at the wall and marches out. 
           It hits the wall and-

                                 BRELLY (CONT’D)
                        Hey heyyy, how can I keep you dry 
                        today?

           Bob follows suit. Ben watches them one-by-one walk out, all 
           chucking their keychains off the wall, each firing up to form 
           a haunting digital symphony of Brellies. Each echoeing over 
           the other.

                    BRELLY (CONT'D)
           Hey heyyy how can I keep you 
           dry today??-----
                                                 BRELLY (CONT'D)
                                          -----Hey heyyy how can I keep 
                                          you dry today??

           We hold on Ben as he clutches the keychain. Alyssa matches.

                                 ALYSSA
                        Yeah. Me too.

           They’re the only two left. Second Hand Man comes over, 
           placing a hand on Ben’s shoulder.

                                 SECOND HAND MAN
                        You’re going to LOVE the 
                        (hashtag)chatlife.

           Ben exhales as we-

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. MILLER HOUSHOLD - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

           Mary and Wanda make phone calls from the dining room table 
           which has been moved aside for a man in a HAZMAT SUIT, who is 
           running a commercial grade hand vacuum across the ashy carpet 
           with precision.

                                 MARY
                           (into phone)
                        Ok, well thanks anyway.
                           (hanging up)
                        Everything is booked.
                                 WANDA
                        This wouldn’t be a problem if it 
                        weren’t for her.
                           (to the HAZMAT)
                        Be careful!

           Hazmat shrugs and then vacuums... more carefully?

                                 MARY
                        You don’t think I know that? 

                                 WANDA
                        Well you’re certainly not doing 
                        anything about it.

                                 MARY
                        You’re right. I want my wedding to 
                        fall apart three weeks before it 
                        happens.

           George pops his head through the door. He’s dressed in full 
           golf attire.

                                 GEORGE
                        Ok ladies, I’m off to the links.

           Mary looks out the window and-

                                 MARY
                        It’s raining.

           George hesitates and then-

                                 GEORGE
                        Gotta want it, Mary. 

           George smiles then exits.

                                 MARY
                        Why don’t we just have the wedding 
                        here? In the back yard?

                                 WANDA
                        Do you care at all what people 
                        think?

                                 MARY
                        It was just a suggestion.

           Wand thinks and then-

                                 WANDA
                        We need a professional.
           Hazmat finds something clanking around in the dust buster - 
           it’s a quarter. He places it in his little Hazmat pocket and 
           continues sucking as we-

           INT. MILLER HOUSEHOLD - LIVINGROOM - THE NEXT DAY

           Ben, Mary, and Wanda face our POV from the living room couch. 
           Each hiding their own shade of misery.

                                 WANDA
                        What we need is someone who can put 
                        together a nice, clean, classy 
                        ceremony. 

                                 MARY
                        On a deadline. We’re booked in for 
                        August 8th and well... we don’t 
                        want our guests to have to 
                        rearrange schedules, rebook the 
                        florist and whatnot.

           WE’LL CUT BETWEEN MULTIPLE WEDDING PLANNER INTERVIEWS:

           The first is WEDDING PLANNER 1 (30s) with her hair pulled 
           back tightly into a power-bun - black clothing (designer), 
           chic square glasses (designer) and a dead soul (custom).

                                 WEDDING PLANNER 1
                        You’re in good hands. I don’t take 
                        vacations. I have never been sick, 
                        and the last risk I took was buying 
                        mid-level coverage for the 
                        insurance on my entire upper body.

                                 BEN
                        And your rate?

           WITH PLANNER 2 (40s) - All white clothing. Poppy and very put-
           together with a $300 haircut.

                                 WEDDING PLANNER 2
                        I’m on the higher end but worth 
                        every penny you’ll spend. I just 
                        did a wedding for the Governor’s 
                        daughter a few weeks ago. It was on 
                        the 7 o’clock news.

                                 WANDA
                        Weren’t you on the cover of the 
                        Knot magazine?
           WITH PLANNER 3 (early 30s) - Drop dead gorgeous. Red blouse. 
           She’s probably given dozens of commencement speeches on the 
           “power of will.”

                                 WEDDING PLANNER 3
                        Yes! The editor is a close personal 
                        friend of mine - I set her up with 
                        her husband.

                                 MARY
                        We have been obsessing over that 
                        March issue with the flower wall.

                                 WEDDING PLANNER 1
                        So have you got a-

           A small object bounces off of her forehead. When it settles 
           on the ground, we see it was an M&M candy...

           That’s when we reveal who just threw it: Minnie, who’s seated 
           next to Ben. They all try to just ignore her at this point.

                                 WEDDING PLANNER 1 (CONT’D)
                        Did you just throw an M&M candy at 
                        me?

                                 MINNIE
                        I don’t think so.

           She’s eating a handful of M&Ms. 

                                 WANDA
                        Will you put those down please?

                                 MINNIE
                        Why’s that?

                                 BEN
                        Please just go on.

           BACK WITH 2:

                                 WEDDING PLANNER 2
                        I start with materials. The 
                        foundation of any wedding is the 
                        tableclo-

                                 MINNIE
                        Have you ever been with a woman?

           Minnie smiles at her. Planner 2 just looks uncomfortable.
                                 BEN
                        Ok. What are you doing?

                                 MINNIE
                        Because you just kinda look like 
                        that type is all I’m saying. 

           ON 3:

                                 WEDDING PLANNER 3
                        I don’t think you’re one to be 
                        doling out fashion advice.

                                 MINNIE
                        Well no, but that doesn’t mean the 
                        blouse doesn’t look awful. I mean 
                        are you trying to fuck the groom or-

                                 EVERYONE
                        Woooah/ooookay/Jesus

                                 MINNIE
                        What? It’s a logical concern.

           On 2: 

                                 WEDDING PLANNER 2
                        My past relationships are none of 
                        your business and I’ll have you 
                        know I’m happily married to my 
                        husband of 6 years.

                                 MINNIE
                        So never??? Not even in college?

                        Where was I?

           Doink - another M&M bounces right off her glasses.

                                 WEDDING PLANNER 1 (CONT’D)
                        Ok that could have taken my eye 
                        out! Do you have any idea what 
                        these eyes are worth?

                                 MINNIE
                        Let’s find out.

                                 WEDDING PLANNER 2
                        I have not been with a woman!! 
                                 MINNIE
                        Well don’t take it as such an 
                        insult, jeez. 

           On 3:

                                 WEDDING PLANNER 3
                        He’s not exactly my type.

                                 BEN
                        I’m right here.

                                 MINNIE
                        Are you calling my grandson ugly?

                                 MARY
                        Can we get back on topic?

                                 MINNIE
                        Now you’ve offended the bride too. 

           On 2:

                                 WEDDING PLANNER 2
                        I get plenty of... you know what, 
                        thank you very much.

                                 WANDA
                        That is enough of this! 

                                 MINNIE
                        Oh look you have a partner. Wanda, 
                        when was the last time you got 
                        laid?

           Planner 2 storms out.

                                 WEDDING PLANNER 3
                        Good luck finding any vendors. I 
                        know everyone within a 100 mile 
                        radius!

                                 MINNIE
                        A 100 mile radius? It must just be  
                        an old hanging curtain down there, 
                        huh?

           There goes planner 3. 

                                 WEDDING PLANNER 1
                        Good day.
                                 BEN
                        Please, wait.

           WE SETTLE DOWN INTO:

           INT. MILLER HOUSEHOLD - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           The whole crew is exhausted.

                                 BEN
                        So um- I’m sorry what’d you say 
                        your name is again?

           We turn to reveal a young lady named AMY (20s). The only 
           thing more frazzled than her hair are her clothes, makeup and 
           general appearance. 

                                 AMY
                        It’s Amy. From The Little Lady. 

                                 MARY
                        Is that the charity downtown?

                                 AMY
                        There are women there named 
                        Charity.

                                 BEN
                        It’s a strip joint.
                           (off of looks)
                        I think.

                                 AMY
                        I just do the events and publicity. 

                                 WANDA
                        Mhm thank you for coming in.

           Amy deflates but-

                                 MINNIE
                        I like her.

           Amy smiles.

                                 WANDA
                        Absolutely not.

                                 AMY
                        I’ll do it for almost nothing since 
                        it’s my first wedding.
                                 WANDA
                        It’s her first wedding.

                                 MINNIE
                        You got the job!

           Amy smiles.

                                 WANDA
                        What? No!

                                 MINNIE
                        Why not? She’s perfect. 

                                 WANDA
                        Because I will not have a wedding 
                        with glitter table cloths and some 
                        woman named Candy, Mandy or Brandy 
                        cutting the cake in half with a 
                        stiletto.

                                 MINNIE
                        Are you paying for this wedding? 

                                 WANDA
                        Are you?!

                          BEN
                                                      MARY
           Ma.
                                          Mom.

           Minnie turns back with the whole glass jar of M&Ms. 

           She tosses it in Amy’s general direction. Without hesitation 
           Amy dives out of her worn-out heels to catch the jar. Not a 
           single candy spills. 

           Everyone’s taken aback. Amy just stands, handing the jar back 
           to Minnie.

                                 AMY
                        Sorry. 

                                 MINNIE
                        You don’t need some chick who will 
                        eat up half the budget. Or one who 
                        can’t take a couple off-color 
                        comments and certainly not some 
                        bitch who’ll implode after a couple 
                        candies hit her on her “insured 
                        eyeballs.” You need a get shit done 
                        chick. On a budget.

           Everyone’s jaw is on the floor. 
                                 MINNIE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be outside.

           Minnie moves to the exit.

                                 WANDA
                        Good.

                                 MINNIE (O.S.)
                        Oh shove it up your ass, Wanda.

           Mary gives Ben a look. 

                                 MARY
                        Handle this.

                                 BEN
                        Yep. On it.

                                 AMY
                        Do I get a deposit of some kind?

                                 BEN
                        Gimme just one sec, Amy.

           Ben rushes out.

           EXT. THE MILLER HOUSEHOLD - DRIVEWAY

           Minnie exits the house in a huff, followed closely by Ben.

                                 BEN
                        Really?

                                 MINNIE
                        Really what? She’s the right woman 
                        for the job. I don’t care what 
                        Wanda thinks. Or Mary for that 
                        matter.

                                 BEN
                        There wasn’t another way you 
                        could’ve made that clear?

                                 MINNIE
                        Excuse me. I’m the only one 
                        actually helping here and you’re 
                        upset with me? 

                                 BEN
                        Wanda is 2 seconds away from 
                        kicking me out of my own wedding.
                                 MINNIE
                        It’s not Wanda’s wedding.

           Ben laughs.

                                 MINNIE (CONT’D)
                        Is this a joke to you?

                                 BEN
                        The fact that you’re giving out 
                        parenting advice, is kind of a 
                        joke, yeah. 

                                 MINNIE
                        I can’t care about the wellbeing of 
                        my grandson?

                                 BEN
                        My wellbeing? Anytime it snowed you 
                        made me walk home from school.

                                 MINNIE
                        To learn a valuable lesson.

                                 BEN
                        What lesson? That 10-year-olds can 
                        get frostbite? 

                                 MINNIE
                        Is that what this is about? How I 
                        treated you growing up? I’m sorry. 
                        I’m sorry I didn’t kiss your boo-
                        boos and rub you down with baby oil 
                        every night.

                                 BEN
                        What?

                                 MINNIE
                        Maybe you didn’t like the way I 
                        raised you, but I raised you. And I 
                        certainly didn’t raise you to be 
                        this...pussy.

                                 BEN
                        I am not a- pussy.

           Minnie pushes him on the shoulder. Hard.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Hey. 

           Minnie pushes him again. He stumbles back.
                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Stop that!

                                 MINNIE
                        You used to be something. Someone. 
                        Do you even remember the funeral? 
                        You held on so tight to that little 
                        car. You had attitude. 

                                 BEN
                        I also had nightmares...forever.

                                 MINNIE
                        You need to step up and take 
                        control of your life. You’re 
                        allowing yourself to be bullied by 
                        a couple cul de sac WASPS and it’s 
                        no surprise you can’t see it with 
                        your AND Mary’s head so far up 
                        Wanda’s ass.

                                 BEN
                        Watch it.

                                 MINNIE
                        You watch it. You’ve got a shit job 
                        and a make-believe life, but that’s 
                        not even the problem. Wanda’s got a 
                        $600 coat and a 2 million dollar 
                        home and George is still taking 
                        golf lessons twice a week, and 
                        you’re telling me they’re going 
                        broke?

           Ben chews on that.

                                 MINNIE (CONT’D)
                        Everything I do is for you. Not for 
                        some reputation, or some Christian 
                        standard or some fucking golf 
                        lessons. Something is going on with 
                        that family, and I want to know 
                        what.

           Ben lets this sink in. It’s the closest thing to affection 
           he’s ever received from her.

                                 BEN
                        Ok, then tell me what to do.

           Minnie stiffens.
                                 MINNIE
                        Grow a pair. And stick with me, 
                        kid.

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. BEN AND MARY’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER

           Ben sits alone in bed while Mary is in the bathroom.

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        She’s ruining the whole thing, Ben.

                                 BEN
                        I know.

           Mary exits the bathroom and climbs into bed. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        She did have a point though on the 
                        planner.

                                 MARY
                        What?

                                 BEN
                        It was a totally wrong one though.

           Mary looks at him, unsure what he’s thinking...

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        I just- She’ll be gone soon. We’ve 
                        only got like what? 20 days left?

                                 MARY
                        Twenty days and we don’t have a 
                        venue. Who knows what she’ll do to 
                        the florist. Or the caterer. What 
                        are we going to tell our guests if 
                        we have to push? My mother will 
                        flip.

           Ben holds a beat. We see it. Mary sees it. But we don’t say 
           anything. Ben has a guardian angel now.

           Mary rolls over and clicks off the light. 

           We slowly pull through the door to see:

           Minnie standing outside with her tea. She’s heard the whole 
           thing. 
           We keep our eyes on her. Unsure of exactly what she’s 
           thinking...she heads to bed.

           We prelap - KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK

                                                           CUT TO:

           EXT. MILLER HOUSEHOLD - THE NEXT DAY

           Minnie is the one doing the knocking. But to no answer. In 
           the driveway she takes in the Mustang, and shakes her head. 
           Next to it is another car which we don’t recognize...

           She KNOCKs again.

           Still no answer. Minnie cautiously turns the knob to find- 

           It’s unlocked?

           INT. MILLER HOUSEHOLD - CONTINUOUS

           Minnie pokes her head in.

                                 MINNIE
                        Hello?

           The house seems to be empty. Interesting...

           She takes in the place, being alone in the lion’s den... 
           noting the pictures on the wall- the expensive china in the 
           armoire an then-

           Dirty shoes? 

           A shirt on the bannister...?

           And then we hear it.

           The sound that could only be made from a bag of flesh 
           slamming against another bag of flesh...

           Minnie looks up the stairs...someone in this house be fuckin.

           She steps slowly, careful not to make a peep. 

           INT. MILLER HOUSEHOLD - UPSTAIRS

           Minnie finds herself atop the stairs. The sound having grown 
           louder with every step. She finds the source:
           A bedroom door. We hear groaning and VICIOUS POUNDING AND 
           MOANING as she makes her way to the door- 

           Placing her hand on the knob-

           Turning it-

           Pushing open the door to see:

           INT. MILLER HOUSEHOLD - BEDROOM

           GEORGE - TAKING IT FROM BEHIND FROM ANOTHER MAN!!

           Minnie: WHAT. THE. FUCK.

                                 MAN
                        Woah!

                                 GEORGE
                        MINNIE?!

           Minnie scoops her jaw from the floor to say-

                                 MINNIE
                        Get out.

           Man and George aren’t sure which she’s-

                                 MINNIE (CONT’D)
                        Pitcher. Out. Catcher you stay.

           The Man pulls up his golf slacks, pulling on his polo to 
           slither out the door.

           Leaving George. Minnie gestures for him to take a seat on te 
           bed while she stands in front of him. He’s naked and 
           vulnerable.

           She holds a beat. 

                                 GEORGE
                        I can explain.

                                 MINNIE
                        Shut your mouth.

           He does. She holds another beat.

                                 GEORGE
                        Please don’t tell Mary.

                                 MINNIE
                        Mary? What about your wife?
           George drops his head.

                                 GEORGE
                        You don’t know what I go through in 
                        this house.

                                 MINNIE
                        Apparently dick.
                           (then)
                        I’m going to ask you a few 
                        questions and you are going to be 
                        VERY honest with me. Is that clear?

                                 GEORGE
                        Yes ma’am.

                                 MINNIE
                        You’re broke.

                                 GEORGE
                        Yes.

                                 MINNIE
                        That wasn’t a question. Does Wanda 
                        know that?

                                 GEORGE
                        Sort of.

                                 MINNIE
                        Does she know Ben is paying for the 
                        wedding?

                                 GEORGE
                        No.

                                 MINNIE
                        But she knows about...this?

                                 GEORGE
                        Sort of.

                                 MINNIE
                        One more sort of and I’m going to 
                        seal your asshole shut with a 
                        burning fire poke.

                                 GEORGE
                        Wanda knows as much as she can 
                        discern. She’s never looked at a 
                        bill and well- she’s never seen me 
                        do anything. She just- brushes it 
                        all under the rug.
                                 MINNIE
                        Ok...?

           George rubs his forehead.

                                 GEORGE
                        But she’s not going to take it 
                        lightly when I ask her for a 
                        divorce.

                                 MINNIE
                           (realizing)
                        And you don’t want to lose half of 
                        nothing.

           Off his look, Minnie sets her jaw.

                                 MINNIE (CONT’D)
                        So you forced Ben to pay for the 
                        wedding.

                                 GEORGE
                        I’m sorry.

           Minnie tosses him a shirt, then moves to the door.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Please don’t tell anyone.

                                 MINNIE
                        I’m not going to. You are. 

           Minnie gives him a look then strides out.

           INT. MILLER HOUSEHOLD - FRONT HALLWAY

           Minnie comes down the stairs to see Hank has just arrived 
           home. He’s struggling with Jay who is going ballistic.

                                 HANK
                        You’re never like this!

           Minnie spots a toy in Hank’s bag. She pulls it out and hands 
           it to Jay who immediately calms down. And so does Hank.

                                 MINNIE
                        The key is distraction.

                                 HANK
                        I can’t do this.
                                 MINNIE
                        Parents make mistakes, Henry.
                           (thinking)
                        The sooner you realize that, the 
                        better off you’ll be.

           Minnie places a hand on his shoulder. Hank slightly recoils. 
           She smiles. Then he smiles. Minnie walks out.

           Hank looks down on his two pleasant and beautiful babies in 
           their car seats. Smiling.

           INT. RETIRED MINDS - BEN’S CUBICLE

           The once, dead office is in the process of being revamped. 
           Maintenance workers install brand new fluorescent lights, and 
           painters put the finishing touches on a fresh coat of dark 
           red paint-- 

           Another one rips the wax paper away to reveal a HUGE BRELLY 
           DECAL on the wall, just smiling away...right in our faces.

           Ben squeezes his LITTLE BLUE STRESS BALL, probably 
           fantasizing about ripping the decal right off as we hear-

           BLIP- BLIP- BLIP-

           Ben realizes that the blips are little chat rooms going off. 
           He types away as Alyssa wheels over on her desk chair.

                                 ALYSSA
                        I can’t take this anymore man.

                                 BEN
                        I know, but...I need this job. 

                                 ALYSSA
                        For what? 

                                 BEN
                        For the wedding.

                                 ALYSSA
                        I thought you said Minnie was 
                        paying for that?

           Ben squeezes his stress ball. They spot Second Hand Man 
           having just opened a cardboard box. 

           Revealing a big PLUSH BRELLY COSTUME. Holy shit.
           Alyssa and Ben both see it. Second Hand Man starts making his 
           way over to us.

                                 ALYSSA (CONT’D)
                        No fucking way, man.

           He arrives.

                                 SECOND HAND MAN
                        Hhhhey team.

           It’s literally just the three of them in this office, and the 
           maintenance workers. Then SHM spots something-

           Ben’s little stress ball. But he lets it slide.

                                 SECOND HAND MAN (CONT’D)
                        Cool mascot huh?
                           (nothing)
                        So as you know we’re a little short 
                        staffed at the moment and-

                                 ALYSSA
                        I’m not wearing that.

                                 SECOND HAND MAN
                        Oh yeah, no we wouldn’t ask the one- 
                        um-

           Alyssa raises her eyebrows.

                                 SECOND HAND MAN (CONT’D)
                        Ben. How would you like to step up? 
                        Take the initiative?!

           SHM checks the stress ball again, which Ben squeezes, HARD.

                                 SECOND HAND MAN (CONT’D)
                        Hey what’s that little thing you 
                        have-?

                                 BEN
                        I’m not wearing that.

                                 SECOND HAND MAN
                        Yikes. Looks like it’s a Retired 
                        Minds stress ball.

                                 BEN
                        You can’t even read the logo.

                                 SECOND HAND MAN
                        Then how did I know it was Retired 
                        Minds?
                                 BEN
                        It’s blue.

                                 SECOND HAND MAN
                        Why don’t I just grab it-

           SHM reaches for the ball. Ben pulls it back.

                                 BEN
                        No. It’s mine.

           A tense beat. SHM drops the costume.

                                 SECOND HAND MAN
                        Wear the mascot and you can keep 
                        it.

           A would-you-rather from hell.

                                 ALYSSA
                        Just give it to him, man.

                                 BEN
                           (gripping the ball)
                        I’m not wearing that.

           Ben doesn’t flinch. In fact...he narrows. As does SHM.

           SHM reaches for the ball. Ben pulls it back. SHM reaches 
           again- this time more aggressive. Ben grips down on it even 
           harder and it turns into a full-on wrestling match. 

           Two grown men in work attire fighting over a little foam ball 
           like two kindergartners fighting over the last twix bar.

           SHM gets the upper hand, pressing Ben’s face to the Brelly 
           mascot, ripping the ball away! SHM tosses it up in his hand, 
           with a smile on his face. 

                                 SECOND HAND MAN
                        Now you’re doing both.

           Ben wipes his face off then runs and spears him, freeing the 
           ball! 

           Ben scoops it up then takes a bite out of the ball, and spits 
           the chunk of foam into SHM’s face. Alyssa’s jaw ROCKETS 
           through the floor.

                                 BEN
                        I quit.
           Ben marches out. Alyssa takes a beat, rolls her jaw back up 
           and then follows him out.

                                 MINNIE
                        What did you just do?

                        Why in God’s name did you do that?!

                                 BEN
                        You told me to take control of my

                        It’s a pleasure to meet you. Right 
                        this way.

           INT. CATONESVILLE AND PIERCE - SHOW ROOM

           Leon leads us around a well-lit show room. Caskets are all 
           over the place and the entire back wall is GLASS. Through it, 
           we overlook the Chesapeake bay from a brick landing area. 

                                 LEON
                        And on the form it had the member 
                        listed as blank. Do you mind my 
                        asking who the casket will be for?
                                 MINNIE
                        It’ll be for me.

                                 LEON
                        I see. I’m sorry to hear that.

                                 MINNIE
                        Don’t be. It was my choice. Well, 
                        and his.

           Minnie looks to Ben - practically asking him to join in-

           Ben places a soft hand on Minnie’s shoulder.

                                 BEN
                        At a certain point you have to 
                        wonder- how many wet sheets is 
                        enough you know? 

           Leon laughs, trying to be in on the joke. But they’re 
           deadpan.

                                 MINNIE
                        Are there any caskets with trap 
                        doors?

                                 BEN
                        Great call.

                                 LEON
                        I’m sorry. I don’t understand.

                                 BEN
                        Well you know how you always see 
                        those documentaries about the 
                        scratch marks on the roof of the 
                        caskets? It’d be nice if there was 
                        a little trap door that would 
                        release some sort of toxin to knock 
                        her right back out.

                                 MINNIE
                        I’m very claustrophobic.

                                 LEON
                           (smiling)
                        Perhaps an axe could swing down.

           Ben and Minnie just stare at him.

                                 BEN
                        That’s really fucked up, man.
                                 LEON
                        How about you just wave me down if 
                        you have any questions.

           Leon walks off leaving Ben and Minnie to almost smile at one 
           another.

                                 BEN
                        Would you ever date someone else?

                                 MINNIE
                        Like who?

                                 BEN
                        I don’t know. He seems nice.

           Minnie looks to Leon who lifts his head from a computer to 
           smile.

                                 MINNIE
                           (digressing)
                        Why don’t you tell me why you quit.

                                 BEN
                        RM was bought out by a huge digital 
                        company. They wanted to turn all 
                        the salesmen into chatroom drones. 

                                 MINNIE
                        What’s a chatroom?

                                 BEN
                        Are you familiar with the internet?

                                 MINNIE
                        I taught you how to hold a spoon, 
                        you little shit.

                                 BEN
                        It felt great. And- yeah. 

           A beat. Minnie looks into him-

                                 MINNIE
                        I bet it did.

                                 BEN
                        I just have no idea what I’m gonna 
                        tell Mary.

           Minnie shifts her gaze out the window to a small terrace 
           overlooking the Chesapeake Bay.
                                 MINNIE
                        Let’s get some air.

           Minnie pushes through the glass door and we find ourselves-

           EXT. CATONESVILLE AND PIERCE - BACK TERRACE

           There’s a light breeze blowing across the bay. Ben and Minnie 
           chat on a brick terrace.

           They watch the passing boats. Minnie looks to him.

                                 BEN
                        Despite all this it’s actually been 
                        nice having someone on my side.
                           (Minnie smiles)
                        For once.
                           (it fades.)

                                 MINNIE
                        I’ve made a lot of mistakes, Ben.  

           Ben matches her eye contact - almost an apology. Ben doesn’t 
           quite budge. But he accepts it.

           If this were another movie they’d be holding hands. But it’s 
           not. And they aren’t. 

                                 MINNIE (CONT’D)
                        I was married before your 
                        grandfather, you know.

                                 BEN
                        What? To who?

                                 MINNIE
                        It’s whom.

                                 BEN
                        What?

                                 MINNIE
                        It’s whom not-

                                 BEN
                        Will you just speak please?

                                 MINNIE
                        His name was Joseph. We met in 
                        Boston. He was a young musician and 
                        we were always on the road. It was 
                        exactly what I thought I wanted.

                        Except one day I’m sitting on this 
                        beach in Bali, most beautiful place 
                        in the world, and Joe brings me a 
                        beer. In the years we’d been 
                        dating, he never noticed that I 
                        don’t drink beer. Because I’d 
                        buried that little fact along with 
                        dozens of other things we’d never 
                        talked about.

           Minnie and Ben share a look.

                                 BEN
                        So Mary and I have a few secrets.

                                 MINNIE
                        Ben.

                                 BEN
                        I love her. I don’t care what you 
                        say. Nothing you can ever do or say 
                        will convince me otherwise.

                                 MINNIE
                        When you marry someone you marry 
                        their family.

                                 BEN
                        I know that.

                                 MINNIE
                        That family is toxic.

                                 BEN
                        And mine is suicidal. 

                                 MINNIE
                        When you get married you have to be 
                        prepared to push everything aside 
                        and give everything you have to 
                        your partner. You have to put them 
                        above everything you’ve ever cared 
                        for. Even family. 

                                 BEN
                        I know that.

                                 MINNIE
                        Is that something you’re prepared 
                        to do?

           Off Ben’s look of uncertainty- 
                                 MINNIE (CONT’D)
                        I’m thinking of moving my 
                        appointment a couple days.

                                 BEN
                        Why?

                                 MINNIE
                        I’ve waited 10 years to see you 
                        again and now I have you and- well- 

                                 BEN
                        You don’t have to do this you know.

                                 MINNIE
                        My life is done, Ben. 
                           (a beat.)
                        Seeing you get married would be a 
                        nice little send off.

           Ben thinks it over and then-

                                 BEN
                        We don’t even have a venue.

           Minnie breaks eye contact.

                                 MINNIE
                        I could move some cash around.

           Ben and Minnie share a look as we-

           EXT. CROSSROAD VINEYARD - LATER

           Mary and Wanda exit the Mercedes to find Ben and Minnie 
           waiting in the parking lot. 

                                 WANDA
                        What are we doing here?

                                 MARY
                        Yeah, Ben I thought we agreed this 
                        place didn’t work?

                                 BEN
                        It didn’t. Buuuut - we booked it.

                                 MARY
                        Ben we can’t afford it.

                                 BEN
                        Yes we can.
                                 MARY
                        How?

                                 BEN
                        We just can.

                                 MARY
                        Did you stumble upon a bag of gold 
                        coins that I don’t know about?

                                 BEN
                        Will you just relax? We’re good. We 
                        got the venue! Same date and 
                        everything. But that’s not even the 
                        best part.

                                 MARY
                        Ben.

                                 BEN
                        Minnie is going to move her 
                        appointment and she’s going to 
                        come.

           Wanda laughs.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        We’ll put the flower wall over 
                        there- which we’ll book.

                                 MARY
                        Ben.

                                 BEN
                        We’ll have to make some set up 
                        adjustments but I figured-

                                 MARY
                        BEN!
                           (off his silence)
                        What are you doing?

                                 BEN
                        What? This is what you wanted.

                                 MARY
                        I do- but.

           A beat.

                                 MINNIE
                        But she doesn’t want it with me.

           Mary bites her tongue.
                                 BEN
                        What?

           A beat.

                                 MARY
                        You should have called me.

                                 BEN
                        Called you? This is- wait- this is 
                        about Minnie coming to the wedding?

                                 WANDA
                        She’s not coming to our wedding.

                                 MINNIE
                        What do you mean our wedding?

                                 WANDA
                        I mean our family’s wedding. So far 
                        as I’m concerned the dead are not 
                        part of anyone’s family.

                                 MINNIE
                        Tell that to your carpet.

                                 MARY
                        This is a big move, Ben.

                                 MINNIE
                        It’s ok. I’ll keep my appointment 
                        and you can have your-

                                 BEN
                        No. You’re coming. Mary. What the 
                        fuck?

                                 MARY
                        I’m done being pushed around by 
                        you, Ben. 

                                 BEN
                        YOU’RE being pushed around? I’m 
                        trying to get my grandmother at my 
                        wedding who BY THE WAY is PAYING 
                        FOR IT and-

                                 MARY
                        What?

           A beat. Ben thinks about it and makes the call-
                                 BEN
                        2 weeks ago your dad cornered me 
                        and told me if I couldn’t pay for 
                        the wedding then there wasn’t going 
                        to be one.

                                 MARY
                        Is that true, mom?

                                 WANDA
                        I don’t know anything about that.

                                 MINNIE
                        Maybe if you talked to your husband 
                        more, these problems wouldn’t come 
                        up.

                                 WANDA
                        Excuse me?

                                 MINNIE
                        Oh nothing. I just always knew you 
                        were a little anal, but apparently 
                        George is too.

           Wanda gasps.

                                 MARY
                        You told me you got a bonus.

                                 BEN
                        Yeah, well I quit.

                                 MARY
                        When?!

                                 BEN
                        Recently.

                                 MARY
                        I bet Minnie knew that though 
                        didn’t she?

                                 BEN
                        Oh I’m sorry am I not allowed to 
                        talk to my grandmother?

                                 MARY
                        You’re supposed to want to talk to 
                        me, asshole! Not your grandmother 
                        who IS TEARING YOUR WEDDING APART 
                        and driving a wedge in between us 
                        and my family.
                                 BEN
                        Your toxic family.

           A beat.

                                 MARY
                        What?

                                 BEN
                        I said your family is fucking 
                        TOXIC. I’m reeaallly sorry that 
                        you’ve felt a little pressure from 
                        my little old grandmother but guess 
                        what - I’ve been getting that shit 
                        for YEARS from your family and now 
                        you have a little taste- and that 
                        sucks but guess what? She’s coming 
                        to my wedding or there isn’t going 
                        to be one.

                                 MARY
                        You know what? Fine. Have a great 
                        time with your grandmother. I don’t 
                        give a shit. I am DONE being 
                        treated like this. 

           Mary walks off to the Mercedes, followed by Wanda.

           Mary hops in the Mercedes. Wanda follows.

           A car rolls up just as the Mercedes pulls out. Out steps:

                                 AMY
                        Sorry! I had to drop off some heels 
                        for Charity. Am I too late?

           Minnie and Ben take a silent beat.

                                 BEN
                        No. You’re right on time.

                                                           CUT TO:

           EXT. MILLER HOUSHOLD - ESTABLISHING - THAT NIGHT

           A household ready to explode.

           INT. MILLER HOUSEHOLD - DINING ROOM

           Mary, Hank, George and Wanda have a very silent dinner. Both 
           babies are cool as a cucumber, distracted by toys while Hank 
           spoons peas into their mouths simultaneously.
                                 HANK
                        So just so I’m clear...Is the 
                        wedding happening or not? 

                                 GEORGE
                        It’s 3 days away, Hank. 

                                 HANK
                        Damn, I was really looking forward 
                        to putting those little tuxes on 
                        the twins.

                                 GEORGE
                        We were all looking forward to 
                        that.

                                 WANDA
                        I’ll send out an email blast, to 
                        tell people to cancel their 
                        flights. Going to cost a fortune 
                        but...

                                 MARY
                        Ben said that you forced him into 
                        paying for the wedding. 

           George scans the room.

                                 GEORGE
                        It sounds like Ben found himself in 
                        a corner and tried to talk his way 
                        out of it.

           Wanda laughs. George checks it.

                                 WANDA
                        She knew, George.

                                 MARY
                        She knew what?

           A beat. 

                                 GEORGE
                        I told you we needed to talk.

                                 WANDA
                        And I told you to handle it.

                                 GEORGE
                        You didn’t know what IT was.
                                 WANDA
                        This is not dinner table 
                        discussion.

                                 MARY
                        What is going on?

                                 WANDA
                        Mary, eat your dinner.

                                 GEORGE
                        I’m having an affair.

                                 HANK/MARY
                        Woaahh. / Holy shit.

           Wanda is about to leap across the table.

                                 GEORGE
                        With Brandt.

                                 HANK
                        Brandt, the male Head Pro, Brandt? 

                                 MARY
                        Dad are you-

                                 WANDA
                        It doesn’t matter.

           George’s look says it all. He takes a deep breath and then 
           reluctantly let’s the words fall out of his mouth-

                                 GEORGE
                        I want a divorce, Wanda.

           Silence. 

                                 WANDA
                        Too bad.

           Another tense beat. Wanda isn’t really surprised. She’s been 
           pushing this day down the road for years.

                                 GEORGE
                        Yes, Mary. I forced Ben into paying 
                        for the wedding. Your mother and I 
                        are a little tight on cash right 
                        now.

                                 WANDA
                        Maybe we wouldn’t be if your father 
                        would sell that TACKY car in the 
                        driveway.
                                 GEORGE
                        That muscle car is a member of this 
                        family. 

                                 WANDA
                        No. It’s not.

           It all hits Mary. Shit.

                                 MARY
                        Ben was getting the money from 
                        Minnie because-
                           (realizing)
                        This family is toxic.

                                 WANDA
                        This family is fine. We’re going to 
                        move on, piece this together and 
                        everything will be fine.

                                 MARY
                        Stop, Mom.

                                 WANDA
                        Stop what?

                                 HANK
                        You’re freaking out.

                                 WANDA
                        I’m freaking out? Did I freak out 
                        when I found your father’s crusty 
                        golf pants? Or when Hank was thrown 
                        out of his own house? I’m the only 
                        one holding this family together.

                                 GEORGE
                        You’re a monster.

                                 WANDA
                        You’re a dick.

           A beat. And then Mary stands, marching out.

                                 WANDA (CONT’D)
                        Where are you going?

           Mary says nothing, she just continues out- leaving behind the 
           rubble of a once perfect family.

           EST. SUNNY ACRES NURSING HOME - ESTABLISHING

           Old folks drag themselves around from tennis to bingo.
           INT. SUNNY ACRES NURSING HOME - COMMON AREA - NEXT MORNING

           Residents are huddled around the Risk board. Ben is playing 
           while Minnie works on a puzzle, not too far away.

                                 DALE
                        I appreciate your concern, son but 
                        for now... I’m going to need you to 
                        get the hell off my island.

           Dale flicks Ben’s last remaining piece off the island of 
           Congo. 

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        Where shall I invade next? 

                                 BEN
                        Which side of that beach in 
                        Normandy did you say you were on?

           Ben stands and moves to another table where Minnie sits.

                                 MINNIE
                        He’s a moron. Don’t think anything 
                        of it.

                                 BEN
                        Yeah. Hey, I got you something. Was 
                        gonna wait until after but... well 
                        yeah-

           Ben disappears for a moment, then comes back to the table 
           with a box. It’s wrapped in a brown paper bag, but not in a 
           cool way... like a 6-year-old did it.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Not a whole lot of materials around 
                        here. 

           Minnie nods and opens it. 

           When she pulls away the tissue paper, we see that it’s a pink 
           and green silk scarf. She smiles to Ben. 

           Minnie reaches to the bottom and pulls out a card-

                                 MINNIE
                           (reading)
                        Certificate of authenticity. Used 
                        by Steven Tyler, August 8th, 1975 
                        at the Boston Garden. 

                                 BEN
                        This is not an admission of guilt.
           Minnie’s “I fucking knew it” look fades away into:

                                 MINNIE
                        Where did you find this?

                                 BEN
                        Put it on.

           She does. Ben smiles. Minnie smiles.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        You look great.

           Ben smiles. Minnie’s fades.

                                 MINNIE
                        I’m sorry about your wedding.

                                 BEN
                        I know. 
                           (a beat.)
                        But hey, at least you don’t have to 
                        kill yourself anymore.

           Ben cleans up the wrapping paper but Minnie looks dead at 
           him.

                                 MINNIE
                        I’m still going through with it, 
                        Ben.

                                 BEN
                        What do you mean?

                                 MINNIE
                        I’m still going through with the 
                        procedure.

                                 BEN
                        I thought you moved it?

                                 MINNIE
                        I would’ve, to make the wedding... 
                        which is no longer happening.

                                 BEN
                        I wonder why that is.

                                 MINNIE
                        How about you check your tone.

                                 BEN
                        You’re the reason the wedding isn’t 
                        happening!
                                 MINNIE
                        And I’d do it all over again.

           A beat.

                                 BEN
                        What did you just say?

                                 MINNIE
                        I said you’re welcome.

                                 BEN
                        You did this on purpose?

           People have started to notice the commotion.

                                 MINNIE
                        I did you a favor.

                                 BEN
                        By tearing my life apart weeks 
                        before my wedding?!

                                 MINNIE
                        What life? You had a shit job, with 
                        a worse relationship and a mountain 
                        of debt. But now look where you 
                        are. You’re exactly where you 
                        belong.

                                 BEN
                        Where? In a nursing home playing 
                        Risk?!

                                 DALE
                        Getting your ass kicked in Risk!

                                 BEN
                        SHUT UP, DALE.

                                 MINNIE
                        You weren’t ready for that life.

           A beat. As it all makes sense to Ben.

                                 BEN
                        You’re not ready.

           Minnie thinks about responding but-

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        You just wanted to take me down a 
                        peg on your way out.
                                 MINNIE
                        Everything I do, I do for you!

                                 BEN
                        You mean like killing yourself?

           We sit in this tense moment. Two rocks, petrified by years of 
           turmoil, stuck between each other... Unable to speak the 
           truth.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        You don’t care about me. You don’t 
                        care about Mary, or the wedding, or 
                        my job. You’re just an old woman 
                        who destroyed my life because you 
                        don’t have one.

           A beat. Minnie narrows in to make sure he hears every goddamn 
           word of what she’s about to say.

                                 MINNIE
                        I didn’t make you quit your job. I 
                        didn’t make you lie to your fiancee 
                        and I certainly didn’t make you 
                        call off the wedding. I told you to 
                        be ready to push everything aside 
                        for her and you weren’t. You 
                        couldn’t even push me aside. 
                           (a beat.)
                        I didn’t destroy your life. You 
                        did. 

           Ben strides to a nearby table to grab a blank pad of paper. 

                                 MINNIE (CONT’D)
                        You need me.

           Ben scribbles something on the bottom and then slides it 
           over.

                                 BEN
                        I don’t need you. I never did.

           We see the pad- a blank page with his signature on the 
           bottom. A literal death stroke. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Stay out of my fucking life.

           Ben marches out.

           We’re left with Minnie who’s left looking at the signature, 
           then up to see the door swing behind Ben.
           EXT. SUNNY ACRES NURSING HOME / INT. BEN’S PRIUS

           Ben gives his robe to a passing Old Timer then jumps into the 
           Prius.

           He takes a moment, knowing exactly where he needs to go 
           before starting the car.

           EXT. SUNNY ACRES NURSING HOME - DRIVEWAY

           Ben speeds out the driveway before seeing an approaching 
           WHITE MERCEDES. 

           As the cars pass one another we see the driver is-

                                 BEN
                        Mary?

           Ben slams on the brakes. Mary slams on the brakes. They both 
           hop out of their cars. Taking a moment to look at one 
           another.

                                 MARY
                        Where are you going?

                                 BEN
                        Where are you going?

                                 MARY
                        I was going to collect my husband.

           A beat.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        I was losing you, Ben. Every day I 
                        lost a little bit of you. Until you 
                        were gone. And I was alone.
                           (a beat.)
                        But I didn’t realize that, for a 
                        long time you’ve been alone. I 
                        should have been in it with you and 
                        I’m sorry.

                                 BEN
                        I’m sorry too. For- yeah, you know.

           They walk towards each other and embrace.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        And I promise to never, ever lie to 
                        you again. I love you, Mary.
                                 MARY
                        I love you.

           They kiss.

                                 BEN
                        And I want to marry you. 

                                 MARY
                        I want to marry you.

                                 BEN
                        On Thursday. Just like we wanted.

                                 MARY
                        Ben, we don’t have a caterer. We 
                        don’t have a florist. And we don’t 
                        have money to pay them.

                                 BEN
                        Did we tell people to cancel their 
                        flights yet?

                                 MARY
                           (realizing)
                        And we have 85 people on their way 
                        expecting a wedding.

                                 BEN
                        Then we’ll make it work. We have a 
                        venue, right?

                                 MARY
                        Yeah...

           Ben shrugs. Mary holds for a beat and then smiles. He matches 
           it and we see them truly communicating for the first time. 
           They kiss and-

           We’re swept away in a quick montage, cutting between Ben and 
           Minnie’s new/old life:

              INT. SUNNY ACRES NURSING HOME - MINNIES’ ROOM - DAY

           Minnie takes a picture off the wall of a YOUNG BEN and 
           Francis, packing it into a box with a POTTED PLANT--

           Minnie spots a phone.
              INT. SEASON’S BLOOM FLOWER SHOP - DAY

           Ben and Mary admire a small flower arrangement. Ben pulls out 
           his cell- no missed calls. No messages.

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        What do you think?

           Ben shakes it off, returning to flower shopping.

                                 BEN
                        How much are they?

                                 FLORIST
                        We could pull this together for you 
                        for--- 800?

           Ben and Mary share a look.

                                 MARY
                        We could sell the couch?

           Ben laughs. As does Mary. Ben turns to the Florist.

                                 BEN
                        We’ll need them by Thursday.

           The florist nods, scurrying off. Ben gives an upper-lip 
           smile. Mary takes note.

              EXT. SUNNY ACRES NURSING HOME - QUAD

           Minnie sits alone at the same picnic table from earlier, 
           admiring the flower bed.

           She looks over to see a COUPLE visiting another RESIDENT to 
           show off their newborn baby. It’s a sweet moment, but Minnie 
           looks away.

              INT. DIANE'S CATERING - TASTING KITCHEN

           Ben and Mary try various soups in a tasting kitchen. Mary 
           sips one then hands it over to Ben who smiles.

                                 BEN
                        The TV?
              INT. SUNNY ACRES NURSING HOME - COMMON AREA

           Minnie looks at her sad excuse for a meal. Stiff meatloaf and 
           watery mashed potatoes. She pushes them away, then stands to 
           leave the room.

              INT. BEN AND MARY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Mary writes out place cards for each guest while Ben reads 
           names from a list - As they write out a place card, he 
           crosses off a name.

                                 BEN
                        Harry and Jenny Keller. 

           Mary scripts it out on a card then-

                                 MARY
                        Ok, next?

           Ben looks down to the guest list to see- “Minnie Becker.”

           Ben hovers over the name. Mary looks on... because she likely 
           put her name on the list.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        You could at least call her.

                                 BEN
                        You don’t get it.

                                 MARY
                        I don’t get parental figures 
                        treating you like shit?

           Ben almost chuckles.

                                 BEN
                        She tore my entire life apart then 
                        tried to tell me she did it for my 
                        own good.

           A beat.

                                 MARY
                        Did she?

                                 BEN
                        I don’t need someone telling me 
                        what I need. I need you. And I have 
                        you. And I’m going to marry you 
                        tomorrow. I’ve made peace with 
                        everything else.
           Ben crosses her name off the list and then stands where we 
           see that the walls are devoid of whatever artwork or decor 
           they previously had. The sofas are gone. The coffee tables 
           are gone. Everything is gone.

           Mary stands too.

                                 MARY
                        And everything you haven’t, we’ve 
                        already sold.

           They laugh and then hug, arched over the hand-written place 
           cards. 

              INT. SUNNY ACRES NURSING HOME - MINNIE’S ROOM

           Minnie puts the final touches on her letter to feed into 
           Ben’s signature. She admires the letter for a moment, before 
           signing her name right next to his.

           Minnie flicks off the lights to her boxed up, packed away 
           room, walking out with the pink and blue scarf coiffed around 
           her neck. 

           EXT. CROSSROAD VINEYARD - DAY OF THE WEDDING

           We’re brought back to regular speed the black classic 1968 
           Ford Mustang pulls up the dirt driveway past signs that read 
           “Ceremony of Mr. and Mrs. Ben Becker.”

           Amy opens the door as we see it’s carrying:

           George (smiling) and Wanda (her normal pissed).

                                 AMY
                        Hello, Beckers.

           They step out.

                                 GEORGE
                        Amy do you know if Brandt has 
                        arrived yet?

                                 WANDA
                        Your mister is not coming to this 
                        ceremony.

                                 GEORGE
                        I have a plus one.

                                 WANDA
                        I’m your plus one.
                                 GEORGE
                        Sign the papers I’ll tell him not 
                        to come.

           Wanda disgruntled, looks over to see an ICE SCULPTURE.

                                 WANDA
                        Who is Lauren?!

           The ice sculpture reads “HAPPY BRITHDAY, LAUREN.” 

                                 AMY
                        Oh we got a great deal on that... 
                        because of the typo.

           Wanda emotionally vomits then marches off. Amy follows.

           George hands his keys over to the VALET who just witnessed 
           the whole thing.

           George hands the Valet his keys.

                                 GEORGE
                        I see one scratch on this car and I 
                        will mount you to the hood of it. 
                        Comprende?

           Valet nods. George looks through his pockets for-

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Little tight on cash at the moment 
                        but I’ll tell ya what. You take 
                        good care of this car, I’ll slip 
                        you a cupcake from the buffet. 

           George walks off leaving a disappointed Valet.

           INT. CROSSROADS VINEYARD - VINEYARD OVERLOOK

           Guests take their seats in the white fold out chairs. The 
           dirt aisle is dusted with scant rose petals leading to the 
           makeshift altar which could easily be confused with a wood 
           shipping slat. Because it is a wood shipping slat. 

           It’s a pretty decent effort...all things considered. 

           Atop the altar Ben stands with Hank (with the twins strapped 
           on), Alyssa (also wearing a tux) and-

           Father Johnson, Bible in hand.
                                 HANK
                        I thought you banished us to hell 
                        or something?

                                 FATHER JOHNSON
                        I’m here as a favor to your mother.

                                 BEN
                        We really appreciate it, Father.

                                 ALYSSA
                        Hey, where’s your grandmomma?

           A beat.

                                 BEN
                        She’s not coming.

                                 FATHER JOHNSON
                        Thank the heavens.

           Ben shakes it off... clearly not a joke he’s ok with yet. 

           Amy cues a MAN sitting off to the side, who hits play on an 
           iPhone.

           Music hums through a few bluetooth speakers, cuing our semi-
           confused guests to stand. But we hold on Ben... who is caught 
           somewhere else completely.

           We hold on him a beat as-

           Wanda enters through the doors, inching her way up the aisle. 
           You can practically see her smile falling apart at the seams.

           Then the music shifts, and from the shining, heavenly 
           doorway, appears: Mary. 

           And holy bejesus she looks amazing.

           She makes her way up the aisle and they can barely take their 
           eyes off one another.

           Ben and Mary stand opposite on the aisle. Exactly where they 
           always wanted to be.

                                 BEN
                        You look beautiful.

                                 MARY
                        You too.

           They smile. But for Ben... something still just isn’t right.
                                 FATHER JOHNSON
                        Please be seated.

           The guests do as they’re told.

           George is joined by Brandt who has just arrived. Wanda spots 
           it, rolling her eyes and setting her jaw.

                                 FATHER JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        We are gathered here today to 
                        celebrate love. Love- as it is 
                        found not only between Ben and 
                        Mary. But love that is exemplified 
                        by the presence of their friends 
                        and family here today.

           Ben furrows his brow. He looks to the crowd- we know exactly 
           what he’s looking for... but she’s not there.

                                 MARY
                        Ben.

           Ben looks back. There’s something wrong. Of course...

           Mary knows. She rubs his hand.

                                 WANDA
                        Could you continue this after the 
                        ceremony??

                                 BEN
                           (holding up a finger)
                        Can we just-

           FJ stops. Everyone freezes. Shock. Ben looks to Mary.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        You’re the most important thing to 
                        me, Mary. And I choose you every 
                        day for the rest of my life. But 
                        right now-

                                 MARY
                        I know.

           A smile.

           And one from Ben. Before he steps off the altar to exchanged 
           wows and hushed conversation.

                                 WANDA
                        Where the hell are you going?
                                 BEN
                        I’m going to get Minnie.

                                 WANDA
                        Like hell you are! She made her 
                        choice. And you’ve made yours. And 
                        you cannot just leave her up there-

                                 MARY
                        I’m going with you.

           Mary steps down. More commotion.

                                 WANDA
                        Mary.

                                 MARY
                           (off Ben’s look)
                        I’m choosing you too.

           Wanda looks around, feeling the eyeballs narrowing in on her 
           like a pack of pretentious pearl-donned wolves. She lowers 
           her voice.

                                 WANDA
                        Both of you get back on that altar.

           Wanda grabs Mary’s arm.

                                 MARY
                        No.

                                 WANDA
                        Mary, get the FUCK BACK ON THAT 
                        ALTAR BEFORE YOU FLUSH YOUR LIFE 
                        DOWN THE DRAIN!

           Jaws. On. Floors. Mary rips her arm away and almost laughs. 
           Realizing this has nothing to do with her.

                                 GEORGE
                        See what I’m dealing with?

                                 WANDA
                        You shut your fucking mouth, 
                        George!

           Mary takes a moment to register her shock and disgust. 

                                 MARY
                        You wanna know why we’re going?
                           (off her silence.)
                        Because everything she did, was for 
                        him.
           Mary marches off, grabbing Ben by the hand as they hurry out.

                                 BEN (O.S.)
                        We’ll be right back!

           But we’re left on Wanda. As she looks around to see:

           Guests looking at her shamefully. George canoodling with 
           Brandt. Hank, the single father, comforting his twins. And it 
           all comes crashing down on her.

           Father Johnson looks at Wanda with sheer disappointment. He 
           steps down from the altar, closes his Bible and exits.

           We pull away to see Wanda- atop the altar. Alone. Surrounded 
           by the remnants of her perfect life.

           EXT. CROSSROAD VINEYARD - VALET STAND

           Ben and Mary rush frantically from the vineyard house. 

                                 BEN
                        Did you drive here?

                                 MARY
                        I ubered.

                                 BEN
                        Shhhit me too.

           They spot the Valet.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        We need a car.

                                 VALET
                        Ticket stub?

                                 BEN
                        We don’t have one. We’re the bride 
                        and groom we’ll be right back if 
                        you’ll just-

                                 VALET
                        I can’t just give you a car.

                                 BEN
                        Dude. Please just help m-

                                 MARY
                        Do we look like people you want to 
                        fuck with right now? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARY (CONT'D)
                        I’m in a wedding gown outside of a 
                        wedding in the middle of August. So 
                        I’m going to stick out my hand and 
                        if there aren’t keys in it in 10 
                        seconds I’m going to rip your 
                        fucking head off. ONE-TWO-

           Clink.

           Mary relaxes. Ben looks shocked.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Problem?

                                 BEN
                        Nope.

           Mary clicks the keys and -- blip blip-

           The Mustang’s lights fire up. It’s parked right up front 
           looking beautiful, muscular and now...unlocked.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Party.

           WE CUT BACK AND FORTH:

           EXT. CROSSROAD VINEYARD - DRIVEWAY

           Ben and Mary  speed out the dirt driveway in the Mustang. 

           ANGLE ON: the Valet.

                                 VALET
                        Fuck this job.

           Valet unbuttons his vest and follows the Mustang out the 
           driveway.

           EXT. DOCTOR BLACK MEDICAL OFFICES - PARKING LOT

           Minnie’s yellow cab arrives out front of the office from 
           earlier.

           She steps out, taking a final glimpses around, before walking 
           to the lifeless building.

           INT. MUSTANG - SPEEDING - SAME TIME

           Ben and Mary fly down the highway.
                                 MARY
                        What if we don’t make it?

                                 BEN
                        We will. We have to. She tore my 
                        whole life apart just to teach me a 
                        lesson... and I just spat in her 
                        face.

                                 MARY
                        We’re going to make it, Ben.

           They lock eyes. Mary smiles. Ben smiles. Mary checks her 
           phone.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Exit 85.

           Ben kicks it into another gear as they go OFF ROAD to pass a 
           couple trucks, barely swerving back onto the highway to dodge 
           a sign reading:

           “Welcome to Washington, D.C.”

           INT. DOCTOR BLACK MEDICAL OFFICES - WAITING ROOM

           Minnie sits quietly in the beige waiting room, looking around 
           to see all the other somber OLD FACES, weathered by their 
           years of misfortune. She shares a look with an OLDER MAN. 
           Then a nod.

           A NURSE appears from an open door-

                                 NURSE
                        Minnie Becker?

           Minnie pops back into her body, then stands up to follow the 
           nurse.

           INT. MUSTANG - SPEEDING - SAME TIME

           They fly by an exit sign reading “EXIT 85”

                                 BEN (V.O.)
                        SHIT!

           The Mustang screeches to a halt ON THE HIGHWAY then flies 
           into reverse before course correcting to make the exit.
           INT. DOCTOR BLACK MEDICAL OFFICES - EXAM ROOM

           Minnie is seated on the same exam bed as Doctor Black wheels 
           up from out of frame. He gives a bittersweet smile. 

                                 DOCTOR BLACK
                        Hey where’s that grandson of yours 
                        today?

                                 MINNIE
                        Getting married.

           Doctor Black nods then places a calm hand on her arm before 
           picking up his needle. 

                                 DOCTOR BLACK
                        You can relax.

           She tries to. But as we look deep into her eyes we wonder if 
           she really knows what she’s doing.

           EXT. DOCTOR BLACK MEDICAL OFFICES - SAME TIME

           Ben and Mary screech up front. He slams the car in park and 
           they rush out of the Mustang- Ben being careful to lend a 
           hand to Mary as they disappear into the building.

           INT. DOCTOR BLACK MEDICAL OFFICES - EXAM ROOM - SAME TIME

           Black places the needle into the IV receptor.

           Minnie closes her eyes and-

                                 BEN (O.S.)
                        Stop!!

           ON BEN:

           As he and Mary burst through the door!

           Doctor Black turns to reveal the PATIENT...is not Minnie.

                                 DOCTOR BLACK
                        Oh hey fella!

                                 BEN
                        Where is she?

                                 DOCTOR BLACK
                        Who?
           Off the Patient’s blank face, Ben takes a deep breath. 
           Shaking his head, refusing to believe what he knows to be 
           true.

           She’s gone.

                                 MARY
                        Ben. I’m- I’m sorry.

                                 DOCTOR BLACK
                        Oh wait I remember you. It’s um-

                                 MINNIE (O.S.)
                        Ben?

           Ben turns to see- Minnie. Holy shit. She’s standing there in 
           the door. Ben is shocked... but smiles.

                                 BEN
                        Are you-? Why are you over-?

                                 MINNIE
                        I just needed a moment.
                           (to Black)
                        I’m ready now, Doctor.

           Minnie strides back in.

                                 BEN
                        Wait a second!

           She does. A few patients pop their heads over the divider 
           from the waiting room to listen. Ben catches his breath.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        I just left my wedding to be here. 
                        And I have something to say to you. 
                        At least. I think I do. I know I do 
                        but- I don’t know exactly how to 
                        say it. I wasn’t really prepared 
                        for this.

                                 MINNIE
                           (rolling up a sleeve)
                        Why don’t you come back in 10 
                        minutes.

                                 BEN
                        My entire life I’ve hated you. I 
                        hated you when you took me in. I 
                        hated you from the moment I met 
                        you. Which I don’t even remember- 
                        but I know I hated you. 
                                 MINNIE
                        Yes you’ve made that clear.

                                 BEN
                        And then you showed up and you 
                        ripped my whole life apart. And I 
                        hated you even more. And then you 
                        told me about your last marriage... 
                        and how much you missed your 
                        husband...and how you waited 10 
                        years to see me and-

           Minnie is damn well listening now. As are some of the 
           onlooking patients, who are likely in the same boat. All 
           ready to leave relatives and loved ones behind.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        It all hit me. As I was standing on 
                        the altar, with the woman I loved, 
                        and all I could think about was 
                        what a huge mistake I made. Not in 
                        who I was marrying. But in who we 
                        were sharing it with. Because I 
                        realized that- all I wanted to tel 
                        you is- 

           Minnie and Ben narrow in on one another.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        how thankful I am to have you. And 
                        how how lucky I feel to have been 
                        raised, and destroyed by you in the 
                        same lifetime. 

           A bittersweet chuckle. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        But above all that I want to tell 
                        you, how much I’ll miss you... if 
                        you go through with this. 

           A beat.

                                 MINNIE
                        But you said it yourself...You 
                        don’t need me.

           Ben musters the words when-

                                 MARY
                        We’re your family. 

           We angle on Mary- standing right there in her wedding gown, 
           on her wedding day-
                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        And you don’t just let family go. I 
                        need my family. I need you.

           Mary grips Ben’s hand. They smile at one another.

                                 BEN
                        We both do.

           Exchanged looks of sweetness amongst the patients. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        And I-
                           (a beat.)
                        I love you.

           A tear rolls down Minnie’s face. But she wipes it away, and 
           shakes her head-

                                 MINNIE
                        I just- I don’t think-

           Ben rushes over to her, snuffing out her rebuttal in embrace. 
           Minnie hesitates for a moment, and then-

           Her bag hits the floor. And her arms wrap around him too.

           They hold eachother. For the first time in a long time... 
           possibly ever.

                                 MINNIE (CONT’D)
                        I love you too.

           They release. Minnie looks to Mary.

           Minnie hugs Mary. Wedding dress and all.

           Minnie, Ben and Mary walk out, together.

           The patients in the waiting room each share a look. Before 
           one-by-one they each file out. Doctor Black watches them go-

           The patient in the chair rips the IV out of her arm, then 
           stands and follows suit.

           Doctor Black...smiles as we.

           CUT TO BLACK

           But, Over credits, we find ourselves...
           EXT. CROSSROADS VINEYARD - OVERLOOK / RECEPTION

           The chairs have been spread out across the dirt around fold 
           out tables with white table cloths. In the background a BAND 
           sets up atop a stage by the dance floor.

           We settle in with Wanda, George, Brandt, Hank and the twins 
           all seated at one table. Wanda isn’t hungry.

                                 BRANDT
                        Good to see you, Wanda. 

           Wanda looks to him... ready to destroy.

                                 WANDA
                        Ever had a 9iron shoved up your 
                        ass, Brandt?

                                 BRANDT
                        ...yes.

           Wanda juts her jaw... and then laughs. The rest of the family 
           slowly joins in.

           ANGLE ON:

           Mary and Ben are doing the obligatory wedding rounds, saying 
           hello to guests when Minnie sidles up next to them.

                                 BEN
                        Having fun?

                                 MINNIE
                        Could be worse.

           Minnie smiles then pulls out an envelope from her purse, 
           handing it over to Mary.

                                 MINNIE (CONT’D)
                        I got you a little wedding gift. I 
                        didn’t have much time so-

                                 MARY
                        You really didn’t have to-
                           (opening it)
                        Oh my God.

           Mary has flipped the envelope open to reveal:

           A check for $560,000 - made out to Ben and Mary Becker.

                                 BEN
                        Wait. Were you just gonna not give 
                        this to me?
                                 MINNIE
                        Is that what you’re focused on?

                                 BEN
                        Where did this come from?

                                 MINNIE
                        From the life insurance policy on 
                        your grandfather. I think he’d want 
                        you to have it. 

                                 BEN
                        He was like 90 when he died. Who 
                        would authorize such a large policy 
                        for such an old guy?

                                 MINNIE
                        Some company with a talking 
                        umbrella.

           They share a smile, then we hear the strumming of a guitar. 
           The opening of which is more distinct than any riff in the 
           history of mankind... Ben and Mareh share a look.

                                 MARY
                        Did we hire a band?

                                 MINNIE
                        Well that’s part 2 of my gift.

           They turn to the stage to see motherfucking Aerosmith.

                                 STEVEN TYLER
                        Every time, I look in the mirror/ 
                        All these lines in my face gettin’ 
                        clearer.. Etc.

                                 MINNIE
                        I was married to the guitarist.

           JOE PERRY looks over to Minnie and smiles. 

                                 BEN
                        Joe, from Boston was Joe-fucking-
                        Perry? 

           Ben and Mary head to the dance floor. Minnie watches them and 
           smiles. Then we hear a voice.

                                 LEON (O.S.)
                        Thanks for the last minute invite.

           Minnie turns to Leon. He smiles. She smiles. We smiles.
