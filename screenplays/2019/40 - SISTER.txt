           EXT. SANTA MONICA BEACH - DAY

           On a beautiful, sticky summer day in Los Angeles. 

           DELILAH WILDE, 58, black, dances her way into our sunny 
           frame. Sand caked around her ankles. A straw hat of epic 
           portions. Her bombtastic dance moves suggest two things: 
           she’s having the time of her life and she’s an unapologetic 
           child of the 70s. We watch her, peaceful and sweet. Until -- 

           Her adult child but forever “her baby,” TEMPLE WILDE, 26, 
           careens into frame to steal Delilah’s spotlight. Temple’s a 
           child of emo, metal and rap so she’s more dougie than 
           Delilah’s disco-favorite, the “four corners.” 

           Delilah HALTS at the intrusion, affronted. 

                                 DELILAH
                        I didn’t request back-up and 
                        certainly not from you with... 
                        whatever that is, Miss Thing. 
                        What’s this?

           She reenacts one of Temple’s moves. Temple scoffs. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        It’s not that. It’s this --
                             (does it correctly)

                                 DELILAH
                        Oh, okay. I get it. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        I shut the club down with that. 

                                 DELILAH
                        Don’t hurt nobody, now. 

           Temple teaches Delilah step-by-step. Complete and unfettered 
           joy as they fall in-line with each other, Wilde-style.  

           SOUND: An INCOMING CALL on Delilah’s phone cuts the music.  

                                 DELILAH (CONT’D)
                        Bring back my tunes! 

                                 TEMPLE
                        No one says “my tunes.” 

           Temple reaches to dig Delilah’s phone out of a pile of their 
           beach stuff. Hesitates to see -- ON THE SCREEN: AC CALLING. 
           Delilah’s screensaver is a picture of her with a CHILD-AGED 
           TEMPLE and Temple’s older sister, ANNA-CHLOE “AC” CLAY (a 
           TEEN in the photo). They’re kissing Temple on each cheek. 

           The pictures stirs a visceral reaction in Temple. Delilah, 
           noticing the shift in mood, lands to investigate. She sighs. 

                                 TEMPLE (CONT’D)
                        Why is she calling? She knows 
                        you’re visiting me. Doesn’t she get 
                        to see you like every day when 
                        you’re at home?  

                                 DELILAH
                        She knows I miss the babies... 
                        Tarzan probably had a game today. 

           Temple DECLINES the call. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Well, she can save her recap for 
                        later. You leave tomorrow so I 
                        demand all of your attention for 
                        the rest of the day. Do we swim? 

                                 DELILAH
                        We swim. 

           Temple pulls her hair into a messy bun. Delilah watches her, 
           her mind still obviously on AC. 

                                 DELILAH (CONT’D)
                        I wish you’d talk to her, Temp. You 
                        only have one sister. I ain’t 
                        having another one anytime soon. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        It’s been ten years, Momma. She 
                        doesn’t wanna talk to me either. 

                                 DELILAH
                        I know how complicated sisters are, 
                        that’s the only reason I haven’t 
                        pushed this thing with y’all. I 
                        coulda cleaned Cherry’s clock a 
                        time or two but that’s my sister 
                        and I love her. Now, y’all gotta 
                        figure out whatever happened 
                        between the two of you yourselves, 
                        but I believe that when someone 
                        loves you -- really loves you -- 
                        they deserve a second chance. 
                             (then)
                        It’s family and you can’t be a part 
                        of any family if you can’t forgive. 
                                 TEMPLE
                        She doesn’t like who I am. 

           Delilah frowns at that, unsure what it means. 

                                 DELILAH
                        She loves you. Isn’t that enough? 

           That seems to land on Temple as she takes a moment to 
           decide. Eventually, with resolve, she slips her swim-cap on.

                                 TEMPLE
                        No. It’s not enough. Now, can we 
                        please talk about something else?  

                                 DELILAH
                        Fine, that’s all my peaching. I’m 
                        on vacation anyway -- just don’t 
                        say I never taught you nothing. 

           Temple cracks a smile. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        I’ll say you taught me how to 
                        dance. 

                                 DELILAH
                        You’ll do no such thing! 

           Delilah reaches out to tickle her but Temple’s quick with it 
           and takes off toward the water. 

                                 TEMPLE (PRE-LAP)
                        If we hurry and change, we can 
                        catch Roxane Gay at the Last 
                        Bookstore tonight. 

                                 DELILAH (PRE-LAP)
                             (deadpan)
                        That sounds fun... 

           INT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - TEMPLE’S LOFT - NIGHT

           An industrial loft in the heart of urban decay. Street-noise 
           and sunlight-bright billboards keep the rent down.  

           Temple and Delilah haul their beach gear inside. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Then after, Sugarfish? 
                             (calling out)
                        Hey Wyatt, you wanna come? 

           WYATT, 27, Temple’s fabulous and warm roommate, rounds the 
           corner in a cuffed collared shirt that looks odd on him, 
           given the assortment of face piercings and tattoos.  

                                 WYATT
                        That sounds delightful. 

           Delilah blinks at them as she sets her stuff down, at her 
           wit’s end with their performative innocence. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        What do you say, Momma? 

                                 DELILAH
                        Will you two cut the bull? I look 
                        like I was born yesterday? 

           Wyatt and Temple share an alarmed look. 

                                 DELILAH (CONT’D)
                        It’s my last night in LA and I 
                        wanna have fun! I know what y’all 
                        would be doing on a Saturday night 
                        if I wasn’t here. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Um, going to see Roxane Gay at the 
                        Last Bookstore obviously. 

                                 DELILAH
                        Oh please. 

                                 WYATT
                        What -- you think cause we’re 
                        millennials, we’re heathens? 

           Delilah smirks, so you wanna play hardball? She crosses to a 
           junk drawer, pulls out a MEDICAL MARIJUANA BOTTLE. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Wyatt! I told you hide that. 

                                 WYATT
                        I... I have a prescription for 
                        that. I’m an anxious boy! 
                             (then, giving up)
                        She’s onto us. Let’s go to 
                        Precinct. 

           Temple glares.

                                 DELILAH
                        Oh! What’s that? 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Just a bar. A lame one. 
                                 DELILAH
                        Tomorrow I’ll be back at my boring 
                        warehouse job in boring Augusta 
                        working like a runaway slave. Show 
                        the old lady a good time!  

           Wyatt and Temple share a shrug, turn up then? 

                                 WYATT
                        Real talk though, I think the at-
                        home slaves work just as hard as 
                        runaways, wouldn’t you say?

           SOUND UP: Something lit, like Kodak Black’s “Transportin’”

           INT. TEMPLE’S LOFT - LATER

           Temple and Wyatt rap the lyrics together in a cypher. 

                                 WYATT 
                        Pockets so fat call me, Orbit --  

                                 TEMPLE/WYATT
                        Norbit! 

           QUICK, FUN CUTS OF Temple, Delilah, Wyatt -- 

           -Sprawled out on the floor -- couch -- table -- 

           -Dancing in the living room. 

           -Passing the vape. 

           A hilarious stavia-induced frenzy. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER 

           Delilah watches, RAPT, as Temple carves an APPLE-PIPE. Wyatt 
           dances with his shirt tied around his head in the b.g.  

                                 TEMPLE
                        You only wanna go about halfway 
                        through the apple to keep the 
                        chamber air-tight. Here. 

           Delilah takes a hit. Her eyes glaze over. 

                                 DELILAH
                        Ooooooo... 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Nice, right? Defcon-five blunt. 

           SOUND: Temple’s phone RINGS with an INCOMING CALL FROM NIA. 
           As Delilah tests out the blunt, Temple discreetly DECLINES. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER 

           Temple, Wyatt and Delilah lay sprawled on their backs, 
           feeling fuzzy and perfect. 

                                 DELILAH
                        Only other time I smoked pot, it 
                        was ‘89. I was still married to 
                        Anna-Chloe’s Dad. 

                                 WYATT
                        That’s your sister, right? 

           Temple, visibly tenser at the mention of AC, only nods. 

                                 DELILAH
                        He was a stick-in-the-mud. Took one 
                        puff, got mad and told me I was 
                        turning into a pothead. 

                                 WYATT
                        Buzzkill. 

                                 DELILAH
                        That’s why I tell my girls to find 
                        a man that makes them happy. AC did 
                        alright. Just Temple left. 

           She beams with pride, stroking Temple’s hair. Temple ignores 
           Wyatt’s questioning frown. He opens his mouth, but Temple 
           interjects with a truly terrifying glare. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - EVEN LATER 

           Wyatt snores on Temple’s shoulder, his shirt now a blanket. 
           Delilah peruses Temple’s records. Gasps at JACKIE WILSON. 

                                 DELILAH (CONT’D)
                        I’m tryna figure out what you know 
                        about all this grown music! 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Thanks for inventing the Isley 
                        Brothers. That was dope of you. 

           Delilah happily throws the record on. 

           SOUND UP: Merge the generations as Kodak fades to Jackie’s 
           “Higher & Higher.” 

           SOUND: Temple’s phone DINGS with a TEXT FROM NIA: Hey, tried 
           to call. Does your Mom leave in the AM? 
           Temple types out a quick reply: Sorry, babe, everyone fell 
           asleep. Will call in the morning if there’s time. 

           Guilt doesn’t stop her from sending it. 

           INT. TEMPLE’S BEDROOM - DAY

           We find Delilah up bright and early. 

           QUICK CUTS of her affectionally straightening Temple’s 
           things, making her bed -- 

           INT. TEMPLE’S LOFT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Temple tosses and turns on the couch. 

           Delilah kisses her forehead. Passes for the coffeemaker. 

                                 DELILAH
                        They say insomnia’s a side effect 
                        of unresolved issues. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Is that what they say at 7AM? 

           Delilah cracks a smile as she starts a pot. 

           SOUND: KNOCK AT THE DOOR 

           Temple frowns. 

                                 DELILAH
                        Who’s that this early? 

           Temple finds her phone. ON THE SCREEN: MISSED CALL FROM NIA. 

           As Temple’s expression slips to panic -- 

           INT. HALL - OUTSIDE TEMPLE’S LOFT - MOMENTS LATER

           Temple steps out, physically blocking NIA’s view of inside. 

           NIA, 28, her kind-of girlfriend. Beautiful and composed. She 
           tenses at Temple’s stiff body language. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Nia, what are you doing here? I was 
                        gonna call you back -- 

                                 NIA
                        After she left? 

           Temple’s silence reads yes. Nia shakes her head, 
           disappointed, hurt.  
                                 NIA (CONT’D)
                        It’s not like I expect you to walk 
                        me in there and introduce me to 
                        your Mom on the spot. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Seems like you do. 

                                 NIA
                        It’s been four months, Temple, and 
                        half the time, I don’t even feel 
                        like I have your attention. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        I can’t have this conversation with 
                        my Mom on the other side of the 
                        door. I’ll call you later. 

           INT. TEMPLE’S LOFT - SAME TIME

           Temple and Nia’s voices are muffled and unintelligible but 
           tension is easy to detect. Delilah frowns. 

           INT. HALL - OUTSIDE TEMPLE’S LOFT - SAME TIME 

           Temple turns to go back inside -- 

                                 NIA
                        This is what I’m talking about. I 
                        can’t be with someone who shuts me 
                        out of half her life. I feel like 
                        I’m wasting my time. 

           Temple’s hand goes lax on the knob. She has a choice to 
           make.  

           And she makes it.  

                                 TEMPLE
                        So don’t waste your time. 

           The wall Temple brings up to shield vulnerability is so 
           instant and robotic, it’s clearly a self-taught defense 
           mechanism. 

                                 NIA
                        You’re gonna let me walk away? 

           Temple doesn’t meet her eyes. 

           Nia scoffs, typical. 

           But as she walks away, Temple deflates. Presses her head 
           against the door and tries to find some composure. She 
           already regrets this but isn’t strong enough to change it. 
           INT. TEMPLE'S LOFT - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Temple steps back in. Delilah senses something is off, but 
           knows when not to push. 

                                 DELILAH
                        Everything okay?

                                 TEMPLE
                        Neighbor. We uh, don’t get along. 

           Delilah hums. Dries her hands and pulls Temple into a hug. 

                                 DELILAH
                        All right, baby. Super Shuttle’s 
                        here. Say a prayer with your old, 
                        tired Momma before I go.   

           Delilah presses their foreheads together. Holds Temple like 
           a precious thing.  

                                 DELILAH (CONT’D)
                             (in prayer)
                        May the Lord bless you and keep 
                        you. May He make His face to shine 
                        upon you, and be gracious to you. 
                        May He lift up His countenance upon 
                        you, and give you peace. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Amen. 

           Delilah leaves a kiss between Temple’s eyebrows. 

                                 TEMPLE (CONT’D)
                        Text me before you take off and 
                        when you land. 

                      TEMPLE (CONT'D)
                                                         DELILAH
           Don’t work too hard. 
                                              Don’t work too hard. 

           INT. ANIMATION STUDIO - EDITING BAY - DAY

           Where Temple works for a kids show called “FOREST BEARS” -- 
           peep the POSTERS and MOCK-UPS on the wall for confirmation.  

           She animates a panel. Couple of clicks and the bears DANCE. 

                                 CO-WORKER (PRE-LAP)
                        Temple Wilde, brings things alive 
                        with her mind. 

           He sidles in with an extra cup of coffee for her. 
                                 CO-WORKER (CONT’D)
                        Did you sleep last night?

                                 TEMPLE
                        Who needs sleep when you have 
                        deadlines? 

           He snorts on his way out. 

                                 CO-WORKER
                        Keep it uppp. 

           Bored with the bears now, Temple digs a worn SKETCHBOOK out 
           the pile of panels on her desk. Her own work is DARK, STILL 
           LIFE, PENCIL-HEAVY. 

           She flips to a half-done drawing of the ocean. The waves, 
           furious. She shades in some more angry waves, then flips 
           through the pages to watch them THRASH. 

           SOUND UP: THAT THUMP THUMP THUMP OF WATERY EDM [PRE-LAP] 

           INT. BASEMENT - POP-UP ART SHOW - NIGHT

           One of those bizarre events you only find in LA. Half-classy 
           art pop-up, half-dance party. Everyone’s beautiful, well-
           moisturized and lightweight nude. 

           Temple arrives, holds at the door to check her ringing 
           phone. ON THE SCREEN: DELILAH CALLING. Temple hit DECLINE. 

           She finds Wyatt in the crowd where he’s talking to a group 
           of people gathered around his futuristic installation piece. 
           Temple slips in. He beams to see her. 

                                 WYATT
                        Baby! You made it. Let’s drink 
                        someone else’s bodyweight in 
                        alcohol because mine would kill us. 

           He pulls her through a crowded aisle of colorful art 
           installations toward the bar. 

                                 WYATT (CONT’D)
                        Nia on her way? 

           A ROWDY GROUP OF GIRLS, 20s, charge through. The drunkest of 
           them all uses Temple to steady herself. 

           BAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Once reunited, with Wyatt, Temple reveals... 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Umm, we broke up this morning. 
                                 WYATT
                        What? You broke up with a lawyer? 
                        Girl, we gotta unpack your choices. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        She doesn’t get me. 

           The rowdy crew squeezes in beside them at the bar. Temple 
           protects her drink from flailing arms.  

                                 WYATT
                        Don’t give me that bullshit. You 
                        always wait for the girl you’re 
                        dating to fuck up, then you go, 
                        “Okay great, now I can reupholster 
                        the carpet in my comfy closet.” 
                        Nothing ever gets serious and you 
                        never have to tell Delilah who’s 
                        like, waiting around for you to 
                        bring some lumberjack home. You 
                        should feel shitty lying to her. 

           He punctuates this read by downing his drink. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Are you done?

                                 WYATT
                        I’ll probably encore. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        I did come out, Wyatt. When I was 
                        sixteen, I told my sister I’m queer 
                        and in love and she told me I can’t 
                        be because God loves me too much.  

           Wyatt short-circuits from this information. 

                                 WYATT
                        AC, the sister you don’t... talk to 
                        anymore... 

                                 TEMPLE
                        August, GA, baby. 

                                 WYATT
                        So many things suddenly making so 
                        much sense.  

           Well, that kills the mood. 

                                 WYATT (CONT’D)
                        Look, I’m sorry, that’s -- 

           Our favorite drunk bar-neighbor lets out an obnoxious cackle 
           and upends the remainder of her drink onto Temple’s sleeve. 

                                 BAR GIRL 
                        OH MY GOD! I’m so sorry! It’s my 
                        friend’s birthday.  

           She drunkenly uses her hands to tend to the stain. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Oh, it’s your friend’s birthday? Of 
                        course it’s okay to act like an 
                        asshole, then. 

           Somehow scathing sarcasm is charming to this girl. She and 
           Temple get a good look at each other. Temple softens.  

                                 TEMPLE (CONT’D)
                        It’s actually okay. For real.  

                                 BAR GIRL
                        Are you sure? I got you all wet. 

                                 WYATT
                        Oh please. 

           Temple reaches over Wyatt to steal napkins. He glares.

                                 WYATT (CONT’D)
                        The attorney gets walking papers 
                        but this one’s a prize?  

                                 TEMPLE
                        Give me a little credit?  

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           INT. TEMPLE’S LOFT - LATER

           Temple and the bar girl make a racket, trying to get inside 
           the loft and devour each other simultaneously. 

           INT. TEMPLE’S LOFT - TEMPLE’S ROOM - LATER 

           Bar girl sleeps. Temple, ongoing victim of insomnia, stares 
           at the ceiling, mentally questioning her choices. 

           SOUND: Temple’s phone RINGS. ON THE SCREEN: DELILAH CALLING. 

           Temple jumps to answer. 

                                 TEMPLE (PHONE)
                        It’s late there. Can’t sleep? 

           Delilah doesn’t say anything for a long beat. 
                                 TEMPLE (PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Momma? 

                                 AC (O.S.)(PHONE)
                        I had to make sure you would 
                        answer. 

           A voice she hasn’t heard in ten years. HER SISTER, ANNA-
           CHLOE. Now, she sounds raw, broken. 

           Temple’s blood runs cold. 

                                 AC (O.S.)(PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Momma... had a heart attack 
                        tonight. She um... Temple, oh God. 

           Her voice breaks. 

           Temple loses grip on the phone. As it HITS THE FLOOR -- 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT./EXT. WYATT’S CAR - DAY

           Wyatt drives Temple to the airport. She’s as stiff and 
           silent as a Magritte figure in the passenger seat.

           He steals looks at her. Wants to say something, anything -- 
           any offer of intimacy would do really -- but there’s nothing 
           to say. And as we watch his struggle, for a moment, we 
           wonder if it’s worst to be the friend. 

           EXT. LAX - TERMINAL - OUTSIDE WYATT’S CAR - DAY

           Wyatt scrambles around to open Temple’s door before she can 
           reach for it herself. Hauls her bags out of the trunk before 
           she can get to them. 

                                 WYATT
                        You should have plenty of time 
                        before your flight to... Call me if 
                        you just wanna talk...  
                             (then)
                        Okay. Umm. Okay.  

           He pulls her into a hug. Temple lets him, but can’t bring 
           herself to hug back. 

           EXT. AUGUSTA, GA - DAY

           Establish small-town, Southern Baptist, good-ol’-[you could 
           insert a variety of stuff here]. Temple’s plane LANDS -- 
           INT. AUGUSTA REGIONAL AIRPORT (AGS) - LATER

           Temple crosses baggage claim toward the exit doors... The 
           closer she gets, the harder it becomes to take another step. 
           All she can remember is why she fled this town. 

           TEMPLE’S POV

           Anxiety gets the best of her, playing with her perception -- 

           The double-doors appear larger. DAUNTING. 

           She can’t do this. 

           Temple ducks into -- 

           INT. BATHROOM - STALL - MOMENTS LATER

           We listen to her ragged breathing as she struggles to pull 
           herself together. 

           EXT. AUGUSTA REGIONAL AIRPORT (AGS) - PICK-UP LANE - DAY

           Temple emerges, only slightly better composed. She scans for 
           AC. 

           LAND ON: OTTO, 30s, white, AC’s husband. He’s the picture of 
           60s hippie with waist-length hair. 

           Temple approaches, expecting AC to appear at any moment... 
           But she never does. Otto’s alone. 

           Otto beams at first -- can’t believe he’s finally seeing her 
           again after all this time. Then he remembers why she’s here. 
           He pulls her into a warm hug. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Where’s AC? 

                                 OTTO
                        She had to stay behind with Tarzan. 
                        He got knocked down at practice. 
                        Tarzan’s our --  

           He catches himself. Of course she knows who Tarzan is -- or 
           does she? This is a nightmare. 

                                 OTTO (CONT’D)
                        You remember Tarzan. Grew up into a 
                        golden retriever while you were 
                        away. You’ll like him. 
                             (then)
                        AC can’t wait to see you, Temp. 

           Temple tosses her bag in the car before Otto can take it. 
                                 TEMPLE
                        Yeah. 

           EXT. CLAY HOUSE - DAY

           FLY OVER AUGUSTA UNTIL WE DESCEND TOWARD

           AC’s beautiful, suburban riverfront dream as Otto pulls up 
           the winding driveway and parks. Check out the pretty white 
           gate and well-maintained garden. AC’s all about perfection.  

           Otto waves to MS. CAROL, 60, a power-walking grandmother 
           circling the riverfront. 

           And here come the 2.5 kids (well, 1.5). First up is OTTO 
           JR., 8, lovingly called TARZAN by his family and therefore, 
           us. He’s all wild limbs and hair, with a tendency to leap, 
           barrel and roll into rooms like well, Tarzan. He charges 
           past Temple for Otto -- 

                                 OTTO
                        Tarzan, you come speak to your Aunt 
                        Temple, what’s wrong with you. 

           Tarzan and Temple aren’t sure what to make of each other. 

                                 TARZAN
                        Your hair’s funny. 

                                 OTTO
                        That is not what I had in mind. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        No funnier than yours. 

           Tarzan shrugs as if to say, not bad. Respect. 

                                 TARZAN
                        Do you like basketball? We have 2K 
                        on XBox. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        I’m not very good. 

                                 TARZAN
                        I’ll show you. It’s easy. 
                             (re: Otto)
                        Can I go now?

           Otto cracks a smile. 

                                 OTTO
                        Sure, go on. 
           DAVINA, 17, their oldest, emerges from the garage. The way 
           she looks exactly like Temple and nothing like Otto tips us 
           off that he’s only her step-Dad. 

           And she’s STRIKING. Lithe, confident with big, alert eyes; 
           bigger emo hair and retro combat boots. She stomps past 
           Temple to the car without slowing for a proper greeting. 

                                 DAVINA
                        Hey. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Hey. 

           The front door opens as they approach. Temple slows. Otto 
           takes her shoulder, gently but firmly guiding her forward: 
           you can do this. 

           AC, now 36, appears on the doorstep. She’s soft-spoken and 
           conservative. At the moment, ashen. 

                                 AC
                        ...Hey, scoot. 

           Temple doesn’t expect to thaw. She’s on autopilot as she 
           crosses toward AC. AC pulls Temple into her, kissing 
           Temple’s cheeks and forehead as if the years between them 
           are nothing. 

           Davina pauses at the car to watch. Otto takes her shoulder 
           to show comfort. But she shrugs him off. 

           AC releases Temple. Smoothes down her hair and clothes, 
           taking in the new version of her sister -- colorful, 
           creative... queer.   

                                 AC (CONT’D)
                        All grown up. Um. I’ll show you 
                        where everything is and we can -- 

                                 OTTO
                        Make a plan. 

           What hangs unsaid: for the rest of your motherless lives. 

           INT. CLAY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Inside is quaint, homey and God-fearing. She can barely go a 
           step in one direction without bumping into a bible or cross. 

           It snaps Temple right back to the reality of where she 
           stands with AC. It hardens her. 

           Temple peruses family photos and artifacts -- 
           That picture hangs. Delilah’s cell phone screensaver. AC has 
           it hanging in her house. 

           AC doesn’t notice Temple’s fixation. 

                                 AC
                        You should eat something. You 
                        haven’t eaten. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        You never showed at the airport. 

                                 AC
                        Hmm? Oh, I had to go get Tarzan. 
                        Otto was there, though, right? 

           Temple picks up a battered bible. AC is quick to take it. 

                                 AC (CONT’D)
                        Careful. That’s really old. 

           AC handles it with care as she tucks it back into place. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        You don’t know. 

                                 AC
                        Hmm?

                                 TEMPLE
                        You don’t know if I’ve eaten. 

                                 AC
                        Well, I’d like to feed you anyway. 
                        I made Momma’s ranch pot roast for 
                        the first time the other night. The 
                        kids actually said mine came out 
                        okay. You wanna try it?  

                                 TEMPLE
                             (moving past AC)
                        I’m not hungry --  

           Delilah’s wallet on the counter. They both pause. 

           INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           AC, full of emotion, watches Temple comb through Delilah’s 
           wallet and affects. The messy receipts stuffed into the side-
           pocket. An old keyring bursting with so many keys it seems 
           to be begging for mercy. A sassy shade of lipstick she never 
           wore. The million little details that make up a person. 
                                 TEMPLE
                        Look at these, $5.07 every morning 
                        at Einstein’s. 

                                 AC
                        Had to have her morning bagel. 
                        Here, I’ll put all the receipts in 
                        a little bag -- 

           Temple pulls them out of her reach. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        She didn’t need to be fixed. 

           AC appears a little ashamed by her own instincts. 

                                 AC
                        Tea? I’ll make some tea.  

           She gets busy putting on the kettle. She likes being busy. 
           It relaxes her mind.  

                                 AC (CONT’D)
                        You know, she would call me every 
                        morning at Einstein’s. I got used 
                        to hearing her voice before work. I 
                        was gonna try to get her to quit 
                        that job, though. She had to work 
                        so hard. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Why didn’t you? 

                                 AC
                        I have a husband, kids, a house to 
                        maintain. It wasn’t always on my 
                        mind. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Impressive priorities.

                                 AC
                        I was here every day with Momma, 
                        taking her out to lunch, doing her 
                        laundry, fixing her car, paying her 
                        bills when she couldn’t while you 
                        were galavanting in LA -- 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Working in LA. So I could pull her 
                        out of this. Meanwhile, you had one 
                        fucking job, keep her alive until I 
                        could come get her and you couldn’t 
                        even do that.  
           Temple realizes what she said. 

                                 TEMPLE (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t mean that. 

           It doesn’t lessen the sting. They both know she did. 

           INT. GUEST ROOM - LATER

           AC opens drawers for Temple to put her things away, but her 
           body language is tenser. The weight of Temple’s earlier 
           comments weigh on her. 

                                 AC
                        Look, I’m not trying to pretend we 
                        haven’t spoken in ten years, but 
                        the bottom line is, we’re the only 
                        people we have left. I know you 
                        have your friends and... people 
                        that you date... but none of them 
                        know exactly what it feels like to 
                        lose our Momma. That’s just you and 
                        me. I want us to start over. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        You’re right. 

           AC sighs, relieved. 

                                 TEMPLE (CONT’D)
                        So the plan. We need to pack up the 
                        house and put everything in 
                        storage. 

                                 AC
                        Pick the church, the pastor and 
                        cemetery -- there’s a memorial 
                        ground ten minutes from here that’s 
                        really pretty. We should go up 
                        there and talk to them. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Momma always wanted to be buried in 
                        Dublin next to Nana. 

                                 AC
                        Dublin is two hours away. I don’t 
                        want her so far from us that the 
                        kids never get to visit her. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        She wanted one thing from us. 

           AC wrestles with that. Decides to maintain the peace. 
                                 AC
                        Okay, fine. We’ll drive up there 
                        next week and -- 

                                 TEMPLE
                        I leave Sunday. 

                                 AC
                        Sunday? As in six days from now? 
                        You’ll have to get a later flight. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        I’m leaving Sunday. I have things 
                        to get back to. People wondering 
                        where I am -- 

                                 AC
                        Tell them you’re with family -- 

                                 TEMPLE
                        I said I’d help. But I leave in six 
                        days. 

                                 AC
                        I knew you were angry with me, but 
                        I didn’t know you hated me. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Jesus, this is not about you. It’s 
                        been ten years. 

                                 AC
                        Why do you never want to talk about 
                        how you feel? You can be angry. I’m 
                        angry, too. Let’s just have a real 
                        conversation about it. 

           Temple scoffs. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        I’m not angry -- wait, what are you 
                        angry about?

           AC stops short of answering. That can’t go anywhere good. 

                                 AC
                        Nothing. I just... This is 
                        stressful. I’m stressed. If you 
                        wanna bury Momma in Dublin, that’s 
                        what we’ll do. Cherry can help. She 
                        still talks to those people. 

           Temple scoffs. 
                                 TEMPLE
                        So she can turn this into the 
                        Cherry show? 

                                 AC
                        Guess so. If you leave Sunday. 

           Temple refuses to give AC the satisfaction of calling her 
           bluff. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        All right, then. Guess so. 

                                 AC
                        We’ll talk to all the aunts about 
                        it tomorrow night at dinner. 

           Temple steps aside as AC crosses for the door. AC nearly 
           goes for a hug but Temple stiffens. It’s awkward, hurtful. 

                                 AC (CONT’D)
                        Goodnight. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Hey. I... I am sorry. 

           AC waits. 

                                 TEMPLE (CONT’D)
                        For your loss. She was your Mom, 
                        too. I know that. Goodnight. 

           It takes AC a bewildered moment before she remembers to 
           leave. 

           As Temple crumbles onto the bed, face in-hand -- 

           INT. AC AND OTTO’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           SOUND: “Ascension” by Maxwell

           Davina plays the song on her phone, swaying to the beat as 
           AC detangles and moisturizes her pretty hair. 

                                 DAVINA
                        Remember when this came on in 
                        Marshall’s and Grandma tried to 
                        start a dance off? You were so 
                        embarrassed. Ma? Are you listening?

           But AC’s lost in thought. Davina gives her a hard nudge. 

                                 AC
                        Hmm? I’m sorry, sweetie. 
                                 DAVINA
                        I said this was Grandma’s favorite 
                        song but your old behind was 
                        probably at the club trying to 
                        dance to it, too. Scam a husband. 

                                 AC
                        How old do you think I am? 

           AC reaches to poke a squirming Davina with the comb. 

                                 OTTO
                        Hey, we having a dance party?

           Otto crosses to take down the bed. Does a little hip shake 
           for AC’s amusement. Davina turns the music off. 

                                 OTTO (CONT’D)
                        How’d it go with Temple?

                                 AC
                        She’s “sorry for my loss.” 

           Otto’s expression agrees that’s a low-blow. 

                                 AC (CONT’D)
                        Now she’s on this kick about 
                        burying Momma in Dublin. 

                                 DAVINA
                        Dublin? We’ll never see her, dude. 

                                 AC
                        Temple won’t budge even a little 
                        bit. And she’s always been this 
                        way, even when she was a kid.
                             (re: Otto)
                        Did she tell you she was leaving 
                        Sunday?

                                 OTTO
                        She didn’t say much of anything. 

           AC shakes her head. Gets going on a tangle. 

                                 AC
                        And she’s angry, even though she’s 
                        saying she isn’t. 

                                 OTTO
                        She thinks by moving your Mom to 
                        Dublin, she’s putting distance 
                        between herself and us. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 OTTO (CONT'D)
                        So when she comes to town to see 
                        Delilah, she won’t have to see us, 
                        too. It’s a permanent sever. 

                                 DAVINA
                             (re: brushing)
                        Careful, Ma... 

                                 AC
                        Which is exactly why I have to go 
                        along with it. If I push too hard, 
                        that wall’s never coming back down. 
                        I’ve seen it before. 
                             (re: the tangle)
                        It just won’t give. 

                                 DAVINA
                        Well, maybe you’re trying too hard. 

                                 AC
                        Pass the shea butter. 

                                 DAVINA
                        Whatever did happen with you guys? 

                                 AC
                             (pointedly to Davina)
                        I made some choices in youth that 
                        came back to bite me on the butt. 

           Davina passes the shea butter with an eye roll. 

                                 AC (CONT’D)
                        And she never forgave me. 

           AC stops suddenly to shake her head at Otto. Just, so 
           fucking bewildered. 

                                 AC (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry for your loss. My sister 
                        said that to me. 

           Otto comes around to squeeze AC’s shoulder. 

                                 AC (CONT’D)
                        I don’t even think she wants to 
                        forgive me. 

                                 DAVINA
                        Should she?

                                 AC
                        The Lord teaches forgiveness.  
                                 DAVINA
                        That wasn’t my question. 

                                 OTTO
                        Hey, she’s here for the next few 
                        days. You have some time, maybe 
                        something will give. 

                                 OTTO (CONT’D)
                        We’ll all be supportive. Won’t we 
                        Davina?

           AC holds Davina’s hair back to find her eyes.  

                                 DAVINA
                        Sure. I’ll keep my opinion to 
                        myself. No one listens anyway. 

           SOUND: Davina’s phone DINGS with an alert. 

           AC tries to sneak a look at the screen. Davina pointedly 
           blocks her view. 

           INT. GUEST ROOM - NIGHT

           An exhausted, but painfully awake Temple, tosses and turns 
           as she slips in and out of consciousness. 

           It fills the room with a trancelike energy.

           Temple’s eyes peel open for quick moments here and there, 
           casting shades of purple and blue on the wall. Then shadows.  

           Then Delilah’s shadow. 

                                 DELILAH
                        Don’t leave me. Stay awake. 

           Temple SNAPS awake. Disappointed it wasn’t real as reality 
           rushes back. Sleep will never come here. 

           EXT. AUGUSTA - RIVERFRONT - DAY 

           The sun shines, but the waves seem irritable.   

           INT. DELILAH’S TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           WE PAN THROUGH Delilah’s home, past a charming clutter of 
           thrift store gems -- most things, vintage collectibles. 
           Temple’s diplomas, certificates and meaningless childhood 
           accomplishments proudly on display in gold frames.  

           The walls and shelves are filled in with family photos: AC’s 
           kids at various ages; AC and Temple together up to  Temple’s 
           teenage years where AC then disappears; Delilah’s sisters; 
           their kids; Temple’s grandmother; GENERATIONS. Intersecting 
           lifetimes, some of which are already over and the rest will 
           be over in the blink of an eye. 

           Temple finds Delilah’s WORK JACKET slung over a chair. She 
           feels overwhelmed as she gathers it in her hands. 

           AC tries to touch Temple’s shoulder. Temple shakes her off, 
           steps away. 

                                 DAVINA
                        Temple, I think this is yours. 

           Davina brings over a box labeled “TEMPLE HS.” 

           Temple explores, pulls out a folded broken EASEL. 

                                 AC
                        Aww, your easel! You took that 
                        thing everywhere. 

           Temple cuts her eyes at AC but doesn’t comment. Keeps 
           exploring -- old glasses, old kicks (Vans, of course). 
           Collections of handwritten essays and letters. A bible 
           signed to Temple from Delilah: “To my baby. God loves you 
           and I do, too! :)” She pushes past to --  

           An old SKETCHBOOK. She flips through. We catch glimpses of a 
           basket of apples; a beautiful TEEN GIRL with shaved sides, a 
           faceless woman wearing a bold sweater made of patches of 
           comic book panels; a boutique of gardenias. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        I can’t believe she kept this. 

                                 AC
                        She kept everything you ever 
                        touched. 

           INT. CLAY HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Otto puts final touches on the table setting. 

           INT. CLAY HOUSE - TARZAN’S ROOM - NIGHT

           AC sifts through Tarzan’s clothes.

                                 TARZAN
                        Can I wear this?

           Tarzan rounds in wearing an oversized basketball jersey. 

                                 AC
                        No. 
           She keeps looking. Picks out a cute Polo.  

                                 AC (CONT’D)
                        Here. 

                                 TARZAN
                        I hate that shirt, it’s itchy. 

                                 AC
                        Your Grandma gave that to you. Put 
                        it on. 

           INT. HALL - OUTSIDE KITCHEN - LATER

           Temple pauses outside the kitchen at the sound of -- 

           TEMPLE’S POV 

           Davina and AC bickering at the island counter.

                                 AC
                        Let’s just make an appointment to 
                        talk before making a snap decision. 
                        What if I’d done that you? 

                                 DAVINA
                        You’d look crazy talking to 
                        yourself right now. 

                                 AC
                        Everything’s a joke still, huh? 

           Temple announces herself with a loud entrance. 

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           AC switches like everything’s fine when Temple arrives. 

                                 AC
                        Hey there. 

           Davina shakes her head at AC’s pretense. Turns EMO HIP-HOP 
           up louder. 

                                 OTTO
                             (crossing through)
                        Davina, you mind turning that down? 

                                 DAVINA
                        If Young Metro don’t trust you I’m 
                        gon’ shoot you. 

           Temple watches the slight, intrigued. AC’s unamused. 
                                 AC
                        That’s enough. Go get dressed. 

                                 DAVINA
                             (DIRECTLY into AC’s ear)
                        METRO BOOMIN WANT SOME MORE, NIG --

                                 AC
                        Davina! 

           Temple stifles a laugh as Davina shoulders past her and out 
           the kitchen. Amused by AC’s visible stress.  

                                 AC (CONT’D)
                        I heard you moving around last 
                        night. Did you sleep okay?

           As she puts on a pot of coffee, 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Like a rock. 

           SOUND: DOORBELL 

                                 AC
                        Ready for this?

           They brace themselves. 

           SOUND UP: Kanye West’s “Ultralight Beam” over MONTAGE -- 

           INT. DINING ROOM - LATER

           Extended WILDES cycle in a melancholic, but joyful reunion. 
           An emotional exchange of sympathies, hugs, kisses. 

           SHOTS AND SHOTS OF AC AND TEMPLE SMOTHERED IN AFFECTION:  

           CHERRY WILDE, 60s, unmarried and the OLDEST, holds AC’s head 
           to her chest. 

           ATHENA RICCI, 50s, other-worldly, with a gorgeous ITALIAN 
           HUSBAND, 50s, in-tow, kisses Temple’s knuckles. 

           DIXIE KIM, 50s, accompanied by her KOREAN HUSBAND, 50s, and 
           TWIN DAUGHTERS, 20, gives AC and Temple an impassioned 
           speech that we can’t hear. 

           Everyone cries, hugs, prays and is just “so sorry” for each 
           other’s “loss.” AC finds recharge, but for Temple -- 

           It’s too fucking much. 

           Temple fizzles to the edge of the busyness. She slumps to a 
           chair. ZONES OUT. 
           “Healing” plays out in the b.g. But somehow, even with all 
           these people, Temple is ALONE. 

           AS WE MOVE IN ON HER GLASSY, DAZED EYES -- AS WE FIND THE 
           BEST ANGLE TO CAPTURE THIS PAIN --  

           DELILAH SLIDES INTO FRAME. 

                                 DELILAH
                        Don’t you hate these people?

           As a STARTLED Temple turns sharply toward Delilah, 

                                                              HARD CUT TO: 

           INT. DINING ROOM - LATER

           PAN AROUND THE TABLE. Everyone holds hands, heads bowed in 
           prayer as Cherry leads us -- 

                                 CHERRY
                        May those hands and our hands, 
                        bodies too, be well and quick to 
                        heal... Blessed be our friends, our 
                        families, and all of our loved 
                        ones... 

           Well, everyone except for Temple who looks around blankly. 
           Her hands are limp in Athena’s and Dixie’s on either side. 

           Delilah, in a bold sweater covered in delightful comic book 
           panels, matches her body language (Note: This projection of 
           Delilah is always Temple’s mirror in style and disposition). 
           They have so many notes. 

                                 DELILAH
                        Look at AC. 

           Tears stream down AC’s cheeks as she clutches Cherry’s hand. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        She always needed someone to cling 
                        to in crisis. 

                                 DELILAH
                        Well, her core’s been rocked. The 
                        God she loved so unwaveringly took 
                        her mother. Now, she’s questioning 
                        everything. 

                                 CHERRY
                        And everybody say Amen. 

                                 THE TABLE
                        Amen./Yes, God./Amen. 
           Cherry and AC wipe each other’s tears away. 

                                 DELILAH
                        You know I never liked Cherry. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        You said she was a bully when you 
                        guys were growing up. 

                                 DELILAH
                        Mhm. The crazy one. Demanding, 
                        overbearing, volatile. You don’t 
                        really notice until -- 

                                 CHERRY
                        Y’all ain’t put no bacon in this 
                        cabbage? I gotta come over here and 
                        teach y’all how to cook.

           Temple and Delilah share a look: the Cherry show. 

                                 DELILAH
                        But then again, the one with balls. 

                                 ATHENA
                        We took a red-eye in from New York. 
                        You know I was on my way as soon as 
                        I got your call.  

           Athena takes AC’s hand. 

                                 ATHENA (CONT’D)
                        Nobody likes to talk about it, but 
                        we know how expensive a service is. 
                        We’re here to help, okay? 
                             (a whisper)
                        I brought my checkbook. 

                                 DAVINA
                        Venmo’s easier. 

           Delilah leans over to Temple... 

                                 DELILAH
                        I used to call her Glinda the Good 
                        Witch. Always here to help. But 
                        after Nana died?
                             (scoff)
                        Miss Glinda moved to London and 
                        we’d be lucky to see her ass once a 
                        year. 

                                 AC
                        The insurance company said --
                                 CHERRY
                        You can’t trust a damn word the 
                        insurance company say, baby. Ever. 
                        Thank the Lord we got here just in 
                        time. 
                             (aside to Athena)
                        Mildred’s son, you remember Ronnie? 
                        He’s the gravedigger over in Dublin 
                        now. He’ll do it at a discount. 

                                 ATHENA
                        Oh, perfect. 

           Delilah nudges Temple, what’d I tell you? 

                                 DIXIE
                        It don’t feel like it now, but I 
                        promise y’all, this too shall pass. 
                        We’ve been through it. You heal. 
                        Life goes on.  

           Temple and Davina (and Delilah unbeknownst to Davina) share 
           a look of WTFness. 

                                 DELILAH
                        She thinks she’s helping. The 
                        logical one. She doesn’t even 
                        realize all that straight talk just 
                        makes everyone feel disposable. 

                                 CHERRY
                        Dix, remind me, first thing 
                        tomorrow, I gotta call Pastor 
                        LeRoy. He’ll do the service.  

                                 ATHENA
                        Does Patty still sing in the choir? 

                                 CHERRY
                        Lemme find out.  

           It’s kind of comforting watching them mobilize. Do 
           something. Change something.  

                                 CHERRY (CONT’D)
                        We got this, babies. Don’t worry. 

           AC avoids Temple’s probing eyes. 

           INT. GUEST ROOM - NIGHT

           The room hums with a whimsical, dreamlike energy. 

           QUICK TIME CUTS of Temple and Delilah “catching up.” They 
           laugh, talk, dance. Putting the moon to sleep and waking the 
           sun up for day.  

           Eventually, Temple’s restlessness wanes. 

           Delilah starts to FADE. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        No, no, no, don’t leave me. Please 
                        don’t leave me. 

                                 DELILAH
                        Then don’t leave me. Stay awake. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        I promise. 

           INT. CAFÉ - COUNTER - MORNING

                                 TEMPLE
                        Single shot of espresso -- double, 
                        actually. Double-shot. 

           EXT. CLAY HOUSE - RIVERFRONT - DAY

           MS. CAROL, our notorious power-walker, lifts her five-pound 
           weights with perfect form as she clears the bank. 

           Temple passes her, walking alone. Eyes glassy from another 
           night with no sleep. She sips her ESPRESSO. 

           SOUND: FOOTSTEPS  

           Temple looks back, but there’s nothing there. She looks down 
           at her own feet crunching over dying leaves -- she can’t be 
           that out of it can she? 

           She shakes it off, keeps going. 

           SOUND: FOOTSTEPS, FASTER 

                                 TEMPLE
                             (hesitant)
                        ...Momma? 

                                 DAVINA
                        What? 

           Temple turns. DAVINA trails in sleepwear and combat boots, 
           drinking coffee. Intrigued by Temple’s energy. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        I want to be alone. 
                                 DAVINA
                        I take my coffee outside, though. 

           Temple keeps walking. Davina follows. 

                                 DAVINA (CONT’D)
                        It’s funny. At first, you give off 
                        this vibe that you’re so cool and 
                        like, over-everything, but you’re 
                        pretty anxious, awkward and weird. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Okay. Thanks.

                                 DAVINA
                        I just wanted to make sure you 
                        weren’t fleeing the state before 
                        the funeral. 

           Temple bristles. Faces Davina. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        You were like a fetus when I left. 
                        I’m not sure you should be forming 
                        attitude about what happened. 

                                 DAVINA
                        I know why you wanna bury Grandma 
                        all the way in Dublin.

                                 TEMPLE
                        It’s what she wanted. 

                                 DAVINA
                        What’s up with you and Ma?

                                 TEMPLE
                        What’s up with you and Otto? 

           Davina appears surprised Temple noticed. She shifts, 
           discomforted by the topic and showing her seventeen years. 

                                 DAVINA
                        He thinks he can tell me what to 
                        do. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        He can’t? 

           Davina gets frazzled. 

                                 DAVINA
                        Whatever, I don’t want Grandma in 
                        Dublin. We’ll never see her. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DAVINA (CONT'D)
                             (then)
                        I wanna see her. 

           That actually weighs on Temple. She softens. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        It’s what she wanted. Don’t we all 
                        deserve the last thing we’ll ever 
                        get the chance to want? 

                                 DAVINA
                        I just don’t wanna forget her. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Me either. 

           INT. GUEST ROOM - DAY

           QUICK CUTS of Temple and Delilah. Still happy. Still 
           dancing. In their own little world. 

           Nothing can get to them here. 

           EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Families pack the stadium. Kids pour onto the field. Temple  
           marvels at the expanding crowd. 

                                 AC (PRE-LAP)
                        Friday night in Augusta. 

           INT. BASEBALL FIELD - MOMENTS LATER

                                 DAVINA
                        Because God hates us. 

           AC and Otto lead Temple -- who’s sipping on an ENERGY DRINK -
           - up the stadium while Davina trails behind them, texting. 
           AC finds TARZAN on the field down below -- 

                                 AC
                        Tie your shoes! 
                             (re: Temple)
                        Tarzan always pitches. Last week, 
                        he hit a grand slam. Sometimes I 
                        think the other kids get jealous. 

                                 OTTO
                        The parents, too. 

           Small-town gossip. Temple fights the urge to roll her eyes. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Uh-huh. 
           AC clocks how Temple’s guzzling that energy drink like 
           water. A lack-of-sleep bender showing under her eyes.

                                 AC
                        You sleep okay, scoot? 

                                 TEMPLE
                        I’m gonna explore. 

           She moves off. 

           Otto gives AC a supportive squeeze. 

           EXT. SNACK STAND - LATER

           Temple tries to walk off some of that weird energy. Around 
           her, people gather in growing food lines. They all seem so 
           content here. This is just life, as small and slow as it is. 

           A TRIO OF UNIFORMED PLAYERS, 6-7, BUMP Temple as they race 
           toward the field. 

                                 YA-YA
                        Sorry, lady! 

           The only girl, a lanky fireball, waves her apology to Temple 
           before continuing on roughhousing with the boys. 

           Temple can’t stop staring. There’s something familiar about 
           her, her face, her mannerisms, that rough-and-tumble... 

           Shit. Temple’s features loosen to dread as she realizes -- 

           EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - STADIUM - LATER

                                 TEMPLE
                        Whose kid is that? 

           Temple rounds in front of AC and Otto. Points TO THE FIELD 
           where Ya-Ya crosses to the pitcher’s mound, bat in-tow. 

           AC, realizing Temple means Ya-Ya, shrinks, guilty. 

                                 TEMPLE (CONT’D)
                        I knew it. 

           Her rising voice, agitated all the more by her jittery 
           nerves, draws nearby eyes. Otto, dreading a scene, reaches 
           for Temple’s arm. 

                                 TEMPLE (CONT’D)
                        How do you not tell me Belle’s kid 
                        is here? 
                                 OTTO
                        Let’s talk about it later, Temp -- 

                                 AC
                        Because I never know where the land-
                        mine is with you.

           Temple sobers. Remembers where she is. She takes a seat. 

           AC and Otto share a worried look. 

           EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - MOMENTS LATER 

           The VOLUNTEER PITCHER, 30s, joins Ya-Ya on the field. It’s 
           clear he isn’t thrilled with the inclusion of a girl. 

                                 VOLUNTEER PITCHER
                        Hurry up. We don’t have all day. 

                                 BELLE (O.S.)
                        Block out all the noise, Ya-Ya. 
                        Remember what we talked about. 

           BELLE EADIE, 27, Ya-Ya’s Mom and by the way Temple’s looking 
           at her, Temple’s Achilles’ Heel. Bohemian, rock kid with an 
           UNDER-SHAVE, a snapback and hardcore cleats. 

           Belle and Ya-Ya pull in for a demonstration on form. 

                                 BELLE (CONT’D)
                        Eyes always on the ball, all right? 
                        Do that thing. 

           Everyone moves into position. 

                                                           TIME CUT TO:

           EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - LATER 

           The pitcher throws Ya-Ya an aggressive curveball ball. She 
           KNOCKS it out of the park -- it SAILS over the fence.  

           Ya-Ya flies down the bases, shaking and dodging boys 
           scattering to out-throw or out-run her and failing. She 
           rounds third base and:   

           It’s a HOMERUN. The crowd CHEERS. 

           Temple stands with the crowd. The excitement, the 
           adrenaline, the energy is contagious and she finds herself 
           just as absorbed. 

           And as Belle celebrates, SHE SEES TEMPLE -- 

           And everything stops.
           EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - LATER

           The crowd disperses, packing it in for the night. 

           EXT. PARKING LOT - LATER

           Temple and Belle take an unhurried walk together. 

           It’s been so long since they’ve seen each other, neither 
           really knows what to do. History exposed in every awkward 
           moment and stilted silence. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Big as Augusta is, it’s actually 
                        kinda small. 

                                 BELLE
                        I was hoping I’d bump into you 
                        while you were in town. I thought 
                        about calling but... I didn’t know 
                        how happy you’d be about that.
                             (then)
                        I know I didn’t handle everything 
                        beautifully and you’re probably 
                        still upset but -- 

                                 TEMPLE
                        It’s crazy that everyone thinks 
                        I’ve just been obsessing over them 
                        for years. Shocking though it may 
                        be, I have new things on my mind.

           Belle absorbs that. 

                                 BELLE
                        Okay. Good. I’m glad. 

           Another stilted silence. Temple pockets her hands and stays 
           stiff like that. Notices Ya-Ya playing just over Belle’s 
           shoulder. It blows her mind all over again.  

                                 TEMPLE
                        So you have a kid. A whole, living 
                        person.  

           Belle brightens at mention of Ya-Ya, but with a 
           bittersweetness underneath that suggests this is a painful 
           topic between them. 

                                 BELLE
                        Yeah, she exists. Not only in my 
                        mind. What do we think of her?  

                                 TEMPLE
                        She’s tall. 
                                 BELLE
                        You called it. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        How’s Dad?

           Belle kicks a muddy spot of dirt under her shoe. 

                                 BELLE
                        Good. I think. He’s at Ft. Jackson. 
                        We divorced maybe a hundred years 
                        ago? Something like that. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Just think, before then, he 
                        mattered so much. 

                                 BELLE
                        I’d like to see you while you’re 
                        here. You can hang out with Ya-Ya, 
                        who’s as abrasive and self-involved 
                        as any seven-year-old. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        I’m gone Sunday. 

           That’s a surprise. 

                                 BELLE
                        That’s soon. Shouldn’t you be with 
                        your family for a while? 

                                 TEMPLE
                             (softly)
                        I should go. 

           Temple turns off --  

                                 BELLE
                        I did try to call you a few times. 
                        I left messages. Whenever I saw 
                        Delilah at the grocery store or AC 
                        at practice, it’s like, “Hey, tell 
                        Temple I said hi.” Any of that get 
                        to you?  

                                 TEMPLE
                        Some of it. And thanks. It was good 
                        to see you, Belle.  

           Belle blows her a kiss. Rejoins Ya-Ya. 

                                 YA-YA
                        Did you see me? Did you see me?  
                                 BELLE
                        I didn’t, I actually took a nap 
                        instead but I heard you did okay!  

           Ya-Ya laughs as Belle tries to tickle her. 

           Temple doesn’t notice AC watching her watch Belle. 

           INT. GUEST ROOM - NIGHT

           Temple, bloodshot eyes, stares at the ceiling. 

           DELILAH APPEARS IN FRAME as she lays down next to Temple, 
           their heads side by side. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Wanna take a walk? 

                                 DELILAH
                        I’m down. 

           SOUND UP: Muffled first chords of “For the Love of You”... 

           Temple and Delilah both pique. 

                                 DELILAH (CONT’D)
                        That’s our jam! 

           INT. CLAY HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

                                 AC
                        Turn it up! Don’t talk trash and 
                        then try to hide the music. 

           AC and Otto dance while Davina hangs her head in 
           embarrassment and Tarzan giggles. 

           Temple draws closer, watching from the archway. Even she 
           can’t fight a smile. 

           Delilah slips past Temple and joins AC and Otto, unbeknownst 
           to them. AC and Delilah mirror each other. They could easily 
           be Delilah and Temple on the beach. 

           It’s a moment that reminds Temple how connected she and AC 
           are. She can’t run from it, she can’t stomach it.  

           And it’s infuriating. 

           Temple abruptly crosses through the kitchen for the 
           backdoor.

                                 AC (CONT’D)
                        Oh, hey, Temple, you remember this 
                        song? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 AC (CONT’D)
                        Come dance with us -- wait, where 
                        are you going? You shouldn’t be out 
                        this late. 

                                 TEMPLE
                             (scary nothingness in her 
                              voice)
                        Who cares what happens to me? 

                                 AC
                        Me, Temple. I care.  

           But Temple’s already out the door. 

           AC turns her alarm to the family. Even Davina’s expression 
           doesn’t betray the shared feeling.

           EXT. CLAY HOUSE - RIVERFRONT - NIGHT

           Temple and Delilah take a walk together. 

           They crosses through a phalanx of dead trees where it breaks 
           out into the lake. Temple’s boots sink into the muddy shore. 
           It’s quiet. The water’s still.  

                                 TEMPLE
                        You raised a real piece of work. 
                        All AC wants is for everyone else 
                        to rearrange their lives to suit 
                        her needs. 

                                 DELILAH
                        Trash. Can you believe her calling 
                        us angry? 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Right? Like it hasn’t been ten 
                        years. Please. 

                                 DELILAH
                        Whatever, we got what we want. 

           A needle-thin river snakes through the grass. 

           Delilah kneels to inspect the water. Her hands slips right 
           through, a reminder she isn’t there. 

                                 DELILAH (CONT’D)
                        That’s all that matters.

           INT. DELILAH’S TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Temple goes through the “TEMPLE HS” box. Fishes out books, 
           notebooks, posters, a collection of OLD PHOTOS -- 
           ON TOP: YOUNG BELLE (with shaved sides) AND TEMPLE, ALL 
           SMILES. CLOCK BELLE’S CHEERLEADING UNIFORM. 

                                 DAVINA (O.S.)
                        Ha! You hung out with a 
                        cheerleader? Embarrassing. 

           Temple jumps, startled, then nudges her away. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        She hung out with me.

           Davina joins to flip through the photos and sketchbooks.

                                 DAVINA
                        You drew this?

                                 TEMPLE
                        Yeah. 

                                 DAVINA
                        Grandma was always talking about 
                        how dope your stuff is. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        I’m not sure I even deserved it. 

                                 DAVINA
                        Dark, dude. She was proud of you. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Who she thought I was -- 
                             (catches herself)
                        There’s a lot I should’ve said that 
                        I didn’t, that she deserved to 
                        hear. And that’s on me. 

                                 DAVINA
                        It’s never too late to start being 
                        who you wanna be. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Look around you. This is the 
                        definition of too late. 

           AC bumbles in, struggling to keep a big box upright. 

                                 AC
                        Don’t worry, Davina, I don’t need 
                        any help -- oh, Temple. I thought 
                        you were sleeping in.

           AC sets the box down. 
                                 AC (CONT’D)
                        Cherry called this morning. Says 
                        Pastor LeRoy’s gonna do the 
                        service. She wants us to drive down 
                        to Dublin with them tomorrow. She’s 
                        taking us to dinner tonight to 
                        “tell us” the plan.  

                                 TEMPLE
                        Any surprise guests? Belle maybe? 
                        Or that kid from third grade who 
                        wore mirrors on his shoes and liked 
                        to push me down at recess.  

           AC ignores the dig. 

                                 AC
                        Just us and the aunts. We’ll share 
                        some funny stories, you know, like 
                        a memorial. It’ll be nice. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        An entire night of Cherry’s messy 
                        ass shading Momma? 

                                 AC
                        Cherry loved Momma. Family isn’t 
                        perfect, you know. We don’t love 
                        perfectly. Doesn’t mean we don’t 
                        love. 

                                 DAVINA
                        I read that death either brings 
                        people super tight together or 
                        ruins their relationships forever. 

           It’s quiet a beat.  

                                 AC
                        Frog Hollow at eight on the dot. 
                        And let’s not make it into a 
                        production? Let’s try to have a 
                        nice night. And Davina, I want your 
                        room and car spotless before we go. 
                        I’m tired of repeating myself.  

           Davina rolls her eyes as AC crosses out. 

                                 DAVINA
                        She’s always telling somebody what 
                        to do and where to be. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        This is gonna be a fucking 
                        nightmare. 
                                 DAVINA
                        You’ll need a buffer for sure. 

           Davina makes a photo of Temple and Belle dance. 

                                 DAVINA (CONT’D)
                        Know what would be hi-larious? Ma’s 
                        face if Belle was there tonight.   

                                 TEMPLE
                        Why would that be hilarious? 

                                 DAVINA
                        I mean, she didn’t tell you Belle 
                        was gonna be at Tarzan’s game. You 
                        don’t tell her Belle’s gonna be at 
                        dinner tonight. I’m messy, though. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Yeah, well, unfortunately for you, 
                        everyone isn’t a teenager who loves 
                        drama. All I want is for this to go 
                        smoothly so I can go home. The last 
                        thing I care about is beefing with 
                        AC. We’re both adults and we’re 
                        gonna act like adults.   

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           EXT. FROG HOLLOW - NIGHT

           Augustans dine on a patio overlooking wrestling waves. 

           We find Temple tossing an EMPTY ENERGY DRINK BOTTLE, then 
           pacing the deck. 

           BELLE arrives to greet her, Ya-Ya dancing around her feet. 

                          TEMPLE
                                                          BELLE
           You made it. 
                                              Hey, babe. 

                                 YA-YA
                        Umm, I’m here, too! 

           Temple leans down to greet Ya-Ya as well. 

           Belle shivers, under-dressed for the wind. Temple gives 
           Belle her jacket. 

                                 BELLE
                        Should we get a table?

                                 TEMPLE
                        Well, actually -- 
                                 AC
                        Hey, they can seat us but we should 
                        probably wait for Cherry and --   

           AC and Davina emerge from the restaurant. AC’s mood shifts 
           at the sight of Belle -- and Belle’s shifts at her -- 

           Temple, enjoying the egg on AC’s face, 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Oh! Sorry, meant to mention I 
                        invited Belle. 

                                 AC
                        You did, huh?

                                 BELLE
                        Cherry?

                                 TEMPLE
                             (eyes still on AC)
                        Yeah, my aunts are coming, too. 

                                 BELLE
                             (not fucking cool)
                        Cool. 

                                 DAVINA
                             (re: Belle)
                        Is that your jacket?

           Temple and Davina exchange a look.  

                                 TEMPLE
                        It’s cold. 

                                 DAVINA
                        I see. 

           Belle gets her second wind, musters a smile for the family. 

                                 BELLE
                        AC, how are you? Sorry to crash. 

                                 AC
                        No worries. It’s nice to see you. 

           They share an awkward hug.   

                                 AC (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna take the kids inside. 

                                 DAVINA
                        But you just said we were gonna 
                        wait outside -- 
                                 AC
                        Why are you talking back to me?

           AC ushers the kids in. As she passes Temple, 

                                 AC (CONT’D)
                        This was supposed to be just 
                        family. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        I would’ve mentioned it, I just 
                        didn’t know how you’d react so...

           Davina low-key sniggers in the b.g. 

           AC takes the jab with silent fury. 

           Temple smirks, enjoying AC’s discomfort. But the look on 
           Belle’s face brings her back to Earth. Belle looks so hurt. 

           Temple’s unprepared for the intense feeling of shittiness 
           that lands on her.  

                                 TEMPLE (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. I should’ve told -- 

                                 BELLE
                        No, it’s fine. You just wanted me 
                        here as a buffer. That’s cool. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        No, it’s not like that -- 

                                 BELLE
                        I’m gonna take off. 

                                 YA-YA
                        But I’m hungry.  

                                 CHERRY (O.S.)
                        Is that Belle Eadie! 

           Cherry slams her car door closed and rushes toward Temple 
           and Belle, leaving Dixie and Athena in her dust. 

                                 CHERRY (CONT’D)
                        Southern Belle from the block!
                             (re: Ya-Ya)
                        And who’s this angel! Please tell 
                        me y’all stayin’ for dinner.

                                 BELLE
                        Cherry! Of course we are.

           Cherry scoops her into a hug. Belle shoots daggers at Temple 
           over Cherry’s shoulder. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        I’m gonna start drinking. 

           EXT. FROG HOLLOW - BACK PATIO - NIGHT

           Find everyone snug at a water-side table. 

           Ya-Ya feeds candles to the waves to watch the flames die. 
           Belle’s nudges to stop go ignored. 

                                 CHERRY
                        We went ahead and ordered roses for 
                        the service this morning. 

                                 DAVINA
                        We said we were gonna get gardenias 
                        cause Grandma loved the smell. 

                                 CHERRY
                        Roses match the casket better, 
                        baby. 

                                 DAVINA
                        When did we pick out a casket? 

           Davina looks to Temple and AC to step in. AC feigns 
           disinterest. 

                                 AC
                        I’m good with it if you are, 
                        Temple. Especially since we’re on 
                        such limited time. 

           Temple matches AC’s unbothered demeanor. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        I’m all in. Thanks for being 
                        decisive, Cherry. 

           Davina scoffs at them, frustrated and disappointed. 

                                 DIXIE
                        Okay, okay, okay, enough depressing 
                        business talk. Everybody has to 
                        tell their favorite ‘Lilah story. 

                                 ATHENA
                        Y’all remember when she glued her 
                        eyes shut trying to do her nails 
                        that time? 

           The table erupts in laughter. Even Temple, who’d rather be 
           lit on fire than at this table, can’t fight a smile. 
                                 BELLE
                        To Delilah. 

           Everyone raises their glass in a toast. Temple finishes her 
           wine in one gulp. 

                                 CHERRY
                        Belle, your little girl is too 
                        precious. 

                                 BELLE
                        What do you say, Ya-Ya?

                                 YA-YA
                        Thank you, ma’am. 

           Davina funnels candles to Ya-Ya for more fireworks. AC snaps 
           her fingers at Davina to stop, not even remotely amused. 

           Cherry takes Belle’s hand, leans over to whisper --

                                 CHERRY
                        Her Daddy still in the picture?

                                 BELLE
                        He’s in the picture for Ya-Ya and 
                        that’s all that matters to me. 

                                 CHERRY
                        I know that’s right. If it ain’t 
                        workin’, it’s better to end it for 
                        the child’s sake. 

                                 ATHENA
                        At least you got to marry your high 
                        school sweetheart -- how many 
                        people can say that?

                                 BELLE
                        No I didn’t, but it’s okay. 

           Temple tops off her own glass. 

                                 AC
                        Cherry, it’s your turn. Say a few 
                        words about Momma. 

                                 CHERRY
                        So ‘Lilah always wanted a bunch of 
                        girls. All I heard comin’ up -- 
                        “I’m gonna take my girls here, 
                        gonna buy ‘em this.” She was so 
                        excited when she had AC. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHERRY (CONT'D)
                        We musta bought out the baby store 
                        at the mall. Then she had Temple 
                        and... Well, one outta two ain’t 
                        bad! 

           The aunts share a big laugh, unaware of the awkwardness that 
           hangs with Temple, AC and Belle. 

                                 BELLE
                        I think Temple came out okay. 

                                 ATHENA
                        She is a doll! She was the sweetest 
                        little girl but... Come on, Temp, 
                        you know the girly stuff wasn’t 
                        your thing growing up. 

                                 CHERRY
                        I told ‘Lilah about that 
                        alternative parentin’. Just lettin’ 
                        them kids run wild, honey. I 
                        thought Temple was worshippin’ 
                        Satan at one point. Always locked 
                        away in that room. I don’t think 
                        she ever even talked to a boy. 

           Temple’s grip on her glass tightens. 

                                 BELLE
                        Let’s talk about something else -- 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Cherry, what do you know about 
                        parenting? You don’t have kids. 
                        You’ve never been married -- you 
                        didn’t even try. 

           AC reaches for Temple’s arm which only fuels Temple’s anger. 

                                 CHERRY
                        What are you tryna say? 

           The table waits. Belle finds Temple’s eyes, silently 
           pleading, don’t make this worse. 

           So she won’t. She goes, taking the wine bottle with her. 

                                 AC
                        Temple -- 

           Davina slides out before Belle or AC can.

                                 DAVINA
                        I’ll get her. 
           AC and Belle don’t look soothed. But look away when they 
           accidentally catch eyes. 

           EXT. FROG HOLLOW - FRONT PATIO - NIGHT

           The wind rolls hard over the waves of the waterfront. 

           Temple, cold without a jacket, chugs wine straight from the 
           bottle. Jittery, anxious, wired. 

                                 DAVINA (O.S.)
                        You’re so gay, dude. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        What?

           Davina looks so smug as she creeps toward Temple.  

                                 DAVINA
                        You gave her your jacket. That’s 
                        fucking gay. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        She was cold. 

                                 DAVINA 
                        I don’t go around giving my jacket 
                        to cold bitches.  

           Facts, though. Temple swigs wine. It’s all the confirmation 
           Davina needs and she’s oddly excited behind it. 

                                 DAVINA (CONT’D)
                        Not gonna lie, this is a relief. I 
                        was starting to worry you were like 
                        a serial killer or something. This 
                        is so much better.  

                                 TEMPLE
                        It is? 

                                 DAVINA
                        Two of my best friends are gay. I’m 
                        well-versed in the life. 

           Temple shakes her head. This kid is a migraine. 

                                 DAVINA (CONT’D)
                        Did Grandma know?

                                 TEMPLE
                             (the alcohol talking)
                        Nah. I was gonna tell her but your 
                        Mom told me to stay closeted to 
                        make it “easier” for everyone. 
                                 DAVINA
                        What? When?

                                 TEMPLE
                        Ten years ago. 

           The pieces click together in Davina’s mind. 

                                 DAVINA
                        She didn’t tell me that. That’s so 
                        fucked.    
                             (then, after a long, 
                              thoughtful beat)
                        Let’s go somewhere.

                                 TEMPLE
                        Now?

                                 DAVINA
                        Yeah. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        What kind of “somewhere,” though?

                                 DAVINA
                        A turn up. 

           Temple laughs. Intrigued despite how bad of an idea this is. 

                                 TEMPLE
                             (the tune of Frank 
                              Ocean’s “Solo”)
                        Might lose my jacket?

                                 DAVINA
                        And hit a solo, ayyyyy. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        We’re in the middle of dinner. 

                                 DAVINA
                        Don’t be a nerd. You were on the 
                        edge of cool with the gay thing. 

           Temple, wrestling --  

                                 TEMPLE
                        Fuck, I can’t believe I brought 
                        Belle here like that. I’m gonna 
                        tell her to come with us. 

           She starts back toward the restaurant. 
                                 DAVINA
                        Dope. Tell Ma and the kids, too, 
                        while you’re at it. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        What am I supposed to do?

                                 DAVINA
                        She’ll be fine. Let’s go. Come on, 
                        you deserve a real drink. 

           Temple goes to chug the rest of the wine before remembering 
           her manners and offering the bottle to Davina. Davina 
           politely declines. 

                                 DAVINA (CONT’D)
                        Chug! Chug! Chug! Okay, come on -- 
                        we can’t miss the train. 

           Temple flings the bottle to the water -- 

           SOUND UP: Something trippy like Uzi’s “Money Longer” over 
           MUSICAL MONTAGE -- 

           INT. RAVE - NIGHT

           PURPLE LIGHTS douse a sea of skin to create a new shade of 
           blue. QUICK CLIPS OF VARIOUS POINTS IN THE NIGHT: AN ANTSY 
           and ERRATIC Temple gives into delirium. A HYPED Davina 
           parties to the brink of collapse. 

           It’s sweaty and manic and FUN.

                                                               FORWARD:

           A group of late teens, early 20ers, DAVINA’S FRIENDS, 
           surround them. The wiry, nerdy one is MICHAEL, 19, Davina’s 
           unexpected boyfriend. He smothers her with kisses. 

           Davina’s friends try to feed them drinks. Davina declines. 
           Temple picks up the slack. 

                                                               FORWARD:

           As Temple and Davina dance -- 

           FIND DELILAH IN THE MIX, throwing that hair around to the 
           rhythm. Temple and Delilah sing the lyrics together, hit 
           matching dances. 

           Let’s just watch them -- the Wilde abandon. 

                                                               FORWARD:
           INT. RAVE - OUTSIDE BATHROOM - LATER

           The crew gathers. Michael snaps pictures on his phone -- 

                                 MICHAEL (V.O.)
                        You look more like her than even 
                        your Mom, Davy.

           He trails his fingers down their noses. Trippin’, trippin’. 

                                 DAVINA (V.O.)
                        We’re the last living Wildes... Do 
                        you realize that? Davina Wilde. 
                        Temple Wilde.    

                                 TEMPLE (V.O.)
                        What about Cherry? 

           Shady, long pause. 

                                 DAVINA (V.O.)
                        Do we have to claim her?

           Shady, long laugh. 

           MICHAEL’S POV

           MOVE IN ON Davina and Temple’s shellac eyes -- 

           QUICK CUTS OF PHOTOS: pressed together; back-to-back; 
           laughing; panicked; dancing; eyes closed; ears plugged; 
           tongues out; middle fingers up (Yonce-style); apart. (Note: 
           Before each flash, Delilah is there mimicking the girls, but 
           as soon as the frame freezes into the actual picture, SHE’S 
           GONE.) 

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           EXT. STREET - SIDEWALK - BACK TO SCENE

           QUIET. Every little sound HEIGHTENED. Listen to the wind and 
           the stomp of Temple and Davina’s shoes as they clonk down 
           the street, arm-in-arm. DELILAH hangs off Temple as Temple 
           struggles to stay upright. An eery combo of no sleep and 
           just... all of the alcohol, girl. 

           Davina’s friends are behind them, watching but pretending 
           they aren’t watching. 

                                 DAVINA
                        Do you have a girlfriend in LA? 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Girls in LA are trash.  
                                 DAVINA
                        That’s why you’ve been talking to 
                        Belle again? Cause small town 
                        chicks are better?

                                 TEMPLE
                        ...No. 

                                 DAVINA
                        Oh so she’s trash, too, then?

           Temple clocks the shade. 

                                 DAVINA (CONT’D)
                        You were in love with her. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        No I wasn’t. 
                             (then)
                        I mean, yeah, I was. Of course I 
                        was. 

                                 DAVINA
                        Did you tell her?

                                 TEMPLE
                        She didn’t care. 

                                 DAVINA
                        That’s wack. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        It was brief. 

                                 DAVINA
                        Well... life is kind of brief. Who 
                        wants Chinese food?

           They want Chinese food!

           INT. CLAY HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

           Temple barely makes the toilet in time for everything in her 
           stomach to come heaving up -- 

           INT. SHOWER - MOMENTS LATER

           The water’s so hot it nearly sizzles against Temple’s skin. 
           She slumps against the wall. 

           SOUND: BANGING ON THE SHOWER WALL   

           It jars us -- then Temple a beat behind. 
                                 AC
                        Hurry up. We need to leave in ten. 

           Temple struggles to orientate herself. She can barely think. 

                                 AC (CONT’D)
                        The aunts are gonna meet us in 
                        Dublin to see Momma’s plot -- 
                        unless you have more plans to party 
                        well into the morning with my 17-
                        year-old child. 

           If there was an oven or guillotine nearby, Temple would 
           stick her head in it. 

           INT. KITCHEN - LATER

           Temple basically crawls in where Davina eats breakfast and 
           AC talks with Otto in the phone. Even post-shower -- 

                                 DAVINA
                        You look like shit. 

                                 AC (PHONE)
                        It’s a long drive so we may be out 
                        there all day. You can pick up 
                        Tarzan, right? Thanks, honey. I’ll 
                        talk to you later. 

           AC notices Temple pouring herself some coffee. 

                                 AC (CONT’D)
                        No, no, you’ve had enough of that. 
                        You’ve barely slept. 

           But Temple’s in a foul, acidic mood --

                                 TEMPLE
                        Jesus, give it a rest. It’s a 
                        little late for the big sister act.    

           Davina cheers in support. 

                                 DAVINA
                        Yeah, bro, you tell her! Woooo.  

           AC watches Temple move off, concerned. Something’s wrong. 

                                                         TRANSITION TO:

           EXT. HIGHWAY - TRAVELING - DAY

           Find AC’s Mercedes eating highway alongside puerile business 
           execs in Teslas, BMWs, Lexuses, Escalades --  
           EXT. MAIN CITY ROADS - DAY

           Farther South, mid-price family cars replace luxury. Hondas, 
           Toyotas, Kias -- 

           EXT. BACKROADS - DAY

           The city disintegrates into dirt roads, blanketed by 
           stretches of a gorgeous green landscape. Now we have horses, 
           cows, chickens and tractors as we break into: 

           EXT. WILDE FAMILY MEMORIAL GROUNDS - DAY

           AC’s car trails Cherry’s down a dank, wet, dirt road. 
           Temple, nursing coffee in the passenger seat, pipes up.

                                 TEMPLE
                        What is this? Where are we? 

                                 AC
                        No, this can’t be it. 

           AC and Temple share a bracing look. All signs point to 
           bullshit ahead.  

           Beyond a row of rotting trees, a TINY CEMETERY opens up. 
           Garbage gathers on dull, cracked markers and headstones. The 
           grass, anemic and dry. This place hasn’t been properly 
           maintained in twenty years. 

           But Cherry’s car pulls up and parks like it’s no big deal. 

           EXT. CEMETERY - MOMENTS LATER

           AC, Temple and Davina cross to Cherry, Athena and Dixie. 

                                 AC
                        This isn’t the cemetery, is it?

                                 CHERRY
                        Our whole family line is out here, 
                        baby. Nana’s right up there. 

           The women start toward the other end of the cemetery. 

           Temple and AC hang back, mirrored shock. 

                                 AC
                        This has gotta be some kind of 
                        mistake. I’m gonna talk to them. 

                                 DAVINA
                        Guess this is what we get for 
                        putting Cherry in-charge of 
                        everything. 
                                 AC
                        Davina, can you for once not act 
                        like a child?  

           AC moves off after the aunts. 

                                 DAVINA
                             (only half-joking)
                        On second thought, since Ma wants 
                        to act like a bitch, let’s ditch 
                        her again. I got the keys... 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Sounds fun, Davina, but if you’ll 
                        excuse me, I need to go find a hole 
                        to put my mother in. 

           Temple leaves her looking a little stung.

           There’s a sliver of a plot left between Mary and Ralph. 
           Cherry points this space out. 

                                 CHERRY
                        So ‘Lilah would go here, next to 
                        Great-Granny and Ralph.

                                 AC
                        She wouldn’t even be next to Nana, 
                        which was the whole point of 
                        bringing her out here, Cherry. And 
                        I’m not gonna lie -- when you 
                        described it to us -- Oh. 

           AC braces herself, realizing she’s stepped on a half-empty 
           can of Coke just hanging out in the dead grass. Temple kicks 
           it away -- at least a tiny release of tension.

                                 AC (CONT’D)
                        This isn’t what we imagined. 

                                 CHERRY
                        Well, what were you imaginin’? We 
                        ain’t the Rockefellas. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHERRY (CONT'D)
                        Even though ‘Lilah always acted 
                        like she was from some royal line.  

                                 TEMPLE
                        She was. It skipped you. 

           AC takes Temple’s arm. Calm down. 

                                 AC
                        We don’t have to be the 
                        Rockefellers to show some respect. 
                        What if Temple and me wanted to be 
                        buried out here next to Momma? 
                        There isn’t even room. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Sure there is. We can push the 
                        weeds, dead trees and garbage back 
                        to squeeze in more dead bodies.  
                             (off everyone’s horrified 
                              silence)
                        Just spitballin’. 

                                 AC
                        You need to chill. 

           Temple wanders off. 

                                 DELILAH (O.S.)(PRE-LAP)
                        AC’s so diplomatic these days. 

           EXT. WEST CEMETERY - MOMENTS LATER

           Temple steps into frame at another end of the cemetery. 
           DELILAH drops an arm across her shoulders.  

           TIGHT ON EVAN IDALAH WILDE: 1979-1981. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Big name, short life. Didn’t you 
                        name her? 

           Delilah shrugs, she knows as much as Temple. 

           Temple turns in the direction of the aunts to shout: 

                                 TEMPLE (CONT’D)
                        Did my Momma name Leon’s kid?

                                 CHERRY
                        Sure did.

                                 DIXIE
                        Leon loved him some ‘Lilah. 
                        Everything she said was gold. 
           Temple looks back at Dixie who, at least in the sunlight, 
           appears to be trying to offer a smile. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        She picked out the twins’ names, 
                        too, didn’t she? 

                                 DIXIE
                        Yeah. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        You wanna be buried out here, 
                        Dixie? 

           Dixie shifts, uncomfortable. 

                                 DIXIE
                        That’ll be up to the girls. I’m 
                        sure they’ll wanna make sure they 
                        can come see me anytime they want. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        So no then. 

           Temple keeps exploring.  

           EXT. EAST CEMETERY - MOMENTS LATER

           Temple halts at the sight of a gaudy PEACOCK HEADSTONE. She 
           first has to make sure it’s real, can’t exactly trust her 
           mind these days. 

           ON THE MARKER: JARRELL DAVID JEFFERSON: 1958-1990. 

                                 DELILAH
                        What the fuck are we looking at? 

                                 CHERRY
                        My baby.  

           Cherry joins Temple’s side. Her proximity only twists 
           Temple’s energy into something darker, more anxious. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Who was he?

                                 CHERRY
                        My best friend growin’ up. He died 
                        before you were even a twinkle in 
                        the eye.

                                 TEMPLE
                        So you bought this peacock?
                                 CHERRY
                        It matched his personality. He was 
                        brash and sexy, livin’ gay and 
                        carefree in NYC, baby. Lived fast 
                        and died young. 

           Cherry tears up. She kisses the peacock and then rubs away 
           the stain of her lipstick. 

                                 CHERRY (CONT’D)
                        Rest in peace, JJ. 

           Cherry collects a spot of trash left on his marker. 

           SOUND UP: Twisted, LOUD insect buzzing -- 

           Temple slaps her own face HARD, trying to kill whatever the 
           hell that was. Cherry looks disconcerted. 

                                 CHERRY (CONT’D)
                        You alright, baby? Maybe you should 
                        sit in the car, get outta the sun.  

           Temple turns away, finds herself face-to-face with --  

           DELILAH, but no longer the youthful manifestation we’ve 
           seen. Instead, an animated, deteriorating CORPSE. The worst 
           way Temple could imagine seeing her. 

                                 DELILAH
                        Gay old JJ gets the very best. But 
                        her own sister? 

           Delilah darkens. 

                                 DELILAH (CONT’D)
                        You’re just gonna let them leave me 
                        in here. Like trash. Aren’t you? Of 
                        course you are. Embarrassing. 
                        Jesus, how did you get like this? 

           Her laugh chills. 

           Temple tries to get away. Athena and AC unknowingly 
           intercept.  

                                 DIXIE
                        So what do y’all think? 

           Delilah perches on the peacock. 

                                 DELILAH
                        Go ahead, tell them you love it. 

           AC awaits the verdict from Temple. 
           Temple turns back to the peacock. 

           A fucking peacock getting more respect than Delilah. 

           She gets a RUNNING START. 

           Her foot finds the peacock’s beak -- it CRACKS -- 

           Cherry gasps. 

           Temple kicks it again and again until the beak SNAPS. 

                          ATHENA
                                                       ANNA-CHLOE
           Oh, God -- 
                                              Temple, stop! 

                                                          DIXIE
                          CHERRY
           What the hell are you doin’? 
                                              Temple! 

           Temple takes another shot at the peacock, then another -- 
           chipping scars into the perfect paint. 

           Cherry grabs Temple by the collar. AC moves to get her off 
           Temple and gets knocked down -- 

                                 AC
                        Oh my God. 

           Davina helps AC to her feet as -- 

           Temple heaves up a piece of stone and throws it like a 
           javelin at the peacock’s feathers. It BREAKS. 

           Cherry, devastated, rushes to collect the pieces. 

           Dixie and Athena, hearts pounding, don’t know what to do. 

           All AC and Davina can do is gape at Temple. 

           Temple wipes the sweat off her brow. Surveys the damage. 
           That feels better.  

           She turns to stumble back to the car. 

           EXT. THE CARS - MOMENTS LATER

           Cherry catches up to Temple. 

                                 CHERRY
                        What the hell is wrong with you?

           Temple rounds on her. AC gets between them. 
                                 TEMPLE
                        You try to trick me into burying my 
                        mother in a fucking swamp so you 
                        can get in a final jab? Fuck you, 
                        Cherry. 

                                 AC
                        Temple, stop. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        You’re defending her now? Really? 

           Athena crosses herself in prayer. 

                                 ATHENA
                        I reach out to You, the Father of 
                        compassion and the Source of every 
                        comfort, asking You to touch them 
                        with Your unfailing love and 
                        kindness -- 

           Now, Temple unleashes on Athena -- 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Shut the fuck up, Athena. Your 
                        prayers aren’t gonna bring my 
                        mother back.  

                                 CHERRY
                        You ain’t the only one who lost 
                        somebody, Temple! We lost our 
                        sister. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        You think that’s the same? 

                                 CHERRY
                        It’s family. 

           Temple scoffs. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        I’m outta here. 

                                 CHERRY
                        Thank God he took ‘Lilah when he 
                        did. She’d be ashamed to see who 
                        you’ve become.  

           Temple tears forward, FIST-FIRST. Cherry braces for a hit.

                                 AC
                        Temple! 
                                 DAVINA
                             (softer)
                        Temple... 

           Temple’s fist falls limp. AC takes the opportunity to muscle 
           her to the car. 

           INT./EXT. CAR - DAY

           AC flies down the road. Hands shaking. 

                                 AC
                        I don’t even know how to fix this. 
                        Temple, what were you thinking? 

                                 DAVINA
                        Maybe that Cherry’s an asshole! How 
                        could you even defend her right 
                        now?

                                 AC
                        Sit back and stay out of this. 
                             (re: Temple)
                        I want a real answer. 

                                 DAVINA
                        She already gave you one! 

           SOUND: Davina and AC’s arguing FADE TO STATIC as a catatonic 
           Temple loses focus --  

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           INT. CLAY HOUSE - GUEST ROOM - NIGHT

           We can hear the water clearly through the open window.  

           Temple sits up in bed. Her dead eyes flicker open and 
           closed. She’s weak. The stress of this in her face and 
           hands, chest and those slivers of muscle between her 
           shoulder blades.  

                                 TEMPLE
                             (a whisper)
                        I have to sleep. I’m sorry, Momma. 
                        I have to sleep. I have to. 

                                 DELILAH
                        Let’s take a walk. 

           Delilah smiles warmly from the window. She gestures Temple 
           over. Temple follows. 

           SOUND UP: Leon Bridges’ “River”
           EXT. CLAY HOUSE - RIVERFRONT - NIGHT

           Wind bullies the waves toward the bank. It’s going to storm. 

           Delilah’s walking too fast for Temple to keep up. She leaps 
           over the wall into the water and disappears.  

           Temple slips in slushy dirt. She looks back to AC’s house --

           TEMPLE’S POV 

           It’s gone. There’s only water now. A world of water. 

           Exhaustion weighs Temple down -- finally winning -- crushing 
           her into the earth. And she sinks. Giving up. 

                                 DELILAH
                        Just a little farther, baby.

           Delilah emerges from the water. It only gathers around her 
           ankles -- shallow for Delilah where it’s deep for Temple. 
           She offers Temple her hand. 

                                 DELILAH (CONT’D)
                        Almost there. Let’s go to sleep. 

           Temple soldiers on into the water. The waves battle back but 
           she powers desperately toward Delilah. Almost there... 
           Almost there... As Temple gives herself to the waves -- 

                                 DELILAH (CONT’D)
                        It’s over. You can sleep now.  

           SNAP OUT OF TEMPLE’S POV TO REVEAL -- 

           The world as is. The quiet Clay house in the background. 

           And Temple floats in the water. 

           It starts to rain as she finally falls asleep. 

                                                            OVER BLACK:

           SOUND UP: STEADY, BEEPING MONITORS -- 

           INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           Temple awakens in a sterilized patient room. Dry, 
           dehydrated. Panic sets in as disorientation fades. She 
           realizes she’s tubed to a hospital bed. Alone.  

           It’s horrifying. Temple panics, the flight instinct takes 
           over and she TUGS at her IV, trying to get it out of her 
           vein so she can go. 
           SOUND: RUNNING FAUCET -- 

           AC emerges from the bathroom. 

                                 AC
                        Whoa, hey, hey, don’t do that. It’s 
                        okay. Just relax. 

           She pries Temple’s hands off the IV and gently pushes her 
           back to the bed. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        What’s happening? Where am I?

                                 AC
                        You almost drowned last night. Ms. 
                        Carol found you when she was out 
                        for her morning walk. You were 
                        delirious. The doctor said you 
                        haven’t slept in over a week. 

           Temple tries to lick her lips but her mouth is too dry and 
           tight. AC reaches for ice cubes but she doesn’t want them. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        What day is it? My flight... 

                                 AC
                        You can take a later flight. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        What are you talking about? 

                                 AC
                        Listen to me, that’s the last thing 
                        you need to worry about right now. 
                        I talked to Cherry. She’s not mad 
                        at you. She understands how hard 
                        this all is.
                             (then, prepared)
                        The aunts are gonna come see you 
                        today and they’re gonna help me get 
                        Momma moved back to Augusta. We all 
                        agreed it’s best to lay her to rest 
                        here. 

           Temple’s confusion twists to anger. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        We all agreed? No, she’s gonna be 
                        buried in Dublin. 

                                 AC
                        You said yourself that cemetery 
                        isn’t good enough for her. 
                                 TEMPLE
                        We can get it cleaned up. The 
                        city’s supposed to do that anyway, 
                        I’ll call the Mayor myself -- 

           AC takes Temple’s hand gentle, but firm. Temple bristles, 
           feeling herself being handled. 

                                 AC
                        Sweetheart, Dublin just isn’t the 
                        right place to put Momma, okay? 
                        We’re gonna put her here in 
                        Augusta, at that pretty memorial 
                        ground I told you about. I’m gonna 
                        take you there so you can see it 
                        yourself. I want you to be happy 
                        with everything but I’m gonna take 
                        the reigns on this now, okay? 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Oh, I see. You want Momma here with 
                        you. So you can put some crazy glue 
                        on the cracks like usual and 
                        pretend everything’s okay.  

                                 AC
                        That’s not what I’m trying --

                                 TEMPLE
                        You had ten years to fix things. 
                        Now that she’s dead, you think you 
                        get absolution by default? 

           Temple wrenches her hand away, snatching out her IV but not 
           even flinching -- 

                                 TEMPLE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want her here with you and 
                        you wanna know why? She was my 
                        family, my only family and when I 
                        come home to see family, I don’t 
                        wanna have to see you -- do you 
                        understand that? 

           AC goes limp, stunned. 

                                 TEMPLE (CONT’D)
                        I’m done. 

           Temple hauls out of bed, ignoring the blood pooling around 
           her IV. She snatches her jeans off the visiting chair -- 

           The Clays appear in the doorway with balloons and flowers. 
                                 OTTO
                        Temple of the Dog, you’re up --

           Temple shoulders past them and out the door. 

           AC still can’t move. 

           EXT. RIVERWALK CITY PARK - DAY

           Temple lingers by a bench (away from the water) in 
           yesterday’s wrinkled clothes. She’s still wearing her 
           HOSPITAL ID BRACELET, prescription crumpled in her hand. 

           BELLE jogs past -- 

           Temple jumps in to match speed but fuck, that is a feat. She 
           goes down like a pile of bricks. Belle, double-taking to see 
           her, circles back. 

                                 BELLE
                        Wowwwww! Really? You have a lot of 
                        nerve, I’ll give you that. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Would an apology make this better 
                        or worse?

                                 BELLE
                        An apology? Shucks, I can’t imagine 
                        what that’d be for. Maybe for using 
                        me as a shield against your batshit 
                        family, then abandoning me? You are 
                        truly trash. 

           She starts to run off, but you know what, there’s more --

                                 BELLE (CONT’D)
                        You know, what’s happening to you 
                        is the worst thing I could imagine 
                        happening to anyone and I just 
                        wanna be there for you but you’re 
                        pushing me away like always. Even 
                        when it couldn’t be more obvious 
                        that you need somebody. I don’t get 
                        why. Why, Temple? 

                                 TEMPLE
                        I don’t know, Belle, maybe because 
                        my life is shit and I have no 
                        fucking idea what I’m doing. 
                             (then, softer)
                        I keep hoping this is a bad 
                        nightmare but I never wake up. 

           A rare display of vulnerability from Temple. It isn’t lost 
           on Belle. She can’t help but soften. 

                                 TEMPLE (CONT’D)
                        Can I make it up to you? 

                                 BELLE
                        No. 

           Belle takes off running. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        But I’m a patient. I was 
                        hospitalized last night.  

           Temple angles the bracelet as proof. Belle returns, alarmed.

                                 BELLE
                        What happened?

                                 TEMPLE
                        They said some lady found me 
                        unconscious in the water outside 
                        AC’s house. Took me to the hospital 
                        and pumped me full of fluids. 

           Belle immediately moves into caretaker mode.

                                 BELLE
                        What were you doing out there? You 
                        can’t even swim! Come sit down. 

           Temple lets Belle redirect her to the bench. Belle shakes 
           her head at Temple. Can’t hide a touch of affection. 

                                 BELLE (CONT’D)
                        Headcase. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        You don’t know the half of it. I 
                        also destroyed somebody’s grave. 

                                 BELLE
                        You did what? 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Fucking Cherry took me and AC out 
                        to my Nana’s grave where I wanted 
                        to bury my Mom. But then we get 
                        there and it’s a dump. And Cherry 
                        was acting like it’s okay, like -- 

                                 BELLE
                        Like it’s good enough for your Mom. 

           Temple appreciates that so, so much. 
                                 TEMPLE
                        Anyway, I -- Cherry bought this 
                        peacock for her best friend and I 
                        kind of... attacked it. 

           Belle bursts out laughing. 

                                                     TEMPLE (CONT'D)
                           BELLE
           You swung on a fake peacock?  
                                              It’s not funny! 

                                 TEMPLE (CONT’D)
                        She said she got it cause he was so 
                        colorful and full of life and 
                        “himself.” He was gay. Cause you 
                        know, all us queens are peacocks.  

           Belle actually wheezes. 

                                 TEMPLE (CONT’D)
                        Asshole. This isn’t funny. 

           Belle laughs harder. It’s infectious.  

                                 TEMPLE (CONT’D)
                        So I can still make you laugh. Good 
                        to know. 

           Belle rolls her eyes but doesn’t deny it. 

                                 TEMPLE (CONT’D)
                             (quiet, painful)
                        I can’t be in AC’s house right now. 

           A beat. 

                                 BELLE
                        ...Me and Ya-Ya are gonna go to the 
                        cages tonight. Down to third-wheel?

           INT. BATTING CAGES - NIGHT

           WIDE ON Temple, Ya-Ya and Belle under twinkly lights. Temple 
           struggles to swing the bat, can’t hit a single ball. Belle 
           attempts to teach form while Ya-Ya heaps encouraging 
           gestures. Temple keeps failing, however. They laugh at her 
           but never leave her hanging. 

                                                               TIME CUT TO:

           EXT. BATTING CAGES - NIGHT

           Temple is the last out behind Belle and Ya-Ya -- 

           DELILAH WAITS in the archway. Gardenia in her hair. (Note: 
           From here onward, her clothes and mannerisms now mirror her  
           conservative style we saw when she was alive.) 

                                 DELILAH 
                        I woulda liked her, you know.

           Temple, frozen. 

           INT. BELLE’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Cozy and warm with spots of child-friendly pop-art. Not to 
           mention all baseball everything all the time. 

           ON THE TV: 1997’s CINDERELLA.

           Temple sprawls out on the sectional to watch Ya-Ya who’s 
           GETTING HER LIFE from an enchanting Whitney Houston playing 
           Fairy Godmother to Brandy’s Cinderella. 

                                 YA-YA
                        Impossible! For a plain yellow 
                        pumpkin to become a golden 
                        carriage. Impossible! For a plain 
                        country bumpkin and a prince to 
                        join in marriage... 

           INT. KITCHEN BAR - SAME TIME

           Belle watches, amused, from the open kitchen where she’s 
           making a special tea for Temple. CLOCK THE MARIJUANA-INFUSED 
           HONEY she stirs in. Temple smirks. 

           YA-YA AND TEMPLE - SAME TIME

           Ya-Ya’s... troubling vocals threaten to overtake Whitney’s 
           pristine ones. Belle jumps in to irritate her: 

                                 BELLE
                         -- And four white mice could never 
                        be turned to horses. 
                             (flubbing the lyrics)
                        And blah-be-be-ba-blah-umm-uhhh-
                        umpf -- possible!  

                                 YA-YA
                        Mom, I don’t want backup -- you 
                        don’t even know the song. 

                                 BELLE
                        Wait a minute, you can’t do what I 
                        do on the mic.
                             (to the tune of 
                              “Impossible”)
                        Ya-Ya’s-grounded-til-she’s-fourteen-
                        ble-blah-horses! 
           Ya-Ya giggles uncontrollably. 

                                 YA-YA
                        You’re messing it up. 

                                 BELLE
                        I’m doing the remix. You’d know 
                        about that if your finger was on 
                        the pulse. 

           Belle comes around the corner. Hands off the tea to Temple 
           and turns off the TV.  

                                 YA-YA
                        Five more minutes. 

                                 BELLE
                        Granted. Just enough for you to 
                        brush your teeth and get changed. 

           Though deflated, Ya-Ya obediently gets up. 

                                 YA-YA
                        Goodnight, Temple.  

                                 TEMPLE
                        Goodnight. 

           Ya-Ya slumps down the hall. 

                                 BELLE
                        I’ll be in in a minute. 

           Belle and Temple, linger. Temple sips tea. 

                                 BELLE (CONT’D)
                        How is it? 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Just what the doctor ordered. 

                                 BELLE
                             (fondly)
                        Indica always puts you out like a 
                        light. 

           Temple stirs her tea. Suddenly thinking about -- 

                                 TEMPLE
                        We would talk on the phone for a 
                        least a few minutes every night 
                        before bed. Every single night. 

           Belle takes Temple’s hand. 
                                 BELLE
                        Stay here tonight, okay?   

                                 TEMPLE
                        Are you sure?

                                 BELLE
                        You’re always welcome anywhere I 
                        am. It’s like you never left. 

           INT. BELLE’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Belle pulls Ya-Ya’s door closed before heading back to 
           Temple.

                                 BELLE
                        My homie never wants to sleep. She 
                        thinks she’s you.  

           She notices the couch-bed Temple’s making up. Bristles. 

                                 BELLE (CONT’D)
                        What’s all this?

                                 TEMPLE
                        I don’t wanna be in your way. This 
                        is fine. 

           Belle starts pulling up sheets. 

                                 BELLE
                        You’re not in my way. There’s 
                        plenty of room. Come on. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        No, really --  

                                 BELLE
                        Babe. 

           She takes Temple’s shoulders. 

                                 BELLE (CONT’D)
                        I know you struggle with social 
                        cues but read the room. It offends 
                        me that you’re trying to sleep out 
                        here. Is that clear enough? 

           She earns a laugh and a nod. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Crystal. 

           Belle takes the pillows and happily tosses them. 
           INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Temple and Belle press in together up against the counter. 
           It’s a tight fit. We watch them in the mirror. 

           Temple rubs oil on her hair. Belle ties hers up into a bun. 

           They wash their faces together. 

           Brush their teeth together. 

           Belle rubs a towel over Temple’s wet face.  

           All that’s left --  

           INT. BELLE’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Temple and Belle lay in bed together. Belle plays with 
           Temple’s hair. Fingers inch toward skin. Hearts make a 
           racket. Pillowy voices. Belle gets closer.

                                 BELLE
                        I almost shaved my whole head last 
                        year. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Oh yeah? Why?

                                 BELLE
                        I kept trying to grow it out but 
                        the under-shave never comes in 
                        even. You gotta show me how to get 
                        mine as healthy as yours. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        You got it.  

           Belle lays her head on the same pillow as Temple’s. Temple’s 
           eyes widen just so and we realize Belle’s touching her 
           somewhere we can’t see. She tries to coax Temple closer. 

                                 BELLE
                             (delicate)
                        Were you gonna hurt yourself? Is 
                        that how you ended up in the lake?

                                 TEMPLE
                        I don’t know. I just wanted it to 
                        not be real. 

                                 BELLE
                        Do you want me to be real?

           Temple nods. Finally leans in and kisses Belle with ten 
           years of pent-up frustration. 
           Belle sinks into it like she’s never wanted to be anywhere 
           else. Like it’s all she’s been waiting for -- 

           And Temple tries to let it happen. She wants but -- 

           She can’t. She just can’t. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Sorry. 

           She presses a kiss to Belle’s forehead. 

                                 TEMPLE (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna get the light. 

           Belle’s disappointment is ours. 

           We’re in darkness, but no one sleeps. 

           INT. BELLE'S APARTMENT - OUTSIDE KITCHEN - DAY

           Temple lingers in the archway where Belle and Ya-Ya are 
           visible having breakfast at the island counter. 

           Temple hesitates to go in, still embarrassed about last 
           night. She looks dazed, nursing a perpetual exhaustion 
           hangover. 

                                 BELLE
                        Coming in or are we into stalking 
                        now? 

           Temple can’t help hanging her head, even as she gratefully 
           steps in --

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           She offers an awkward wave. Joins Ya-Ya at the counter.  

                                 TEMPLE
                        Morning. 

                                 BELLE
                        Coffee? Because I know you didn’t 
                        sleep. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        No thanks. I don’t even think I can 
                        keep it down. 

           Belle frowns, a bit alarmed by Temple’s eyes. 

                                 BELLE
                        Are you okay? If possible, you seem 
                        even farther away than usual. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BELLE (CONT'D)
                        Like you’re on a different planet 
                        as opposed to just in a different 
                        time zone. 

           SOUND: Temple’s phone RINGS. ON THE SCREEN: DAVINA CALLING. 

           A beat before she hits accept. 

                                 DAVINA (O.S.)(PHONE)
                        Yo. Are you over the Pacific Ocean 
                        yet?

                                 TEMPLE (PHONE)
                        What?

                                 DAVINA (O.S.)(PHONE)
                        Just using past behavior to predict 
                        present and future behavior. 

                                 TEMPLE (PHONE)
                        I’m uh, at Belle’s. 

                                 DAVINA (O.S.)(PHONE)
                        Oooooo.... 

                                 TEMPLE (PHONE)
                             (a warning)
                        What’s up, Davina?

                                 DAVINA (O.S.)(PHONE)
                        I need your help with something. 
                        Come with me somewhere. 

           Temple fights an eye roll. We’ve heard that before. 

                                 TEMPLE (PHONE)
                        I’m not sure that’s a good idea. 
                        I’m not sure... Anna-Chloe would 
                        think that’s a good idea. 

           Temple ignores Belle’s prickly stare. 

                                 DAVINA (O.S.)(PHONE)
                        We need to insert a little 
                        separation of sister and niece 
                        here. Ma’s issues with you aren’t 
                        my issues. Don’t you agree? 
                             (Temple doesn’t disagree)
                        Dope -- pick you up in twenty. 

           Temple puts her phone away. Belle eyes her suspiciously. 

                                 BELLE
                        Getting mixed up in AC and Davina’s 
                        relationship really a good idea? 
                                 TEMPLE
                        I’ll see you. 

           Belle watches her move off, uneasy. 

           SOUND UP: Lazy, cruising track like “Top” from Uzi  

           INT./EXT. DAVINA’S CAR - TRAVELING - DAY

           CUTS OF Davina’s car whipping down the road, through this 
           lane and that one -- so it’s everywhere all at once -- 

           Davina and Temple bop to the music, quietly in-sync -- for 
           the moment at least. 

                                                           TIME CUT TO:

           INT./EXT. DAVINA’S CAR - TRAVELING - LATER

           Still on the move, but with the music turned down. 

           Temple, energy waned, slumps in her seat. Her eyelids are 
           garage doors, threatening to fall closed any moment. 

                                 DAVINA
                        It’ll take five minutes. 

           Temple rubs her forehead. Can’t believe what she’s hearing. 

                                 DAVINA (CONT’D)
                        It’s just an abortion. It’s not a 
                        big deal.  

                                 TEMPLE
                        Is it Michael’s? 

                                 DAVINA
                        Ma hates him and for no reason. 
                        She’s so extra.  

                                 TEMPLE
                        He better be paying for this. 

                                 DAVINA
                        Oh yeah. Duh.  

           She hands off her phone. ON THE SCREEN: VENMO NOTIFICATION -- 
           Michael just sent you $604.71 [skull emoji][baby emoji]. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Davina... 
                                 DAVINA
                        I thought you of all people would 
                        understand this. Look, it’ll be 
                        quick. We can get food after. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        You won’t wanna eat after. 

                                 DAVINA
                        You’ve had one? 

                                 TEMPLE
                        No, I just... I went with a friend 
                        once. She was gonna get one but 
                        then she changed her mind.   

           Davina puts pieces together but doesn’t pry. 

                                 DAVINA
                        What do you say? Will you help me? 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Pull over. I’m gonna call AC. 

                                 DAVINA
                        What? Dude, no! I’m trusting you 
                        with something right now. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        If AC finds out I did this without 
                        telling her -- 

                                 DAVINA
                        Ma wasn’t thinking about me when 
                        you guys decided to bury Grandma 
                        two hours away. Hella shady but I 
                        forgave her and stayed out of it. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        So this is payback?

           Temple unlocks her phone screen. Pulls up AC’s name.  

                                 DAVINA
                        Wait! We’re here. Look. 

           The PLANNED PARENTHOOD office looms in the distance.

           INT. DAVINA’S CAR - PLANNED PARENTHOOD - MOMENTS LATER

           Davina parks. Kills the engine. They sit in stillness. 

                                 DAVINA
                        You always look so tired. 
                                 TEMPLE
                        I am so tired. 

                                 DAVINA
                        Ma thinks you were wildin’ swinging 
                        on Cherry like that but I get it. 

           She finds Temple’s eyes. 

                                 DAVINA (CONT’D)
                        She also thinks I don’t remember 
                        life before she met Otto -- wrong 
                        again. They got married, had Tarzan 
                        and turned into this perfect little 
                        family. I love them, I do, but it’s 
                        different and honestly, when it was 
                        just you, me, Grandma and Ma, that 
                        was the last time I felt like I 
                        belonged anywhere. Ma and Cherry 
                        and those guys have no idea what 
                        it’s like to be us. The black 
                        sheep. 

           Temple accepts that with a nod. For the first time since 
           losing Delilah, someone’s speaking her language. 

                                 DAVINA (CONT’D)
                        I’m not gonna make the mistake Ma 
                        did with my Dad -- or sperm donor, 
                        for real. 

           She pops open the glove department and reveals an early 00s 
           MP3 PLAYER. It’s scratched up and of zero monetary value but 
           she handles it with care. 

                                 DAVINA (CONT’D)
                        You gave me this when I was a kid. 
                        Put all these songs on it for me. I 
                        listened to it for ten years. 
                        Sometimes with Grandma. 
                             (then)
                        I never stopped thinking about you. 
                        Did you stop thinking about me? 

           Temple shakes her head no. 

           ON DAVINA as that sinks in. She smiles. 

                                 DAVINA (CONT’D)
                        So? Will you help me?  

           INT. CLAY HOUSE - DAVINA’S ROOM - DAY

           AC peeks in on the sleeping Davina. Blows a frustrated 
           breath at the state of her messy bedroom.  
           She slips in quietly to collect dirty clothes. Grabs the 
           sweatpants we just saw Davina wearing at Planned Parenthood 
           where they’re slung over her desk chair. AC notices peppered 
           blood stains inside. 

           Holds on them a beat before stuffing them deep into her 
           laundry bag. 

           INT. CLAY HOUSE - VARIOUS - LATER

           QUICK CUTS of AC distracting herself with cleaning. 
           Scrubbing counters, crevices -- even the floors -- with 
           disturbing aplomb. 

           EXT. CLAY HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - LATER

           AC washes Davina’s car. She gets into a good crevice on the 
           passenger side. Pops the door open to get a better angle.   

           She kneels down to gather trash on the floor, slows at the 
           sight of: Davina’s battered MP3 player. 

           She rolls it over in her hands, thoughtfully. 

           INT. CLAY HOUSE - LATER

           AC opens a bible. Her hands shake as she finds prayer, 
           Psalms 23. The Lord is my temple. I shall not want.   

           EXT. PARK - DAY 

           Belle and Ya-Ya play in the grass together. 

                                 BELLE
                        Temple, come handle my lightweight! 

           Temple hangs back on a bench. Her dazed, trancelike energy a 
           sharp contrast to Belle and Ya-Ya’s joy. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Did you ever know AC broke my 
                        easel? The first one you got me, 
                        too. She took it to tease me, ended 
                        up dropping it down the stairs “by 
                        accident.” 

           REVEAL DELILAH, sharing the bench. Lounging. Relaxed. Smug.  

                                 DELILAH
                        Little liar. 

                                 TEMPLE 
                        What?
                                 DELILAH
                        You’re lying on AC. Rewriting 
                        history, willy-nilly. You dropped 
                        that easel down the stairs, running 
                        in the house after I told you to 
                        stop. AC tried to fix it for you, 
                        but she couldn’t. So you got mad at 
                        her when you shoulda been mad at 
                        yourself. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        That’s bullshit. 

           Delilah smirks. Her amusement lights a fire under Temple. 
           Temple shakes her head, frustration mounting. 

                                 TEMPLE (CONT’D)
                        You would’ve like Belle, huh? You 
                        know the reason I never told you 
                        about her? Cause AC told me not to. 
                        She said that me being gay was a 
                        sin that went against everything 
                        you ever taught us about God a-and 
                        faith. And if I told you who I 
                        really was, you wouldn’t love me. 

                                 DELILAH
                        I know that. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Good, I’m glad you know. And? 

                                 DELILAH
                        You have to forgive her. 

           Temple rears up from the bench, affronted. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        What -- why? Why do I have to 
                        forgive her? 

                                 DELILAH
                        Cause what else is there? 

                                 TEMPLE
                        I’m outta here. 

           Temple storms off. Delilah laughs, amused. 

                                 DELILAH
                        Oh what, you don’t miss me when I’m 
                        not saying what you wanna hear? 

           Belle notices Temple leaving. Concerned. 
           INT. BELLE’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Temple stares at herself in the mirror. Robotic and rubbed 
           raw from exhaustion. 

           SOUND: Her phone RINGS. ON THE SCREEN: AC CALLING. 

           A beat before Temple picks up. Holds the line in silence.  

                                 AC (O.S.)(PHONE)
                        ...Hello?

                                 TEMPLE (PHONE)
                        Yeah. 

                                 AC (O.S.)(PHONE)
                        Look, the home called. They’re done 
                        with... Momma. I’m gonna go see her 
                        in the morning. I think you should 
                        come see her, too. 

           Temple takes a long moment on her reflection.  

                                 AC (O.S.)(PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Hello? Temple?

                                 TEMPLE (PHONE)
                        Yeah. I’ll be there. 

           INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY 

           The FUNERAL HOME DIRECTOR, 50s, leads Temple and AC inside.  

                                 FUNERAL DIRECTOR
                        I’ll give you a moment. 

           He steps out. 

           Temple and AC fan out on either side of the table. 

           Here rests DELILAH -- and not the flushed-cheeked apparition 
           we’re used to. It twists our stomachs seeing her like this.  
           Dead. In the scary, human way that you don’t come back from.  

           AC pulls the blanket up. Doesn’t want her to be cold. 

                                 AC
                        You took Davina to get an abortion. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        She told you. 
                                 AC
                        No, she didn’t. 
                             (then)
                        So you took her then. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        I thought it’d be better if she had 
                        an adult with her. And she didn’t 
                        want you, so. 

           It’s hard to hear but AC nods, acknowledging that truth. 

                                 AC
                        Thank you. My worst fear is her 
                        being out in the world alone. 

           Temple seems shocked. Gratitude isn’t what she expected. 

                                 AC (CONT’D)
                        Thank you. I mean it. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        You’re welcome. 

           AC nods, long, fast strokes -- she’s in her own mind now, 
           not really hearing Temple anymore. 

           She crosses to the door. Temple follows, thinking they’re 
           leaving -- but AC SHUTS IT, locking them inside. 

                                 AC
                        I’m sorry, Momma. I’m so sorry that 
                        you raised such an arrogant piece 
                        of shit. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        What?

           She ROUNDS on Temple, suddenly unleashing -- 

                                 AC
                        You arrogant piece of shit! 

           The force of her voice sends Temple staggering back. 

                                 AC (CONT’D)
                        How dare you. You think I don’t 
                        know why you took her to get that 
                        abortion? It wasn’t about helping 
                        her not make a huge mistake before 
                        her life even really starts, it was 
                        to get back at me. 
                                 TEMPLE
                        I was helping her. I stopped her 
                        from becoming you. 

                                 AC
                        Screw you.  

           AC tears around the corner of Delilah’s table like she might 
           take a swing. 

           Temple jolts back against the table -- RATTLING DELILAH -- 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Welcome back. 

           It’s quiet and awful. Delilah’s body disturbed between them. 

                                 AC
                        I did change. I changed, Temple. 
                        You didn’t. You keep saying you’re 
                        alone but I’m right here. You just 
                        keep punishing me -- you --  

           She can barely get the words out. She seems to be yelling at 
           Temple, pleading to God and placating Delilah all at once. 

                                 AC (CONT’D)
                        God help me. You just keep 
                        punishing me.  

           AC covers Delilah’s hands with her own.  

                                 AC (CONT’D)
                        She keeps punishing me. 
                             (in prayer)
                        Our father. Please forgive me. 

           Temple stares at Delilah’s body, willing it to life. Wanting 
           to, needing to see her -- 

           Nothing. Delilah doesn’t move. 

           She’s gone. 

           EXT. RIVERFRONT - NIGHT

           The storm breaks.

           INT. CAFÉ - NIGHT

           It’s only sparsely crowded, just a FATHER playing with his 
           kids and a couple of TWENTYSOMETHING SINGLES. 

           Temple steps in. She looks like she’s been through the 
           ringer. Spots Belle at the counter. Beelines. 
                                 TEMPLE
                        Hey. 

                                 BELLE
                        Whoa, what happened? 

                                 TEMPLE
                        You look nice. 

                                 BELLE
                        Did you get my message? I might be 
                        out a little late tonight, but Ya-
                        Ya’s with my Mom if you want the 
                        place to yourself.  

           Temple pulls Belle into her body, surprising her. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Hang out with me. 

           Belle gently pushes Temple away. Discomforted by Temple’s 
           off energy. 

                                 BELLE
                        Temple, are you okay? 

           A beautiful GIRL, 20s, steps in, all smiles as she 
           approaches. Touches Belle’s arm. 

                                 BELLE’S DATE
                        Belle, hey. Sorry I’m late. 

           Oh. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Or I’ll just get out of your face. 

                                 BELLE
                        We’ll talk later, Temple. 

           Temple turns to go. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Nah, it’s okay. I should’ve known. 

           And Belle knows better than to take the bait but -- 

                                 BELLE
                             (re: date)
                        I’m sorry, excuse me. 

           She follows Temple into the storm.  
           EXT. CAFÉ - MOMENTS LATER

                                 BELLE
                        You should’ve known? 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Don’t keep your girlfriend waiting. 

                                 BELLE
                        I don’t wanna fight. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Did you know, the night I told you 
                        I was in love with you, I waited 
                        outside your house for three hours?  

                                 BELLE
                        I don’t wanna hear this. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Yeah, I waited three hours to tell 
                        you I loved you and you told me you 
                        were fucking pregnant. 

                                 BELLE
                        Oh! Is that what happened? Thanks 
                        for the walk down memory lane.  

                                 TEMPLE
                        It’s ten years later and I’m still 
                        just waiting around while you pick 
                        someone else -- nothing’s changed. 

           Belle SHOVES Temple with a decade’s worth of pint-up rage. 

                                 BELLE
                        You don’t want me! You never want 
                        me. Not ten years ago, not last 
                        night when I threw myself at you 
                        and you just laid there. Delilah 
                        didn’t even know who I was. She 
                        thought I was just some girl, your 
                        “friend.” When it really mattered, 
                        you never came through for me -- 
                        ever, not once. 
                             (then, louder -- ANGRIER)
                        The most important person in your 
                        life went to her grave thinking I 
                        was no one, Temple! But you waited? 

                                 BELLE’S DATE (O.S.)
                        Belle? Is everything okay? 

           She appears in the b.g., threatening to step in. 
           Temple goes without a word. There are no words.   

           WE STAY ON BELLE, who’s shaking. 

                                                         TRANSITION TO:

           EXT. AUGUSTA REGIONAL AIRPORT (AGS) - DAY

           The sky, streaked ugly with black and grey as wind slashes 
           through water and trees. 

           INT. PLANE - DAY

           Temple stares out at the clouds. Numb, exhausted, awake. 

           INT. LOS ANGELES - TEMPLE’S LOFT - DAY

           Wyatt lounges on the chase. 

           SOUND: A KEY IN THE LOCK -- 

           Wyatt jumps in. Rushes to help Temple get her stuff inside. 

                                 WYATT
                        Temple. You’re early. Did you get 
                        everything... done? 

           She shakes her head no. 

                                 WYATT (CONT’D)
                        Are you hungry? I’ll cook for you. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        I just need to sleep.

           She disappears into her bedroom. 

           INT. TEMPLE’S BEDROOM - DAY

           SUNLIGHT sticks to the windows. 

           Temple, in bed. Not sleeping. Eyes red. 

                                                             QUICK CUT:

           INT. TEMPLE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT - LATER

           Moonlight sticks to the windows. 

           Temple, in bed. Not sleeping. Eyes read. 

           SOUND: Her phone DINGS with an alert. ON THE SCREEN: NEW 
           VOICEMAILS. 

           Temple hits play. 
                                 CO-WORKER (O.S.)(PHONE)
                        Hey, Temple, you’re back in LA? 
                        How’s the family holding up? Hope 
                        to see you at work soon. 

           Delete. Next. 

                                 NIA (O.S.)(PHONE)
                        Temple. I bumped into Wyatt. He 
                        told me what happened. 
                             (long silence; then)
                        I’m so sorry. 

           ... Delete. 

                                                             QUICK CUT:

           INT. TEMPLE’S ROOM - DAY - LATER

           First blue shadow of dawn. 

           Temple blinks at the ceiling. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Momma?

           REVEAL DELILAH in the corner, knitting.  

                                 TEMPLE (CONT’D)
                        Momma.

           Delilah ignores her. Like Temple’s the one who isn’t there. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           SOUND UP: INCESSANT KNOCKING (PRE-LAP) 

           INT. TEMPLE’S BEDROOM - DAY

           It’s annoying enough to stir Temple out of her catatonia. 

           She grabs her phone, TEXTS WYATT: Can you answer the door?

           WYATT’S REPLY: Gone to brunch, honey. Ignore it. Sleep :) 

           She tries, but -- 

           SOUND: MORE FUCKING KNOCKING.  

           Temple hauls herself out of bed -- 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Temple pulls the door open, ready to read whoever’s on the 
           other side their motherfucking rights -- 
           DAVINA. Or, Davina’s back. 

           Temple freezes. Davina turns to face us. Eyes red and wet. 
           She’s furious, she’s rattled. It’s hard seeing her like 
           this. Temple doesn’t know what to say. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        What are you doing here?

           And as Davina PUNCHES Temple right in her fucking face -- 

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           INT. GROCERY STORE - CHECKOUT COUNTER - LATER

           ON Temple’s eye, bruised and swollen purple. She waits while 
           the TEENAGE CASHIER, 17, rings up a pricey steak. 

           Davina, sulking at her side, throws some Skittles on the 
           belt. Temple pays for those, too. 

           EXT. GROCERY STORE - CURB - DAY

           Temple and Davina sit on the curb. Davina eats Skittles.

                                 TEMPLE
                        Davina, why are you here?

                                 DAVINA
                        I’m not ready to talk to you yet. 

           Temple decides to not push. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        What do you wanna do?

                                 DAVINA
                        Something where I don’t have to 
                        talk to you. Where do you go when 
                        you hate Temple? 

           INT. ART GALLERY - LATER

           Contemporary, modern art. Sleek and minimalist. 

           Temple soothes her eye with a slab of steak as she leads 
           Davina through the displays. Passers-by level them with 
           questioning looks. Temple doesn’t notice or care. 

           The girls stop to take in a black and white portrait of 
           LITTLE GIRLS IN THE MEADOW. It’s ethereal and otherworldly, 
           like a still from Lemonade. 
                                 DAVINA
                        I can’t believe you left again. You 
                        told me you wouldn’t. What’s wrong 
                        with you?

           Temple at least looks guilty for having no answer.  

                                 DAVINA (CONT’D)
                        You act like you have no one but 
                        Ma’s here -- I’m here -- and you 
                        need us -- you need family and 
                        being family means people hurt you 
                        sometimes but you have to let them. 
                        You have to let people hurt you, 
                        Temple, and then you have to 
                        forgive them... You fucking dick. 

           Temple lowers the steak. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        I’m gonna take you home. 

           Davina nods her agreement, but her eyes never leave the art. 

           INT. TEMPLE’S LOFT - DAY

           Wyatt and Davina eat chips and watch television on the 
           couch. They don’t notice Temple watching them from afar. 

           She turns into -- 

           INT. TEMPLE’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Finds her phone and makes a call. 

                                 TEMPLE (PHONE)
                        ...Hey. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PARK - DAY

           Temple sits on a bench. 

           NIA joins, offering Temple a bottle of water and keeping the 
           other for herself. She grimaces at Temple’s shiner. 

                                 NIA
                        I hope that isn’t an indication of 
                        how you’re doing. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        Thank you for seeing me. I wouldn’t 
                        have blamed you if you told me to 
                        fuck off. 
           Nia considers that. 

                                 NIA
                        Well, Temple gets enough hate from 
                        you. Figured I’d show you some 
                        kindness. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        I just can’t focus on anything. 

           It’s almost a plea.

                                 NIA
                        I wish you would’ve told me. I’m 
                        still someone who cares about you. 
                        I don’t know why I’m surprised, 
                        though. You have a weird thing 
                        about people caring about you.  

                                 TEMPLE
                        I loved my mother more than 
                        anything. But I never umm... I 
                        never got the chance to -- 

           She laughs, but it’s dry and humorless and sad. Nia gets it. 
           Feels for her. She rubs her back, friendly comfort that 
           Temple isn’t sure she deserves. 

                                 NIA
                        It’ll be okay. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        I’m not sure it will. It’s been ten 
                        years and I’m still sixteen. 

           INT. PLANE - DAY

           Temple and Davina listen to music together, sharing earbuds 
           from Davina’s phone. 

           Davina angles Temple’s chin to check her swollen eye. It’s 
           healing ever so slowly. 

           INT. CLAY HOUSE - DAY

           AC rushes to gather Davina in her arms before Davina and 
           Temple can even get in the door good. 

           Her teary eyes find Temple’s over Davina’s shoulder. She 
           nods her gratitude. 

           INT. DELILAH’S TOWNHOUSE - DAY

           It feels smaller, empty. Like Delilah was never here. 
           AC hangs back, giving Temple space as she takes to the 
           middle of the floor. DELILAH watches from a corner. Silent.

           INT. CLAY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Temple plays 2K with Tarzan, losing miserably. 

           Otto lands. 

                                 OTTO
                        Temp, let me steal you for a sec. 

           EXT. GARDEN - MINUTES LATER

           Temple sits in the grass, squints against the sun. Otto 
           arrives with a steaming mug of tea. He hands it off. 

                                 OTTO
                        Lemon, ginger and a sprinkle of 
                        cayenne pepper for none other than 
                        the Stone Temple Pilot herself. 

           Otto joins her in the grass. Temple frowns.

                                 TEMPLE
                        Look, Otto, I’m sure you mean well 
                        but I really can’t take anymore 
                        talking about it. I feel like 
                        everyone keeps reminding me how 
                        miserable and sad I should be but I 
                        already am, so. 

           Otto smiles at her. 

                                 OTTO
                        I just wanna sit with you. Smell 
                        the flowers. Feel the sun. Give you 
                        some tea.

           Temple takes a sip. 

                                 OTTO (CONT’D)
                        Isn’t that better? 

           It kind of is. 

           EXT. CHURCH - DAY OF SERVICE

           Establishing. 

           INT. CHURCH - DAY OF SERVICE - SERIES OF SHOTS 

           NO SOUND AS WE TAKE IN 

           -A grand hall fit for a queen. 
           -DELILAH’s casket, etched in white and gold and surrounded 
           by gardenias.  

           -The CHOIR and PASTOR have the floor.

           -Cherry, Dixie and Athena have the floor.

           -Otto, Davina and Tarzan have the floor.

           -The Pastor leads the congregation in prayer. Temple, AC and 
           Davina clutching her hands, bows her head, too. 

                                                                LATER:

           -Everyone cycles up to Delilah’s casket to say goodbye. AC 
           and Temple stay seated.

           -People find comfort in one another, embracing. AC joins in 
           prayer with Delilah’s sisters. Temple lets a COUSIN hug her. 
           She hugs back. 

           -Otto holds Davina and Tarzan to him as he watches over the 
           service. 

           -OVER A SERIES OF SHOTS, THE CHURCH SLOWLY EMPTIES UNTIL 
           JUST TEMPLE AND AC ARE LEFT AT DELILAH’S CASKET. 

           INT. CHURCH - MOMENTS LATER 

           Temple and AC stand over Delilah. Temple touches Delilah’s 
           hand. AC, sensing the shift in Temple, rubs her back. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        I needed you to tell me it was 
                        okay.  

                                 AC
                        It is gonna be okay, scoot. 

           Temple looks at AC. AC realizes it’s about her. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        I needed you to tell me it was 
                        okay. I was sixteen and I was in 
                        love and I came to you cause you’re 
                        my sister. I just needed you to 
                        tell me that it was okay. 

                                 AC
                        Temple -- 

                                 TEMPLE
                        I needed you to tell me there was 
                        nothing wrong with me. I just 
                        needed you to tell me it was okay -- 
           AC tries to take Temple’s shoulder -- Temple pushes out of 
           her grasp. The moment breaks her. Tears finally fall. She 
           UNRAVELS. 

                                 TEMPLE (CONT’D)
                        No, I was in love with her -- I was 
                        in love with Belle and I wanted was 
                        to share that with my family but 
                        now Momma’s gone and I’ll never get 
                        to and that’s your fault. All you 
                        had to do was tell me it was okay -- 
                        why couldn’t you just tell me it 
                        was okay?  

           AC breaks, desperate to get Temple in her arms. 

                                 AC
                             (whispering)
                        I know. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. 
                        I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I’m sorry. 
                        I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry... 

           Temple lets AC hold her like a child. Her arms go around AC 
           in the fiercest embrace.

           They stay that way for a long moment. 

           When AC releases her, we notice -- 

           BELLE. Watching from the doorway. Her face pure wonderment. 
           She heard it all.  

           AC steps away to give them space. 

           Temple and Belle find each other.  

           Belle touches Temple’s face. Temple pulls Belle into her 
           arms. We move out on this image and find --  

           Delilah’s apparition watching. She knows... And it’s okay.  

           EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - TEMPLE’S LOFT - DAY 

           Establishing. Sunlight-bright billboards. Foghorn-level 
           street noise. 

           INT. TEMPLE’S LOFT - DAY

           Temple wheels her suitcase in. Wyatt jumps up from the chase 
           for her arrival. Waits, unsure how to proceed. Temple smiles 
           at him. He smiles back, moves in to help her with her stuff. 

                                 WYATT
                        Sleep?
                                 TEMPLE
                        Sleep. 

           SOUND UP: Jackie Wilson’s “Higher & Higher” -- 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Wyatt flips through his phone under the dead-weight of 
           Temple comatose on his shoulder. She might have transcended 
           another dimension of consciousness she’s sleeping so hard. 

           EXT. AUGUSTA - STORAGE UNIT - DAY

           Otto passes AC the LAST BOX off their truck to tuck away. AC 
           puts it in, assesses the packed unit. 58 years of life, of 
           Delilah’s life, in boxes. 

           Otto presses a kiss to her shoulder. Pulls the door down, 
           draping us in darkness -- 

           EXT. LOS ANGELES - RESTAURANT - DAY

           Temple and Wyatt, brunch and mimosas. 

           INT. CLAY HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Davina and AC gather food to set the table. Otto pulls down 
           plates for Davina and she lets him. It fills AC with hope. 

           INT. CLAY HOUSE - DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           The Clays sit down to family dinner with Davina’s boyfriend, 
           MICHAEL. He’s nervous and AC isn’t much more than tolerant, 
           but it looks to be going well. 

                                                         TRANSITION TO:

           EXT. AUGUSTA - DAY - BACK TO SCENE 

           FLY OVER the town at a glacial pace. Over the weak waves 
           nudging the waterfront forward. Over families playing in the 
           park. Over dogs running across yards. 

                                 AC (O.S.)
                        How’s work?

                                 TEMPLE (O.S.)
                        It’s okay. They found another 
                        animator to finish the season so I 
                        can take some time. They guaranteed 
                        me a spot for season two, though.  

                                 DAVINA (O.S.)
                        They must not want season two to be 
                        good. 
                                 AC (O.S.)
                        Davina. 

                                 DAVINA (O.S.)
                        What’d I do? 

           We finally DESCEND ON 

           EXT. MEMORIAL GROUNDS - DAY

           CHYRON: “Two Weeks Later” 

           Temple, AC and Davina head toward Delilah’s grave, 
           unhurried. AC has a bundle of flowers. Temple tosses an 
           APPLE up and down.

                                 AC 
                        So umm, how’s Belle?

                                 TEMPLE 
                        Davina, don’t -- 

                                 DAVINA
                        Belle’s great -- they talked this 
                        morning, in fact. 

                                 TEMPLE 
                        Ugh, you’re actually trash. 

                                 AC
                        Is she gonna move to LA?

                                 TEMPLE
                        Come on, it’s been ten years. 

                                 DAVINA
                        And? It’s only time. 

           They arrive at DELILAH’S GRAVE. The grass hasn’t started to 
           grow in so dirt peeks out like a fresh wound. 

           Davina kneels in the dirt. 

           AC places the flowers next to her. 

                                 DAVINA (CONT’D)
                        Where’s the marker? 

                                 AC
                        It can take a while to get here. 

           Davina gathers dirt in her fingers. 

           Temple places the apple at the head of the plot.  
                                 AC (CONT’D)
                             (re: apple)
                        Do I even wanna know?

                                 TEMPLE
                        Nope. 

           It hits them all over again. Delilah’s gone. Nothing makes 
           sense. Maybe it won’t ever again. AC covers Temple’s hand 
           with her own.

           Davina breaks the tension with a snort. 

                                 DAVINA
                        You guys remember the four corners? 

           Temple and AC burst out laughing. 

                                 AC
                        She used to really think she was 
                        doing something. 

                                 TEMPLE
                        With that game face. 

           Davina and AC start demonstrating until they’re laughing, 
           loud and joyfully, doing Delilah’s dance together. 

           WE MOVE IN on the apple in the dirt. 

           INTO FRAME, A HAND -- DELILAH’S. She picks it up. 

                                 DELILAH (V.O.)
                        May the Lord bless you and keep 
                        you. May He make His face to shine 
                        upon you, and be gracious to you. 
                        May He lift up His countenance upon 
                        you and give you peace. 

           Delilah joins in dancing and it dawns on us that only we can 
           see her now. TEMPLE CAN’T. 

                                 DELILAH (V.O.)
                        Amen. 

           As they dance us out -- 

                                                                      END.
