          WHITE...

           The orchestra glistens, and the fluffy white clouds part to 
           reveal we are high above a beautiful day in New York City!      

           A PIGEON walks up to the edge of the clouds.. then DIVES through 
           the gap in the sky, soaring down to Manhattan.

           Flies through: an Office Bullpen of Day Traders at green & black 
           IBMs... Down to a 2nd Floor Jazzercise class... To Subway Stairs 
           where Working Girls in pantyhose & Reeboks drinking Slim-Fast, get 
           splashed by a Checkered Cabbie whistling at a Leotard Gal roller-
           blading past a Jalopy of Grouches.  You know, general hubbub.  

                                 GROUCH
                        Hey, watch it, Mac!

           At a Cafe Table: a Newspaper dated MAY 16, 1990 is lowered by  
           JOAN GANZ COONEY (59, Frances McDormand) shoulder-padded suit 
           jacket, matching necklace & earrings, hair that doesn’t move. 

           Joan puts her coffee cup down.. then spots her fingers clamped on 
           the handle, involuntarily clamshelling open and closed.  She 
           realizes what she’s doing and gives a small melancholy chuckle.  
           When she hears a COO... and looks down - it’s the Pigeon. 

                                 JOAN
                        Is it time, already?

           Another COO.  Joan checks her watch, despondently.  It is.

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        Thank you, Bernice.

          INT. THE CATHEDRAL OF ST. JOHN THE DIVINE - A MEMORIAL - DAY

           Joan is handed a PROGRAM, and a Butterfly made from felt on a rod.  
           She walks down the grand aisle. In the Left Pews: Hippie-Artsy 
           Types wave - she smiles warmly, her people.  They scowl over to...     
           The Right Pews: A fleet of Corporate Men, including their leader: 

           MICHAEL EISNER (Michael Shannon/ Bill Hader), Corporate CEO, who 
           gives Joan a villainous “I see you” head nod and smile.  

           Joan sits alone.. Then sees A MOM (25, black) & her BOY (4) in the 
           aisle, looking for a seat, and scootches in so they can sit next 
           to her.  The Boy is holding a stuffed Grover toy, looking all 
           around the church, a bit confused.  Joan watches him - captivated.

                                 THE BOY
                        Where is he?

           Joan’s lips part, no idea how to answer.  But--

                                 MOM
                        Remember, sweetie?  We talked about 
                        this.  He’s... well, he’s dead.  
                        He’s not coming back.  He’s gone.

           The Boy nods, brow furrowed, processing.  Joan can’t look away. 
           When.. he reaches for Joan’s hand. She’s caught by surprise, but 
           gives it. He uses it to climb up & stand on the pew - calling out: 

                                 THE BOY
                        WE’LL MISS YOU, MISTER HENSON!
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  2.

           This takes Joan’s breath away for a moment.  Mom pulls him down.

           Everyone in the pew ahead turns around: OSCAR, GROVER, THE COUNT, 
           ERNIE & BERT, COOKIE MONSTER, etc. warmly smile and wave to Joan - 
           their matriarch.  A Coo from Bernice the pigeon on Bert’s finger.

           Joan notices the Boy staring at her, trying to figure her out.  

                                 JOAN
                        We’re all gonna miss him.

                                 THE BOY
                        Did you watch the show?

                                 JOAN
                        Uh... Well... Yes.

                                 THE BOY
                        Yah.  It’s really good.

           Joan guffaws.  When a large shadow casts down the aisle. She turns 
           to see SNUFFY bashfully peeking in the main door. She goes to him.

                                 SNUFFY
                        Heeey, Joooan.  I-- I hope I wasn’t 
                        bothering anyone.

                                 JOAN
                        Nonsense, come in, sweetheart.

           They join the Sesame Street family - dressed up, mournful. 

                                 GROVER 
                        Joan, I heard some people saying.. now 
                        that Jim is gone, that man [Eisner] is 
                        trying to get us all to move away from 
                        Sesame Street.

                                 JOAN
                        Ya know, Grover, the truth is Jim was 
                        always a big fan of Walt Disney, since 
                        he was a little boy.  

                                 ERNIE
                        Since Walt Disney was a little boy?

                                 BERT
                        No, Ernie, Since Jim-- ugh, nevermind.

                                 JOAN
                        He told me he saw Snow White in the 
                        movie theatre, ten times.

                                 GROVER
                        Ten?  Augh.  That is a lot of times!

                                 JOAN
                        Mhm.  And I think.. well, an invitation 
                        to have Kermit & Piggy & Fozzie & Gonzo 
                        be a part of that.. That was Jim’s 
                        dream.  But he never wanted any of you 
                        guys from Sesame Street to go with them. 

           Eisner now stands in the aisle, right next to Bert & Cookie, who 
           don’t see him yet... talking as Cookie eats a hymnal:
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  3.

                                 BERT (TO COOKIE)
                        No, I don’t think they would typically 
                        have cookies... at a funeral.

                                 COOKIE MONSTER (TO BERT)
                        Okay, me thought maybe.

           Bert & Cookie see everyone looking at them, then slow-turn and see 
           Eisner!  Bert shudders!  Cookie screams/throws hymnals in the air: 

                                 EISNER
                        Helloooo Muppets.  ...Joan.  
                        I’m Michael Eisner, head of the Walt 
                        Disney Company, and according to our 
                        contract with Jim.. your new boss.   

                                 JOAN
                        Jim would never do that.

                                 EISNER
                        He already has.

                                 JOAN
                        Well, you can show me where he said 
                        that, in writing.  But for now--

                                 EISNER
                        Joan, Joan, Joan..  It’s a 150 million 
                        dollar contract.  We’re the biggest 
                        entertainment conglomerate in the Universe.  
                        It’s completely confidential.  But I 
                        wouldn’t expect you to understand that, 
                        with your pledge drives & your tote bags... 
                        (laughing)
                        Yes!  Gonna make alotta changes ‘round 
                        here.  Starting with these clothes.

                                 ERNIE
                        But Bert gave me this shirt.

                                 BERT
                        I think it’s very flattering on hi--

                                 EISNER
                        Sure, but every day?  And Cookie... 
                        How would you like to be on the 
                        cover of every Nabisco box?

                                 COOKIE MONSTER
                        Why I want that?  I want what IN box.

                                 SNUFFY
                        But.. what will become of Sesame Street?

                                 EISNER
                        Your wizened tenement block of nostalgia?  
                        Knocking it all down this afternoon, 
                        to build luxury high-rise condominiums.

           He pulls out/ unrolls ARCHITECTURAL RENDERINGS of SESAME PLAZA.

                                 MUPPETS
                        What?!/ No!/ Sesame Plaza?!/ Who brings 
                        architectural plans to a funeral?

           Barkley the Dog starts GROWLING/tugging at Eisner’s pant leg.    
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  4.

                                 EISNER
                        We’ll still make a version of the show.  
                        And if people want their kids to watch 
                        it, they’ll pay whatever I tell them.

                                 JOAN
                        But Sesame Street is free for all kids.

                                 EISNER
                        ...Not anymore.

           Barkley gives Eisner’s pant a good tug, and Eisner KICKS the dog 
           square in the face!  Barkley YELPS... whimpers.  Everyone GASPS!  
           Joan stands, incensed -- guarding everyone cowering behind her. 

                                 EISNER (CONT’D)
                        Kiss your furry little babies goodbye.
                        (then, singing as he leaves)
                        On my way to where the air is sweet...

                                 OSCAR THE GROUCH
                        Gee, he seems like a real swell guy!

                                 THE COUNT
                        ONE! One villainous, corporate monster! 
                        Ah-ah-ah!

                                 TELLY
                        We gotta stop him!

                                 GROVER
                        This sounds like a job for SUPER-Grover!

           He ducks down, and pops back up in a Super Grover Hat & Cape. 
           Melee... until in the pew ahead, SAM THE EAGLE turns around.

                                 SAM THE EAGLE
                        Ah-ah-ahem!  Please have some sense of 
                        decorum.  This is still a memorial.  

                                 ERNIE
                        Maybe if we take the street sign down, 
                        he wont know where to find us.

                                 OSCAR
                        Except that we’re the only block 
                        with’a 6-foot-tall canary!

           They all turn to reveal: BIG BIRD at the far end of the pew.

                                 BIG BIRD
                        But, Joan... Sesame Street is our home.

                                 JOAN
                        I know, Big Bird... but when we were 
                        creating the show, we knew that numbers 
                        & letters would never be able to 
                        compete with cartoons for the kids’ 
                        attention - unless we had something as 
                        amazing as.. well, you all.

           The Cathedral’s Pipe Organ warms up. Joan looks to LARGE B&W 
           PHOTOS HANGING UP of JIM - one with Frank performing Ernie & Bert.

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        So when I met Jim and saw how 
                        funny, how… genius he—
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  5.

           She turns to see them all, mouths agape, hanging on every word.  

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        Have I never told you where you all 
                        come from?..

           They quietly shake their heads no - eyes brimming with wonder.                                    
           When the Cathedral’s pipe organ begins… THE SESAME STREET THEME.                      

          OPENING CREDITS “CAN YOU TELL ME HOW”

           Tim, his assistant, perks up at this... listens interested.

                                 JOAN
                        Ah, fortunately we’ve got much more 
                        important things to discuss. Such as--

                    SUPERVISOR
                                            A VOICE  (O.S.)
           How many kids?  Got photos?
                                      One minute to air.
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  6.

                                 JOAN
                        So, your remarks will be--

                                 SUPERVISOR
                        You know, my grandfather knew your 
                        grandfather.  Great great men.

                                 JOAN
                        Yes, well... they’re dead now. And here 
                        we are - with an hour of television to 
                        try and say something with. 

           Tim smiles/blushes to himself.

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        Now, after the intros will be a Q & A--  

                                 SUPERVISOR
                        I was sorry to hear about your dad.  

           She squints, was that a power move? Or just the clumsiest earnest? 

                                 JOAN
                        Carl, a little more volume on the mics, 
                        please - can’t quite hear these 
                        gentlemen as well as I’d like.

                                            A VOICE  (O.S.)
                       CARL
           Certainly, Joan.
                                      Live in thirty.

                                 JOAN
                        Gentlemen, you’re on.

           She leaves the pool of light.  The sound of heels walking away.  
           The Supervisor looks at those 12 empty chairs, confused... 

                                 SUPERVISOR
                        ...Say, who are all these chairs for?!

           In the CONTROL ROOM:  Joan paces behind LEWIS (45), her boss.  
           Carl runs the sound, and Tim (that Assistant) slips in the back.

                                 LEWIS
                        ‘Sure you know what you’re doing, Joanie?  

                                 JOAN
                        No way of knowing, Lewis - it’s 
                        never been done before.

                                 LEWIS
                        In 3... 2...

           The “ON-AIR” Light buzzes. An Opening FILM Package Plays: shots of 
           1960’s NYC - wealth, poverty, white, Hispanic, black... a quick 
           glimpse of Joan holding an interview microphone in Harlem.

           ON STAGE: The MODERATOR (a Ted Baxter, 40), sits center-stage 
           between the men and the 12 empty chairs (now in darkness).  

                                 MODERATOR
                        “Good evening and welcome to Poverty.”

           Joan throws her arms up, WTF?

                                 MODERATOR (CONT’D)
                        “Poverty.. ANTI-Poverty, and the World!”
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  7.

                                 LEWIS
                        Boy, I hope you’re better at producing 
                        shows than you are at naming them.

           Joan sighs, then MOUTHS ALONG HER WORDS with the following:

                                 MODERATOR (from prompter)
                        “You gentlemen run public policy for 
                        poverty in our city, where many say a 
                        child born into disadvantage today has 
                        boots with no straps - no way to pull 
                        herself up and out - just an intentionally 
                        endless cycle of discriminatory low-pay 
                        jobs, opportunistically high-rent housing, 
                        illiteracy and hopelessness.”

           The men are BLINDSIDED.  Tim is GOBSMACKED at Joan’s boldness.  
           Joan is pleased, peeks into the GREEN ROOM: We can’t see inside, 
           but she politely gestures for them to stay quiet, and follow her.

                                 SUPERVISOR
                        Not true. The city’s provided a great many 
                        opportunities for the uh-- Urban Poor. 
                        IF they they’re willing to work hard.

                                 ANOTHER MAN 
                        My father was born on a farm, and now I 
                        live on Park Avenue, so I’m proud to say 
                        it is still possible in America. 

                                 A THIRD MAN
                        I think if you took your cameras to 
                        Harlem, the Bronx, even Bed-Stuy, and 
                        asked the Urban Poor -- they would tell 
                        you that things have gotten much better. 

                                 MODERATOR
                        Yes, let’s ask them.

           The lights come up on the other side of the stage, as MEN & WOMEN 
           FROM THESE NEIGHBORHOODS WALK UP & FILL THOSE 12 CHAIRS.  The 
           three panelists are FROZEN, mouths open, stupefied.

                                 CARL
                        God, I love live television.

           Tim looks to a quietly proud Joan - Tim is in disbelief at what 
           she pulled off, beyond impressed... turned on, he whispers to her:  

                                 TIM
                        You owe me a drink.

                                 JOAN
                        How do ya figure?

                                 TIM
                        I’m gonna lose my job for telling my 
                        boss, to do your show.

                                 JOAN
                        ..You told him that?

                                 TIM
                        Of course. It’s amazing. You’re amazing.  

           Lewis hears this, quietly looks to Carl, they raise an eyebrow.
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  8.

                                 JOAN
                        Oh, I’m convinced that Indian on the 
                        Stand-by logo gets better ratings.

                                 TIM
                        A typical response would be thank you.

                                 JOAN
                        You want a typical response, go find 
                        a typical girl.  They’re everywhere.

                                 TIM
                        Guessing maybe you haven’t found 
                        that husband and family just yet?

                                 JOAN
                        What gave it away? The job? The sense 
                        of self? The fact that I don’t want my 
                        whole world to be just women & children 
                        like a lifeboat on the Titanic?

           Tim smiles/ shakes his head as if to say “wow”... He loves this.

                                 TIM
                        Where does all that fire come from?

                                 LEWIS
                        Arizona.

           Joan rolls her eyes, steps out of the Control Room, Tim follows.

                                 TIM
                        Seriously.  Why do you... care?

                                 JOAN
                        Maybe you should ask the people who don’t.

                                 TIM
                        I’d rather talk to you.

                                 JOAN
                        ..My father ran a bank, in a depression, 
                        so you learn pretty quick that some 
                        people have more than they need, and 
                        others need more than they have.  And 
                        watching him take care of those people, 
                        people nobody else seemed to care about, 
                        well, I thought maybe I could...

           Vulnerable, she starts back into the Control Room, opens the door:

                                 TIM
                        Well... I believe in you.  In what 
                        you’re trying to do.

           She hears this PROFOUNDLY.  Touched... almost confused.  Then-

                                 JOAN
                        You do?

           He nods.  He means it.  She can tell.  She looks him up & down.  

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        Well...  Seems like an even trade.
                        Lose a job... get a girlfriend.

           Tim’s face lights up.  Lewis looks to Carl, happy for their girl. 
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  9.

           ON-STAGE: All 12 NEW YORKERS are now seated in the chairs...

                                 SUPERVISOR
                        Now who the hell are they?

                                 BLACK WOMAN
                        We’re the Urban Poor.  

                                 PUERTO RICAN WOMAN
                        Pleasure to finally meet you.

           PRELAP: A crowd laughs/ applauds as we MATCH CUT TO:        
           This CLIP of Joan’s TV Program shown on the big screen at...

          INT. LOCAL EMMY AWARDS - NIGHT

           Joan’s nervous hand is steadied by Tim’s - matching WEDDING RINGS. 

                                 PRESENTER (READING ENVELOPE)
                        “Poverty, Anti-Poverty & The World”!

           Joan kisses Tim, hugs Lewis. Gets to the stage, in front of a 
           projected still of a ROUGH HARLEM STREET CORNER.

                                 JOAN
                        Wow.  I want to thank my boss Lewis, my 
                        husband Tim, and my field team who 
                        follow me into our most vulnerable 
                        neighborhoods week after week, in the 
                        hopes that shining light on these 
                        issues will make a real lasting change.

           The Still Frame of the Street Corner... MATCH CUTS TO:

          EXT. THE SAME ROUGH HARLEM STREET CORNER - 5 YRS LATER - NO CHANGE

                                 CHYRON: FIVE YEARS LATER

           Joan sees, sighs.  Many residents know Joan, wave, “Hey Joanie!”.

          EXT./EST. JOAN’S STREET (IN SHARP RELIEF) - AFTERNOON

           Joan on her tree-lined street, grocery bags in tow, passes an 
           Electronics Store window, where HER SHOW is on.  Thrilled, she 
           peeks into every apartment window to see if they’re watching.  She 
           climbs stoops, fire escapes, on the ground to look in garden apts.  
           But they’re all watching Bonanza. ...That inane theme song.

          INT. JOAN & TIM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

                                 JOAN
                        Because, I’m thirty years old, and I’m 
                        just plagued by the idea that I’m going 
                        to live and die without being able to 
                        make any real difference in this world. 

           Tim’s setting the table, refills his Scotch. Joan notices, but 
           goes back to cleaning - unusually fastidious, per Tim’s face. 

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        Lewis invited Lloyd Morrisett tonight... 
                        Vice President at Carnegie... 
                        (Tim draws a blank)
                        As in, “This program is brought to you 
                        by The Carnegie Corporation of New-”
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  10.

                                 TIM
                        Ohhhhhh.  Right-right-right. 

           Joan sees a Stack of BOOKS, on top: The Feminine Mystique, so 
           prominently displayed, so she tucks it under the other books.   
           Now Giovanni’s Room is on top - she winces - shuffles again.  
           Silent Spring. Oy – shuffles again. Autobiography of Malcolm X. 
           She gives up, just throws them all in a closet and slams the door.

           A KITCHEN TIMER GOES OFF.  She checks on her STEW.  She wheels 
           the TV to the kitchen, stirring along with Julia Child on TV…

                                 JULIA CHILD (ON TV)
                        You want the flavor of the onions and the 
                        beef to all blend themselves with the stew...

           TIME CUT TO: The Party Underway:  Three Couples.  Men are at one 
           end, women another.  Joan stands to the side with hors d'oeuvres, 
           unsure where she belongs.  Tim sees this, smiles, fucks with her.

                                 TIM
                        Go talk to the wives.

                                 JOAN
                        (through a fake grin)
                        I don’t wanna talk to the wives.

                                             JOAN (CONT'D)
                       TIM
           Just be yourself.
                                      They don’t like myself.  

           He pushes her in a seat next to pregnant MADGE (34, Nina Arianda).

                                 MADGE
                        Joan, I haven’t seen this program’a 
                        yours, I’m more a fan’a soaps.  But you 
                        know ya gonna have to give it up once the 
                        kids come. Tim can’t nurse’em himself!

           The Wives laugh, Joan feels shitty but stays on her best behavior.

                                 JOAN
                        You got it all figured out, Madge.

                                 MADGE
                        Besides, then ya don’t have to worry 
                        ‘bout getting shot up in Harlem, by 
                        some drug dealer.

           Madge laughs, the Wives laugh.  Joan’s face = NOPE.   

           Tim nudges Lewis to “watch this”.  As does the man from Carnegie:  
           LLOYD MORRISETT (35, Jim Parsons) measured, mannered, very 
           intelligent in that square, picked-last-for-kickball kinda way.

                                 JOAN
                        You know why they call them Soap Operas?  
                        The whole reason the maudlin genre 
                        exists… is to attract women who don’t 
                        work, and stay home watching TV, to buy 
                        their soap. That is the extent of your 
                        power as a woman in this country in 1966. 
                        ...I’d rather get shot!  Hahaha!

           The others laugh politely, confused by her delivery. DING!
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  11.

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        Oh! Excuse me, ladies.  Dinner’s ready.

           Joan gets the Beef Stew - circles the table - listening & ladling.

                                 LEWIS
                        ..is that you can’t blame the technology.  
                        Gentlemen, we’re using atomic energy to 
                        make fried bologna sandwiches!  Imagine 
                        instead of Flipper & The Monkeys, a fella 
                        used his RCA to learn Astrophysics or 
                        ..Siamese over his Swanson’s T.V. Dinner!

                                 TIM
                        And I’m saying what are our priorities as 
                        a country?  We spend millions to go to the 
                        moon, and millions more so everyone can 
                        watch on a brand-new color set.. While a 
                        few blocks away, millions of American 
                        children are going to bed starving.  

                                 LLOYD
                        We’ve been wrestling with the same root 
                        question I believe you’re both asking, 
                        which is “How to ensure all Americans 
                        achieve their potential”?  And it seems 
                        to concern closing an Achievement Gap 
                        between... well... your children in New 
                        Rochelle, and those in the inner city 
                        who are dropping out at alarming rates. 

                                 MADGE
                        Can’t just tutor the kids or--?

                                 LLOYD
                        They’ve tried intervening in high 
                        school, middle school, primary school. 
                        Nothing’s worked.  We found that most 
                        of those kids who dropped out.. started 
                        first grade six months behind their.. 
                        middle-class brethren. And by fifth 
                        grade they were two years behind.

                                 JOAN
                        Then the kid is so humiliated at not 
                        being able to keep up with his class, 
                        that he acts out, clowns around, to 
                        distract from the fact that he can’t 
                        compete academically. ...Then the 
                        school writes it off as an “attitude 
                        problem” instead of taking 
                        responsibility for a system, a country, 
                        completely failing them.  And the kid 
                        gets so frustrated, so embarrassed that 
                        they just never come back to school.

           She finishes serving, sits, looks up - they’re all looking at her. 

                                 LLOYD
                        JOAN, is it?

           They feel an immediate kinship.  Someone who understands.  Lloyd 
           tastes the stew and is surprised nay confused by how good it is. 

                                 LLOYD (CONT’D)
                        Mmmm...
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  12.

                                 MADGE
                        Why can’t the parents just help?

                                 LLOYD
                        It can be hard to help with homework, 
                        if both parents work a job. 

                                 JOAN
                        Let alone three. 

                                 TIM
                        You said the kids are behind by six 
                        months... what is it they don’t know?

                                 LLOYD
                        We’ve found most children who drop out 
                        didn’t know their A-B-C’s & 1-2-3’s 
                        when they started first grade. 

                                 JOAN
                        That’s it?  Just A-B-C’s and 1-2-3’s?

                                 LLOYD
                        Yes.  We, at the CarNEgie Corporation--

                   ANOTHER WIFE
           Ahhh... I’ve always wondered 
           how you pronounce that.
                                              THIRD WIFE
                                      I was always saying CARnegie, 
                                      CARnegie, like an automobile.

           Lloyd tries to smile to her like he’s seen humans do, then.

                                 LLOYD
                        We’ve tried “pre-school” programs, to 
                        close the gap... but we only have the 
                        resources to reach a few hundred children.
                        (Hm.  His eyes narrow)
                        Joan, you produced that TV documentary about 
                        the pre-school intervention in Harlem?

                                 JOAN
                        Yes...

                                 LLOYD
                        Do you think.. television could be used 
                        to teach pre-school aged children?

           Joan hears this... stops... thinks...

                                 LEWIS
                        We can’t compete with Batman for 
                        adults, how the hell would some 
                        schoolmarm get kids to change the 
                        channel from Bozo the Clown?

                                 TIM
                        I think he was asking Joanie.

                                 LLOYD 
                        I bet we could find some funding 
                        for you to do a proper study, Joan.  
                        Put together a report for us?..

                                 LEWIS
                        Oh, Joan wouldn’t be interested in that--
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  13.

                                 JOAN
                        OH YES JOAN WOULD!

           She pauses - too strident, even for her.

                                 LEWIS
                        I mean to say, you’re a Producer, not 
                        some researcher.  

                                 JOAN
                        (bashful, subservient)
                        Of course... I’m sorry.

                                 LLOYD
                        Ah. Wouldn’t want to steal away your MVP.

                                 MADGE
                        No offense, Joan, but whaddyou know about 
                        teaching kids?  Ya haven’t even got any.

                                 JOAN
                        Well... my mother always said “if you 
                        teach, and your husband dies, you’d have 
                        the same hours and summer vacation as 
                        the kids.”  Very progressive.  So I 
                        majored in education in college.

                                 TIM
                        Madge, what did you major in again?

                                 MADGE
                        I went to a very prestigious secretarial 
                        program.  The Katharine Gibbs School...?
                        Next to the Horn & Hardart--

                                 LLOYD
                        Joan, what is this stew?

                                 JOAN
                        Ugh... Beef Bourguignon. ..Is it okay?

                                 LLOYD
                        (confused, dry)
                        It’s outrageous.  A complete success.

           Madge gets curious... tastes it, confused how great it is.

                                 MADGE
                        Say, where did you learn to make a 
                        thing like that?

           Joan thinks earnestly for a moment… then remembers, laughs…

          INT. JOAN & TIM’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT

           Joan sneaks in, ready for bed. Tim’s asleep, an EMPTY SCOTCH GLASS 
           on his belly.  It clearly triggers Joan, who picks it up and sees: 
           ON TV:“MIKE DOUGLAS Show” Florence Henderson & ROWLF (The MUPPET).

                                 FLORENCE (TO ROWLF)
                        Are you interested in natural childbirth?

           Rowlf & Joan make the exact same wide-eyed WINCE & GROWL.               
           Joan sets the SCOTCH GLASS on top of the TV, and SNAPS it OFF.  
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  14.

           TIME CUT: The PHONE RINGS, the next morning.  Joan picks it up.

                                 JOAN
                        Hello?

          EXT. JOAN & TIM’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Joan in the driver seat of her modest car, confused.

                                 JOAN
                        I just don’t understand what made Lewis 
                        change his mind about the research trip.

           She doesn’t see Tim smile suspiciously, as he shuts the trunk.

                                 TIM
                        I guess he came to his senses.  

                                 JOAN
                        This could really help, huh?  I 
                        mean in a real way.

                                 TIM
                        Yes... I mean, worst case scenario, 
                        you go back to your old job. 

           He kisses her.  She has a super guilty “I didn’t tell you” face. 

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        What..?

           She pulls the car away slowly, explaining out the window...

                                 JOAN
                        Taking this job was contingent on 
                        giving that one up completely, so if it 
                        doesn’t work out I’m on the bread line 
                        with the rest of ‘em, G’bye!

           Tim laughs, as she drives away.

                        So for three months, I drove around the 
                        country, meeting with teachers, 
                        psychologists, TV producers.. I was 
                        determined to find out if children 
                        could learn.. through television.

                                 PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHER
                        Oh, they’re monsters.

           The kids are running riot everywhere.  Loud!  A catastrophe.

          INT. MONTESSORI SCHOOL - DAY

           Classical music.  Some children teaching themselves to waltz.

                                 MONTESSORI TEACHER
                        Maria Montessori shows us that children 
                        learn, not from watching, but from doing.

           Joan takes NOTES: “Can’t learn from just watching.” 

                                 MONTESSORI TEACHER (CONT’D)
                        Oh! Happy birthday, Calvin.

           Calvin (5), a small Noel Coward character has fashioned his own 
           birthday cake from found materials as art.  It’s on fire.

                                 CALVIN
                        It’s the oldest I’ve ever been.  
                        ..And the youngest I’ll ever be.

           Calvin stands there, staring at Joan with a creepy smile, eyes 
           sparkling in the firelight.  Worried, Joan blows out the fire.

          INT. WCAU-TV, PHILADELPHIA PUBLIC TV STATION - DAY

                                 STUDIO HEAD
                        Our shows are for everyone in Philadelphia.

           JOAN’s happy to hear, on a tour with a STUDIO HEAD (White, 50).

                                 STUDIO HEAD (CONT’D)
                        For instance, what does a woman need most--

                                          STUDIO HEAD (CONT'D)
                       JOAN
           ...A chance to--?
                                      Cooking shows.

           Joan hides a wince, but one person sees/smiles - we’ll learn he is 
           MATT ROBINSON (Black, 30s - Andre Holland) smart, warm, paternal.  

                                 STUDIO HEAD (CONT’D)
                        And Matt here is a writer on our show 
                        “Opportunities in Philadelphia” 
                        targeted at the needs of the Negro.
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  16.

                                 JOAN
                        Oh, wonderful.  And what are the needs of--

           Matt opens his mouth to answer, but--

                                 STUDIO HEAD
                        Employment listings.

           Joan smiles the same smile to Matt, who laughs quietly - bonded.

                                 STUDIO HEAD (CONT’D)
                        But if it’s children you’re after...

          INT. CHILDREN’S SHOW SET - PUBLIC TELEVISION STATION - DAY

           Joan watches them film a local Children’s TV Show: shoestring 
           budget, small puppet thing...  Mind-numbingly slow and dull.  She 
           falls asleep, but her own SNORING wakes her as a Cameraman scowls.

          INT. MOTEL - NIGHT

           BORED, loudly typing up her REPORT.  Amidst dry hardback books, 
           University reports, her own notes... she hears the TV..           
           ON TV: WILKINS COFFEE COMMERCIAL: Two MUPPETS- WILKINS & WONTKINS. 

                                 WILKINS (VOICE OF JIM HENSON)
                        Okay, buddy, whaddyou think of 
                        Wilkins’ Coffee?

                                 WONTKINS
                        ‘Never tasted it.

           Wilkins fires a Canon - hilariously EXPLODING Wontkins!        
           Joan laughs despite herself.  Huh.  The next noisy commercial 
           comes on, she shuts the TV.  Then thinks on it again, laughs.

          INT. HARVARD UNIVERSITY QUAD - DAY

           GERRY LESSER (40), a bright, friendly academic, walks Joan.

                                 JOAN
                        Thank you for meeting me, Gerry.  
                        Lloyd said you run Harvard’s Lab on..

                                 GERRY
                        Human development.  Educational 
                        psychology.  How people learn.

                                 JOAN
                        I heard that children learn from 
                        doing, rather than watching--

                                 GERRY
                        We all learn differently.  In infant 
                        studies, sight leads the learning.

                                 JOAN
                        Really?  That’s- well, that’s great news, 
                        as we’re hoping to see if television 
                        could do the same for young children.

                                 GERRY 
                        (hands her a business card)
                        You should go here.  
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  17.

          INT. BEHAVIORAL LAB / OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

           Joan is behind a DOUBLE-SIDED MIRROR, watching a room of six very 
           POLITE CHILDREN.  When A LAB ASST enters, with an inflatable clown 
           BOBO DOLL -  the kind weighted at the bottom, so it rocks back up.  

           The Lab Asst pushes Bobo gently - he bobbles over and back up.  
           The kids are politely delighted!  Joan leans in, curious.     
           Again the Lab Asst, pushes the Bobo doll, this time with more 
           force - and the doll sways back up to standing.  She then exits.

           In the Observation Room: The Lab Asst enters, stands next to Joan.  

                                 JOAN
                        And you think just by watching they--

           The Lab Asst holds up her finger, to say “just a moment...”    
           Then Joan’s expression turns to shock-horror as...              
           THE CHILDREN BEAT THE ABSOLUTE FUCKING SHIT OUT OF THIS DOLL.    
           It SLAMS against the glass next to Joan, and she leaps in the air!

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        Oh!!!  Ahem.. Thank you, very.. 
                        interesting.  So it IS possible.

           She takes her notes out, as the doll POPS & flies around the room.  

          INT. A FRIEND’S SMALL APARTMENT - NIGHT

           PATTI (30, a young Julie Kavner) a friend, hands Joan a blanket & 
           pillow for the couch.  Joan makes it work and soon falls asleep.

           THEN WAKES UP VIOLENTLY - to a BLARING LIGHT and LOUD NOISE!   
           Joan wipes her eyes, gets her bearings...  Her watch reads: 5 AM.

           Patti’s KID (5) is in front of the TV, like Poltergeist, with 
           only the “Standby/ Station ID Logo” and that loud BEEEEEP! 
           Joan’s eyes are wide, WTF?!  Patti hands Joan a cup of coffee.

                                 PATTI
                        She does this every morning, ‘til 
                        the cartoons come on.

                                 JOAN
                        In an hour?

           Patti nods calmly, but Joan is weirded out. BEEEEEEEEEEEEEP!

           Then at Breakfast:  The Kid sees a carton of cigarettes.  

                                 THE KID
                        (singing the jingle)
                        ME AND MY WINSTON’S 
                        WE GOT A REAL GOOD THING!

           Patti takes the cigarettes and puts tater tots on the Kid’s plate.

                                 THE KID (CONT’D)
                        I only have room for four tater tots.

                                 JOAN
                        That’s six.

                                 PATTI
                        Haven’t done numbers yet.
                        (to her kid)
                        Well, then I want quality bites, ma’am.
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  18.

                                 THE KID
                        Move Up To Quality… Move up To Schlitz!

           Joan clocks this, Patti doesn’t even hear it anymore.        
           In the Kid’s theatrics she spills ketchup.

                                 PATTI
                        Ugh, sweetie, you got it on your shirt.

                                 THE KID
                        AJAX DETERGENT IS STRONGER THAN DIRT!

           Joan stares quizzically as it flows out of her involuntarily.    
           A new TV theme starts & the Kid runs to the Living Room to watch.

                                 JOAN
                        Patti... Tim wants kids.  

                                 PATTI
                        Oh wonderful, are you...?

                                 JOAN
                        No-no... Well, between you and I...  
                        Tim may have trouble with the bottle.

                                 PATTI
                        Oh, you just hold it at an angle, 
                        he’ll get the hang of--

                                 JOAN
                        No, not that bottle.

                                 PATTI
                        Oh? ... Oh.  Well, I’m sorry... Have 
                        you uh, brought it up?  Maybe spoken 
                        to a pastor, or-- I know your Mom had 
                        such a hard time with--

                                 JOAN
                        I can’t go through what my mother 
                        did - kids to support, no job, no 
                        husband to help.. 

           Joan stops, remembers Patti’s situation.  Feels awful.

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        Oh, god, I’m sorry, Patti, I-

                      PATTI
                                             JOAN (CONT'D)
           No.  It’s fine.   Joan-- 
                                      What a thing to say.  I 
                                      didn’t--  I mean to say I’m 
                                      not that strong.

                                 PATTI
                        I know what you mean.  Believe me, 
                        this wasn’t the plan.  

           Then Patti shakes herself out of it, puts her hand on Joan’s.

                                 PATTI (CONT’D)
                        If the drinking really is that bad..  I 
                        don’t think anyone would blame you  for 
                        not wanting to have a family with him. 

           AN EPIPHANY FOR JOAN.  Maybe she wont have to have a baby.
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  19.

                                 JOAN
                        Really?... Well, I was never like those 
                        women you see in the commercials anyway, 
                        who get orgasms waxing the kitchen floor.

                                 THE KID
                        GLO-COAT! USE HARD WAX - GLO COAT! 
                        FLOORS SO CLEAN, FLOORS SO BRIGHT...

           Joan’s eyes light up hearing this... she’s GOT IT!

          INT. CARNEGIE CORPORATION - LLOYD MORRISETT’S OFFICE - DAY

           A 52-page report lands with a THUD on his desk. “The Potential 
           Uses of Television in Preschool Education”  By Joan Ganz Cooney” 
           Lloyd looks up.  It’s Joan.  Suitcase and coat in hand.

                                 JOAN
                        We’ll make it quick-cutting, fast 
                        moving, like the cartoons, to hold 
                        their attention, and we’ll have 
                        jingles and animation — commercials!   

                                 LLOYD
                        What do you mean?  Advertisments?

                                 JOAN
                        Kids’ve memorized every beer commercial 
                        and cigarette ad.  If we make catchy, 
                        short, colorful, musical ads - for each 
                        letter and number - and run it as often 
                        as Chock-Ful-A-Nuts, they’ll know ‘em 
                        by heart in no time.

           She stops, Lloyd has no poker face...

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        What?

          INT. JOAN & TIM’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

                                 JOAN
                        Lloyd said he tried the whole time, but 
                        Carnegie wont fund it.  No one will...  

           He puts her head on his chest-  calms down.  He smiles, then--

                                 TIM
                        You went to see Lloyd first?

          INT. CARNEGIE CORPORATION - LLOYD MORRISETT’S OFFICE - LATE NIGHT

           Lloyd reads the 52 page report... RAPT, almost nauseous with how 
           good it is.  He closes it.  Blown away.  His SECRETARY stops by.

                                 SECRETARY
                        You want me to make another pot’a coffee?  

                                 LLOYD
                        She did it.

                                 SECRETARY
                        Who?

                                 LLOYD
                        Joan.  Not only proved it can be done, 
                        but she goes on to explain precisely 
                        how.  An entirely new educational model.
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  20.

                                 SECRETARY
                        That’s great.. right?

                                 LLOYD
                        Not if I can’t figure out where to 
                        get four million dollars to make it.

                                 SECRETARY
                        ...I’ll make another pot.

          EXT./EST. THE SUN RISING OVER NEW YORK CITY

           Joan sits with EVELYN (30s, Tiffany Haddish) over coffee.

                                 JOAN
                        And how did your work as a Community 
                        Liaison prepare you for a job here at NBC?

                                 EVELYN
                        Well, P.R. isn’t just press releases, 
                        it’s knowing how the viewer wants to 
                        engage with your show.  People find a 
                        new program because of a conversation at 
                        the bus stop, or the beauty parlor, not 
                        just because the New York Times says to.

                                 JOAN
                        And what are your favorite programs?

                                 EVELYN
                        Um, I love Carol Burnett.. Bewitched-- 

                                 JOAN
                        Anything on our network?

           Evelyn looks CAUGHT, then smiles/shakes her head, “No.”  Joan 
           laughs.  It’s now clear they’re friends doing a mock-interview.

                                 EVELYN
                        Lassie?  Is that y’all? ...Bonanza?  
                        They ask you that when you worked here?

                                 JOAN
                        It’s your third interview - you have the 
                        job.  Just say Laugh-In, you’ll seem hip.

                                 EVELYN
                        I am hip. Ooo, and late.  Headed to work?

                                 JOAN
                        Oh, uh, no.  They-- well, they couldn’t 
                        find the funding for the project, so... 

                                 EVELYN
                        What?!  Joan!  Why didn’t you say that?  
                        You let me go on about this stupid job 
                        and--  What are you gonna do?

                                 JOAN
                        I... I don’t know.

                                 EVELYN
                        Ugh, why don’t we get a drink after.    
                        I just have to head to this meeting, hit 
                        the ladies’ first and...
                        (looks in her purse for something..)
                        Damn.  Really?  S’there a drug store, or--?
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  21.

           Joan puts her own PURSE on the table, unzips it, with a wry smile.  
           Evelyn peeks in, sees it, sighs.  She checks the coast is clear 
           and then begins to stealthily reach in Joan’s Purse for it, when.. 

                                 WOMAN AT THE NEXT TABLE
                        Excuse me...

           Evelyn throws the purse down. It’s a Woman at the Next Table (70):

                                 WOMAN AT THE NEXT TABLE (CONT’D)
                        Have you any sugar?

                                 EVELYN
                        Sugar! YES! Of course. Here you are.

           She hands the Sugar.  Evelyn reaches for the purse again, when--

                                 WAITER
                        Ladies, is there anything else I can--

                                 EVELYN
                        NOPE!  Just leaving.

           Joan laughs, zips her purse closed.  Oh well.  Evelyn walks away. 
           Waiter leaves. When Evelyn runs back, starts to UNZIP the purse...

                                 ROCKEFELLER PLAZA ANNOUNCER (ON P.A.)
                        We ask you now to join us in a moment 
                        of silence for our Apollo astronauts.

           Evelyn & Joan bow their heads, reverently.  Then Joan hears a slow 
           UNZIIIIP - DEAFENING in the silence.  Joan can’t help laughing as 
           Evelyn grabs the KOTEX, starts off - but it CRINKLES SOOO NOISILY.

                                 EVELYN
                        (under her breath)
                        Why do they make these wrappers so 
                        damn loooud?   

                                 JOAN
                        (laughing, whispered)
                        Break a leg!

          INT. JOAN & TIM’S APARTMENT - THAT MORNING

           Joan walks in, pulls her earrings out.  Sits, looks around... 
           Bored.  Turns the TV on - Soap Operas - her face is horrified.

           TIME LAPSE: Joan cleans the house.  She mops, reading the Wax 
           instructions, trying to be domestic.  Darns a hole in Tim’s coat, 
           poorly.  Cooks a giant dinner.  Even does her hair & makeup. 
           ...And is now just sitting on the couch, bored out of her mind, 
           reading a magazine, trying to smile like the women on the Mop Wax. 
           When THE PHONE RINGS.  And the fake smile melts away.

                                 JOAN (ON THE PHONE)
                        Lloyd!  No, just relaxing.

          EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - THE MALL - DAY 

           Lloyd & Joan walk briskly down the WASHINGTON MALL, real purpose.

                                 LLOYD
                        I don’t know how you do it, Joan Cooney.  
                        But you always seem to win.
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  22.

                                 JOAN
                        Do I?

                                 LLOYD
                        Ever write one of those reports before?

           She shakes her head, no.

                                 LLOYD (CONT’D)
                        It’s all I do, all day... Yours is far 
                        better.  It’s insufferable.  Even that 
                        damned beef stew.  I’ve eaten beef stew 
                        at least once a week for forty years, 
                        and-- I’m guessing that was your first 
                        time out of the gate?

           She nods, reticently.

                                 LLOYD (CONT’D)
                        Insufferable...  Well, we need that Joan 
                        Cooney magic today.  Everyone - and I do 
                        mean everyone - has said no to funding 
                        this.  Got a call back from Doc Howe, 
                        President Johnson’s Commissioner of 
                        Education.  He said he would listen to a 
                        pitch about contributing some federal 
                        funds towards it. After which it might 
                        be possible to secure other partners and 
                        get this made.  And if not... Well... 

           She nods, she understands the stakes, he doesn’t have to say--

                                 LLOYD (CONT’D)
                        Hundreds of thousands of Americans will die 
                        avoidable deaths of illiterate poverty.

           No Pressure.  And with that, he marches up the marble stairs.   
           She takes a deep breath, and follows him into...

          INT. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION (D.C.) - GRAND HEARING ROOM - DAY

           DOC HOWE (Tommy Lee Jones), a no-nonsense patriot & Sancho Panza’y 
           MEL, (Wallace Shawn) who tries to quiet the MIC FEEDBACK. 

                                 DOC HOWE
                        God damnit, why’re we spendin’ good 
                        taxpayer dollars on this shitty hi-fi? 
                        Toldja I don’t want this microphone.
                        Like I’m Merv fuckin’ Griffin.  Next! 

           Joan & Lloyd are before a semi-circle of Bureaucrats perched 
           like a Congressional Hearing.  Intimidated - Joan rises.

                                 JOAN
                        Joan Ganz Cooney on behalf of the 
                        Children’s Television Preschool Project.

                                 DOC HOWE
                        Yup.  Read your report.  This fella says 
                        he showed it around to some TV folks, and--

                                 MEL
                        This program would cost double what you’re 
                        projecting.  Not four but eight million.
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  23.

           A beat.  Joan looks to Lloyd, frozen - they WHISPER to each other:

                                 LLOYD
                        Is that true?

                                 JOAN
                        I.. I asked around, and this was the 
                        consensus, but it’s a new format--

                                 LLOYD
                        Ohhh man.  I thought you said you 
                        knew television, Joan--

                                               DOC HOWE
                                      Ms. Cooney?!
                       JOAN
           I... I do, but this model is--

                                 LLOYD
                        Guess your luck has run out.

           Mel is satisfied with himself.  Joan turns back to the panel:

                                 JOAN
                        Well... As you know, The NEA has asked 
                        the U.S. government to expand school 
                        to a full year before kindergarten.

                                 MEL 
                        That’s not the same thing as--

                                 JOAN
                        Time Magazine projects that will cost 2.75 
                        billion dollars, and that’s before 
                        construction costs to accommodate the five 
                        million pre-schoolers.  So even at eight 
                        million, our show is still a bargain.

                                 DOC HOWE
                        I like this girl...
                        (He looks at Joan, takes a breath)
                        ..So, I’m gonna give you the four 
                        million you asked for.

                                 JOAN
                        ..what?

                                 MEL  
                        What?!

                                 LLOYD
                        WHAT?!

                                 DOC HOWE
                        Then I’m gonna tell my friends over at 
                        The Ford Foundation to cough up a few 
                        million.  You folks at Carnegie can make 
                        up the difference, string bean?

           Lloyd nods eagerly.

                       MEL 
           Sir, we--
                                           DOC HOWE (CONT'D)
                                      God damnit, what is it, Mel? 

                                 MEL 
                        In this climate of war and poverty, there 
                        just isn’t the money for a.. teevee show.

           The other BUREAUCRATS in the semi-circle nod in agreement.
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  24.

                                 DOC HOWE
                        Aw, Jesus Christ, Mel.  You’ve been 
                        goin’ on about the poor, and prisons, 
                        and how the Soviets’ education is better 
                        than ours, since.. since Sputnik!  Now 
                        how we gonna claim to be the greatest 
                        country in the world if our kids can’t 
                        even read?  Someone taught you!  What’s 
                        so god damn hard to understand about 
                        that?  Alright, lets take a vote!  
                        All in favour say “Aye”... AYE!  

           ONLY Doc Howe, raises his hand in support.

                                 DOC HOWE (CONT’D)
                        All opposed..?

           EVERYONE ELSE raises their hands “NO”:

                                 EVERYONE
                        NAYE!

           Joan’s heads falls.  ...Damnit.  DOC GAVELS LOUDLY!

                                 DOC HOWE
                        Looks like the Aye’s have it!

                                 MEL  
                        What!? No, we-- Can he do that?

                                 DOC HOWE
                        Just did!  You’re an advisory 
                        council.  It’s ultimately my call.  
                        (leaning to Joan, smiling)
                        Who should we make the check out to?

                                 JOAN
                        Uh... The Children’s Television Workshop.

           Joan turns to a flabbergasted Lloyd:

                                 LLOYD
                        ...Insufferable.

                        We knew someone had to help those kids, 
                        and that TV could teach.  But ya gotta 
                        get ‘em in the church before you preach, 
                        and I had no idea how we could get kids 
                        to pay attention.  Until...
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  25.

          EXT. A NEW YORK STREET - NIGHT

           Joan is walking home from work, headshot/resumes in hand of 
           various children’s performers, ventriloquists, clowns, etc.    
           When a small YELLOW FEATHER blows up to her feet.  

           Curious, she reaches down to pick it up, but it blows away.  So 
           she follows that yellow feather, around the corner...  Where she 
           hears laughter, excitement, people walking into a Movie Theatre... 
           and on the POSTER Outside: “The Hilarious Puppet World!”

           The feather takes a hard right turn and flies INTO THE THEATRE.

           Joan turns to the camera, with a look, shrugs... and goes in.

           Across the street, we see the back of a Tall, Lean, Bearded Man 
           (30s) under a street light - in a floral shirt and suede jacket.  
           He crosses to the theatre, as we now see on the MARQUEE:

                   “The Hilarious Puppet World ...of JIM HENSON”

           And in he walks.

          INT. A MOVIE THEATRE (MANHATTAN) - NIGHT

           Joan takes a seat in the back of a dark theatre. ROLLING LAUGHTER.      

           ON THE SCREEN: A Reel of Jim Henson’s Early Muppet Commercials 
           WILKINS COFFEE: Two puppets - WILKINS & WONTKINS in close-up. 

                                 WILKINS
                        Okay, buddy, whaddyou think of 
                        Wilkins’ Coffee?

                                 WONTKINS
                        I never tasted it.

           Wilkins fires a Canon - EXPLODING Wontkins.  Joan laughs, 
           recognizes it... her eyes narrow, as if kismet brought her here.

           MARATHON GASOLINE: Two Puppet Gas Pumps Sing a Jingle!

                                 GAS PUMPS
                        ..OUR FEELING OF PRIDE, 
                        CAUSE WE’VE GOT MARATHON GASOLINE 
                        SURGING INSIIIDE!

           Joan can’t believe it, it’s perfect. She looks at the people 
           all around her: Adults, watching puppets, crazy for it.

           LACHOY DRAGON: A Mother and Boy are in the Grocery Aisle, 
           when a 7-foot-tall full-body Dragon Muppet walks out.

                                 DRAGON
                        What you need is LaChoy Chow Mein!

                                 BOY
                        Boy, a real dragon!

           His tail keeps knocking over all the cans.  He breathes fire, 
           catching the store on fire, as a Clerk tries to put the fire out, 
           and his tail still knocks everything off the shelves.  

           Joan can’t stifle it any longer, just cathartically guffawing! 
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  26.

          INT. JOAN & TIM’S APARTMENT - TABLE -  NIGHT

                                 JOAN
                        (pacing)
                        He’s self-produced 100 hilarious 
                        commercials, and vaudevillian sketches on 
                        The Jimmy Dean Show.  He’s artful but 
                        accessible. Absurd, but not inappropriate.  
                        Joyful, but not syrupy.  And tomorrow I’m 
                        just gonna drive out and ask if he’ll join 
                        our show.  And this composer Joe Raposo.  
                        And this writer/director Jon Stone.  
                        They’re evidently THE BEST and if I can 
                        get all three, maybe we’ll have a show--  
                        Sorry!  How was your day?

                                 TIM
                        Um.. ya know... New York Council 
                        Against Poverty, so.. always fun.  

           She eyes the Scotch Bottle - empty.

                                 JOAN
                        Oh, I’m sure you made some great 
                        steps forward that--

                       TIM
           No, we didn’t actually. 
                                             JOAN (CONT'D)
                                      You’re very hard on yourself--

                                 TIM
                        I’m not being fucking modest, Joan.  
                        I’m telling you, we haven’t been able 
                        to do anything of any significance. 
                        ...You know how it is.  

                                 JOAN
                        Actually.. This time feels different.  
                        Like if I get it just right.. not just 
                        the letters and numbers, but to show kids 
                        what tomorrow could look like. It feels 
                        like it could actually help, like in a 
                        real way, ya know?  And that maybe... 
                        this is what I’m supposed to be doing.

           Tim hears this.  Not in the same boat anymore, it would seem.

                                 TIM
                        I know if anyone can do it - you can.  
                        ..But you were asking about my day, and I 
                        cannot be as optimistic. ‘Cause nothing 
                        my team can afford to do is making a dent 
                        against a system built by rich slumlords.  
                        And I worry, allll the time - in the 
                        shower, when I wake up and flip my pillow 
                        over in the middle of the night - that 
                        not only am I letting the entire 
                        community down, but.. that City Hall is 
                        just using our flaccid, underfunded 
                        organization, so they can point to us, 
                        throw up their hands and say “Well, we 
                        tried, but I guess it can’t be fixed.” 
                        Knowing their friends are profiting off 
                        it.  And that giving them that scapegoat, 
                        is WORSE than doing nothing at all!

           He THROWS a dinner plate, SHATTERING on the wall. Joan looks down.    
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  27.

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.  I just...

           She starts to say something, when she sees a bandage on his arm.

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        Oh, just blood drawn.  Annual checkup.  
                        ..Doctor asked if we were “trying”.

           This stops Joan.  Tim is warm, but...

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        Realized I didn’t know what to tell him.

                                 JOAN
                        Yah, I just gotta get this show up and 
                        running.  And then we can talk about it.

           He pauses.  A real honesty in his face.

                                 TIM
                        ...Yah?

                                 JOAN
                        ..Yah.  

           That’s more than he expected.  He’s happy. 

                                 TIM
                        Well, there’s dinner in the fridge 
                        if you’re hungry.  

                                 JOAN
                        Chinese, or--?

                                 TIM
                        No I-- I made it.

                                 JOAN
                        Oh, Tim. I saw they were screening-- and 
                        I have to find the right creatives, or--

                                 TIM
                        I know, I’m not saying it out of..  
                        Just saying.. if you’re hungry.

           He kisses her head and heads to bed.

          EXT. A COMMERCIAL SHOOT IN THE WOODS - THE NEXT DAY

           An APPLE sits atop a Colonel Sanders-looking MUPPET... shaking.     
           An ARCHER pulls back a very real ARROW.  Off-camera, we hear:

                                 ONE MAN (O.C.)
                        Oh, god... Oh, man...

                                 ANOTHER MAN (O.C.)
                        Aw, don’t worry ole buddy, it’ll be fine.

           The arrow FIRES! EXPLODING the apple, but missing the Muppet.    
           We see the two men, laying in the dirt, operating the Muppet.   
           One trembling bald man in glasses - FRANK OZ (30s, David Cross).  

           The other is JIM HENSON (30s, John Krasinski), the tall bearded 
           hippie from outside the movie theatre - directing barefoot.
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  28.

                                 ARCHER
                        You want me to take it again?

                                 FRANK OZ
                        NOPE!  That was good. I’m sure we got it.

                                 JIM
                        Just one more.  I’d like to see if 
                        we can get the arrow to stay in the 
                        apple this time.

                                 FRANK OZ
                        Hmph!

           Joan, quietly trudges through loud leaves to set.  Finally making 
           her way to a kind woman - JANE HENSON (30) stitching a puppet.

                                 JOAN
                        Touch-ups on one of the actors?

                                 JANE
                        Exactly.  The Henson Stitch.

                                 JOAN
                        You must be--

                                 JANE
                        Jane.  Henson.

                                 JIM
                        Standby!

                                 FRANK OZ
                        Oh god... Oh god...

           The Archer pulls back.  Frank closes his eyes.  FIRES.  IT STICKS.

                                 JIM
                        And cut!  Got it!  Great work, everyone.

           Frank opens his eyes, pants with relief.  Jim gets up.     

           Joan takes a deep breath... this is it... this is it.

                                 JOAN
                        Mister Henson, I’m Joan Ganz Cooney.

                                 JIM
                        Hi, Joan, I’m Jim.  Over there is Frank 
                        Oz, best puppeteer in the world.  And I 
                        think you met my wife, Jane.

                                 JOAN
                        Yes.  I uh, well I think what you do is 
                        just wonderful.

                                 JIM
                        Gee, thanks.  You have great taste.

                                 JOAN
                        I wanted to talk to you about you 
                        joining our television program.

                                 JIM
                        Oh, yah?  Are you a booking agent?
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  29.

                                 JOAN
                        No, it’s a full series order.  And, I 
                        think your characters could be the stars.

                                 JIM
                        Oh!  You know I’ve been trying to put 
                        together a series.  These commercials 
                        pay the bills, but I think there’s a lot 
                        more we can do, with real character 
                        work, not just novelty jokes and gags.

                                 JOAN
                        Absolutely!

                                 JIM
                        I should tell you, I pitched a few 
                        networks, but nobody really believed 
                        people would tune in for a bunch’a 
                        puppets.  Who’s this one for?

                                 JOAN
                        It’s for The Children’s Television 
                        Workshop, and it would be--

                                 JIM
                        Oh.  
                        (momentum coming to a halt)
                        Gosh, I... well, I wish I knew that 
                        before you drove all the way out here.

                                 JOAN
                        Why’s that?

                                 JIM
                        I don’t do kiddie-shows, Ms. Cooney.  

                                 JOAN
                        Oh, well it’s really a--

                                 JIM
                        But I do wish you the best of luck.
                       JOAN
                                                BERNIE
           I--
                                      Jim.

           Jim’s Manager BERNIE approaches Jim with a contract & pen.

                                 JIM
                        Excuse me.

                                 BERNIE
                        Got Frito-Lay to pay 100 grand for the 
                        Munchos ad.  Just need your Hancock.

                                 JIM
                        (reading the contract)
                        This says they would own the character.

                                 BERNIE
                        Jim, you got hundreds of ‘em.  Look!
                        (taking off his shoes, re: his socks)
                        Two more!

           Jim’s upset, but wouldn’t show it.  He puts the puppet back on.
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  30.

                                 JIM
                        (as the Puppet)
                        Never sell any of my muppets.      
                        I own my characters.. Always.

           Jim hands the contract back to him.  Returns to the shoot.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        Alright, everybody!  Movin’ on!

           Joan, disappointed... defeated... heads off.  FAIL.

          EXT. AN A-FRAME HOUSE - THE VERMONT COUNTRY - DAY

           JON STONE (Kevin Kline) salt & pepper hair, a big beard - a gruff 
           bear of a man with a commanding theatre-trained voice, is pulling 
           office file boxes out of his car, onto his porch.. As Joan’s sad 
           little car pulls up, and she gets out in her City Mouse suit. 

                                 JON STONE
                        Ah!  You know, after you hit thirty, 
                        you are no longer required to sell the 
                        cookies door-to-door.  But since 
                        you’ve made it all this way, I’ll take 
                        a box of those Chocolate Mint ones!

                                 JOAN
                        Jon Stone?  I’m Joan Cooney, I called 
                        about our new television program.

                                 JON STONE
                        You?  You look like a.. Texas High School 
                        Principal who became a Republican senator.

                                 JOAN
                        Everyone seems to agree you are the 
                        single greatest writer and director 
                        in childrens’ television.  Yale 
                        Drama, Captain Kangaroo, years of--

           Joan grabs a box, walks with him, sets it next to his DAUGHTER(5).

                                 JON STONE
                        Young lady, as you can well see, I 
                        have no interest in putting more time 
                        into the vapidity of banana peel 
                        humour and sock puppet shenanigans.

                                 JOAN
                        Yes, but the--

                                 JON STONE
                        The world is amiss, my dear!  I can no 
                        longer stand idly by as these children 
                        grow up in a deranged country, divided 
                        - by race, by age, by class, by 
                        gender!  ..And a box’a those Peanut 
                        Butter Sandwich ones if you have ‘em.

                                 JOAN
                        I’d rather teach a man to eat.. cookies.

           A beat.  He winces.  Puts the file box down where he stands.

                                 JON STONE
                        Wow, you do need a writer.
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  31.

           She nods, embarrassed.

                                 JON STONE (CONT’D)
                        You know who would be splendid for 
                        this?  A puppeteer by the name--

                                 JOAN
                        Jim Henson... yah.  I tried.  He said he 
                        doesn’t do kiddie shows.  Joe Raposo the 
                        composer wont answer my calls.  And now I 
                        have millions of dollars and this chance 
                        to make something extraordinary, but--

                                 JON STONE
                        You seem kind, smart, well-mannered.. I’m 
                        not sure you’re really cut out for 
                        producing national television.  And my 
                        daughter doesn’t need another kiddie show. 

           Now or fucking never, Joanie...  Deep breath.

                                 JOAN
                        With respect it’s not really for your 
                        child.  Not for a man with a house in 
                        the country, who drives his Porsche into 
                        the city for Oysters & a Broadway show.

           He pauses.  Turns.  Now it’s interesting scene-work to him.

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        It’s for the poor kids, immigrant kids, 
                        kids who don’t have two parents at home, 
                        left to fend for themselves in this 
                        garbage world you mentioned.  We have the 
                        first workshop in a few weeks, if you’d 
                        consider putting your world-class 
                        expertise for purposes nobler than selling 
                        paper towels for CBS.  I know TV can be 
                        used to teach, but if it’s not 
                        entertaining..  Well, nobody leaves My 
                        Fair Lady humming the plot.

                                 JON STONE
                        (impressed she took the note)
                        Annnnd cut.  Much better.  But alas 
                        I’m not your man.  

           He takes her card, thinks, then... looks to his daughter.

                                 JON
                        Did you say all that to Jim?

           Off Joan, realizing she didn’t.

          INT. WCAU-TV, PHILADELPHIA PUBLIC TV STATION - DAY

           Matt Robinson(“Opportunities in Philadelphia”) picks up the phone.

                                 MATT (ON THE PHONE)
                        Hello? ... Ah, no he is away for 
                        the summer, teaching. ... You bet.
                        (about to hangup, then)
                        When’s the workshop? ... Okay.
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  32.

          INT. CARNEGIE CORPORATION - LLOYD MORRISETT’S OFFICE - DAY

           Joan sits across from Lloyd’s desk, as he hangs up the phone.

                                 LLOYD
                        Can’t even get Philadelphia to come to 
                        the Workshop.  I’ve only got a handful 
                        of RSVPs for from any psychologists or 
                        educational experts.   

                                 JOAN
                        Alright, so no experts, no creatives... 
                        Great start. 

                                 LLOYD
                        Well, we knew getting Jim & Jon & 
                        Joe was a long shot.  But I’m glad 
                        you tried.  And... I’ve been 
                        getting pressure from the higher 
                        ups here at Carnegie, who want to 
                        make sure the program is also... 
                        for middle class children.

                                 JOAN
                        Also?  Or... Only?

                                 LLOYD
                        Well... I know it’s possible to get the 
                        middle class kids to watch, get their 
                        scores up.  The other kids... well, 
                        we’re biting off a lot in our first 
                        year. And I just don’t want to set us 
                        up for a goal we can’t achieve.

                                 JOAN
                        Well, I think we can.  Besides, we 
                        promised the Ford foundation and Doc 
                        Howe it’d help the disadvantaged child.

                                 LLOYD
                        Yes.  The Middle Class and 
                        Disadvantaged child.

                                 JOAN
                        I don’t think-- I mean I don’t know if-- 
                        Can it be for both at the same time?

                                 LLOYD
                        That is... fortunately not my 
                        department. But a question for the new 
                        Executive Director of The Children’s 
                        Television Workshop.  Joan...

           Joan leans in...

                                 LLOYD (CONT’D)
                        Could you make a list, of all the men you 
                        think are qualified for the position?

          INT. JOAN & TIM’S APARTMENT - THAT NIGHT

           Joan is making a list of men for Lloyd.

                                 TIM
                        Then what did you say to Lloyd?
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  33.

                                 JOAN
                        What do you mean?  I’m making the list. 

                                 TIM
                        Jesus Christ, Joan...  YOU should be the 
                        Executive Director, don’t you see that?

                                 JOAN
                        Lloyd said I could be “Deputy Director”.

                                 TIM
                        “Deputy”?.. Who are you - Don Knotts!?
                        (off her reaction)
                        Sorry, I’m angry FOR YOU.

                                 JOAN
                        Tim Cooney, now you are the first 
                        feminist I ever met, of either sex, but 
                        I’ve never seen a single.. person like 
                        me in a position like this?  Because I 
                        can’t see them giving a job like this, 
                        head of the entire project, a multi-
                        million dollar national show to.. to...

                                 TIM
                        Say it.  Say, “A woman”... I don’t 
                        know why you do that.

                                 JOAN
                        Do what?

                                 TIM
                        You pretend like it’s not a thing, so 
                        maybe in your head you... Look, you 
                        researched this show, you created this 
                        show.  Tell them if you don’t get the 
                        top job, you just wont do the show.  

           Joan balks... too ballsy for her.  ..right?

                                 JOAN
                        I fight for things. Important things...

                                 TIM
                        Not yourself.

                                 JOAN
                        Wha--  I mean.  ..Why is that?

                                 TIM
                        I imagine... that’s because it’s 
                        awfully vulnerable to admit that you 
                        need help in the first place.  
                        ...That you’re hurting.

           Joan looks to him, glass of ice trembling in his hand.  OH. She 
           looks away, not prepared for this discussion.  He takes her hand, 
           as if to say, “PLEASE LOOK.  Please say something...”

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        That if you don’t acknowledge the 
                        problem... if you keep pretending it’s 
                        not getting in the way... then maybe 
                        you wont ever have to deal with it.

           Joan looks to Tim - to the glass - to him, his eyes pleading... 
           Holy shit, Joan, does he have to come right out and say it?  
           She looks to him... then quickly away, too scared to engage...                 
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  34.

           On TV: The Loud Intro of “THE TONIGHT SHOW with Johnny Carson”

           Tim looks back from the TV, but Joan’s gone.

          INT. SUBWAY - EVENING

           Joan rides silently.  Then something triggering, turns to see a 
           Homeless Guy and a bottle of booze has spilled.  That smell.

           Quietly, out of focus in the background, we introduce her   
           ALCOHOL COPING MECHANISM: An IMAGINARY MUPPET WORLD - NYU kids, 
           Hassids, construction workers, a mariachi band - ALL MUPPETS.

          EXT. NBC, 30 ROCKERFELLER PLAZA - NIGHT

           Joan, sees a Security Guard she knows (we only see from behind).

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Ms. Ganz!  S’been a long time!

                                 JOAN
                        Hi, Sam, just meeting some of the old 
                        gang for cocktails.  Do ya mind?

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        ‘Course not!

           He welcomes her with his FELT MUPPET HAND.  Joan walks in.  

          INT. 30 ROCKERFELLER PLAZA - STUDIO 6-B “THE TONIGHT SHOW” - NIGHT

                        I didn’t know puppets could be so.. Hip. 
                        I’m obviously the farthest thing from.    
                        Clearly, you’re far more than just 
                        a childrens’ entertainer... 

                                 JIM
                        That’s very nice of you, Ms. Cooney--

                                 JOAN
                        I know why you hate kiddie shows.  
                        Because they’re loud, mindless affairs, 
                        pandering to the dumbest, most artless 
                        child, sitting in front of the TV like 
                        a zombie, eating a box’a Mallomars.

           Jim tilts his head, eyes crinkle, grins.  That is what he thinks.

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        Childrens’ television is a wasteland - 
                        a complete shitshow.  Too hip for ya? 

           Jim starts to say something, but no argument, just blushes.

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        Our show exists for one reason...  to 
                        help kids whose parents cannot help them.  
                        It’s there to teach numbers and letters 
                        to children who would otherwise remain 
                        illiterate their whole lives and never be 
                        able to compete in the world, because of 
                        the circumstances they were born into.  
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  35.

           Jim looks down to KERMIT in his hand...

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        We’ve assembled the best educators in 
                        the world, but your muppets are the 
                        only thing I know that’ll hold the 
                        kids’ attention long enough to teach 
                        them what they need to know.  And, the 
                        5-year-old doesn’t control the TV, his 
                        older brother or his mother do -- and 
                        your comedy works for all of them.  I 
                        have millions of dollars to fund you 
                        experimenting with avant-garde shorts, 
                        animation, stop-motion, absurd comedy.  
                        You’ll show everyone what you can do, 
                        and in the process, give a few kids a 
                        real shot. ...What’s hipper than that?

                                 KIDS (O.S.)
                        DAD!!! / DADDY!

           When FOUR of Jim’s own children - all under 10 - run up to him.  
           Joan had no idea he was a Daddy.  

                                 JIM
                        Hey kiddos!

           She just smiles, offers her card.  His son BRIAN (5) takes it.  

                                 BRIAN HENSON
                        “Joan Coo-ney.”

           Joan smiles, and sees herself out.  Her point made for her.   
           Jim takes Joan’s card from Brian, flips it over, it says:    
           “And you can own your characters.”  

          EST./EXT. THE WALDORF ASTORIA HOTEL - MORNING
           A SIGN on an easel “THE CHILDREN’S TELEVISION WORKSHOP” in...

          INT. WALDORF ASTORIA HOTEL - HALL OUTSIDE THE BALLROOM - DAY

           Joan & Lloyd walk up to the sign. 

                                 LLOYD
                        Well... this is it.  I sent notes back 
                        to everyone who said they couldn’t 
                        come, pleading with them... I spent 
                        forty-five dollars on bagels & cream 
                        cheese.  Someone better show up.

           Joan bashfully hands him a LIST of Men’s Names.

                                 LLOYD (CONT’D)
                        What’s this?

                                 JOAN
                        It’s the list you asked for, of 
                        Executive Directors.  

           Lloyd looks, reads on the list: “JOAN GANZ COONEY”

                                 LLOYD
                        But... I thought you wanted a man 
                        for this position.
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  36.

                                 JOAN
                        Why would you assume that only a--?

           Lloyd looks in his Briefcase, pulls her 52pg report, flips, reads:

                                 LLOYD
                        “He will have to be expert at both 
                        television and education.  HE will need to 
                        be able to manage creative and research--”

                                 JOAN
                        I wrote that?  

           He nods.  A sheepish beat for her.

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        But I... I--

                                 LLOYD
                        I told everyone you would do a great 
                        job, but it’s just.. I know you’ve never 
                        done something like this before.

                                 JOAN
                        Nobody has.  ..What did everyone say? 

                                 LLOYD
                        Well, most people were open to the 
                        idea, except the um, Ford Foundation--

                                 JOAN
                        The Fo--?  She’s a woman!  The only--

                                 LLOYD
                        Look Joan, there’s just no room for 
                        error on this and I don’t want it to be 
                        your head if we can’t pull this off.

                                 JOAN
                        We can.  And.. If I'm not Executive 
                        Director, then.. Then I’m not going 
                        to be any part of the show.  

           And with that she throws open the door to the WORKSHOP BALLROOM...          

           It’s PACKED!  Joan has the wind knocked out of her.  She walks 
           down, shakes hands, greets many smiling faces, when... Someone 
           hands her a box of GIRL SCOUT COOKIES.  Joan turns to find:

                                 JON STONE
                        Let’s teach a man to eat cookies.

           Joan gives Jon a big bear hug.  

                                 JOAN
                        What changed your mind?

                                 JON STONE
                        I got a call from someone...

           Then Jon points behind her.

                                 A FAMILIAR VOICE  (O.S.)
                        Hi there.

           Joan turns.  It’s JIM HENSON.
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  37.

                                 JIM HENSON
                        I’m here to help. 

           Joan smiles, almost at tears.  She hears a piano sparkling... 
           turns to see JOE RAPOSO (28) at an upright piano.

                                 JON STONE
                        I believe you know Joe Raposo, 
                        composer, boy genius, star fucker.

                                 JOE RAPOSO
                        I’m gonna tell Lena Horne you said that!
                        (singing and playing)
                        HELLOOOOO, JOAN COOOONEY!

                                 JOAN
                        Well, Joe Raposo, you do exist.

                                 JIM HENSON
                        Sure, just call Barbara Streisand 
                        and ask her.

                                 JOE RAPOSO
                        That’s Murray Hill 7-7-500.

                                 JOAN
                        I guess the three of you know each other.

           Gerry, that Harvard Academic from Joan’s trip, approaches.  

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        This is our Harvard developmental 
                        psychologist, Gerry Lesser, who will be 
                        leading our educational team and running 
                        our Workshops, to figure out what you 
                        guys are writing songs and skits about.  
                        Gerry, this is our Creative team.  

                                 JIM
                        Gerry.  I’m Jim.  That’s Joe, Jon 
                        and you know Joan.

                                 GERRY
                        Jim.

                                 JON STONE
                        Gerry!  Jon.  

                                 GERRY
                        Jon!

                                 JON STONE
                        Gerry, you know Jim, Joan, Joe.

                                 GERRY
                        Joe!

                                 JOE RAPOSO
                        Gerry, Joe!  Jon, Jim, Joan!

           All laughing.  Joan is thrilled.  COMPLETE SUCCESS!             

           When Evelyn (Tiffany Haddish) approaches Joan. 

                                 JOAN
                        Evelyn!  What happened to the job at NBC?
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  38.

                                 EVELYN
                        I was going to take it, but then.. 
                        they gave it to someone else.  Said my 
                        experience was not applicable to the 
                        major leagues. 

                                 JOAN
                        I can’t tell you how essential it 
                        will be to what we’re about to do.. 
                        If you would be up for joining us?

           Evelyn smiles, nods.  

           Joan walks to the front of the conference table, looks to Lloyd 
           who is looking at Jim & Jon & Joe & Gerry - beyond impressed.

                                 LLOYD
                        Insufferable.

           And Lloyd tears up her LIST of other Executive Directors.

           Joan smiles. Then addresses the group (polite, if not meek):

                                 JOAN
                        Good morning, I’m Joan--

           But a few people aren’t seated/listening.  Jon gives her some 
           silent “direction” - a bit of poise, calm, power..  She tries it:

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        (to the stragglers)
                        Thank you, we’re beginning.

           They immediately sit, silent.  Jon makes an “Ooo, Perfect!” face.

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        (new poised & powerful Joan)
                        I’m Joan Ganz Cooney, Executive Director 
                        of The Children’s Television Workshop. 
                        We have an unprecedented opportunity to 
                        use television to teach, and have asked 
                        you here to help decide just what it is 
                        middle class & disadvantaged children 
                        need to learn most before starting first 
                        grade.  I’d encourage you, rather than 
                        trying to shove the classroom model into 
                        that little box, to lean into the 
                        extraordinary things T.V. can do that 
                        the classroom cannot.  Especially as 
                        school has a captive audience, whereas 
                        our program must be entertaining enough 
                        to hold the child’s attention - no small 
                        feat.  The question before us, is no 
                        longer whether children learn from 
                        television, we know they do, it’s our 
                        mission to decide what they will learn.

           Gerry takes over, he has listed “GOALS” on the chalkboard.

                                 GERRY
                        So lets brainstorm big picture goals.  
                        Alright, just call ‘em out.

                                 SOMEONE
                        Teach ‘em to count!
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  39.

                                 GERRY
                        Great.  So Numbers...

                                 SOMEONE ELSE
                        Teach them to read!

                                 GERRY
                        Okay.  We’ll call that Letters...

                                 MATT
                        I’d like this program to prepare my three-
                        year-old daughter to react properly the 
                        first time someone calls her, “A Nigger”. 

           All turn to MATT ROBINSON (from Philly), sitting there smiling.   

           Jim goes from slouching to upright.  Gerry looks to Joan.  Joan 
           looks to Lloyd -- who is at the bagels, pretending he can’t hear.  

                                 JOAN
                        Everyone, this is Matt Robinson, a 
                        talented writer from Philadelphia, 
                        joining us for the workshop.

                                 MATT
                        I think this is an amazing opportunity, 
                        it’s just.. this is a lot of very nice, 
                        very smart, but... 

                                 JON STONE
                        ...very white people to make a show for 
                        a bunch of inner-city kids?

                                 MATT
                        (smiling, almost blushing)
                        I wasn’t gonna say it like that, but...

           Jon LAUGHS, throws his arm around Matt, big squeeze, fast friends. 

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know if the plan was to invite 
                        some of us to the table for show, hoping 
                        we’d stay quiet?  But Joan, I know you 
                        spent a lot of time in the community, so 
                        you know that we don’t really just sit 
                        quiet.  Especially with an opportunity 
                        like this to help our kids.

           She smiles.  Gerry, rolls up his sleeves...

                                 GERRY
                        Well, that makes for a great question. 
                        Who is the audience for our show?

                                 EVELYN
                        I wrote down, “Middle Class and 
                        Disadvantaged children”...
                        But those are two very different kids 
                        from two very different communities, 
                        who lead very different lives.
                        Hi everyone!  I’m Evelyn, in-charge of 
                        getting the kids to watch the show.  
                        P.R./Community Outreach..  and I’m 
                        just looking for clarification on what 
                        community it is I’m.. reaching out to. 
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  40.

                                 JOE RAPOSO
                        What about Puerto Rican kids.. Chinese?  

                                 SOMEONE
                        The kids in Appalachia?

                                 MATT
                        I mean, black people haven’t cornered 
                        the market on illiteracy.  

                                 EVELYN
                        No, those white southerners give us 
                        a real run for our money.

           ARTHUR (50s, white - Jeff Daniels) Academic, confident, lecturer.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Arthur Johnson, University of California 
                        - we are talking about using this 
                        program to try to close the Achievement 
                        Gap for inner-city children, are we not? 

                                                EVELYN
                       MATT
               (happy to have an ally)
                                      Yes!
           Absolutely.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Which is rooted in a Deficit Model.

                      GERRY
                                                 MATT
           Arthur, I--
                                      Let the man talk, Gerry.

                                 ARTHUR
                        We have an opportunity to not just 
                        teach curriculum, but values.

           Matt and Evelyn’s head nod up and down.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        The inner city child wants what the 
                        white child in the suburbs has.  Their 
                        parents-- or rather parent, singular 
                        wants that white life for their child.

                                 EVELYN
                        I’m not sure I would say it like--

                                 SOMEONE
                        Wait, is this a black show?

                                 JOE RAPOSO
                        What’s a black show?

                                 JON STONE
                        I assume most of the people in that 
                        neighborhood would be black or 
                        Hispanic, or immigrants of some ilk--

           Joan freezes, keeps a smile.  Hadn’t thought of it, frankly.

                                 SOMEONE
                        What neighborhood?

                                 JON STONE
                        Well it’s set in Harlem, isn’t it?
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  41.

                      SOMEONE
                                             SOMEONE ELSE
           IS IT!?
                                      Oh, MY!

                                 ARTHUR
                        And ghetto children live in what is 
                        tantamount to a War Zone - a violent, 
                        unstable, unloved climate. They speak 
                        an inferior dialect of English… 

                                 JOAN
                        Arthur...

           Joan starts to stand up, but Matt’s gestures to her - he’s got it.

                                 MATT
                        I guess, is British.. or Australian 
                        English inferior to--?

                                 ARTHUR
                        “Are” they inferior?  Plural. 

           Ooooo...  Matt’s eyes go wide. 

                                 GERRY
                        Let’s get away from criteria like 
                        “deficits”.  More than reciting 
                        lectures, we need-- 

                                 ARTHUR
                        To put the fashionable sensitivities of 
                        the day above these children’s well-
                        being?  It’s not even been empirically 
                        proven whether or not the deficit gap 
                        can even be closed in the first place.  
                        It may not be nurture as much as...   

           A beat.  Even the Academics look to him with new eyes.  Fuck.

                                 EVELYN
                        I’m sorry, I missed that.

                                 MATT
                        He’s saying there’s a chance it’s 
                        just... a genetic defect?

                                 ARTHUR
                        If we really do want to help, then it 
                        doesn’t help anyone, least of all those 
                        children, to pretend we live in a world 
                        where everything is equal.

           Joan rises again, but Evelyn’s waves to her that she’s got it.  

                                 EVELYN
                        You’ll forgive me, I’m just a community 
                        organizer, so I’ll speak to that 
                        community - where life is far more 
                        challenging, stacked against them.  But 
                        that doesn’t mean there is an 
                        intellectual gap, or “deficit” in their 
                        aptitude.  In fact, those kids are 
                        racing up the same hill as the other 
                        kids, with much more weight on their 
                        backs, trying to keep up.  And perhaps 
                        if any distinction, there is something 
                        to be said of their ability to survive 
                        in that environment.
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  42.

                                 JON STONE
                        Well-said.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Well, a tee-vee show wont save them.

                                 MAN’S VOICE
                        Then I just wasted four million bucks!

           They turn to see DOC HOWE (Tommy Lee Jones), who snuck in.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I’m sorry, and you are?

                                 DOC HOWE
                        A spy, sent by Captain Kangaroo. 
                        Harold Howe, Commissioner of Education 
                        for these United States.  I was in town 
                        for some United Nations horseshit, when 
                        I remembered y’all were getting started 
                        just down the street helpin’ the 
                        kiddies, and thought I’d peek in.  

           Doc holds up an Envelope.

                                 DOC HOWE (CONT’D)
                        This is a little Test our team in D.C. 
                        drafted up, they’re gonna give to a 
                        bunch of kids before and after watching 
                        your show, to see if they learned what 
                        you said they would.  Thought I’d sneak 
                        ya a copy ahead’a time, hedge our bets.  
                        If there’s gonna be a future for this 
                        show, I gotta show all those whackjobs 
                        down in Washington whether or not this 
                        cockamamie idea’a yours really can 
                        change the world.  Or if we just wasted 
                        millions of dollars in the middle of a 
                        war and famine… on puppets and songs.  
                        (hand on Jon’s back)
                        Sound good to you, Pappa Bear? 

                                 JON STONE
                        Aye-aye, Sir.

                                 DOC HOWE
                        That’a boy.  Break a leg, everyone.  
                        The futures of those kids lives rest 
                        on your thin liberal arts shoulders.

           Doc leans to Joan’s ear, eyes Arthur:

                                 DOC HOWE (CONT’D)
                        Now listen, don’t you go taking any 
                        shit from.. anybody, ya hear me?  Make 
                        the show you talked about. 

           Joan nods, smiles.  Doc grabs a bagel, leaves.

                                 ARTHUR
                        The show may help kids who have parental 
                        reinforcement, but if you think children 
                        in Harlem, D.C., Bed-Stuy will even 
                        watch an educational program.. I can’t 
                        be of any help.  You’ll be lucky to get 
                        five percent viewership in the ghettos. 
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  43.

                                 JOAN
                        Well, we’ll see about that.

                                 MATT
                        This isn’t some study.. for a scholarly 
                        journal somewhere, or some part-time 
                        volunteer program where white folks 
                        pitch in to help and hope for the best.  
                        This is whether or not these kids will 
                        be able to learn to read, find a job, 
                        support their families.  And none of 
                        their lives will be improved by all of 
                        us just giving it the old college try.  
                        (he turns to Joan, re: Arthur)
                        We have to WIN.

           Joan takes a deep breath - intimidating, but knows he’s right.  

                                 GERRY
                        So, some questions to consider in our 
                        workshops.  Who is our audience?  Where is 
                        the show set?  Who are our characters?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Well what are they?  Black.. white?

                                 JIM
                        Maybe... the characters don’t need to 
                        be black or white.

           They turn to Jim, slouched in his chair sketching: Two Puppets.     
           One stout & orange, one long & yellow.  This SKETCH is illuminated 
           by a Workshop Lamp CLICKING on, in...

          INT. MUPPET WORKSHOP - ANOTHER DAY

           OPERATING TABLE: Scissors, Needles, Cotton Balls, Rubbing Alcohol. 
           Paper pattern sketched.  Cut out.  Foam rubber, rubber cemented. 
           Orange and Yellow felt fabric cut.  Stitched.  Cardboard.  Paint.  
           A tongue.  Two Eyes.  A Nose.  Tuft of Hair.

           Then... Two figures slowly rise into frame: A long Yellow puppet 
           & a stout Orange puppet - we’ll one day know as Bert & Ernie.  

           Reveal... Jim & Frank puppeteering. Bert on Jim, Ernie on Frank. 
           We are behind the two of them, facing a mirror, slowly pushing in, 
           as they play with voices, mannerisms -- improvising, exploring:

                                 JIM/YELLOW
                        Hey.

                                 FRANK/ORANGE
                        Hey yourself.

                                 JIM/YELLOW
                        (now a posh voice)
                        And just hoooow, may I ask, are yooooo--

                                 FRANK/ORANGE
                        (matching posh)
                        Quite well, yes, quite, yes.

           Jim shakes his head, they try again, different voices:

                                 JIM/YELLOW
                        Yeah, Havin’ a good one, cow polk? 
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  44.

                                 FRANK/ORANGE
                        Yessir, I’m-ah, I’m-a havin’a... teensy-
                        weensy, - I’m-ah, tellin’a you’ah... 

           Jim starts laughing at how bad it is.

                                 FRANK/ORANGE (CONT’D)
                        (laughing at himself)
                        That’s-a spicy meat-a-ball!

                                 JIM/YELLOW
                        You bet yer parker house buns.

                                 FRANK OZ
                        What is this, like a... a rich.. 
                        Italian person from.. Kentucky? 

                                                FRANK
                       JIM
               (snorting laughing)
                                      That old trope.
           Yup.  

                                 FRANK OZ
                        What’s the brief on this one?  You 
                        said they wanted a smart-alicky--

                                 JIM
                        The original idea was to have a clever 
                        child correcting his teacher, but then 
                        they didn’t want kids to copy that and 
                        get in trouble... so I said we could 
                        maybe make’em two friends, kinda Laurel 
                        ‘n Hardy - and one is a little more 
                        stiff, the other more goofy.

                                 FRANK OZ
                        Well, we know who’s who here, don’t we?

           Frank switches them.  NOW: Jim is Ernie & Frank is Bert. Perfect.

                                 JIM/ERNIE
                        Well hello there, friend!

                                 FRANK/BERT
                        What is it?

                                 JIM/ERNIE
                        Just that today is MONDAY, and you know 
                        what day comes before Monday, dontcha?

                    FRANK/BERT
                                           JIM/ERNIE (CONT'D)
           Yes of course, I--
                                      SUNday.

                                 FRANK/BERT
                        Right. Yes, I was about to say, I seem 
                        to remember, as it was yesterday.  And 
                        every seventh day since the world began--

           Jim laughs, but keeps it together.

                                 JIM/ERNIE
                        Uh-huh!  And do you know what comes 
                        after Monday, ole buddy, ole pal?

                                 FRANK/BERT
                        I just explained, it’s Sunday, then 
                        Monday, then--
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  45.

                                 JIM/ERNIE
                        Would you like me to TELL you what day 
                        comes after Monday, oh best friend of mine?

                                 FRANK/BERT
                        No, not particularl--

           Jim stifles a hearty laugh, but pushes through.  This is the game.

                                 JIM/ERNIE
                        TUUUUESday.  That is the day that..

                                 FRANK/BERT
                        This isn’t really news to anyone.  
                        There’s a calendar in every room.

           Jim looks away, chuckling, then--

                                 JIM/ERNIE
                        And can you imagine, just look into 
                        the future and guess what could 
                        come after Tuuuuesday?

                                 FRANK/BERT
                        I bet you’re gonna tell me.

           Jim just rolls on the floor, laughing that Ernie “Hee-hee” laugh.

          INT. A NICE RESTAURANT - PRIVATE BACK ROOM - NIGHT

           Private room cocktails: Joan, Jim, Jon, Joe, Gerry, Matt, Evelyn, 
           Lloyd and WIVES mingle... Joan sees Tim alone with a seltzer.

                                 JOAN
                        Go talk to the wives...

                                 TIM
                        I don’t wanna talk to the wives...

           She laughs, but he’s kinda serious, as she nudges him into them.

                                 WIFE
                        Oh!  You must be Mister Joan Cooney.

           Tim nods, forces a smile, a good sport.  Joan approaches, Jim:

                                 JOAN
                        Where’s Jane?

                                 JIM
                        One of the kids is sick.. and the dog.

                                 JOAN
                        Rowlf?

                                 JIM
                        Yah... Some sort of intestinal issue. 
                        Something to do with having someone’s 
                        arm two feet up his ass..

           Joan laughs, covers her mouth, scandalized. 

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        The Vet said he had only seen this 
                        kind of thing before in The Village.

           Tim sees Joan laughing with Jim, while he’s stuck with wives.
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  46.

          EXT./EST. SUN RISING OVER THE WALDORF - MORNING

          INT. WALDORF ASTORIA BALLROOM - THE WORKSHOP - DAY 2

           Gerry writes: “DAY 2”. Lloyd puts out new bagels.  Joan grabs one.

                                 LLOYD
                        Joan.  Did you see Jim’s contract?
                        He’s asking to OWN the characters.

                                 JOAN
                        Yah, did you see his salary?  I know for 
                        a fact he normally gets paid ten times 
                        that.  He’s doing this for cost, and for 
                        the right reasons... And I don’t know 
                        how we do the show without him. 

                                 LLOYD
                        What if one day he changes his mind, 
                        and takes his puppets with him?

           A moment... Joan has no idea.  

                                 A HOTEL BELLMAN
                        Mr. Morrisett, a phone call.

           Lloyd leaps to the Lobby, As Evelyn enters with poster materials:

                                 EVELYN
                        Just the woman I wanted to see.  So.  
                        I wanted to get started, you know 
                        getting the word out, but I thought, 
                        if there was a little money for 
                        materials.  I know it’s non-profit and 
                        all, but I thought if I could get Jim 
                        to draw some characters I could get my 
                        sister to let me use the copy machine 
                        at her office if I go in on a Saturday- 

           Joan is so touched but finally stops her.

                                 JOAN
                        Evelyn, we... budgeted money for you.  
                        Getting these kids to watch, is 
                        probably the hardest part-- the most 
                        important part of the whole project.

                                 EVELYN
                        Oh. Well, that’s great, because I 
                        thought if we can put some small ads in 
                        the bigger congregation’s church 
                        bulletins.  Now they can be upwards of 
                        a dollar per week, for - I’m thinking - 
                        a few weeks leading up to the premiere.  
                        If we have thirty-five.. forty bucks, I 
                        could really stretch it, get people 
                        talking, and kids--

                                 JOAN
                        Evelyn.

                                 EVELYN
                        What?

                                 JOAN
                        We put aside a little more than that.
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  47.

           At the Bagels, across the room: The academics steep their tea. 

                                 ACADEMIC
                        I think this one is an “everything”.

                                 SOMEONE ELSE 
                        Whatever happened to “plain”?  Haha..

           They laugh to each other, when from across the room, they hear:

                                 EVELYN
                        A MILLION DOLLARS?!?!?!

           Joan blushes at Evelyn’s excitement.

                                 EVELYN (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna buy a movie theatre and have 
                        our show playing on the big screen all 
                        day, every day.  Up on the marquee at 
                        The Apollo Theatre!  Hell, I’ll get 
                        Martha and the Vandellas to sing about 
                        it from a limousine, as the whole Alvin 
                        Ailey company dances up 125th!
                        (singing & dancing with Joan)
                        CAAAAALLING OUT AROUND THE WORLD, 
                        ARE YOU READY FOR A BRAND NEW BEAT? 

           Joe hears her, and accompanies on the PIANO.

                                 EVELYN (CONT’D)
                        SUMMER’S HERE AND THE TIME IS RIGHT, 
                        FOR DANCING IN THE STREET!

                                 MATT
                        PHILADELPHIA, P.A.!

           Matt joins her, dancing.  As does Jon and Jim and Gerry...   

                                 JON/JIM/JOE/GERRY
                        DANCIN’ IN THA STREET!

                                 EVELYN
                        ALL WE NEED IS MUSIC.  SWEET MUSIC!..

           When the door opens and Lloyd enters.  Sees this.  Oh, his face.    

                                 LLOYD
                        What is this, American Bandstand?

                                 MATT
                        Can’t be!  There’s colored people!

           Evelyn high-fives Matt!  

           Lloyd waves Joan to follow him out to the Lobby: Shuts the door.

                                 LLOYD
                        You have to pick a Producer to be your 
                        eyes & ears, so YOU can start visiting all 
                        the affiliate public TV stations around 
                        the country who will carry our show.

                                 JOAN
                        I leave tonight to meet with Seattle and 
                        then Portland..  Why are you so--?
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  48.

                                 LLOYD
                        I just got off the phone with our 
                        Affiliate station in Dallas, and luckily 
                        I was able to talk them off a ledge, but 
                        you have to get every city to agree to 
                        air it, or no child will ever see it.  

                                 JOAN
                        I understand how television works, Lloyd--

                                 LLOYD
                        No, Joan.  You live in New York City.  
                        You eat.. ethnic food on your way to.. 
                        jazz clubs, with your.. lesbian friends, 
                        talking about.. Votes for women, and--

                                 JOAN
                        We got the vote, Lloyd, a while back--

           He sidles upto a MAP OF AMERICA in the lobby, as a visual aid.

                                 LLOYD
                        Seattle will be fine, hippies in 
                        Portland, San Francisco will love it... 
                        BUT, down here (the south), and here, 
                        (midwest) we’re gonna have real trouble.

                                 JOAN
                        Okay, so just the whole country.

                                 LLOYD
                        To people in Mississippi, Alabama, Nebraska 
                        ...MISSISSIPPI, our program is going to be 
                        a lot to take.  There are already rumblings 
                        about this show having.. an Agenda.

                                 JOAN
                        We do... To teach kids their ABC’s.

                                 LLOYD
                        Mhm.  Some programmers are worried it 
                        will seem... political.  In-your-face...

                                 JOAN
                        You mean...?

           The ever-subtle Lloyd just OPENS THE DOOR, without breaking eye 
           contact with Joan -- where they’re dancing on the table.          
           A Hispanic Academic, spinning a Chinese Teacher in a Wheelchair...

                                 EVERYONE
                        DANCIN’ IN THAAA STREET!

           Door closes.

                                 LLOYD
                        We can’t risk ostracizing the very 
                        people we need to reach.  You saw 
                        Fiddler on the Roof on Broadway.  
                        Half the audience were..

                                 JOAN
                        (fucking with him)
                        Fiddlers? ... Roofers.
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  49.

                                 LLOYD
                        Jews, Joan, Jews.  People like to 
                        see themselves. 

                                 JOAN
                        Exactly.

                                 LLOYD
                        You know I’m on your side.  But this 
                        is why we need to stick to CURRICULUM - 
                        letters and numbers, nothing.. social.  

                                 JOAN
                        But we discussed it was equally 
                        important to share VALUES, of 
                        equality and representation and--

                                 LLOYD
                        And what happens when one of the 
                        affiliates doesn’t share those values? 
                        I’ll tell you what - they pull the show.  
                        Then they talk to other stations, it 
                        creates a domino effect, and suddenly 
                        nobody gets to see your show.  Last 
                        year, a station refused to air The Lab’s 
                        episode on Race Relations.  Word got 
                        out, people called their local stations.  
                        The whole country pulled it.  

                                 JOAN
                        What are you suggesting?

                                 LLOYD
                        No one objects to A-B-C and 1-2-3.  
                        Aim for the targets you know you can hit.

           He nods to DOC’s TEST in her hands.  She nods...  Then she sees a 
           FILM REEL sticking out from Lloyd’s briefcase.

                                 LLOYD (CONT’D)
                        You know I never meddle, artistically.

                                 JOAN
                        But?...

                                 LLOYD
                        Well, I think I found an actor who 
                        would be great for one of the hosts.  
                        Someone affiliates would just love.

           REVEAL: This is being shown on a TV MONITOR in the Workshop.

           REVERSE SHOT: Jon, Joe, Jim, Matt, Evelyn watching, horrified.    
           Lloyd is enraptured, eyes soft, mouthing along.

                                 JON STONE
                        Is this a joke?
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  50.

                                 LLOYD
                        His name is Bob McGrath.
                        There are a lot of Irish immigrants.

                                 MATT
                        Yah, in the 1860’s...

           Small high-five from Jon to Matt - now thick as thieves.

                                 LLOYD
                        Well, we’ll have all kinds of viewers, 
                        and for some, seeing Bob--

                        In our profession we call it Patterning. 

                                 GERRY
                        So this brings up a great question 
                        about our cast of characters.  Who 
                        are the people in our neighborhood?

                                 JOE RAPOSO
                        (at the piano)
                        OHHH OHHHHH... 
                        WHOOO ARE THE PEOPLE IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD?  
                        ..IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD? 
                        ..IN YOUR NEIGH-BOR-HOOD? 

                                 ACADEMIC
                        What is this?

                                 JIM HENSON
                        In our profession, we call it a SONG.

                                 GERRY
                        Shall we get started?

           Matt looks to the empty chair next to him.

                                 MATT
                        Are we gonna wait for Arthur?

           Gerry looks to Joan, then...

                                 GERRY
                        I did not invite him back.
                        When people tell you they can’t be 
                        of any help... believe them. 

           Everyone sits up straighter.  A newfound respect for Gerry.

                                 JOE RAPOSO
                        OH... A BIGOT IS A PERSON
                        IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD?  

           Everyone laughs, some sing along.

                                 JOE & CO.
                        ..IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD?

                                                EVELYN
           I like this song...
                                      It’s catchy.

                                 JOE RAPOSO
                        THE PEOPLE THAT YOU PASS,

                                 JOAN

                                 GERRY
                        Wrap it up.

                                 JOE RAPOSO
                        So whaddya say?!

           They finish, heads on hands, like old vaudevillians...      
           The Academics are astounded, jaws on the floor.  APPLAUSE.

                                 MATT
                        I mean, Joan, you told us to lean into 
                        what TV does well.  Regarding casting, 
                        maybe we “show, don’t tell”.  Just have 
                        a terrific black lady and Bob - the 
                        whitest man the world has ever known - 
                        hanging out like it’s nothing.

                                 JON STONE
                        Are we showing the world as it is?  
                        Or as we’d like it to be?

           A Moment... They all look to each other - good question.

                                 JIM HENSON
                        I mean, there are puppet monsters...

                                 ANOTHER ACADEMIC
                        It’s not healthy to mix make-believe 
                        and real life, or it confuses the 
                        child.  Just look at Fred Rodgers’ 
                        program.  That trolly goes to The Land 
                        of Make-Believe.  A clear line.

                                 GERRY
                        Yes, but he focuses on emotional needs, 
                        whereas we have curriculum goals--

                                 MATT
                        And Values.  We can teach about the 
                        prejudice that exists for these kids--

                                 LLOYD
                        I think we need to stick to letters and 
                        numbers.  The things Doc is TESTing for.

                                 EVELYN
                        Okay, I hear that, but... well...
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  52.

                                 MATT
                        I mean, it doesn’t matter what comes 
                        after A & B, if you’re too scared to 
                        walk to school in the first place? 

                                 LLOYD
                        Why would you be scared of school?

                                 MATT
                        ‘Cause they beat the shit outta you!

           Very raw.  More than he intended.  He takes a breath, regroups.

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        Who is this show for?  Hmm?
                        (he sees Gerry--)
                        No, don’t write it on the board, Gerry.  
                        (he turns to-)
                        Joan...  Who is this show for?

           Joan looks to Lloyd.   

                                 JOAN
                        The truth is, Matt... Carnegie wants our 
                        show for middle class kids.  The U.S. 
                        Department of Education and the Ford 
                        Foundation want it for disadvantaged kids--

                                 MATT
                        Who do YOU want it for?

                                 JOAN
                        I think.. there’s no reason this program 
                        cannot enrich the lives of all children.

           Matt looks off, in that way you do to try and keep the sad down.

                                 MATT
                        (soft, to himself)
                        You spend so much of your life trying 
                        to throw people off the scent.  Then 
                        when you finally need to... Ahem.  
                        (comes right out with it)
                        When my father sat me down, and tried 
                        to explain.. why people hated us, for 
                        no reason.  It’s probably the only 
                        thing I remember my father ever sitting 
                        me down to teach me..

                                 LLOYD
                        There are real risks to the child 
                        discussing these things without proper 
                        emotional support structures in pla--

                                 EVELYN
                        There are risks to these kids walking 
                        to the corner to get a quart of milk!

                                 LLOYD
                        I’m saying for the purpose of the 
                        show, we might want to stick to the 
                        fundamentals of our world.

                                 MATT
                        Of your world.  Your advantaged world. 
                        See, that’s the advantage.  Not having 
                        to worry about all that, all the time.  
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  53.

                                 JOAN
                        (rises, leads)
                        This program will proudly help teach 
                        middle-class kids.  But... please hear me 
                        when I say... If this show does not 
                        improve the education, the life, of the 
                        inner-city child -- I would personally 
                        consider our entire experiment a failure.

           They all nod.  Their marching orders clear.  Jim nods to Joan.

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        It will be much harder to succeed with 
                        children of any background, whose 
                        parents can’t provide reinforcement.  
                        And much harder for our amazing Evelyn 
                        to get them watching in the first place.   
                        But of course, that’s why those kids 
                        need this show the most.  They are.. the 
                        Bull’s Eye of our target.

                                 JON STONE
                        Good.

                                 JIM HENSON
                        Good.

                                 EVELYN
                        Maybe we can think up another 
                        metaphor for black kids that’s not 
                        a Bull’s Eye, but.. good!

                                 MATT
                        I’m just-- I mean, I know Doc’s 
                        test will show if kids can learn 
                        from the show, but... well, how are 
                        we gonna know if the kids we made 
                        the show for.. are even watching?

           They all turn to Joan.

                                 JOAN
                        ...I dunno.  But I’ll figure it out.

          INT. JOAN & TIM’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           New confident Joan packs, calling off to Tim at the bathroom sink.

                                 JOAN
                        I leave tomorrow morning for Seattle.  
                        And I think I just bring it up to the 
                        affiliates, acknowledge the issue, so 
                        we can deal with it.  

           She looks at the liquor cart, empty.. immediately nervous again.  

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        Tim, I um, wanted to mention that I saw 
                        a place that said it could help with--

           A KNOCK at the door. Joan gets it - a DELIVERY MAN (Muppet).

                                 DELIVERY MUPPET
                        Hi there, you uh Tim Cooney?  Sign 
                        here please.  Thank you.
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  54.

           He hands her a BAG, A LIQUOR BOTTLE.  She closes the door.

                                 JOAN
                        Tim, can we--

                       TIM
                                             JOAN (CONT'D)
           Who’s the--(bottle)?
                                      No, please Tim, let me say 
                                      this, because--

           Tim sits at the table, with supplies, re-bandaging his hand.

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        Ooo, what happened to your hand?

                                 TIM
                        It’s been like that for three days.

                                 JOAN
                        No...

                                 TIM
                        Yah, I thought you were trying to 
                        save me embarrassment. 

                                 JOAN
                        It’s been lots of late nights and 
                        early mornings, I guess I just see 
                        you in bed, or... What happened?

           Tim sits, determined to be honest, not embarrassed.

                                 TIM
                        So, three nights ago, you didn’t come 
                        home for dinner again, and I got a 
                        steak because I had a shitty day at the 
                        office where I almost got fired--

                                 JOAN
                        Fired?

                                 TIM
                        Guess I had more to drink at lunch 
                        than I thought, and not enough food 
                        to.. balance it out, or... 

                                 JOAN
                        Tim Cooney..

                                 TIM
                        So then I came home, upset, determined 
                        to tell you, to... I don’t know, like if 
                        I told you, then I’d be too embarrassed 
                        to do it again, or-- so I got a nice 
                        steak, so you’d be less mad.  Then it 
                        was nine o’clock and you still weren’t 
                        home.  So I finished the scotch.  Then I 
                        was so drunk, when I went to cook the 
                        steak I burned my hand on the pan--

                       JOAN
                                             TIM (CONT'D)
           What?
                                      Had to go to the hospital--

                                 JOAN
                        Why didn’t you call or--

                                 TIM
                        ..where I realized I hadn’t paid the 
                        insurance for six months... 
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  55.

                                 JOAN
                        What?!

                                 TIM
                        And I spoke to a doctor.  Asked for help.

           Joan is floored.  Thrilled.

                                 JOAN
                        With the--

           He nods.

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        Oh. That’s great.  What did he say?

           He pulls out a PRESCRIPTION PILL BOTTLE.

                                 TIM
                        Antabuse.  Makes you sick if you 
                        drink.  So sick you don’t wanna drink.  
                        Threw all the liquor away - hope ya 
                        don’t mind.. Saved that bottle from 
                        the Finger Lakes we got together, 
                        which was shitty wine, but thought 
                        maybe it had some sentimental-

           Joan is trying to process what all this means.  She looks at the 
           BOTTLE just delivered, with a “then who..?” Finds a small card: 
           “Break a leg at the workshop. Love Lewis & The WNDT Gang”.

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        Your friend Patti called, the night I 
                        had a little too much-- one of the 
                        nights.  She found an earring behind the 
                        couch from when you stayed over on your 
                        research trip, she was mailing it and 
                        needed our-- And.. I heard her-- her 
                        daughter, in the background.. And she 
                        said she’d kill me if I told you - but 
                        she mentioned what it was keeping you 
                        from feeling ready to have a baby.  

           Tim produces a PAMPHLET: A Doctor with a Couple & a BABY.

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        So I’m done drinking.  Forever.  And.. I 
                        made an appointment for next week.  
                        Figured your show premieres in a little 
                        over a year.. so we enjoy the summer, 
                        then once it gets cold out... we find a 
                        way to keep warm, then, in a year from 
                        now, we’ll have your amazing show, and a 
                        new audience member to watch it!

           She starts to say... but then stops, forces a smile.

          INT. JOAN’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           A MAP OF AMERICA - GREEN Pins in SEATTLE & PORTLAND - MATCHES TO:

          EXT. AMERICA FROM ABOVE/ INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

           Joan, looking down at the country.
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  56.

          INT. A LOCAL STATION - DAY

           Joan trucks in her luggage, shakes hands hello...

          INT. JOAN’S OFFICE - MORNING

           Three GREEN PINS in Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco.     
           When there’s a knock at the door, it’s a MAN IN A SUIT (Black, 
           40s) sits down with Joan and shows her a RED FOLDER.

          INT. HOWARD JOHNSONS - ICE MACHINE - NIGHT

           Joan, bag in tow, is keying in her room, when she sees another 
           BUSINESS WOMAN?? (40s) at the ICE, who gives her a warm smile.  

                                 BUSINESS WOMAN??
                        Hi there.

                                 JOAN
                        Hi...

           She sees Joan’s face, starts to say something, then doesn’t, then:

                                 BUSINESS WOMAN??
                        Sorry.. are you okay?

           Joan nods, but not believably.  Joan opens her Room Door, 
           then turns back - about to SAY SOMETHING... When the Woman’s 
           KIDS run up.  Joan forces a smile, shuts the door.  Alone.

          INT. MUPPET WORKSHOP - DAY

           Joan walks past, towing luggage, and sees Jim at that 
           Operating Table, sewing blue fur together [Grover].

                                 JIM
                        Well hey there!  How was ..Chicago?

                                 JOAN
                        Signed on.  How was the workshop?

                                 JIM
                        I wanted to do an insert about the 
                        number 7, but according to the experts 
                        1 and 7 look waaay too much alike and 
                        the kids will be confused. As do 3 & 8, 
                        2 & 5.  And that god damn 6 is clearly 
                        just masquerading as an upside-down 9.  
                        And don’t get them staaarted on zero!

           Joan laughs.  Then looks at his handiwork.

                                 JOAN
                        Is that the famous Henson stitch?

                                 JIM
                        How’d you hear about that? 

                                 JOAN
                        (then)
                        Your wife.  First day I met you.
                        How do you... keep it all together?

                                 JIM
                        It’s a zig-zag stitch that--
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  57.

                                 JOAN
                        No, I mean... the fact that you’re so 
                        ambitious and still-- I’m struggling 
                        to... and I don’t know if there’s 
                        anyone in the exact same boat, but 
                        when I see you with--  What I mean is-- 

                                 JIM
                        ..Is that what you came to ask me about?

                                 JOAN
                        (handing him a contract)
                        We have the final contract.  Split 
                        profits from any licensing, but you 
                        own your muppets.

                                 JIM
                        Terrific.  Sorry for the hassle, I just 
                        wanted to make sure.. I dunno.. That 
                        they have some integrity, not just 
                        change themselves for whatever the--?
                        (then)
                        I think maybe one strengthens the other.  

                                 JOAN
                        Beg your pardon?

                                 JIM
                        This job makes me a better Dad.. And I 
                        think being so amazed by my kids makes 
                        me work harder to get this just right.   
                        (seeing her face)
                        But that didn’t answer your question.

                                 JOAN
                        I just don’t understand how anyone can 
                        manage both. I never see you stress out, or--

                                 JIM
                        Oh, that’s easy. I hide behind the puppets.  
                        They can say things I never could. 

                                 JOAN
                        It’s just all so.. seamless.

           He waxes the thread.  Sews two pieces of fabric, side-by-side.

                                 JIM

                        (he flips the fabric)
                        It only seems seamless.  It’s a somewhat 
                        labor-intensive quilting stitch.  But 
                        when done correctly that stitch, and all 
                        the hard work and long hours just.. 
                        Disappear.

                        And what happens if they don’t sign on?

           WHOOSH...  Joan’s Auto-pilot stops at this question.  She turns.

                                 JOAN

           Joan looks around: Scissors, Needles, Cotton Balls, Alcohol.   
           When a DOCTOR (MUPPET) enters - if Olympia Dukakis was a Muppet.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Hi, Joan?  Got a call from ..Tim.    
                        Said you two were trying to have a baby? 
                        (She waits.)
                        That’s where you would say “Yes!”  
                        in an excited voice.

                                 JOAN
                        Sorry.  It’s just been a very busy 
                        time at work, so I’m--

                                 DOCTOR
                        Oh, you work?

                                 JOAN
                        (earnestly)
                        Yeah.  ..Is that okay?

                                 DOCTOR
                        Whaddya mean “is that okay”, whaddya 
                        think this is, Club Med?

                                 JOAN
                        Do you have kids?

                                 DOCTOR
                        I’m the premiere fertility expert in 
                        New York City.  I’ve had a’lotta kids.  
                        You’re.. 35, and just starting now?  

                                 JOAN
                        I uh-- Tim had a problem with alchohol--

                                 DOCTOR
                        And you didn’t have a problem with that?
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  59.

                                 JOAN
                        Well.. he didn’t have a problem with me 
                        working and not having a baby, so...

                                 DOCTOR
                        So it all worked out..  Look up.

                        You don’t feel.. as a woman.. you’re... 

                                 DOCTOR
                        What?  Like I’m not fulfilling my job 
                        requirements as a uterus?  Other women 
                        can’t do this job.. Some can barely push 
                        a stroller and chew gum at the same 
                        time.  I figure I can do a lot more for 
                        the children of the world in this job, 
                        than by pushin’ out one’a my own. 
                        (then)
                        But, I know what’cha mean.  ‘Not exactly 
                        like ya have a lot of women to pattern 
                        after, or even talk to about it.  

                                 JOAN
                        Exactly! I mean do you think--

           Gerry has a board full of possible Titles for the show.

                                 GERRY
                        Alright, this is our last workshop, 
                        we’re supposed to be outta here an hour 
                        ago, but I promised Evelyn a name for 
                        this show by Monday so she can, you 
                        know, tell people what to watch.  

                                 JIM
                        I like “1-2-3 Avenue B”...

                                 MATT
                        What happened to “A Negro’s in Brooklyn”?

                                 JON STONE
                        Yah, like A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, but...

                                 GERRY
                        ...I thought you guys were kidding.

           Jon & Matt shake their heads “no”... then break, laughing.

                                 MATT
                        We were Gerry.  We were.

                                 JON STONE
                        Well, you all have the weekend to come 
                        up with a real title.  And we’re not 
                        calling it “Down to Fun Town”-- Sounds 
                        like a euphemism for cocaine.
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  60.

                                 SOMEONE
                        How ‘bout.. “Sesame Street”?  
                        (then)
                        You know, a city block where anything 
                        is possible, like “open-sesame”. 

           People consider it, say it to themselves.  Then...

                                 JON STONE
                        I think that’s about the worst name 
                        I’ve ever heard.  

                      SOMEONE
           Okay...
                                           JON STONE (CONT'D)
                                      Like a Turkish Grocery Store 
                                      in Queens. 

           Joan enters, haggard, with luggage - takes stock, then...

                                 JOAN
                        Where’s Joe?

                                 JIM
                        He’s on a yacht with Frank Sinatra.

                                 JOAN
                        Seriously?  

                                 JIM
                        He called ...from the yacht.

                                 JOAN
                        (re: the Board of names)
                        Still don’t have a name?
                      SOMEONE
                                               JON STONE
           Sesam--
                                      NO!

           Joan sits.  They get quiet.  She pulls a RED FOLDER.

                                 JOAN
                        I was thinking about what Matt asked, 
                        about how to make sure the people we 
                        were making the show for actually saw 
                        it.  Doc’s Test will show in a lab 
                        setting if the show can actually teach.  
                        But I hired a company, to do a kind of 
                        Census, sending people out on foot into 
                        our most vulnerable areas, knocking on 
                        doors, to see if those kids are 
                        watching, if they’re.. learning.  

           Beat.  Wow.  Okay.

                                 MATT
                        What areas?

                                 JOAN
                        (reading the Red Folder)
                        Harlem, D.C., ...Bed-Stuy.

                                 MATT
                        Really?

                                 JOAN
                        Really.
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  61.

                                 EVELYN
                        Do or die...

                                 JOAN
                        Alright.  Some of you we’ll see Monday 
                        on set.  Most of you.. thank you so much 
                        for your time in this workshop, and 
                        everything you did to help us make.. 
                        Sesame Str-- 

                                 JON
                        NO!

           They all laugh, applaud, get up, shake hands, hug.             
           Matt packs up, checks his TRAIN Ticket to PHILLY.  Then sees a 
           note for “Matt”.  He looks around, then curious... opens it.

          INT. A BAR - FEW MINUTES LATER

           Matt walks in.  Sees Joan, Gerry, Jim, Jon.

                                 MATT
                        Heeey.. guys.
                       JON
           Ah, Matthew my boy!  
                                                 JIM
                                      Hey, there he is!

                                 MATT
                        Oh, you’re the people who left me this 
                        serial killer note to meet you at an 
                        undisclosed location, late at night?

           They laugh.. When Evelyn ruuuns in, throws her arms around Matt:

                                 EVELYN
                        Sorry I’m late!  Next round on me!   
                        Congratulations, Mister Producer!!!  

           Evelyn sits.  Sighs.  Then sees their faces.

                                 EVELYN (CONT’D)
                        ...You didn’t tell him yet?

           Beat.  Matt looks to them super-confused.  To Joan.

                                 JOAN
                        So the workshop was a great success, in 
                        large part to you.  It set forth an 
                        ambitious, never-attempted, potentially 
                        impossible mix of curriculum and values 
                        that we now have to try to whip up into a 
                        wildly entertaining show.  And from day 
                        one it’s been clear that this is just as 
                        much your show as anyone here.  And I 
                        speak for everyone when I say it would be 
                        our great honor if you’d join us as a 
                        Writer/Producer in this.. ambitious, 
                        never-attempted, potentially impossible 
                        mission we are embarking upon.

           Matt hears this... Overwhelmed.

                                 MATT
                        Yah.  Yah, I can do it!  WE can do it.

           Everyone celebrates.
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  62.

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        (to Joan)
                        And I know we can get forty.. fifty 
                        percent of those Bed Stuy kids. 

                                 JOAN
                        In Bed Stuy, I’d be happy with 20. 

                                 MATT
                        I’m gonna go call my wife.

           Matt runs to the phone. Something clicks for Joan “oh shit.”  And 
           she grabs her purse, ruuuns out, past:

                                 MATT (ON THE PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Hi baby, it’s Daddy.

          INT. A RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Tim looks at his watch, 8:45, smiles to the other two Working Man/ 
           Doris Day Wife COUPLES at the table.  Joan runs in late.

                        I am so sorry, it was a late night 
                        at work and we-- Hi, sweetie.

           He smiles, but Ooooo he is not happy.  He sips his seltzer.

                                 WIFE
                        Do you also work in social--?

                       JOAN
                                                 TIM
           Yes, in a--
                                      No.  

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        Joan is in show business.

           Everyone’s thrilled to hear, except Joan.

          EXT./EST. THE SUN RISING OVER THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE - MORNING

          INT. STUDIO - MORNING

           The whole gang is crowded around the stagedoor, ready to go in.

                                 JON STONE
                        Before we go in and see the set... 
                        I asked you all to take the weekend 
                        to think up a name for our show...

           He looks around... Nobody speaks up.

                                 EVELYN
                        I have to go to press this week, Jon. 

                                 JIM
                        I guess “Sesame Street” it is.

                                 JON STONE
                        Are you kidding me?  Come on, 
                        someone must have something!?

                                 JIM
                        ...Alright!  Welcome to Sesame Street!
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  63.

                                 JON STONE
                        Oh, Jesus Christ...

                                 SOMEONE (O.S.)
                        BLUE SKIES!

                                 GERRY (TO JOAN)
                        That’s what they say when there are 
                        kids on set, so Jon doesn’t curse.

           Then they turn the corner... There’s the SET!

                                 MATT
                        Wow... it looks just like...  Look--
                        Exactly like in the tenements.

                                 LLOYD
                        (not as pleased)
                        Yes...

           Joan shakes her head at Lloyd, who’s dusting the set.

                                 LLOYD (CONT’D)
                        Mississippi called.  They would 
                        like to see any film or images we 
                        have as soon as possible.

           Joan nods to Lloyd, trying to stay calm., then turns to Jon:

                                 JOAN
                        It’s a... fine name.

                                 JON STONE
                        For a god damn Lebanese Bakery... 

                                 SOMEONE (O.S.)
                        BLUE SKIES!

           Then Jim takes note of the trash can he’s leaning on.  Peeks in...

                                 JIM
                        Hmmm.

                                 JON STONE
                        Or maybe the kids should learn it’s 
                        okay not to be happy all the time.  

           Jim hears that.  Writes it down...  Sketches the can...

                                 CREW
                        Okay... First up is “Bob sings”.  

           BOB MCGRATH - in a turtleneck, joins them on the stoop.

                                 BOB MCGRATH
                        Hi everyone.  Hi kids.

           He starts doing a litany of VOCAL WARM-UPS, STRETCHING as everyone 
           is trying to do get ready...  The kids hate him.  So does Jon.

                                 BOB MCGRATH (CONT’D)
                        Red leather, yellow leather... 
                        Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat...
                        KNAPsack straps, KNAPsack straps...
                        Bumble bee baby boy, Bumble bee baby boy... 

                                 JON STONE
                        BOB!
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  64.

                                 JOAN

                                 GIRL CHORUS (SINGING)
                        1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12!

          JOAN: Joan Meeting remote affiliates, shaking hands, showing clips. 

          EVELYN: Looking at Posters with different Sesame Street logos.

          JON: Animators Animating the Pinball animation:

                                 JON STONE
                        What is this shit?

                                 SOMEONE (O.C.)
                        BLUE SKIES!

           Jon turns to see: A Black Kid & White Kid doing Voice Over.

          JOAN: RECORDING THE AFFILIATE PITCH FILM (TO CAMERA)

                                 JOAN
                        We want to emphasise that the 
                        Children’s Television Workshop is 
                        an experiment.  Research is woven 
                        into the total fabric of the show.
                        Every segment is being tested and 
                        evaluated by the toughest critics 
                        of all - the children themselves.  

           This Pitch on a Monitor Lloyd watches: Cuts from Joan to an 
           ANIMATED SHORT - A Black Kid & White kid staring at a Letter J.

                                 LLOYD
                        Have you sent this to Mississippi?

                                 JOAN
                        No. ...Not yet.

          LLOYD: Touring Texan Affiliates through the SET, it’s weird to them.  
          They see costume sketches of a Mixed Race Cast.  They even look 
          askance at Ernie & Bert.  When they turn away, Frank & Jim pull their 
          puppets off to reveal holding up their middle fingers.

          MATT: At a typewriter, late, more coffee... more scripts...         

          STUDIO: A BAKER (actor) atop a flight of stairs with PIES in hand. 

                                 BAKER
                        10!  10 Banana Cream Pies!

           And he falls down the steps.  Jim and Jon think it’s hilarious.
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  65.

          JOAN’S MAP: More Green Pins... New York, Boston, Philadelphia, DC.

          JON & JIM: At a favorite Pub after work.  Jon’s reading a script, Jim 
          sketches that Trash Can, when a cantankerous WAITER approaches.

                                 WAITER
                        Say, you fellas gonna order or what?!

           Jim and Jon are thrilled with how comically rude he is.         
           Jim has sketched a Mean Monster sticking out of the Trash Can.

                                 WAITER (CONT’D)
                        You gonna draw all night, Picasso, 
                        or ya gonna eat?  Sheesh! 

           Later: Jim and Jon laugh their way out of “OSCAR’S TAVERN”.

          GERRY & MATT: At a DAYCARE: Testing the “J” animated clip with kids.                    
          They show the kids 5 letters on a table, the kids pick the “J”.   

           ON TV: Ernie in the bathtub with his toy.

                                 ERNIE
                        RUBBER DUCKY I’M AWFULLY FOOOOOND OF YOU!

           There’s one little boy JOHN JOHN (4), the most adorable little 
           kid, who is standing, gesticulating, singing along!

                                 JOHN JOHN
                        FOOOOOND OF YOUUUUUU!!!

           Matt watches John John.  He impishly waves back.  Matt laughs.

          JIM & FRANK: Performing Ernie & LEFTY the salesman.  

                                 LEFTY
                        Hey, PSST!  How’d ya like’ta buy an 8!

           And Lefty opens a trenchcoat, where he has a Number 8.

                                 ERNIE
                        An 8?

                                 LEFTY
                        Riiiiiiiight.

           Lloyd is watching, taps Matt on the shoulder, next to Jon.

                                 LLOYD
                        Excuse me, is he selling the number 
                        8 as if it were drugs?

                                 JON STONE
                        Shhh...

                                 LLOYD
                        You think that’s appropriate?

                                 JON STONE
                        Wouldja get the hell outta here?!

                                 SOMEONE (O.S.)
                        BLUE SKIES!

                                 BOB MCGRATH
                        BLUEEE SKIIIES, SMILIN’ AT MEEE!

                                 JON STONE

                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  66.

          JOAN’S MAP: Green Pin on Texas, Louisiana... Florida, Alabama...

          JOE: AT STUDIO 54, Joe knows everyone.  Sees his friend SYLVESTER 
          singing and his BACKUP Girls.  Joe gives the Backup Girls his card.

          EVELYN’S NEIGHBORHOOD KIOSK: Kids watching a clip on a TV.

           A CHINESE WOMAN (70s), translates for a 90-year-old - to Joan.

                                 CHINESE WOMAN
                        There Chinese people on this show?

           Joan nods.  She’s surprised, translates.  Both taken aback.

                                 JOAN
                        (looking at the neighborhood)
                        Actually, it looks a lot like this.

           Evelyn holds out candy to KIDS, but before she hands it over:

                                 EVELYN
                        Now, what’s it called?..

                                 KIDS
                        Sesame Street?

                                 EVELYN
                        When’s it on?..

                       KIDS
                                               ONE KID
           8 o’clock!
                                      And again after school!

                                 EVELYN
                        And why should you watch it?..

                                 KIDS
                        Cause it’s gonna help me make my 
                        dreams come true!

                                 EVELYN
                        Good job!

           Evelyn hands out candy... Then sees a pair of PUERTO RICAN BOYS (5 
           & 7) tearing off sheets of ALUMNIUM FOIL, selling it to Kids for a 
           nickel. They see Evelyn watching them, and give her a Bronx Cheer.

          INT. STUDIO - DAY

           Grover is talking with precocious JOHN JOHN - from the Day Care.

                                 GROVER
                        John John?  Can you count to ten?

                                 JOHN JOHN
                        I want to count backwards!
                        TEN!!!  NIIIIIINE!!! EIGHT! SEVEN!

           Joan is watching, amazed.

          RECORDING STUDIO - We see who’s singing: Sylvester’s Backup Girls!

                                 GIRL CHORUS (SINGING)
                        (big finish!)
                        ELEVEN, TWE-E-E-E-E-E-ELVE!

           Joe looks to Jon in the booth.  Thumbs up!
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  67.

           AN ASSISTANT runs in the booth with Flowers.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Flowers for The Pointer Sisters!

           RUTH POINTER takes them, then looks to camera...

                                 RUTH POINTER (TO CAMERA)
                        That’s right.

           JUNE & ANITA POINTER poke their heads into frame as well. 

                                 JUNE POINTER (TO CAMERA)
                        Everybody’s gotta start somewhere.

                                 ANITA POINTER (TO CAMERA) 
                        Tell it!

           Then Joe’s head pops into frame from the booth - on that mic:

                                 JOE RAPOSO
                        Sorry girls.  Something unspecific 
                        about the tape malfunctioning.  Can 
                        we get that ending one more time?

                                 RUTH POINTER
                        (winking at the camera)
                        ‘Course ya can.  Girls?

           And they each SHOW OFF in a COMPLETELY Unnecessary Encore PLAYOFF!

                        ELEVEN, TWE-E-E-E.. E-E-E-E.. E-E-E-E.. E-E-ELVE!!!

                                 GERRY (PRELAP)
                        We have a problem.

          INT. DAY CARE - DAY

                                 COOKIE MONSTER (ON TV) 
                        C IS FOR COOKIE, THAT’S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME! 

           Joan, Gerry, Jon, Jim & Matt watch all the DAY CARE KIDS. 

                                 GERRY
                        They love Cookie, and Ernie & Bert and 
                        Grover and the songs and animations 
                        and sketches... and then...

           ON TV: They cut back to the Street... where BOB comes out.

                                 BOB MCGRATH
                        Hey Kids, ready to hear a story?

           Then they see The Day Care KIDS TUNE OUT COMPLETELY:

                                 THE KIDS IN THE DAY CARE
                        Ugh... 
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  68.

                                 BOB MCGRATH
                        Once upon a time...

           The kids in the Day Care stand up... talk... fight.

                                 GERRY
                        The kids are ZOMBIES for the Muppets, but 
                        when we get to the Street itself, with 
                        just humans, and no muppets, they 
                        completely tune out.  If we don’t fix 
                        this, when Doc does his tests, I don’t 
                        think the kids will be able to remember 
                        anything from the street segments. 

                                 JIM
                        And if they don’t pass Doc’s Test...

                                 JOAN
                        No more Sesame Street.

                                 JON STONE
                        You’re telling me we built the street 
                        set, and shot all these scenes for 
                        nothing? It’s half the god damned show!

                                 ONE DAY CARE KID
                        (at the screen)
                        SHUT UP, BOB!

                                 JON STONE
                        Well, can’t argue that.

                                 MATT
                        There must be a solution...

           Jim thinks... walks over to a YELLOW BIRD in a Birdcage.

           Lloyd charges in.  Jon sees he’s in a tuxedo.

                                 JON STONE
                        I’ll have the salmon.

                                 LLOYD
                        I was at a-- Joan, can I speak to you?

          EXT. DAY CARE IN HARLEM - CONTINUOUS

                                 JOAN
                        What’s so important you came to Harlem?

                                 LLOYD
                        Mississippi, Joan.  They saw the film 
                        strip pitch where negro kids and 
                        chinese kids and white kids are all 
                        playing together on one block--

                                 JOAN
                        You mean our show?

                                 LLOYD
                        They refuse to air a show that is 
                        set on an integrated street.  

           Joan takes a beat.  Wind knocked out of her.  He hails a cab.
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  69.

                                 LLOYD (CONT’D)
                        We booked you on a 4:15 flight.  
                        You have to FIX this, Joan.  Before 
                        anyone else finds out about it and 
                        all the affiliates pull out.

                                 JOAN
                        That integrated street-- that’s just as 
                        important as the curriculum. ..Isn’t it?
                        I mean, I know we can’t compare--

                                 LLOYD
                        Yes, you can compare, Joan.  You must 
                        compare.  Would it be better if we didn’t 
                        have the oppressive history of insane 
                        bigotry, holding this country back, and 
                        could make this show whatever we want?   
                        OF COURSE.  But we live in America.
                        And if I had to pick between a socially 
                        progressive show that exposes kids to 
                        equality & pluralism, but only airs in three 
                        cities and gets cancelled within a year.
                        ...OR one that sticks to curriculum, 
                        doesn’t ruffle feathers, and creates a 
                        new generation who can ALL READ - a book, 
                        a street sign, fill out a job 
                        application, vote, breaking that cycle of 
                        illiterate poverty, giving them the tools 
                        to fight for themselves for years to--

                                 JOAN
                        So we just cater to the lowest common 
                        denominator in Mississi--?

                                 LLOYD
                        The lowest common denominator have kids!  
                        Who advocates for them?  The millions of 
                        kids who were born in the wrong place at 
                        the wrong time if they wanted an education.  
                        (angry now)
                        Whose parents don’t say, “I want a better 
                        life for my child,” like you’d assume any 
                        human being would, but instead say “I never 
                        learned to read and I turned out fine!”  
                        (then, calming)
                        If we miss the opportunity to teach 
                        millions of children to-- to give them 
                        some tools to pull themselves out of 
                        that.. because we said it was more 
                        important to stand our ground on..  

                                 JOAN
                        ..on social progress?  

                                 LLOYD
                        Learning to read IS social progress.  

          INT. JOAN & TIM’S APARTMENT - MID DAY

           Joan throws a suitcase on the bed, clothes in.  Hears a smash.  
           Peeks around the corner... where Tim is on the bathroom floor.

                                 JOAN
                        Tim?  What are you doing home?

           He vomits.
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  70.

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        Oh, honey.  Are you sick? 

                                 TIM
                        No...

           She sees the Alchie pills... A flask in the trash.  Ah.

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        See... You’re not-- not even upset.

           She looks in the mirror... she’s not, at all.

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        That’s what I wanted to see, I think.

                                 JOAN
                        Tim.  I want you to be okay.

                                 TIM
                        No... you--  You’re relieved. 

                                 JOAN
                        I am not--

                                 TIM
                        Yes!  You’re happy ...to have an excuse.

           Joan is upset, in that way when someone is right.  She storms 
           out with her suitcase.  Slams the door.

          INT. AIRPLANE TAKING OFF IN NEW YORK - DAY

           Joan looking at the clouds, thinking...

                                 HIPPIE GIRL (PRELAP SINGING)
                        ROWS AND FLOWS OF ANGEL HAIR
                        AND ICE CREAM CASTLES IN THE AIR
                        AND FEATHER CANYONS EVERYWHERE...

          INT. CASTING - AUDITION ROOM - DAY

                                 HIPPIE GIRL
                        I'VE LOOKED AT CLOUDS THAT WAY...

           Long-flowing hair, floral blouse, accompanying herself on guitar. 
           It’s ...fine.  Sign: “AUDITIONS: SUSAN” Jon & Matt politely smile.

           Meanwhile in The WAITING ROOM:  Folding chairs with ten more of 
           the same thin, young, hippie white woman with long hair, and 
           guitars. When in walks LORETTA (32, Black) big afro, short skirt, 
           long red nails, sheet music - walks up to the CASTING ASSOCIATE.

                                 LORETTA
                        Sorry, I teach up in the Bronx and 
                        only could get someone to cover for 
                        me for half the day and I--

                                 CASTING ASSOCIATE
                        And where is your guitar?

           Then she looks.  They all have guitars.
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  71.

                                 LORETTA
                        They always have a piano player.  I’m 
                        a Broadway girl.  Did you see Pippin?

                                 CASTING ASSOCIATE
                        Mhm.

                                 LORETTA
                        Ah... Well, I was almost in that.  

           TIME CUT TO LORETTA IN THE AUDITION ROOM:

                                 LORETTA (CONT’D)
                        HERE IS MY HANDLE, HERE IS MY SPOUT!

           She plays to the camera, full panto. Matt and Jon are charmed.

                                 LORETTA (CONT’D)
                        WHEN I GET ALL STEAMED UP, HEAR ME SHOUT!  
                        Everyone!

                                 LORETTA & JON & MATT
                        “TIP ME OVER AND POUR ME OUT!”

           Jon and Matt giggle to have joined in so willingly.

                                 MATT
                        You said you teach in the Bronx?

                                 LORETTA
                        Substitute.  AND I got great notices 
                        in a play at the Roundabout.

                                 JON STONE
                        The one under the Gristedes?

           She nods.  Matt sits next to her, hands her pages.

                                 MATT
                        You would be one of four adults, 
                        kind of educational guides... 
                        Should we have her do the scene?

                                 LORETTA
                        Can I ask, what Susan does for work?

                                 MATT
                        Well, I thought one of the things 
                        missing from the black home was a 
                        reliable homemaker figure, help the kids 
                        with homework, reading, loving...

                                 LORETTA
                        Didja... Huh.  Okay...  

                                 MATT
                        What?

                                 LORETTA
                        No... Nothing.  I gotta give you 
                        white suburban housewife better than 
                        those Joan-Baez-lookin’ girls. So 
                        that’s what I’m gonna do!

           Jon GUFFAWS!  Matt blushes.  Jon presses record on the camera.

                                 JON STONE
                        Roliolioio!
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  72.

                                 MATT (AS GORDON)
                        Hi, Susan.  I was just telling Enzo 
                        and Barney all the places they could 
                        find circles in their home.

                                 LORETTA (AS SUSAN)
                        Well this pan is a circle.  And these 
                        cookies!  Would you boys like one?

           TIME CUT TO: Loretta is leaving.

                                 LORETTA (CONT’D)
                        Come by to see the play, or... just 
                        to grab some groceries.

           Jon and Matt laugh as Loretta waves and leaves, as the 
           Casting Associate brings a rotary phone in.

                                 CASTING ASSOCIATE
                        It’s for you, Matt. 

                                 MATT (ON PHONE)
                        Hi, Hon.  Yeah, it’s almost wrapped, 
                        should be on the 7 o’clock train-- 
                        Yes, I understand, but...  Alright, 
                        you’re right, would you put her on?
                        (then)
                        Hi, Holly.  How was your day?  The zoo?

           Jon watches, then focuses on Matt with the camera. Presses Record.

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        What color was the zebra?  You have a 
                        great memory, I can’t remember what I 
                        had for lunch.  Maybe you could be a 
                        lion tamer one day... Ooooo!  Listen 
                        sweetie, you have to go to bed before I 
                        get home so I wanted to-- Excuse me?  
                        Oh, I’m sorry, I thought I was speaking 
                        to a young lady. Perhaps the calls got 
                        crossed with a nursery school. OPERATOR!

           Jon laughs quietly to himself.

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        Operator, would you please put 
                        Holly on?  Oh, there you are.  
                        Okay.  Well, I love you too.  

           Matt hangs up.  Sees the red camera light is on.

                                 JON STONE
                        I think we know who our Gordon is.

                                 MATT
                        No.

                                 JON STONE
                        You wrote the character you wanted to 
                        see.  Nobody we auditioned gets the 
                        essence of it like you.

                                 MATT
                        Two black leads?  There hasn’t ever been 
                        on a show on TV with two black leads...
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  73.

                                 JON STONE
                        Exactly.

                                 MATT
                        Oh, no... I think one Loretta, one 
                        Bob, one old man... 

                                 JON STONE
                        Wouldn’t it be nice to see a strong, 
                        warm, smart, father figure.  When all 
                        they see is maids and drivers...

                                 MATT
                        Don’t give ME the Maids & Drivers speech!  
                        Besides, now we have Uhura.

                                 JON STONE
                        “We call it patterning!”

                                 MATT
                        You met John John, we have plenty of 
                        smart black kids for-- 

           Jon dials the phone.

                                 JON STONE
                        Not the kids...  Parents need a 
                        good role-model too sometimes.
                        (then, on the phone:)
                        Hi Sweetie, it’s Daddy.

          EXT. MISSISSIPPI / PLANE LANDING - TWILIGHT

                                 NINA SIMONE (V.O.)
                        The name of this tune is “Mississippi Goddam” 
                        ...And I mean every word of it.
                        ALABAMA’S GOT ME SO UPSET,
                        AND MEMPHIS HAS MADE ME LOSE MY REST.
                        BUT EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT MISSISSIPPI GODDAM!

           Joan exits the plane, onto the ladder cart, looks out, feeling she 
           can definitely do this-- oh, a confederate flag...  Wow. Okay...

                                 NINA SIMONE (V.O.)
                        I DON'T BELONG HERE.

           Joan’s Taxi stops at a Red Light. She sees a Public Washroom.  
           “WHITES” & “COLOREDS” is visible under a translucent whitewash. 

                                 NINA SIMONE (V.O.)
                        YOU KEEP ON SAYING 'GO SLOW!'...

          INT. MISSISSIPPI STATE COMMISSION ON EDUCATION - NIGHT

           A SECRETARY from the 1800’s, sits behind the Reception Desk.  
           Joan is sweating.  There’s tissues on the desk.  Secretary eyes 
           them, and Joan, and Joan eyeing them... then returns to typing.

                                 JOAN
                        Joan Ganz Cooney, from the--

                                 MISSISSIPPI SECRETARY (INTO INTERCOM)
                        She’s here.

                                 NINA SIMONE (V.O.)
                        MISSISSIPPI, GODDAM!
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  74.

           The Wooden DOUBLE DOORS warmly open to SALLY (SALLY FIELD, 60s) 
           Just the warmest, most hospitable, cutest, kindest, earnest woman. 

                                 SALLY
                        Oh my god.  Wow.  Mrs. Cooney.  May I 
                        call you Joan?  Would you please come 
                        in?  I really am so tickled that 
                        you’re here, I’m such a fan of your 
                        documentaries. So when I heard about 
                        Sesame Street, well... I don’t think 
                        it can be overstated how terrific it 
                        is going to be for children.  I think 
                        you’re just about the most.. brilliant 
                        person I’ve ever met.  And you know 
                        Jim Henson, is from Mississippi.  Yes.   
                        We’re very very proud. 

           Joan looks around to check she’s in the right room.  Door closes.

           Sally is on the other side of the room, slicing a piece of...

                                 SALLY (CONT’D)
                        Do you like cake?  Tess out there made 
                        this. I’m sure you’ve got much fancier 
                        things in New York City, but growing up 
                        I thought Mud Cake was just about the 
                        greatest thing since.. Well much better 
                        than sliced bread frankly.  I mean I 
                        remember when we had to slice it 
                        ourselves - it wasn’t that big a deal.

           Joan genuinely laughs, charmed.

                                 SALLY (CONT’D)
                        She’s actually an amazing baker, 
                        ..a terrible secretary, but an 
                        amazing-- well, try it.

                                 JOAN
                        Oh, it’s terrific.  WOW, what is that--

                                 SALLY
                        Butter.  That’s how you can tell a 
                        southern recipe, it’s not measured in 
                        tablespoons, but in sticks.  Ugh, you 
                        know who loves her butter - same 
                        station as y’all - Miss Julia Child.  
                        You ever cook any of her, uh--

                                 JOAN
                        Yes, actually I have.

                                 SALLY
                        I knew it... Such a different world.    
                        A couple girlfriends and I drove up to 
                        New York once, cause I don’t like 
                        planes, but I remember thinking “MY 
                        GOD!” All those people!  Like the whole 
                        town was a stadium on game day.  Anyway, 
                        I am just so honored to have you here.  
                        Now! How do we two gals get this show of 
                        yours on the air here?
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  75.

                                 JOAN
                        ...I’m sorry... I thought-- I was told 
                        that you and your colleagues at the--

                                 SALLY
                        ..State Commission on Education.

                                 JOAN
                        Yes, that you decided not to show it.

           Sally leans forward, bit of mischief. 

                                 SALLY
                        I had an idea.  A bit.. rebellious.  
                        Get around these people who think 
                        everything has to be one way or the 
                        highway.  All or nuthin’.

                                 JOAN
                        I agree.

                                 SALLY
                        I knew you would, oh I knew you would.  
                        So you’re running a kind of variety 
                        format, with about 100 hours of 
                        programming.  Animated bits, the muppet 
                        skits, then the street segments.     
                        All interchangeable, repeatable?

                                 JOAN
                        Yes, exactly.

                                 SALLY
                        So... when I went off to college, 
                        Mississippi State College for Women - 
                        the first public women’s college in 
                        the country - up in Columbus. Ugh, I 
                        remember my mother thinking it was so 
                        far away.  Well, one of the things 
                        that had just the biggest effect on 
                        me was the mess hall. The uh- 
                        cafeteria.  Oh my god!  To be able to 
                        take a roll, green salad, piece’a 
                        chicken, little bowl’a lime Jello.. 
                        Ugh, I felt to the manor born!

           Joan smiles but wonders where this is going...

                                 SALLY (CONT’D)
                        So I realized... We could take all 
                        those pieces of yours, and make a 
                        different local version that reflected 
                        our own community here.  A’la carte!

                                 JOAN
                        (walking softly)
                        You want to take the.. black people 
                        out of the show?

                                 SALLY
                        Oh, no!  Not at all.  I think it’s 
                        very important for people to be 
                        exposed to all different cultures.  
                        I just know there are some segments 
                        where you have a little colored boy 
                        and a white boy sitting together.  
                                 (MORE)
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  76.
                                 SALLY (CONT'D)
                        Or on the street, you see an oriental 
                        girl playing with a regular girl 
                        and... Mississippi... well, they’re 
                        not ready for a show like that.

           Joan takes a beat, plans her move.

                                 JOAN
                        I’m sure.. you know your people better 
                        than I do.  But it reminds me of the 
                        Henry Ford quote when he was building 
                        the first automobile, he said--

                                 SALLY
                        “If I asked people what they wanted, 
                        they would’a said a faster horse.”

           Joan nods.  Sally smiles, kind-hearted... equally matched.

                                 SALLY (CONT’D)
                        You know who I found was one of the 
                        biggest proponents of keeping things 
                        organized, culturally? Mister Malcolm X.  
                        When I heard his speech to his own 
                        people I thought, alright, I guess 
                        everyone wants the right to celebrate 
                        their own distinct culture.  

                                 JOAN
                        I had Malcolm on my TV program.  He 
                        changed his mind on that before he--

                                 SALLY
                        Well what does Julia Child call it?  Mise 
                        en place? Right?  Everything in its place.

                                 JOAN
                        We have a choice when we were creating 
                        this program.  Between showing the world 
                        as it is, or.. well, as it should be.  
                        As it will be, one day.  And--

                                 SALLY
                        I know you mean well.  But that’s not 
                        the world as it is here.  And I have to 
                        say, it doesn’t look like that’s how 
                        it’s going to be any day soon.  So for a 
                        little colored kid to see that, and 
                        think that’s how life is going to be-- 
                        how he or she is going to be.. received 
                        by the world.  Well, I think that could 
                        be potentially far more dangerous.  

           Off Joan’s face.

                        I’VE LOOKED AT CLOUDS FROM BOTH SIDES NOW...

           Jon, Jim, Gerry, Joan, Matt all sit in tiny plastic kids’ chairs. 
           They watch the kids, who aren’t even watching this Woman on TV.  
           Another failure... Joan is a million miles away.  Matt sees.
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  77.

                                 MATT
                        You okay?

                                 JOAN
                        I um... Mississippi said they would not 
                        air an integrated version of our show.

                                 MATT
                        What does that mean? Our show is--

                                 JOAN
                        It means that hundreds of thousands 
                        of kids in Mississippi, who could 
                        really use the show aren’t gonna 
                        see it.  And if this gets out, and 
                        it will, other stations may pull it 
                        too.  Possibly the whole country.

                                 MATT
                        What’s the other version of our show?

                                 JON
                        What do you mean?

                                 MATT
                        You said they wont air the 
                        integrated version.

                                 JOAN
                        Well, they suggested we could.. keep the 
                        segments with black kids.. separate.

                                 MATT
                        And you said..?

                                 JOAN
                        Carnegie, the Ford Foundation, The 
                        Corporation for Public Broadcasting, 
                        the U.S. government, have given us 
                        millions of dollars, assuming our 
                        program was for the whole country.  
                        If we can’t show the country watched, 
                        they will not fund a second season.

           A beat... A LITTLE GIRL (Black, 5) tugs at Joan:

                                 A LITTLE GIRL
                        (re: the woman singing on TV)
                        This woman is boring me.

                                 JOAN
                        I know, sweetie...

           Matt picks her up.  Rocks her a bit.

                                 MATT
                        Do you want me to.. give you permission 
                        to do that?  To segregate Sesame Street?  
                        Is that what you’re asking?  You want 
                        like a black sign-off for a-- 
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  78.

                       JOAN
                                             MATT (CONT'D)
           No.
                                      ..Under some busted notion 
                                      that it’ll reach more kids?

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        White people think everything is 
                        just for them.  This was one thing 
                        we had that... Ugh.

           Matt’s eyes start watering, he puts the girl down, she walks back. 

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        When my sister was about that big,
                        she had scarlet fever.  But there was a 
                        cure, so we all got in the car and drove 
                        her over to the hospital.  Me holding my 
                        sister, screaming, in the back seat.  We 
                        pull up to the nearest place, my dad gets 
                        out, picks his daughter up in his arms, 
                        runs into this hospital with his little 
                        girl.  And then two minutes later comes 
                        running back.  Throws her in the back 
                        seat, and starts driving again.

           Joan’s confused.

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        The next hospital, same thing.  Dad runs 
                        in.. then a few minutes later, runs back 
                        out.  My mother looking at a map, trying 
                        to find the next one.  We went to eight 
                        hospitals that night, my sister writhing 
                        around in my arms, in the back of that 
                        car.  None of them would treat her... 
                        (sniffs a tear in)
                        A little girl.  Doctors!  Our most 
                        educated-- people who took an oath, and... 

                                 JOAN
                        What happened?

                                 MATT
                        She died in the car.

                                 JOAN
                        (gut punched)
                        I’m so sorry, Matt, I-- Jesus.

                                 MATT
                        And I don’t know if there is a cure for 
                        what those doctors had.  But I do know 
                        you have to teach that kind of hate to 
                        a person.  To a kid.  So I thought, I 
                        dreamed, that mixed in with the A-B-C’s 
                        and 1-2-3’s, it was possible... for our 
                        show to teach the opposite. 

           Then as this sinks in... they see the kids watching the TV are on 
           their feet.  They look to the TV: and see it’s LORETTA.

                                 LORETTA (ON TV) 
                        HERE IS MY HANDLE, HERE IS MY SPOUT.
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  79.

           The kids LOVE Loretta.  Clapping along.  Copying her panto.

                                 LORETTA (ON TV) (CONT’D)
                        Everyone!

                                 THE KIDS
                        TIP ME OVER AND POUR ME OUT!

           Joan and Matt were mouthing along too.  A miracle.

          INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

           Joan waits.. Sees PARENTS magazine. OY. She picks it up, flips... 
           An AD FOR “SESAME STREET”.  When DOCTOR (MUPPET) enters.

                                 DOCTOR (MUPPET)
                        There she is.

                                 JOAN
                        Hi.  I um... Well--

           Joan smiles, Doctor looks to her, understands... Joan just cries. 
           Doctor puts Joan’s head on her shoulder. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        So, things are good?

           Joan laughs through tears.  Doctor pats Joan’s back.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Ya know, the thing they never tell ya 
                        about getting to tha top.. maybe they 
                        just don’t tell the girls.  When you make 
                        it.. it feels good for about ten seconds.  
                        Then you realize there’s nobody to go to 
                        for advice, and you just gotta make these 
                        huge nauseating decisions yerself, and 
                        just hope to god you’re right.   

           Joan nods.  Doctor feels Joan’s lymph nodes.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Especially when there’s no one around 
                        who looks like you.. and ya wanna make 
                        it seem like you belong, so you pretend 
                        like yer absolutely fine.  But inside...

                                 JOAN
                        Yah.  Well... 

                                 DOCTOR
                        Frankly, I didn’t expect ya back here.  

                                 JOAN
                        Neither did I... but it seems more and 
                        more possible that my job might be 
                        coming to an end soon.  And this might 
                        be my next, um--  Is alcoholism genetic?

                                 DOCTOR
                        We don’t know yet, they’re doing 
                        studies.  What I do often see is people 
                        who grew up with it are more likely to 
                        put up with it.  We’re not always 
                        attracted to what’s good for us.   
                        We’re attracted to what’s familiar.
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  80.

                                 JOAN
                        What the hell does that mean?

                                 DOCTOR
                        Well... If it bothers you so much, 
                        some part of you must already know.  
                        Of course then it just makes it 
                        harder to leave’em, because it 
                        feels like you’re losing your 
                        father all over again. 

           Doctor looks to Joan who’s miles away... processing deeply.  
           She moves a lock of hair out of her face, lovingly.

                                 JOAN
                        If I had been home, doing what he-- 
                        keeping up my end of the bargain--

                                 DOCTOR
                        Oh my god, do you hear yourself?  

           She grabs Joan’s face with her green felt hand.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Ya can’t run around all yer life, 
                        trying to be a version of yourself you 
                        think makes other people more 
                        comfortable!  You have to just figure 
                        out who you are, what you do, and do 
                        it! ..Ya can’t be everything to 
                        everyone.  You are not an Entenmann’s.  

                                 JOAN
                        ..How did you figure it out?  

                                 DOCTOR
                        I’ll tell you... but after that you 
                        gotta promise to either open your mind.. 
                        or your legs - cause I got a lotta 
                        appointments today.

           Joan nods.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        This girl I delivered when I was in 
                        medical school, back when Ullyses S. 
                        Grant was President - she came in 
                        pregnant herself a few years ago, and I 
                        pulled a baby out of HER.  They say, 
                        for a mother, that’s when you feel the 
                        cycle is complete - not when you have 
                        the baby, but when your baby has a 
                        baby.  And I realized then and there, 
                        that I am capable of extraordinary 
                        things.  And if I wanted a baby of my 
                        own that badly... I would know. I would 
                        know because I would HAVE one.

           A beat.  This sits with Joan.

           GO WIDE to Reveal: The DOCTOR MUPPET is being PUPPETEERED BY JOAN.     
           Talking to HERSELF, through this Muppet, on her own hand. 

           She’s actually sitting in...
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  81.

          INT. MUPPET WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

           Jim’s Operating Table of Scissors, Needles, etc. 

           KNOCK-KNOCK.  Joan quickly takes the Doctor Muppet off her hand.  
           A worried MOTHER (Black, 28), runs by, lost, looking for help. 

                                 JOAN
                        Can I help you, ma’am?

                                 MOTHER
                        My son?  I went to pick him up from the 
                        Day Care and they said he was here.

                                 JOAN
                        John-John?

                                 MOTHER
                        Yes!  

                                 JOAN
                        He’s doing his ABC’s with Grover.

                                 MOTHER
                        No.  That’s impossible. 

          INT. STUDIO - MOMENTS LATER

           Joan walks the Mother in quietly up to the Monitor/Camera.   

           John John is sitting on a box, talking to Grover.  

                                 GROVER
                        Uh-huh...

                                 JOHN JOHN
                        F... G... H.... I... J... K!!!

                                 GROVER
                        Very good, and then--

                                 JOHN JOHN
                        L-M-N-O-P! Q!!!  

           John John’s Mother is weeping, she sits...

                                 MOTHER
                        How did you do this?  I-- I 
                        couldn’t help him... 

                                 JOAN
                        Of course, with work, I’m sure it’s--

                                 MOTHER
                        No... I mean I can’t really-- you 
                        know. (read).  I mean I get by, but.. 
                        well, when he’d ask me what things 
                        was, I didn’t know.  ‘Cause my mother 
                        didn’t know.  And I didn’t want that 
                        to, you know hold him back, but..  I 
                        know I probably shoulda-- but ugh, I 
                        was so embarrassed. 

           Matt stops by.  “Everything okay?” eyes to Joan.
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  82.

                                 JOAN
                        This is John John’s mom.  This is 
                        Matt, one of our Writer/Producers.  
                        He saw John John at the Day Care and--

           John John’s Mother hugs Matt.  HARD.  Dries her eyes.

                                 MOTHER
                        (to Matt and Joan)
                        Thank you.

                                 JOHN JOHN
                        W-X-Y...

                                 GROVER
                        And do you remember the last one?

                                 JOHN JOHN
                        Uh-huh.

                                 GROVER
                        What is it?

           John John gestures with his finger for Grover to come closer.  
           He does... John John gives him a kiss.  Grover gasps.

                                 JOHN JOHN
                        Z!

           Reverse Shot: The Entire Crew crying.  

           Then John John sees his Mother, runs to her.

                                 JOHN JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Mamma!

                                 MOTHER
                        I am so proud of you, John John!   
                        I cannot believe you can do all of 
                        that.  You know how hard that is?

                                 JOHN JOHN
                        Awww, it’s eeeasy!

                                 MOTHER
                        No, it’s not.  No it’s not...  You 
                        are sooo smart.  I am so proud to 
                        be your mom.

           She kisses him so hard.

           Joan sees this... it sits with her... She walks back.. 

          INT. JOAN’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           She has been working away... then stops, looks at her watch,  
           grabs her luggage, her plane tickets, shuts the light, leaves... 

          INT. MUPPET WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

           Joan passes by the doorway, and sees Jim here, still working.

                                 JOAN
                        Hey. ...Still here?
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  83.

                                 JIM
                        Yah.  Jane and I had.. well. 
                        Sometimes that ole Henson stitch 
                        comes unraveled.  And I’m pretty 
                        sure she was completely right.
                        (then)
                        And I’m pretty sure I was 
                        completely wrong.. with you.

           Joan looks confused.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        I told you I had it all.  But I, well, 
                        I have a Jane.  She used to be my right 
                        hand... literally.  Then the kids came 
                        and I got to be a dad and do this.  
                        Because I have two right hands.  

           Joan hears this...  Jim sees her LUGGAGE.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry you didn’t have a better time 
                        in Mississippi.  I had a good time 
                        catching frogs in those streams as a 
                        kid, but... You ever catch frogs?

           She gives him a, “Do I look like I ever caught frogs” face.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        You have to stand still.  And well, 
                        Mississippi has a long proud 
                        history of standing still.  And I 
                        was never very good at that. 

           Joan hears this.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        I remember how people used to talk in 
                        town, about other people... who were 
                        different.  And you’re a kid so you do 
                        what the grown-ups do... “Patterning”.  
                        But at some point, someone had to tell 
                        me the difference between right and 
                        wrong.  And for millions of kids... I 
                        think that someone is you, Joan. 

           Joan looks at all the Muppets around them...  The seed of an idea 
           in her brain, but not yet there. She’s frustrated. Matt walks by.

                                 MATT
                        Are Mom and Dad fighting?

           Jim and Joan look to each other.

                                 JIM
                        Ya know, what you and I have is a lot 
                        like a marriage, isn’t it?  Lots of 
                        valuable time together ..and no sex.

                                 JOAN
                        I was thinking of what she said, in 
                        Mississippi, about our show... trying 
                        to understand where they’re coming 
                        from.  
                                 (MORE)
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  84.
                                 JOAN (CONT'D)
                        Seeing new things, different things 
                        as.. scary.  And I thought.. 
                        we have actual MONSTERS on the show.. 

                                 MATT
                        And the colored folks is what scares ‘em.

                                 JOAN
                        EXACTLY.  And you know how when we test 
                        the episodes for the kids at the Day 
                        Care, we lose their interest any time we 
                        cut from the Muppets back to the street?

           They nod... Joan looks at Matt and Jim - framed by all these 
           muppets and monsters and whatevers...  She sees THE DOCTOR 
           MUPPET in the pile...  And something clicks.

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        I have an idea, but I don’t know if 
                        it would make any sense.

                                 JIM
                        Those are the best kind of ideas.

                                 JOAN
                        What if we INTEGRATE EVERYTHING.  
                        Not just the people... What if we mix 
                        the Muppets in with the People, have 
                        them walking up and down the street, 
                        Ernie and Bert can live below Susan. 
                        They work together, live together, eat 
                        together, hang out together.  Say, THIS 
                        IS WHO WE ARE, take it or leave it. 
                        Then maybe those people who see a black 
                        man and a white man hanging out as 
                        absurd, will get a little perspective? 

                                 MATT
                        Didn’t the child psychologists mention 
                        that we need a clear line between real 
                        life and... make believe?

                                 JOAN
                        I think... to get through life... 
                        sometimes the two are not as 
                        distinct as you might think.

                                 JIM
                        I think that’s about the best thing I 
                        ever heard!  And I know just the Muppet.

           Jim is sketching, a tall, yellow bird, with a man inside.

                                                   THIS MATCH CUTS TO:

          INT. STUDIO - BACKSTAGE - MINUTES LATER

           CARROL SPINNEY - a lean hippie-ish puppeteer, wears familiar 
           orange stripey legs and big orange bird feet.  

                                 JIM
                        Carroll, this is Kermit, he designs 
                        all the muppets with me.
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  85.

           KERMIT LOVE, puppet builder (50) hands Carroll a small TV monitor:

                                 CARROLL
                        Your name is Kermit?

                                 KERMIT
                        Your name is Carroll?

                                 JIM
                        You’ll need this to see.

                                 CARROLL
                        What?

           And with that, Kermit and Jim hoist BIG BIRD up and over Carroll, 
           and flip on a camera.

           CARROLL’s POV: Inside a warm yellow glow, as Carroll sees 
           himself in the bird costume on the monitor in his hand.

                                 BIG BIRD
                        Hiii, everybody!

           The new “SESAME STREET” street sign is up.  Now populated with 
           people, kids... and MUPPETS - in windows, on the street, in cars!  

           Matt walks out as GORDON and greets Loretta (as SUSAN).

                                 LORETTA (AS SUSAN)
                        Well, hi Gordon!

                        Morning, Susan!

           And now Ernie and Bert have moved into the building!  And from the 
           many different faces of Sesame Street... out walks BIG BIRD!

                                 ERNIE
                        Hey Big Bird!

                                 BIG BIRD

                        We’re keeping Sesame Street just as 
                        it is.  The only thing the 
                        Mississippis of the world respond 
                        to is popular opinion.  So we have 
                        one month, to make this show the 
                        most extraordinary undeniable hit, 
                        that they will beg us to show it.

           puddle... of course... alright... Mhm...  She shakes it off, 
           smiles.  Holds out flyers on the corner.  Nobody wants it.  She 
           smiles HARDER... follows someone trying to explain why it’s so god 
           damn important... nothin.  Gets splashed by a passing CON ED Van.

           The PREACHER’S SON on the church steps, sees Evelyn in the rain, 
           and runs to her with HIS umbrella.  She explains. We’re far away, 
           watching them walk, but it is clear but she is doing VERY well... 
           He’s amazed... She stops... looks to him... this is it... He NODS!    

           He gestures for her to follow him. And as soon as he goes 
           inside... Evelyn jumps up and down - SUCCESS!!!

                                 ARETHA
                        THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD EVER REACH ME, 
                        WAS THE SON OF A PREACHER MAN!

          THE BLACK COMMUNITY RISES TO THE OCCASION:

           -Preacher’s Son introduces her to An Older Black Couple.           
           -Older Black Man introduces her to a few Black Businessmen.        
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  87.

           -Older Black Woman introduces her to some Black Teachers.          
           -Another Meeting - Con Edison Bldg: They’re thrilled to see HER!        
           -Another Meeting - Expensive Dinner. They get the check.           
           -Evelyn Pitching in Board Rooms, Classrooms, Beauty Shops...     

           Evelyn at 125th Corner: Mothers passing out her flyers.  Everyone 
           takes them - excited!  But to Evelyn, it’s not quite enough. 
           When... HONK-HONK!  A fleet of beat-up CON-EDISON vans pulls up.      

           An AutoBody/Paint Shop: Evelyn is done UP, heels... walks into the 
           garage.  Looks around. Then pulls on some legs from under a car - 
           a fucking Gorgeous Mechanic in coveralls.  She explains her plans 
           for the vans... Shows drawings in her binder.  He’s skeptical.   

           Harlem Park: 30 Women - Jews, Puerto Ricans, Blacks, Joan - 
           kinda not sure what they’re doing there. When... A FLEET of 
           TEN PAINTED SESAME STREET VANS pull up. Evelyn slides the 
           door open.  They’re OUTFITTED with TV monitors.  Joan’s jaw 
           drops!  Evelyn passes pre-routed MAPS: Bronx, Harlem, Bed 
           Stuy, DC, Philly... then throws keys to women who rev up & 
           DEPLOY IN ALL DIRECTIONS!         

           These Colorful Vans - Driving all over the North East!

           Van Stops - in the Bronx, Harlem, Bed Stuy, etc:  The women 
           show the TV clips, books, pass out fliers, to kids just 
           waiting in a LINE AROUND THE BLOCK!  Joan’s AMAZED.

           THAT BIG HARLEM CHURCH - SUNDAY SERVICE!  EVELYN DOLLED UP!     
           Mic by the cord, working the room, KILLING IT!  Muppets wave from 
           behind the altar (Jim and Frank underneath) Kids go NUTS!  

           They do a live SKIT.  Evelyn brings a kid up, holds up a POSTER 
           WITH “A” on it - the kids scream “A!” The crows goes fucking WILD!  

           On a high, She walks upto the Preacher’s Son, points to her cheek. 
           He rolls his eyes.  The crowd goes NUTS!  HE KISSES HER CHEEK!   

                                 ARETHA
                        WHOA, THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD EVER REACH ME...    
                        WAS THA SWEET TALKIN’ SONNOFA PREACHA MAN!!!

          INT. STUDIO - DAY

           They’ve installed a new METAL TRASH CAN with a hole in the bottom.

                        THE LORD TOOK HIM AWAY FROM ME...

           Jon hates this man.  Loretta approaches Joan:

                        (comes up to Jon)

          EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS - DAY

           CAROLL nervously hails a CAB, looking over Jim’s OSCAR sketch 
           & script, trying out different voices, unhappy:

                                 CAROLL/ OSCAR
                        “Hey there, kids.” “Well, hallo kids!”

           CAB pulls up, Caroll jumps in.  CABBIE (Real-life Caroll Spinney).

                                 CABBIE
                        Where to, Mac!?

           The exact Oscar voice.  Caroll is thrilled!

                                 CAROLL
                        “Where to, Mac?”  YES!  I’m sorry, 
                        I’m going to ugh, to Sesame Street.

                                 CABBIE
                        Can you tell me how to get to 
                        Sesame Street?

          INT. 30TH STREET RECORDING STUDIO - DAY

           Joan busts past a receptionist, soundproof doors and red lights...

                                 JOAN
                        Where’s Joe?

                                 SOMEONE
                        Ma’am, you can’t go in there--

           She enters the recording studio, where Joe is on a box, 
           surrounded by weird people with weird instruments... a little 
           toy piano... a small group of KIDS in front of microphones.

                                 JOE RAPOSO
                        STOP...stop.. stop... It’s too clean. I 
                        want to feel like it’s a wocka-wocka 
                        block-a party, a song everyone already 
                        knows and just started jamming.  So 
                        drums, can you give me a little booda-
                        badoom after measure-- after, “how to 
                        get” booda-ba-doom. Xylaphone can be 
                        less military, more pakonka lapatah - 
                        “Good Vibrations”.  Jean, harmonica is-- 
                        just do whatever you’re doing. 
                        (to the Recording Booth)
                        Let’s go again, right now.  
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  89.

                                           JOE RAPOSO (CONT'D)
                 VOICE (FROM BOOTH)
           Ready when you are Joe.
                                      Can we get the kids 
                                      tambourines?

                                 JOE RAPOSO (CONT’D)
                        Kids! Circle up.
                        (they look to him, a great coach)
                        This is your song, this is your time, 
                        this is all for you!  Your parents made 
                        a mess of things.  You are the great 
                        hope for a tired weary world. “Happy 
                        people like-- what a beautiful!” You’re 
                        overwhelmed by everything that’s 
                        possible in your lifetime!  

           Joan’s face softens.

                                 JOE RAPOSO (CONT’D)
                        You’re taking over!  You own the city, 
                        march around like it. Yesterday was 
                        rough, but it’s over.  Tomorrow is 
                        yours.  You’re on your way to where the 
                        air is sweet!  To a place where you 
                        belong.  A place where people will help 
                        you grow.  Where people love you just 
                        for being you.  You hear me?

           They nod earnestly.  Joan’s eyes starts tearing up.  He’s magic.

                                 JOE RAPOSO (CONT’D)
                        Okay.  Here we go. 1-2!

           The SESAME STREET THEME begins. 

                                 KIDS
                        SUNNY DAYS! SWEEPIN’ THA CLOUDS AWAY! 
                        ON MY WAY TO WHERE THE AIR IS SWEET! 
                        CAN YOU TELL ME HOW TO GET-- 
                        HOW TO GET TO SESAME STREET.

           Joan sees the chorus of kids: two thrilled Black girls, a super 
           gay Italian kid, a very serious Cuban girl and her little 
           brother, a chunky little Dominican boy in coke bottle glasses, a 
           Blonde girl in pigtails with a huge crush on the Chinese boy. 

           It’s all PERFECT!  Joe sees Joan’s expression and smiles as if 
           to say “Of course it’s amazing.”  She laughs, shakes her head.  
           He points to a percussion tray, she mouths no, he nods yes.     
           Joan picks up a little EGG SHAKER and joins in.

                                 KIDS (CONT’D)
                        HOW TO GET TO SESAME STREET...

           The song continues as we DISSOLVE INTO: 

          THE OPENING TITLE SEQUENCE OF SESAME STREET - all kinds of kids 
          running and playing on a playground... TOGETHER.

           Pull Wide to Show this is on a TV Monitor, in:

           Jim watching his kids watch it... Nervous.

          INT. LLOYD MORRISETT’S HOME - MORNING

           Joan is watching the show with Lloyd’s family.

                                 LLOYD
                        I can’t believe nobody else pulled 
                        out except Mississippi.  It’s a 
                        miracle.  Where’s Tim?

                                 JOAN
                        Oh, I’ve been um, staying with a friend.

                                 LLOYD
                        Oh.  Well, congratulate him for me.

                                 JOAN
                        What do you mean?

                                 LLOYD
                        What do you mean, what do I mean?  
                        He’s the one who called me.. after 
                        your dinner party, to convince me 
                        to hire you for the study.

           A moment - he realizes she genuinely doesn’t know.

                                 LLOYD (CONT’D)
                        He never told you?

           Joan just shakes her head.  

           The Show on Lloyd’s TV MATCHES TO TV Sets in windows all over:

          INT. JOAN’S BLOCK - MORNING

           That same block Joan walked before, looking for her show.  
           But now EVERYONE has Sesame Street turned on.  They’re on the 
           cover at the Newsstand.  She hears kids screaming out...

                                 KIDS
                        A!!!  B!!!  C!!!

           Sesame Street on the cover of Newspapers on everybody’s Doorstep: 
           “A TRIUMPH”, “The Best Argument for Television” Etc.

           She passes her apartment... There’s Tim on the stoop.  She sits.

                                 TIM
                        You really did it.

                                 JOAN
                        You watched?

                                 TIM
                        Of course I watched.

                                 JOAN
                        ...Thank you.
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  91.

                                 TIM
                        You think I’d miss it, after all that?

                                 JOAN
                        No... thank you... for all the 
                        breakfasts, and the sack lunches, and 
                        dinners and the dry cleaning, and... for 
                        telling me that I could do it, when I 
                        didn’t have anybody to.. to look to.  

           He smiles, kisses her head.

                                 TIM
                        Well... now we can have that baby.

           She looks at him.  He knows.

                                 JOAN
                        I’m sorry, Tim.

                                 TIM
                        Me too... 

           This hits them both hard.  He puts his arm around her.  She 
           puts her head on his shoulder.

                                 JOAN
                        I didn’t know you were the one who 
                        told Lloyd to give me that chance.

                                 TIM
                        A woman?  For a job like that?   
                        How will she fit in her duties as 
                        your domestic servant.

           Joan laughs through wet eyes.

                                 JOAN
                        She won’t.

                                 TIM
                        You don’t owe me anything...

           She looks to him, grateful for that generosity.

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        But boy...  I always knew how amazing 
                        you were. I just.. I  always thought I 
                        would be that kind of amazing… as a Dad.

           She nods - the hardest possible thing to hear.

           Puts her head back on that shoulder...

          INT. CATHEDRAL OF ST. JOHN THE DIVINE - BACK TO MEMORIAL

           Up on the altar is JANE HENSON (55) surrounded by her ADULT KIDS.

                                 JANE
                        I don’t want to pretend that I know 
                        what happens after this life.  Or that 
                        Jim knew.  But he had great plans… 

           Joan laughs, the whole crowd does.
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  92.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Ugh... mostly, I think now, I just feel 
                        like it’s only us - his family. These 
                        are only his kids, I’m only his wife.  
                        They had messy rooms.  I burned the 
                        dinner.  He didn’t come home.  The dog 
                        died.. You know, whatever… it’s only us.  

           Joan smiles at this humanity.

                        And because everyone else was working, 
                        I was often used for interviews.  And 
                        the press would ask me “did you ever 
                        have any idea it would get this big”. 
                        And what I didn’t know is that it had 
                        gotten this big.  I just didn’t know...

                        I had no doubt we would hit our marks 
                        with those kids.  I am very proud of 
                        that.  But... I’ll be happy when we 
                        get the results of the Census.

           A fleet of college-aged black men and women with clipboards 
           are dropped off, and spread out.  They talk to every man, 
           woman and child.  Every babysitter.  Every one.  Taking notes.

           More young men and women with clipboards canvas the street.

           Evelyn walks out of her home, goes into a bodega, and sees those 
           same Two Young Puerto Rican ALUMINUM FOIL BOYS with all their 
           nickles buying 5 more rolls.  She looks at them weird.  They scoop 
           up their rolls, give her a “don’t look at us” look, and head out.

                        Hi, Doc!

                                 DOC HOWE

                        Hell, they knew their ABCs, 123s, they 
                        could name Susan, Gordon, Bob, Oscar,

                        How did you know about that?

                                 DOC HOWE
                        So I’m gonna tell ya a little story.  
                        You remember those schools in the 
                        South who refused to integrate?
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  94.

                                 DOC HOWE
                        And you remember those fellas in D.C. 
                        who wouldn’t give those states any 
                        federal funding until they did?

                                 JOAN
                        That was you?

           This does make her feel pretty great.

                        You take care now, Joan Cooney.

           Joan hangs up.  As a Hispanic woman, RENA (30) walks up.

                                 RENA
                        I’m looking for who’s in charge here?

                                 JOAN
                        That’s me.

                                 RENA
                        Oh, what a surprise.

                                 JOAN
                        Why’s that? 

                                 RENA
                        My colleagues and I were confused why 
                        Susan is such a stereotype.

           Joan is given pause.  Matt approaches.

                                 MATT
                        She’s an articulate, beautiful, 
                        caring woman.  We don’t see black--

                                 RENA
                        Not because of her race, sir.  Susan, 
                        the ONLY woman on the most progressive 
                        show on television, is a homemaker?

                                 MATT
                        We need women at home taking care--
                        I’m sorry, who are you.. with?

                                 RENA
                        I’m Rena, with the National Association 
                        for Women. And it came up at our 
                        meeting, as everyone had seen the show, 
                        and many of these women were out in the 
                        neighborhoods getting the word out--

                                 MATT
                        These are the same critics who say 
                        we’re more Westchester than Watts.

                                 RENA
                        I’m not even getting into complaints 
                        from the Hispanic population of where 
                        they are in this show.  I’ll just 
                        stick to a scene where Big Bird is 
                        helping Gordon.  Gordon says,

                                 RENA (CONT'D)
                        “You’re a boy bird, you have to do men’s 
                        work, the heavy work, the important 
                        work.  Girls arrange flowers, decorate.”  

           Matt begins to speak, but she gives him an “I got this”.

                                 RENA (CONT’D)
                        The way women are portrayed, who 
                        young girls have to look up to and 
                        pattern after, prevents them from 
                        realizing their full potential.

           Joan laughs to herself.

                                 RENA (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, but this isn’t funny to 
                        the members of my--

                                 JOAN
                        No, you’re... You’re completely 
                        right.  I was so worried about... 
                        Would you like a job?

                                 RENA
                        ...what?

           Joan nods.

                                 RENA (CONT’D)
                        You don’t need to check with 
                        someone first?

                                 JOAN
                        No... I’m in charge.

           Rena smiles.  JOAN TURNS, pretending to grab something from a 
           drawer, but really just smiling broadly herself about that too.

                                 EVELYN
                        You should both be in school.

                                 BOY 1
                        That’s my brother, I watch him.  
                        School tried for years to teach him, 
                        but they couldn’t, so now we work.

                        Oh... Well.. What’s all this foil about?

                        wanted to watch those shows anyway.
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  97.

                        BUM-BUM, BUM-BUM, BUM-BUM BADDA BUM!

                                 BOY 1
                        If you put foil on your antennas it 
                        comes in better, and you don’t have 
                        to keep getting up to move them, 
                        and since kids are crazy to get 
                        that station now, because of some 
                        new show.  We’re making a fortune.  
                        Block by block.  Square by square.

                                 BOY 2
                        Block by block.  Square by square.

                                 EVELYN
                        ...What’s the name of this new show?

           CUT TO: The Checkout Counter - Evelyn puts THIRTY DOLLARS DOWN.

           CUT TO: Boy 1 walks out of the Bodega, with all-he-can-carry 
           arms full of FOIL, and Boy 2 pulls a brand-new Radio Flyer wagon 
           STACKED FULL OF FOIL, with “SESAME STREET” Bumper stickers.

                                 EVELYN (FROM HER VAN) (CONT’D)
                        I love you boys!  Go make some money!  
                        If you need more foil, you got my 
                        number.  And please... make sure you 
                        both watch the show.  Okay?!

           They nod.  Wave.

                        The... Deficit Model, wherein the negro

                        even public television is now consumed 
                        with putting braces on their legs so 
                        they can run with the big kids.  But 
                        I’m here to tell you that it cannot be 
                        addressed with education…

                        It might be a kind of entertainment... 
                        but unfortunately, it comes down to 
                        genetic differences between the Races.

                                 LLOYD
                        Asshole!

           They all turn to buttoned-up Lloyd... impressed.

                                 JON STONE
                        God, I hope those black kids blow 
                        everyone else out of the fucking water.

                        (to Joan)
                        You know, after our premiere... I 
                        got a call from NBC, asking if I 
                        wanted to work in Prime-time.

                                 JOAN
                        Oh, wow, congratulations Evelyn!

                                 EVELYN
                        I would love to stay here, but in case 
                        these numbers are not what you were 
                        hoping for...

                                 JOAN
                        Evelyn, I--

                                 GERRY
                        I think we should be realistic.  As you 
                        said these kids don’t have the same 
                        support... so I think even... 10-20%?

                                 JON STONE
                        Yah, 25 percent?  I’d be thrilled.

                                 JIM
                        A quarter learning to read and write.  
                        That’s gotta be a big win, right?

                                 MATT
                        I haven’t had dinner with my daughter and 
                        wife in over a year.  We better have 
                        reached at least half those kids. 

           When a MESSENGER ARRIVES...  Everyone freezes.  Joan gets up... 
           takes it... opens it...  They stand up.  Nervous.  Joan reads:

                                 JOAN
                        “A Report of Three Studies on the Role

                        Washington, D.C. ...and Bed Stuy”

           Evelyn grabs Matt’s hand.

                                 EVELYN
                        Do or die...

                        was achieving its prime objective of

           Matt breathes heavy...
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  99.

                        “The results left no question that Sesame 
                        Street has indeed achieved this goal.”

           Everyone freezes.  Joan starts to speak... Cannot.

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        Our research indicates that... 

           Joan looks... doesn’t understand.

                                 MATT
                        What?

                                 EVELYN
                        What is it?

                                 JOAN
                        ...92 percent.

           A still moment... Impossible.

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        92 percent.

           PEOPLE START SCREAMING!!  Joan doesn’t know what to do.

           Evelyn falls to her knees, hands on her face, sobbing.  

           Matt gets down on the floor to hug Evelyn - tears streaming. 

           Jon sits there, eyes wet, hand over his mouth, heaving.

           Gerry and Joe lift Evelyn up in the air, heroically, and leave her 
           in Oscar’s trash can, laughing.

           Joan laughs, then sees Jim, and they both burst into happy tears.

                                 BOTH (AT THE SAME TIME)
                        You did it.

           They embrace. The others embrace around them.  A big hug.  Then...

                                 JIM
                        (to Joan)
                        You’re thinking “what about that 
                        other 8 percent?”, aren’t you?

           Joan laughs!  

                                 JOAN
                        I think your kids will be very 
                        proud of you.

           Jim is touched, he nods, grateful...

                                 JIM
                        And that 92% will one day be very 
                        proud of You.  ...Your kids.

           Joan can’t hold it back anymore, cries over Jim’s shoulder.  

                                 JOAN
                        ...thank you.
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  100.

           Matt and Evelyn see, and come running for Joan.  Squeezing her.  
           COMPLETE SUCCESS.  Joe plays something congratulatory on the piano 
           that Jon sings triumphantly to...  Champagne!

           Joan looks to Lloyd - both stunned speechless.

                                 LLOYD
                        92 percent... 

           Joan nods.

                                 LLOYD (CONT’D)
                        Insufferable.

           Joan laughs, they embrace.

           ...When someone in the background almost trips behind a backdrop.  

                                 A WOMAN
                        Oh my...

           Joan looks around the corner... It’s Sally Field.

           Everyone stops.  Joan walks over.

                                 JOAN
                        Hello, I didn’t um, I didn’t know you 
                        were coming.  Welcome to Sesame Street.

                                 SALLY
                        Thank you.  

                                 JOAN
                        Champagne?

                                 SALLY
                        No.. Thank you, I can’t stay long.  
                        Gotta get a flight back to Mississippi. 

           Everyone’s face registers who this is.  Pretends to not listen.

                                 JOAN
                        I thought you hated to fly.

                                 SALLY
                        I do... but... well... the truth is, 
                        Look, I don’t know the last time you had 
                        to change your mind about something.  A 
                        big something.  It’s-- well, it’s hard.  
                        And growing up down there, especially as 
                        a-- Well, it takes a certain kind of... 
                        a bravery, really.. to make tomorrow 
                        come a little faster.  I tell myself 
                        it’s cause I never had anyone with those 
                        ideals look up to.  Especially a--
                        (she gestures to Joan)
                        Well, ‘til now.

           Joan looks at her team, whose expressions say “HOLY SHIT!”

                                 SALLY (CONT’D)
                        I’d like... I hope you all can accept 
                        our apology. 
                                 (MORE)
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  101.
                                 SALLY (CONT’D)
                        And ask that we could please show 
                        Sesame Street... - as is - to the 
                        children of Mississippi.

                                 JOAN
                        It would be our pleasure.

           Everyone breaks the silence, going over to say hi to Sally.

           Matt shakes his head, wow, to Joan -- whispers through a grin:

                                 MATT
                        Now don’t go walkin’ around with that 
                        smile like you cured racism or anything.

                                 JOAN
                        I think you made that world a little 
                        better for your daughter to grow up in.  

           He nods, grateful to hear that.

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        And did your sister proud.

           His face crinkles, tears come close behind.  They embrace.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Evelyn, there’s a call for you.

           Evelyn steps to the side to pick up the receiver.

                                 A VOICE (ON THE PHONE) 
                        Yah, Miss Evelyn, please.

                                 EVELYN
                        This is her.

                                 A VOICE (ON THE PHONE) 
                        Listen, we watched your show.  He’s 
                        been watching for a week straight 
                        every morning and afternoon.

                                 EVELYN
                        Is this?..

           little brother, is in the living room watching Sesame Street.

                                 EVELYN
                        I thought you two would be out 
                        selling foil?

                                 BOY 1
                        No ma’am, not anymore, that boy’s 
                        going to college.  Listen!

           He holds the phone out.  Evelyn listens.

                                 BOY 2
                        1!  2!  3!  4!  5!  6!

                        I saw you on TV!

                                 MATT
                        Yeah? 

                                 HOLLY ROBINSON
                        Yeah, you were helping people.

                                 MATT
                        Yeah, I was.

                                 HOLLY ROBINSON
                        That was nice of you.

           Matt hugs Holly.  He can’t kiss her enough.

          INT. MATT ROBINSON’S HOME - SAME NIGHT

           -Matt eats dinner with his family.  He’s home.  They’re overjoyed. 
           -They watch Sesame Street, together.  She loves it.                
           -Then after he puts Holly to bed, and he’s thumbing through MAIL:

                         “FROM THE DESK OF JOAN COONEY:                               
                   Another study I was sent from a University...                    
                          I figured you’d want to see.”

           He opens it.  Reads it.  Can’t believe it.  Then sees included is 
           the envelope from Joan is a business card & address for ARTHUR.  
           So Matt goes to his typewriter... Types an ENVELOPE.

          INT. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA - PROFESSOR ARTHUR’S OFFICE - DAY

           THIS ENVELOPE is picked up by Arthur.  He uses a haughty letter 
           opener to open it, confused at the return address.

                                 MATT (V.O., READING)
                        Dear Arthur, Enclosed you’ll find not 
                        only the report disproving your 
                        prejudicial, unlettered claims about 
                        black children’s ability to learn. But  
                        also a University study...  

          INT. A STUDY - THREE WHITE CHILDREN IN THREE LAB ROOMS - DAY

           -KID 1: Is sitting politely in a chair watching Sesame Street.   
           -KID 2: The show is turned off and she’s called to the table.    
           -KID 3: A Lab Assistant shows FOUR PHOTOS OF DIFFERENT CHILDREN.

                                 MATT (V.O.)
                        Where they showed little kids 
                        photos of many different children. 
                        And asked them which child they 
                        would like to be friends with...
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  103.

           -Kid 1 looks at the photos intently.                               
           -Kid 2 flips through the FOUR PHOTOS: THREE WHITE, ONE BLACK GIRL.                           
           -Kid 3 knows who... looks to the Lab Assistant.  Pulls one.

                                 MATT (V.O.)
                        Kids who had watched Sesame Street 
                        almost all said they would prefer 
                        to be friends with the black kid.

           And we push in on the photo they’re all holding... THE BLACK GIRL.

          INT. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA - PROFESSOR ARTHUR’S OFFICE - DAY

           Arthur’s face is furrowed, his brain warm.  He reads the end:

                                 MATT (V.O.)
                        So maybe you should consider 
                        watching the show, yourself.

           That letter MATCH CUTS to one in BRIAN HENSON’s hand - now 40...

          INT. THE CATHEDRAL OF ST. JOHN THE DIVINE - BACK TO MEMORIAL

                                 BRIAN HENSON
                        Dad wrote us all letters, and I want to 
                        read you a part of... It says, “Have a 
                        wonderful time in life everybody. It 
                        seems strange writing this kind of 
                        thing while I’m still alive… but it 
                        wouldn’t be easy after I go…”

           Jim’s son, Brian is on the altar reading... The crowd laughs.

                                 BRIAN HENSON (CONT’D)
                        “To each of you, I send my love.  If on 
                        this side of life I’m able to watch over 
                        and help you out – know that I will.”

           Joan hears this.  Looks to Jim’s pic.  Then sees EISNER.

                                 BRIAN HENSON (CONT’D)
                        “This may all seem silly and over the 
                        top to you guys, but what the hell, 
                        I’m gone and who can argue with me?”

           Gets a big laugh!  The New Orleans Jazz Band begins a trip 
           back up the aisle. Everyone starts walking out. 

           Joan looks at Jim’s picture in the program... it’s a lot.

                                 THE BOY 
                        You okay, Joan?

                                 JOAN
                        I guess maybe I have to start thinking of 
                        him as gone.  Of all of them as gone...  

           She looks ahead to the pew of Muppets.

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        I guess it couldn’t last forever.  
                        I just... I wonder what Jim would 
                        want me to do...
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  104.

                                 THE BOY
                        “Please... watch... out.. for each 
                        other.  -Jim Henson.”

           Joan turns to see The Boy reading the memorial program.

                                 JOAN
                        You can read that?

           He nods, smiles, something familiar to it.

                                 THE BOY
                        I start kindergarten in a week.

           When, his FATHER comes to join The Boy and his Mother.

                                 FATHER
                        I’m so sorry I’m late. 
                        (to Joan)
                        I hope he wasn’t bothering you.

                                 JOAN
                        Not at all.

           He gives his son a big kiss, picks him up.  Smiles to Joan.

                                 FATHER
                        Uh... Miss Cooney?

                                 JOAN
                        Do we know each other?

                                 FATHER
                        A long time ago.  Maybe this’ll help... 
                        (he postures proudly)
                        A!  B!  C!  D!  E!!!

                                 JOAN
                        John John?!

           They embrace.

                                 FATHER
                        Yes, ma’am.  And this is my wife, 
                        and looks like you met our son.  

                                 JOAN
                        He’s terrific.

                                 FATHER
                        I have a good job.  A good house.  
                        A great family... I meant to write 
                        a hundred times, but well, we 
                        wanted to be here for this.
                        (then)
                        I taught him what you taught me. 

                                 THE BOY
                        ABCD-EFG-HILK-ELLEMENO-P!

           Then it’s their turn to clear the pew, into the aisle.  

           Joan watches as The Boy grabs John John’s hand and they walk...  

           Joan starts into the aisle... Alone.

           Then she looks down... to find Grover and Ernie holding her hands.
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  105.

          EXT. CENTRAL PARK - MOMENTS LATER

           The whole Sesame Street Muppet gang walk Joan down Central Park 
           West, and drop her off at her Apartment Building.  Joan looks to 
           all of them... They look to her... As if for the last time.

                                 SNUFFY
                        You’re-- you’re not coming with us?

                                 JOAN
                        There’s no place for me there anymore.

           Bert wipes a tear.  

                                 BIG BIRD
                        But what’ll we do without you?

                                 JOAN
                        Oh you’ll be fine, Big Bird.  What’ll I 
                        do in this world without all of you?

           Joan crosses the street to her apartment. 

           She turns around... There they are waving... She waves back.

           She smiles for them, but turns back to the apartment and 
           can’t keep from crying any longer.  

           A big truck drives by... And when it passes... they’re gone.  

           Joan sits on a bench outside.  And cries.  We see faintly in the 
           B.G.: One furry blue monster waiting at the Crosswalk, then the 
           light changes, he grabs an adults hand, and crosses the street... 

                                 A VOICE 
                        Joan!  Oh, Joan!!

           Joan wipes her eyes quickly.  It’s...

                                 JOAN
                        Hi, Grover.

                                 GROVER
                        Joan... are you sad?

                                 JOAN
                        Yah.  I’m uh... Saying goodbye to 
                        you guys, to Jim, makes me sad.

                                 GROVER
                        You know what I do when I’m feeling sad?

                                 JOAN
                        (smiling, knowing full-well)
                        What, Grover?

                                 GROVER
                        I sing a song.  Would you like to 
                        sing with me?

           She nods, but the underscore has already started up, underneath...

          {AN ORIGINAL SONG - IN THE JOE RAPOSO/MUPPETY STYLE}

           Grover explains “There’s so many amazing people in the world 
           we never get to meet, instead of being sad to say ‘Goodbye’, 
           perhaps we can be happy that we ever got to say ‘Hello’.”
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  106.

           Joan smiles, and repeats the sentiment:

                                 JOAN
                        SO HAPPY THAT WE GOT TO SAY--

                                 A MAN’S VOICE
                        Hello.

           They turn, and there on the bench is JIM HENSON - playing the 
           Banjo stinger from Rainbow Connection in counterpart.

                                 JIM
                        Please watch out for each other.

           Joan nods, her instructions clear.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        And love and forgive everybody.  
                        It’s a good life, enjoy it.

                                 JOAN
                        I’m gonna miss you.  I-- I don’t 
                        know how to begin to say goodbye.

                                 JIM
                        Well, you don’t have to... because...

           THE LAST CHORUS OF THE SONG: 

                                 ALL THREE (In 3-Part Harmony)
                        INSTEAD OF JUST A SAD GOODBYE,  
                        I’M HAPPY THAT WE GOT TO SAY ‘HELLO’.

           And with that Jim is gone.  Joan kisses Grover’s little blue head.  

           Bernice the pigeon flies up from their bench, around the corner... 
           Where EISNER pulls up at a light, in his BLACK STRETCH LIMO.

                                 EISNER
                        (on a brick car phone)
                        No, of course Jim didn’t sign the 
                        contract.  But they don’t know that.  
                        Whadda they got, a few kids from the 
                        projects?  I’ve got enough lawyers to 
                        repave Sesame Street, and bury Joan 
                        underneath it.  We’re gonna crush ‘em! 

           The limo peels off.  BUT... in the FOREGROUND: An OLD TRASH 
           CAN LID raises, it’s OSCAR, he heard the whole thing!

          INT. JOAN’S NEW APARTMENT LOBBY/ELEVATOR - DAY

           Joan waves to the doorman, walks into the ELEVATOR, and the 
           doors begin to close, when she hears:

                                 A VOICE 
                        Hold the elevatah, please.

           Joan puts her hand out.  Someone enters.  It’s the Doctor Muppet!

                                 DOCTOR
                        Well, look who it is!  Haven’t seen 
                        you in a New York minute.  ‘Course 
                        there’a people in this building I 
                        haven’t seen since Roosevelt.  So 
                        how’s uh-- what’s his name--?
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  107.

                                 JOAN
                        Oh, well... We’re divorced.

                                 DOCTOR
                        As soon as the question came out of my 
                        mouth I noticed you were dressed like 
                        yer coming from a funeral, and thought--

                                 JOAN
                        Oh, I am-- but it’s for a-- well, we 
                        founded the company together.. which 
                        looks like it’s coming to an end--

                                 DOCTOR
                        ..And now you gotta keep the family 
                        together. Story as old as the hills.

                                 JOAN
                        Oh, no I was thinking maybe it was 
                        time for me to, I dunno--

                                 DOCTOR
                        To what?  Retire?  YOU?  You wanna 
                        take the bus from Zabar’s to a 
                        matinee with women who smell like 
                        wet fur and colostomy bags?  No.

                                 JOAN
                        I’m just not sure what else to do.

           The Doctor Muppet just stares at her.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Whaddyou talking about!?  You do, what 
                        have you done yer whole life!  What 
                        mothers have done since the beginning of 
                        time!  You fight!  For your job, for 
                        your family!  For your god damned kids. 

           Joan knows she’s right, when the Elevator DINGS and she calms.  

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Well, this is me.

          EXT. CENTRAL PARK/ JOAN’S NEW APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER 

           Joan walks outside in a haze, when Oscar drives up in his JALOPY.

                                 OSCAR
                        Get in, Tootz!

          EXT. STREETS OF NEW YORK CITY - SUNSET

           Oscar driving, with Joan in the passenger seat.

                                 JOAN
                        I knew he was just trying to bully us.  
                        You think it’s too late to stop him?

                                 OSCAR
                        There he is!

           Pointing to a black stretch limo ahead of them... AND THEY’RE OFF!

           Then along the way, they stop at a stop sign, and Joan 
           realizes she’s at that ROUGH HARLEM Corner... 
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  108.

           It’s not perfect... but now there’s a GIRL (6) on that same 
           stoop, and she’s reading a book.  Joan sees, is moved, and 
           immediately something clicks in her - a fight instinct.

           Then, along the FDR Drive: They catch up.  Eisner rolls his 
           limousine window down.  Joan calls out from moving cars:

                                 JOAN
                        The jig is up, Eisner!  We know you 
                        don’t have a contract with Jim, and are 
                        just trying to intimidate a small non-
                        profit children’s educational program.

                                 OSCAR
                        (to Eisner)
                        Ya know, I really admire you!  

                                 EISNER
                        Well, thank you.

                                 OSCAR
                        It’s not everyday you see such a 
                        garbage person.  Heh-heh-heh.

                                 EISNER
                        (to the driver)
                        To the bridge!

                                 JOAN
                        Didja hear that?  He’s headed for 
                        Sesame Street!  Step on it, Oscar!

          EXT. THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

           They’re in a high speed chase... Eisner CALLING OUT THE MOONROOF: 
           Eisner empties a box of TACKS onto the road, Oscar rolls over.

                                 OSCAR
                        Joke’s on him!  The tires were 
                        flat already!

           When in the back seat - Ernie, Bert & Cookie with Popcorn:

                                 ERNIE
                        GEE, BERT!  Is this how you thought 
                        this movie would end?

                                 BERT
                        I was hoping for more of a quiet 
                        independent film.

                                 JOAN (TO CAMERA)
                        So was I.

                                 COOKIE MONSTER
                        Me think this what Jim would have wanted.

           They all nod, he’s right.

          EXT. SESAME STREET - A REAL BLOCK - DAY

           The Limo & Jalopy screeches around a corner onto Sesame Street - 
           not a set, but a VERY REAL city block - a WRECKING BALL awaits.

                                 JOAN
                        Hold it, right there, Eisner!
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  109.

                                 EISNER
                        Give up, Joan, it’s over... you lost.

                                 JOAN
                        If you keep this up, I’ll be forced to 
                        go public, and file a report with the 
                        Attorney General of New York.

           When The Attorney General of New York (BARACK OBAMA) walks by.

                                 ATTORNEY GENERAL
                        Excuse me... I’m the Attorney General 
                        of New York.

                                 EISNER
                        What?!?

                                 ATTORNEY GENERAL
                        Is there a problem here?

                                 EISNER
                        Jim Henson promised me the muppets!
                        I can have my lawyers explain.

                                 ATTORNEY GENERAL
                        That wont be necessary.

           A.G. opens his COAT: He’s wearing a VINTAGE SESAME STREET T-SHIRT.

                                 JOAN
                        May I show you?

           Joan gestures INSIDE the window of 123 Sesame Street, they look...

          INT. MUPPET WORKSHOP - FLASHBACK

           Jim and Joan (1990), up late one late night. 

           In the Window: The Attorney General, muppets and everyone watches:

                                 JIM
                        Joan, I wanted you to know that I’m 
                        starting work with Disney on some new 
                        movies, a TV series, a show at the park..

                                 JOAN
                        Oh, Jim!  Wow...  Congratulations! 

                                 JIM
                        Thank you... But I want you to know... 
                        that the Sesame Street muppets are not 
                        part of that deal.

                                 JOAN
                        But they’re yours...

                                 JIM
                        Not anymore.  

           Joan tilts her head, curious.  Jim smiles.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        I’m leaving the Sesame Street muppets 
                        to the children of the world.

           Joan is speechless. A hug.  EVERYONE OUTSIDE ERUPTS IN A CHEER!!!
                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  110.

          EXT. SESAME STREET - A REAL BLOCK - CONTINUOUS

           The Attorney General folds his arms. A CROWD now surrounds Eisner.

           They try to start the limo, and it stalls, makes a weird noise.  
           He opens the hood - Cookie Monster has EATEN much the engine.

                                 COOKIE MONSTER
                        Sorry!

                                 EISNER
                        Excuse me, can you help me with my car?

           The two mechanics turn... IT’S THE REAL MARIA & LUIS

                                                CAN YOU TELL ME HOW?  111.

           When a Baker appears atop a flight of stairs.

                        Oh no...

           The baker tumbles, and the pies end up all over Eisner.

                                 JOAN
                        Well, there’s only one more thing to do.
