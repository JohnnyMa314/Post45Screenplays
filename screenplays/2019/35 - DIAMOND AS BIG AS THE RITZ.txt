           SHIMMERING TITLES: “THE DIAMOND AS BIG AS THE RITZ”

           As JOHN speaks, the titles lose their sheen, and fade to 
           unremarkable versions of themselves until they are an opaque 
           and unforgiving black.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        Why are beautiful things so 
                        irresistible? So often they come 
                        from something not beautiful at 
                        all. Something completely and 
                        utterly resistible.

           SUPER: “1924”

           SMASH TO BLINDING WHITE LIGHT.

           EXT. WOODS - ROCKY MOUNTAINS - MONTANA - 1924 - NIGHT

           FLASH. Lightning illuminates the flooding sky. A downpour 
           loosens the mud around tree roots. A towering pine crashes to 
           the ground as thunder claps.

           But we hear none of that. 
           Instead, we hear a glorious OPERA singer. A soprano. 
           Scaling an aria up and down with a vibrato to kill for.

           Snarling DOBERMANS drip spit from their chops as they sniff 
           the air. Sniffing for the scent of...

           A man (30s) - we will know him as THE ITALIAN. He carries a 
           small bundle of cloth, running frantically through the woods 
           to evade dogs and men.

           A DOBERMAN closes in, sinking its teeth into the man’s leg, 
           bringing him to the ground. 

           The BUNDLE falls out of his hand and the cloth unwraps to 
           reveal A MASSIVE ROCK. Bigger than a man’s fist.

           The dog pounces for the kill. The Italian kicks it square in 
           the face, stunning it briefly. 

           Seizing his window of opportunity, the man crawls through the 
           mud toward the ROCK. The dog recovers, and charges. It’s 
           going to rip the man apart when...

           The man spins around, and CLUBS the dog over the head with 
           the rock, beating it over and over as we are treated to the 
           sweet delights of our soprano, our angel.
           The Italian stops beating the dog, looks down at his hand, 
           mesmerized by the weapon. And here, for the first time, we 
           finally get a good look at this rock. Which we now see is a

           MASSIVE DIAMOND. It’s as if all the diamonds we’ve ever met 
           Frankenstein’d themselves together to create a diamond hell-
           bent on bringing kings to their knees and nations into war. 

           This diamond sits there. In his hand. Streaks of blood 
           washing away in the rain. We watch, transfixed, as our angel 
           concludes her song and we are left with SILENCE.

           A CRACK of thunder brings THE SOUND IN. Nearby shouts and 
           flashlights break his trance, and The Italian escapes out of 
           frame as his pursuers come into focus. 

           They are led by a towering WHITE-HAIRED MAN (60s), 
           brandishing a pistol. If you were to look closely, you’d spot 
           a chain around his neck with a CRUCIFIX and a SMALL KEY 
           attached. He stares down at the dog, whimpering in a pool of 
           its own blood. Without hesitation, he shoots the dog in the 
           head, silencing its whimpers.

                                 WHITE-HAIRED MAN
                             (shouting above the storm)
                        FIND HIM!

           The search party is off. 

           The MOON glows in the sky, slowly morphing into

           A SMALL PEARL EARRING

           EXT. TRAIN PLATFORM - HADES, MISSOURI - DAY

           SUPER: “9 MONTHS EARLIER”

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        My mother wore her pearl earrings 
                        today. They’re fake, but they’re 
                        the nicest thing she owns.

           Gradually we inch out from the Pearl, beginning to see the 
           earlobe on which it rests.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        She bought them off a traveling 
                        salesman years ago. If it tells you 
                        anything, the guy was also selling 
                        snake oil and dream catchers.
           We’re further out, enough to see the earlobes belong to BETTY 
           UNGER (45) - a provincial woman with a tank full of love and 
           gallons to spare. Betty is speaking intensely and urgently 
           but we only hear John. 

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        I think she thinks they’re real, 
                        but I’ve always been afraid to ask. 
                        She only wears them on special 
                        occasions. Like today. Today is 
                        special. But we’ll get to that.

           Further out still, we see Betty is speaking to her husband 
           JAMES UNGER (49) - distinguished, soon to feel his age.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        My father is here too. He took the 
                        morning off of work, because as I 
                        said, today is special. Although 
                        truthfully speaking, I’m sure he 
                        was just glad to find an excuse to 
                        see the sun. He works in the coal 
                        mines. Has for thirty years. 

           James argues back at Betty.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        Everyone here works in the coal 
                        mines. He doesn’t really talk about 
                        it but I can tell he hates it. I 
                        asked Mother once why he never 
                        found a new job, but she just said 
                        people have obligations and I would 
                        understand when I was older.

           JOHN UNGER (16) bounds onto the platform with train ticket in 
           hand. We drink him in. He is ours. Quaintly, understatedly 
           handsome with eyes hypnotic enough to coax out secrets, and a 
           heart good enough to keep them. But no heart, despite how 
           good, is immune to temptation.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        Well. I’m older now.

           The SCREECH of a train whistle brings us into the scene.

                                 JOHN
                        All set. 
                             (farewell)
                        Betty. James.
                                 BETTY
                        You may be a big, grown-up scholar 
                        now, but it’s still “Mom” and “Dad” 
                        to you.

                                 JOHN
                        Whatever you say, Betty.

           A knowing smile. A rehearsed levity.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                             (noticing their tension)
                        What is it?

                                 JAMES
                        Son, there’s been a mix-up.

                                 BETTY
                        It appears the transport coach from 
                        the station to the school requires 
                        payment... which is not covered by 
                        your scholarship.

                                 JAMES
                        Now, I’ve spoken to the conductor 
                        and he insists it’s no more than a 
                        five mile walk...

           But we don’t hear what else he discussed with the conductor 
           because we’re back in John’s head.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        You can’t pick your family. It 
                        might be the only thing in life 
                        that you truly have no say over. I 
                        love my parents. I do. I love them 
                        more than anything in this world. 
                        But it’s moments like these - these 
                        small indignities in which they 
                        would rather explain away our lack 
                        of means than simply to 
                        acknowledge, Son, we’re poor and 
                        you’re walking. Moments like these 
                        that made me itch for my new life, 
                        just around the corner.

           Another SCREECHING whistle brings us back. The final call. 
           John is pulled toward the train, but not before his father 
           holds him by the shoulders. The unfamiliarity of the act 
           clear on John’s face. John absorbs his father’s words.

                                 JAMES
                        Make us proud, John. Never forget 
                        who you are. An Unger. From Hades.
           INT. TRAIN HALLWAY - DAY

           John drags a trunk onto the train, where he finds... no one. 
           Not another human soul wanders the corridor. He passes empty 
           compartment after empty compartment.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        That wasn’t a bug in your ear. You 
                        heard correctly. “Hades.” As in 
                        “Hades, Missouri.” I’ll pay you 
                        twenty dollars if you’ve ever heard 
                        of it. Which is just as well, 
                        because you haven’t heard of it and 
                        I don’t have twenty dollars. Not 
                        yet, anyway.

           INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY

           John sits alone.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        The thing about Hades is that no 
                        one comes and no one leaves. You 
                        are born in Hades, you work in the 
                        coal mines in Hades, you marry in 
                        Hades, you procreate in Hades, you 
                        grow old in Hades, you die in Hades 
                        and no one outside of Hades ever 
                        knows you existed.

           A TICKET TAKER passes the compartment, not noticing John.

                                 JOHN
                        Excuse me?

                                 TICKET TAKER
                        I didn’t see you there.

                                 JOHN
                        I have a ticket.

                                 TICKET TAKER
                        Don’t mind that. I only start 
                        punching at the Springfield stop.

                                 JOHN
                             (firm)
                        I’d like you to punch it now.

                                 TICKET TAKER
                        Pardon?
                                 JOHN
                        I worked three jobs last summer. 

                                 TICKET TAKER
                        You what?

                                 JOHN
                        I built fences and tended livestock 
                        on the Dickerson ranch. I kept 
                        books in the accounting office of 
                        the Hades Mining Company, 
                        Incorporated. And I painted toys in 
                        the toy shop - little model trains 
                        just like the one we’re on now, but 
                        smaller, toy-sized. I saved every 
                        penny I made from those three jobs 
                        so I could buy my one-way ticket 
                        from Hades, Missouri to Greenwich, 
                        Connecticut. A place no one has 
                        heard of to a place where 
                        millionaires live. And I did. I 
                        bought it. It’s right here in my 
                        hand. A one-way from Hades to 
                        Greenwich. Not Springfield to 
                        Greenwich. I’m not leaving 
                        Springfield. I’m leaving Hades. So 
                        if it’s all the same to you, I 
                        would very much appreciate it if 
                        you could punch my ticket during 
                        the short and only time for the 
                        remainder of my life on planet 
                        Earth that I remain here. In Hades.

           The Ticket Taker is flummoxed. John adds:

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        Please.

           Ticket Taker punches the ticket and goes, wondering the same 
           thing we are. What curious boy is this?

           John steels himself. The train starts to move. Out the 
           window, his parents proudly wave goodbye. As John waves back:

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        No one gets out of Hades. But like 
                        I said. Today is special. 

           TEARS pool in John’s eyes.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. IDYLLIC COUNTRY ROAD - CONNECTICUT - DAY

           John drags his trunk through a muddy New England road, 
           flanked by towering oaks. He looks up, stops, taking it in:

           ST. MIDAS SCHOOL, a stately New England Hogwarts. A new home. 
           Young men unload luggage from a row of black luxury vehicles.

                                 PERKINS (O.S.) (PRELAP)
                        If you are sitting in this room, 
                        then congratulations are in order. 
                        St. Midas’ Preparatory Academy is 
                        the threshold of opportunity.

           Another black car CLIPS past John. Too close for comfort.

           INT. ST. MIDAS’ SCHOOL - GREAT HALL - DAY

           HEADMASTER PERKINS (55, wrinkles, philosophy) lectures a 
           roomful of new students: sixteen year old boys at attention.

                                 PERKINS
                        Since the Great War, education has 
                        changed. The leaders of tomorrow 
                        must have more than intelligence. 
                        They must be equipped to handle the 
                        ethical and moral challenges that 
                        come with this brave new world.

           As Perkins speaks, we catch glimpses of St. Midas’ finest. 
           One boy repeatedly flicks another’s ear. Lads snicker over a 
           pocket-sized porno of a naked bombshell.

                                 PERKINS (CONT'D)
                        Only the finest young gentlemen of 
                        your generation...

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        Wealthiest. Is what he means. Only 
                        the wealthiest young gentlemen. 

                                 PERKINS
                        ...have been selected to learn, to 
                        grow and mature within these halls.

           All the boys wear a uniform - dark BLAZERS with the St. 
           Midas’ crest on the chest. But that’s just the starter kit. 
           Many of them have accessorized expansion packs: Gold Rolexes. 
           Designer luggage. Oxfords you could hock to pay tuition.

           We finally land on JOHN - no expansion pack, no starter kit. 
           He wears civilian Hades garb. Missed the memo.

                        Each of you has something unique to 
                        offer. 

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        Money.

                                 PERKINS
                        A purpose.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        Money.

                                 PERKINS
                        Some reason why you’re here... 

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        It’s money.

           CHARLES WRINGLEY (16) - a brutish lump of a trust fund 
           sitting behind John - turns to his friend and mutters...

                                 WRINGLEY
                             (snickering at John)
                        Charity by the looks of it.

           John doesn’t flinch. Perkins flags their chuckling.

                                 PERKINS
                        Something funny?

           Wringley and friend hush. But Perkins steps away from his 
           podium and strolls down the aisle toward John and the others.

                                 PERKINS (CONT'D)
                        No, please. Here I am, welcoming 
                        you into the finest young men’s 
                        preparatory academy in the world, 
                        but clearly you have something to 
                        say that supersedes all of that, so 
                        I implore you...

           Silence hangs in the hall.

                                 PERKINS (CONT'D)
                        I can assure you, Mr. Wringley, it 
                        matters not who your parents are 
                        within these halls. You will be 
                        held to the same standards as the 
                        other students.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        It was a nice gesture of 
                        egalitarianism.

                        But the truth is that Headmaster 
                        Perkins called him by name. Which 
                        means it did matter who his parents 
                        were. I had no clue of course, but 
                        everyone else seemed to, and that’s 
                        what mattered.

                                 WRINGLEY
                        Apologies, Headmaster Perkins. I 
                        cannot seem to focus on your 
                        illustrious introduction when not 
                        everyone is dressed in accordance 
                        with the St. Midas code. Forgive 
                        me, I find it... disrespectful.

           All eyes shift to John. A chorus of “What is he wearing?” and 
           “Is it a joke?” ripples across the Blazers. 

           Perkins towers over John. Wringley sure he’s off the hook as-

                                 PERKINS
                        My ass already hurts from you 
                        kissing it, Wringley. Let’s not 
                        make it a habit.
                             (then, as he turns to go)
                        And whoever you are, find yourself 
                        a uniform. This isn’t a public 
                        house.

           More snickers around the hall. John goes red in the face.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        It wasn’t the lack of uniform that 
                        embarrassed me. I couldn’t care 
                        less about the uniform. A navy 
                        blazer could be bought and worn and 
                        shed like a snake’s skin. It was 
                        those three little words that 
                        reduced me to a faceless intruder 
                        in a sea of navy blazers: “whoever 
                        you are.”

           INT. ST. MIDAS’ SCHOOL - DORMITORY COMMON ROOM - DAY

           Boys drag their luggage up the stairs. An RA barks orders:

                                 R.A.
                        Room assignments have been made at 
                        random. There is no switching your 
                        assigned room. Any grievances may 
                        be taken up with the house master. 
           John climbs the stairs, pushing through boys greeting each 
           other with a chorus of “how was summer on the Cape?” “London 
           was dreadful,” and other such reviews dripping in privilege.

           INT. ST. MIDAS’ SCHOOL - BEDROOM - DAY

           THUNK. John’s trunk lands at the foot of his bed. Alone for 
           the first time, he surveys this new space. Home away from 
           home. Or a new home entirely.

           Running his hand along the metal frame of the bed. His bed.

           FLASH: Somewhere far from here, a hand plunges into a PILE OF 
           HAY. Stuffing the hay into a sack. Again and again.

                                 WRINGLEY (O.S.)
                        Well this is a disaster isn’t it.

           Back in the BEDROOM, Wringley enters with two other BLAZERS - 
           THE LANCASTER TWINS (think Winklevoss pedigree circa 1924). 

                                 WRINGLEY (CONT'D)
                        Tuition could feed a third world 
                        country but they couldn’t bother to 
                        find a halfway decent mattress.

           John begins to unpack. Wringley and Twins exchange glances.

                                 WRINGLEY (CONT'D)
                        It’s you. Look, I think we maybe 
                        got off on the wrong foot. Charles-

                                 JOHN
                        -Wringley, yes I know who you are.

                                 WRINGLEY
                        You have me at a disadvantage then. 

                                 JOHN
                        I’m John.

                                 WRINGLEY
                             (last name?)
                        John...?
                             (no answer)
                        Right. Well John, it seems there’s 
                        been a mix up. Me and my mates here 
                        were supposed to bunk together. So 
                        if you wouldn’t mind switching with-

                                 JOHN
                        Room assignments are random.
                                 WRINGLEY
                        That’s what they say, yes. But you 
                        see there’s a family tradition 
                        between the Wringleys and 
                        Lancasters. We’ve known each other 
                        since we were in diapers.

           John ignores him and returns to unpacking.

                                 WRINGLEY (CONT'D)
                        Listen, John. You’ll find this 
                        place can be uncomfortable for 
                        people like you.

                                 JOHN
                        People like me?

                                 WRINGLEY
                        Don’t make me say it. It’s rude to 
                        talk about money. 

           The Twins shove John aside, grab his trunk and dump its 
           contents. Books and clothes are strewn everywhere. 

                                 WRINGLEY (CONT'D)
                        Let’s get one thing clear. You KNOW 
                        nothing. You ARE no one. And you 
                        may be here because the scholarship 
                        fund is doing its share of 
                        community service, but you are not 
                        St. Midas material. So if you 
                        insist on sticking around despite 
                        everyone’s wishes, the least you 
                        could do is fall your ass in line.
                             (then)
                        It’s a mess in here. Be a lad and 
                        tidy up before I move in.

           Off John - fuming. Unwilling or unable to fight back.

           INT. ST. MIDAS’ SCHOOL - BEDROOM #2

           John angrily unpacks in his new room. He caved.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        Did you know that some people can’t 
                        smell skunk? It’s true. It’s a 
                        genetic trait. Darwin’s theory of 
                        natural selection tells us that 
                        beings with hereditary traits most 
                        suited to surviving in a certain 
                        environment will persist, while 
                        others will die out.

                        That’s why most people can smell 
                        skunk. From an evolutionary 
                        standpoint, it’s helpful to know if 
                        something smells like a steaming 
                        pile of shit.

           INT. ST. MIDAS’ SCHOOL - DORMITORY COMMON ROOM - DAY

           John descends the stairs. The rhythm of conversation halts as 
           the boys find new topics to discuss. John moves on.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        My first day at St. Midas convinced 
                        me there’s another uncommonly known 
                        genetic trait. One that those with 
                        wealth possess to sniff out those 
                        without it. It’s helpful to know 
                        who can and can’t afford to break 
                        the rules... from an evolutionary 
                        standpoint.

           We REVOLVE around John, spinning out in this new element, the 
           walls of privilege closing in on him. Spinning faster and 
           faster, the Common Room transforms from DAY to NIGHT:

           INT. ST. MIDAS’ SCHOOL - DORMITORY COMMON ROOM - NIGHT

           A phonograph blasts a JAZZ HIP HOP BANGER — a Kendrick-Lamar-
           Meets-Flappers-and-Prohibition-Lose-Your-Mind-and-Make-Bad-
           Decisions Banger. 

           Boys hoot and holler and climb over furniture and dance 
           around the roaring fireplace. Being young and drunk hasn’t 
           changed much in the last hundred years.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        That first night, one of the boys 
                        threw a party. It was against the 
                        rules of curfew... 

           COCAINE on a CALCULUS textbook disappears up a rolled up $50 
           bill. Champagne waterfalls straight from the bottle, missing 
           the boys’ mouths, splashing at John’s feet.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        ...not to mention the rules of 
                        Prohibition. All the while, they 
                        spoke of money. 

           The Lancaster Twins hold court, passing around a cigar box.
                                 LANCASTER 1
                        Fresh off the family farm in Cuba.

                                 LANCASTER 2
                        Is it still called a farm if it’s 
                        over a thousand acres?

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        Then I saw something I’ll never 
                        forget.

           Click. The Twins procure a lighter, but it’s out of fluid.

                                 LANCASTER 1
                        I told you to fill it at home.

                                 LANCASTER 2
                        Well that’s just the bee’s knees.

                                 VOICE (O.C.)
                        I’ll take one of those.

           The circle parts to reveal a BOY (16 and POINTY), draped 
           sideways over an armchair in the corner. He consumes space 
           with a freedom, and quietly sips a tasteful volume of 
           champagne from a glass. Like he wandered into the Moulin 
           Rouge for a casual nightcap.

                                 LANCASTER 1
                        And who are you?

                        Tell you what, I’ll even light it 
                        for you.

                             (glancing at his brother)
                        It’ll cost ya. Five dollars.

           Beat. (This scans to about $50 in today’s currency.) The 
           Lancasters think they have him over a barrel. Then the Pointy 
           Boy removes his wallet. 

                                 POINTY
                        Out of fives, gents.

                                 LANCASTER 2
                        Piss off then. 

                                 POINTY
                        But I’m guessing this will do.

           A $1000 BILL emerges from the Pointy Boy’s wallet. 
           (Roughly $10k today for those of you keeping track at home.) 
           The circle falls silent, and the cigar box finds itself 
           quickly to the Pointy Boy. He picks one, clips the end, wafts 
           the tobacco, removes a lighter and clicks it on.

           The flame dances near the end of the cigar, but he pauses 
           before lighting it.

           THEN-- He then raises the $1000 bill to the flame. 

           TIME SLOWS

           Boys gasp. Watching their profane idol Hard Cash burn.

           We hot box inside our Flapper Kendrick Jazz Banger.

           The Pointy Boy uses the flaming K note to light the cigar. 
           Inhaling deeply. Eyes rolling back in nicotine euphoria.

           Flapper Kendrick scratches to an end. 

           The PERFECTLY CIRCULAR VINYL spins to a stop as it morphs 
           into a PERFECTLY CIRCULAR DILATED PUPIL of John’s eye.

           And we’re back.

                                 POINTY (CONT'D)
                        Well I’m tired.
                             (re: record player)
                        Someone going to flip that over?

           He drops the lighter and the flaming $1000 on the table and 
           disappears up the stairs into the dorms above.

           John and the boys are left mesmerized, watching in silence as 
           the face of Alexander Hamilton goes up in flame.

           INT. ST. MIDAS - VARIOUS

           John snakes through the halls, on a mission. Heads turn. 

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        I didn’t have the luxury of grand 
                        gesture to signal the others to 
                        leave me alone. I needed camouflage 
                        from their prying eyes and sharp 
                        noses that could sniff out poverty 
                        like it was excrement on their 
                        shoes. I had to get my hands on a 
                        blazer. It was more than just dress 
                        code. It was Darwinism. It was 
                        survival.

           He finds his way into the
           BOOKSTORE——

           John stares at a BLAZER on a mannequin. The tag reads $50. 

           FLASH: Cocaine sucked up the $50 bill at last night’s romp.

           Sobering.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        It wouldn’t be easy. But I was 
                        always good at doing the math, and 
                        the math said there was a way. 
                        First I’d need a job. The bookstore 
                        would do fine.

           NOW flying through the HALLS, John wades through BLAZERS. 
           Doing the math. Drowning in navy.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        A blazer cost $50. With minimum 
                        wage at 25 cents an hour, that 
                        meant 200 hours of labor. Factoring 
                        in time for school and part time 10-
                        hour work week, it would be a full 
                        semester before I would hit 200 
                        hours. In the meantime...

           IN THE CAFETERIA——

           John stands in a line of Blazers waiting to be served food. 
           Mind racing. Counting jackets like cards in a deck. 

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        There are 46 boys in my class. Most 
                        boys had two jackets because, 
                        again, most boys had money.
                        So with nearly 80 blazers in play, 
                        half of which laying around any 
                        given time, I could borrow a 
                        different blazer every four days 
                        over a 22 week semester without 
                        borrowing the same one twice.

           John sits with his food at a table. Alone.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        As long as I kept track of whose 
                        coat was whose, by January I would 
                        be the proud owner of my very own 
                        St. Midas Blazer.

           He goes to take a bite WHEN--

           A BLAZER lands on the table in front of him. Just like that.
                                 PERCY
                        It’s a 38 in the chest. Might be a 
                        bit loose in the shoulders, but 
                        you’ll grow into it. Pass the salt.

           PERCY WASHINGTON falls into the chair opposite John. We 
           recognize him as the Pointy Boy by the way he drapes himself 
           over the chair - limbs falling across it - making it his own. 
           He has a way of doing this with the furniture in any room.

                                 JOHN
                        I’m not taking that.

                                 PERCY
                        Don’t be ridiculous. Of course you 
                        are. Salt.

                                 JOHN
                        I don’t need your charity.

                                 PERCY
                        Nor would I give it to you. But I 
                        had an extra. 

           John clocks the fresh price tag still on the jacket. Percy 
           watches him with eye contact that frightens most teen boys.

                                 PERCY  (CONT'D)
                        Two jackets is... excessive, no? 
                        People always want more. They think 
                        more is better. But more means 
                        problems. Hassle. See, if I keep 
                        both jackets I’d feel pressure to 
                        wear both jackets, forcing me to 
                        keep track of which was clean, 
                        which was used, doubling my laundry 
                        load, and inconveniencing me such 
                        that I’d likely never wear the 
                        second blazer at all just to avoid 
                        the fuss. So really, me giving this 
                        to you is an entirely selfish act 
                        to keep my life from slipping into 
                        utter chaos. Pass the salt.

           John considers. LAUGHTER erupts at an adjacent table and he 
           sees they’re looking at him - the butt of another joke.

                                 PERCY (CONT'D)
                             (re: the other boys)
                        Most of them aren’t like that.

                                 JOHN
                        Is that so?
                                 PERCY
                        No. Just wanted to cheer you up. 
                        Most of them are exactly like that.
                             (grabs salt across table)
                        You’re really going to have to get 
                        better at making friends if you 
                        want to survive here.

           Percy unfolds a NEWSPAPER. He talks without looking up. The 
           headline reads “COMMERCIAL AIR TRAVEL, FUTURE OF AVIATION.”

                                 JOHN
                        Are you?

                                 PERCY
                        Am I what?

                                 JOHN
                        Like that?

                                 PERCY
                        Probably.
                             (quoting article)
                        “The Ford Air Transport Service 
                        anticipates commercial passenger 
                        flights will be available to the 
                        American public early next year.” 
                        Christ, what’ll they think of next?

           Percy begins salting his potatoes. Still reading. 

                                 JOHN
                        I’m John.

                                 PERCY
                        John who?

                                 JOHN
                        Unger.

                                 PERCY
                        Gesundheit.
                             (then)
                        Percy Washington.

                                 JOHN
                        Washington. 
                             (joking:)
                        Any relation to George?

                                 PERCY
                        Wouldn’t that be something.
                                 JOHN
                        Why aren’t you sitting with them?

                                 PERCY
                        Perhaps you’re right.

           Percy stops salting, folds the paper, and stands up.

                                 JOHN
                        I didn’t mean... I just assumed you 
                        were also-

                                 PERCY
                        Simple?

                                 JOHN
                        Rich.

           Percy falls into the chair again.

                                 PERCY
                             (royally fucking with him)
                        Wait? Unger! John Unger? Of the 
                        Nantucket Ungers?!

           John smiles: I deserved that. Percy returns a smirk.

                                 PERCY (CONT'D)
                        Where from then?

                                 JOHN
                        Hades.
                             (off Percy’s look)
                        Missouri.

                                 PERCY
                        Pretty hot down there?

                                 JOHN
                        Never ask someone from the South if 
                        “it’s hot down there?”

                                 PERCY
                        I see.

                                 JOHN
                        It’s hot.

                                 PERCY
                        Yes I imagine so.

           THWAP! A piece of bread hits John in the back of the head. 
           Snickers from the Blazers at another table.
                                 PERCY (CONT'D)
                        You know, you’ll never win their 
                        respect if you let them walk all 
                        over you.

           John considers this. He grabs the jacket and goes. 

           Percy tastes his over-salted potatoes. Dissatisfied, he 
           pushes them away. 

           INT. ST. MIDAS’ SCHOOL - BEDROOM

           John wears the BLAZER. Studying himself in a mirror. Hands 
           running over fabric, brass buttons. Foreign textures. 

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        Even with the blazer, the first few 
                        weeks were brutal. Everyone knew 
                        everyone. They grew up playing in 
                        each others’ sandboxes, which in 
                        this case were beach-front Hamptons 
                        homes. The only thing intriguing to 
                        them was the unknown. It was for 
                        this reason that I fully intended 
                        on keeping myself a mystery.

           He drinks in the look. Becoming acquainted with his new self.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        The blazer worked as camouflage. 
                        But what I really needed was armor.

           INT. ST. MIDAS’ SCHOOL - DORMITORY COMMON ROOM

           John glides down the stairs, just starting to blend in. A 
           group of boys crowds around Wringley, reading from a letter.

                                 WRINGLEY
                        “...the whole town of Hades misses 
                        you, my dear John. Just the other 
                        day, Mrs. Dickerson told me her 
                        arthritis makes it impossible to 
                        milk the goat - how she wishes you 
                        were here to help-

           John snatches the letter from Wringley. Fuming.

                                 WRINGLEY (CONT'D)
                        There he is: the goat-milker 
                        himself. Tell us, John Unger, what 
                        else you do to the animal? Anything 
                        special? No need to be ashamed.
                                 JOHN
                        Stay out of my mail.

           As John leaves, Wringley and the boys start BLEATING like 
           goats. Animals that they are.

           EXT. LAKE - CREW BOAT - DAY

                                 COXSWAIN
                        Stroke... Stroke... St-

           Percy and John share a racing shell crew boat. Surrounded by 
           a dozen similar shells. They stroke in unison, directed by a 
           COXSWAIN with a bullhorn. It’s P.E. for the trust fund class.

                                 PERCY
                        I have it on good authority that 
                        you lost your virginity to a goat.
                             (John remains silent)
                        I just have one question: was it 
                        her first time too?
                             (Nothing from John)
                        Or his. I don’t judge. Perkins says 
                        it’s a brave new world.

                                 COXSWAIN
                        Stroke... Stroke...

                                 PERCY
                        Did you at least use protection?

           John’s oars go dead in the water. The boat comes to a stop.

                                 JOHN
                        What are you playing at, Percy?

                                 PERCY
                        What do you mean? I’m asking my 
                        friend about his first whoopee.

                                 JOHN
                        I wouldn’t use that word.

                                 PERCY
                        Whoopee?

                                 JOHN
                        Friend.

                                 PERCY
                        Don’t be absurd, John. Of course 
                        we’re friends.
                                 JOHN
                        Why?
                             (no answer)
                        The first time I saw you, I watched 
                        you set fire to an amount of money 
                        that would feed my family - no, my 
                        whole town - for weeks. Without 
                        blinking an eye. What could you 
                        possibly want from someone like me 
                        other than to mock me? My town. My 
                        life. My name.
                             (then)
                        You see, a friend - where I’m from, 
                        all the way down South, where it is 
                        very, very hot - does not treat his 
                        friends like a joke. I wasn’t born 
                        with a silver spoon in my mouth, so 
                        forgive me as I learn to bear the 
                        taste of metal.

           Beat.

                                 PERCY
                        Have you ever seen a peacock, John?

                                 JOHN
                        A peacock?

                                 PERCY
                        The bird.

                                 JOHN
                        I know what a peacock is.

                                 PERCY
                        So you’re familiar with the concept 
                        of peacocking. Showing a tail full 
                        of vibrant colors, thereby 
                        signaling to all the other peacocks 
                        that ONE: you are readily available 
                        to fuck, and TWO: that you are, 
                        under no circumstances, to be 
                        fucked with.

                                 JOHN
                        Is this a parable?

                                 PERCY
                        Given this is an all-boys school, I 
                        was less concerned with item ONE.

                                 JOHN
                        Can you get to the point.
                                 PERCY
                        It was fake. The bill was fake. 

                                 JOHN
                        You carry around fake money?

                                 PERCY
                        You don’t hear stories of me laying 
                        with barnyard animals do you.
                             (then)
                        You may be from down South where it 
                        is very, very hot. But the heat 
                        didn’t cook your brain. You’re 
                        smart. You don’t need a silver 
                        spoon to understand that it’s sink 
                        or swim out here and you’re going 
                        to need to toughen up and hit back, 
                        or you may as well get out of the 
                        boat and drown now.

                              fallen behind)
                        You two! Front of the pack or it’s 
                        an extra hour on the track.

           Wringley, the Twins and other boys BLEAT like goats up ahead.

           OARS CUT through the water double time. John’s fire is lit.

           INT. ST. MIDAS’ SCHOOL - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           John lies awake, watching a SPIDER spin a web in a moonlit 
           corner of his iron bed frame.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        Percy was right. I needed to fight. 
                        I was so eager to get out of Hades, 
                        I hadn’t considered how to survive 
                        once I did. Again it was Darwinism: 
                        Mock or be mocked. Prank or be 
                        pranked. Kill or be killed. If I 
                        was going to wage war, I needed 
                        reinforcements. And if Percy said 
                        we were friends, I was not in a 
                        position to turn that down. 

           The spider connects a thread, completing another ring of the 
           web. There is much work to be done. John leaps out of bed.
           ELSEWHERE IN THE DORM—— Percy is sleeping. A hand comes down 
           over his mouth. He wakes with a start to find John, signaling 
           to be quiet and follow him. 

           INT. ST. MIDAS’ SCHOOL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           John picks the lock to CLASSROOM 104. Percy appears carrying 
           TWO PAINT CANS. They whisper urgently.

                                 JOHN
                        Got ‘em?

                                 PERCY
                        They really shouldn’t keep the 
                        medical wing unguarded. 
                             (noticing John)
                        Are you picking the lock?

                                 JOHN
                        My uncle is the Hades locksmith.

                                 PERCY
                        Of course he is.

                                 JOHN
                        He says there’s no excuse to be 
                        without a way in.

           CLICK! The lock opens along with the door.

                                 PERCY
                        I think I like this new John Unger.

           As John and Percy enter, we get a good look at those paint 
           cans, and see they’re marked “PETROLEUM JELLY.”

           INT. ST. MIDAS’ SCHOOL - CLASSROOM 104 - THE NEXT MORNING

           All is quiet. We hang in the empty classroom for a beat.

           The bell rings. Blazers file in. The boys stand dutifully 
           beside their desks. No banter. Not a word. Not in this class.

           One of the Lancaster Twins FLIPS A PEN in his hand. His 
           nervous habit becomes our steady metronome while we wait... 

           Flip. Flip.

           John shoots an unsettling smile at Wringley a few desks over.

           Flip. Flip.
           The PEN catches John’s eye. A small DIAMOND inset in its cap 
           catches the light as it flips. John forgets himself.

           Flip. Flip.

           Percy turns to find John’s gaze, but instead catches John in 
           a trance with the diamond on the pen. Clocking it. 

           Flip. Flip.

           The teacher MR. STENSON (52, sharply adverse to tomfoolery) 
           enters and stands beside his desk. 

                                 MR. STENSON
                        Today we continue our work in 
                        chapter three with momentum and 
                        friction coefficients. Sit.

           In unison the entire class sits. Or tries to at least...

           AN ELECTRIC GUITAR SONIC BOOM needle drop leads us into a 
           gorgeous slow motion ballet of commotion:

           - Everyone SLIPS out of their chairs - covered in JELLY.

           - Books and papers take flight. Little DOVES OF ACADEMIA. 

           - Stenson throws out his back, his VERTEBRAE CLICKING in time 
           with the electric guitar. 

           - The Lancaster Twin lands on his pen, IMPALING his hand. 
           Diamond protruding from flesh.

           - Everyone learns a little more about friction coefficients 
           than they had bargained for. 

           - Everyone... EXCEPT WRINGLEY, who remains sitting. 
           Dumbfounded and sitting. His chair NOT jellied.

           Back in REAL TIME, everyone moans on the floor. Someone 
           mentions needing to ring their chiropractor.

           Mr. Stenson notices Wringley as the only unaffected party.

                                 MR. STENSON (CONT'D)
                        Wringley! To the headmaster.

                                 WRINGLEY
                        But, Sir, I have no idea–

                                 MR. STENSON
                        NOW.

           John, milking it on the floor, catches Wringley’s gaze.
                                 WRINGLEY
                             (under breath)
                        You.
                             (then to Stenson)
                        Sir, I know who-

                                 MR. STENSON
                        OUT OF THIS CLASSROOM NOW!

           Percy and John lock eyes. 

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        It was on.

           Our downright raucous ELECTRIC GUITAR kicks back in. 
           Definitely “KIDS” by Sleigh Bells. And we launch into a...

           PRANK MONTAGE SEQUENCE:

           - WRINGLEY steps out of a BATHROOM STALL with a tray of 
           DINING HALL GLASSES - filled with urine. The TWINS top off 
           the piss mimosas with OJ.

           - JOHN & PERCY sit at their regular table, drink from their 
           “OJ,” and spit everywhere. WRINGLEY and Co. cackle nearby.

           - JOHN & PERCY steal BLEACH from a cleaning closet, pouring 
           it into an open shampoo bottle. 

           - WRINGLEY steps out of the shower with BLEACHED HAIR. He 
           wipes the steam off the mirror to witness the crime and 
           yelps. When he raises his hands to his head, we see his 
           UNDERARM HAIR BLEACHED TOO.

           - It’s snowing at St. Midas. WRINGLEY (hair grown out, only 
           the tips bleached) passes a Christmas tree strung with 
           lights. He pauses, an idea brewing.

           - JOHN and PERCY wake up, unable to move. They’ve been tied 
           to their beds by strands of Christmas tree lights.

           - The boys rowing crew on the lake. WRINGLEY leads the pack 
           when he starts taking on water. A number of small holes have 
           been drilled in the bottom of the boat. As he Titanics, he 
           sees PERCY, JOHN on the shore, a POWER DRILL in hand.

           END MONTAGE.

           INT. ST. MIDAS’ SCHOOL - DORMITORY - NIGHT

           John tugs on a TAUT ROPE into the common room. We don’t see 
           what’s on the other end. Percy checks if the coast is clear.
                                 PERCY
                        Where did you even find him?

           John pulls the rope and in walks A GOAT.

                                 JOHN
                        It took me all year to befriend the 
                        livestock manager on the grounds. 
                        And for the record, it’s a “her.”

           Percy glances down at the goat’s FOUR MASSIVE UTTERS.

                                 PERCY
                             (to goat)
                        M’apologies, miss.

                                 GOAT
                        BA-A-A-A-A

                                 PERCY
                        SHH! Quick let’s do this before she 
                        wakes the whole damn house.

           John yanks the Goat through the common room, narrowly 
           avoiding knocking over lamps and chairs on the way.

           The Goat STOPS as they’re halfway up the stairs. John tugs at 
           the rope. No dice.

                                 JOHN
                        Come on. Move.
                             (then to Percy)
                        Well don’t just stand there.

           Percy reluctantly situates himself at the ass end of the Goat 
           and attempts to push her from behind. 

                                 PERCY
                        Go. Stupid beast. Ahh! Ew. What the-

           Nature calls. The Goat takes a sizable DUMP on Percy’s 
           slipper, and continues walking

           UPSTAIRS——

           John and Percy stop outside Wringley’s door.

                                 JOHN
                        Who’s the farm boy now, Wringley?

           They creak open the door to find HEADMASTER PERKINS standing 
           in the threshold, glaring, assuring them that they are in 
           deeper shit than the one currently drying on Percy’s slipper.
           INT. ST. MIDAS’ SCHOOL - KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING

           STEEL WOOL scrapes SCUM off a cast iron skillet.

           John and Percy scrub a mountain of dishes in the early hours.

           John struggles with a particularly nasty bit of grease.

                                 PERCY
                        Eight months is a good run. We 
                        should be proud.

           John is quiet. Percy deals in cheer and silver linings.

                                 PERCY (CONT'D)
                        Most pranksters were caught by the 
                        New Year.

           More silence.

                                 PERCY (CONT'D)
                        You know, in 1818 Ralph Waldo 
                        Emerson was kicked out of Harvard 
                        for starting a food fight. He threw 
                        a piece of buttered toast at a 
                        classmate in jest. Before long, it 
                        graduated to an all out brawl. 
                        Students throwing tea cups, 
                        utensils, chairs, you name it! All 
                        from some buttered toast.

           John attacks the grease.

                        Come now, John. We do a bit of 
                        scrubbing and we’re in the clear. 
                        Suspension isn’t an option for a 
                        first offense. They don’t even 
                        phone your parents. 

           John throws the pan into the sink.

                                 JOHN
                        I don’t care if they phone my 
                        parents! Let them. In fact, I dare 
                        them to. I’d love to see Headmaster 
                        Perkins track down the one phone at 
                        which he could possibly reach James 
                        and Betty Unger. I’d love to see 
                        his face as he’s met with the 
                        dismal greeting on the other end: 
                        “Hades Mining Company.” Maybe he’d 
                        think it was a mistake.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        I can see his smug face as he comes 
                        to terms with just how poor a 
                        student of his beloved St. Midas 
                        actually is. Maybe he’d hang up the 
                        phone out of pity. Let bygones be 
                        bygones. Be a shepherd to the poor, 
                        misguided sheep. Or maybe he’s a 
                        wolf - maybe he’d lunge for the 
                        kill. “This is precisely why St. 
                        Midas only accepts boys of a 
                        certain pedigree,” he’d say. Be 
                        done with me then and there.

           Beat. John starts scrubbing the pan again. 

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        It’s a nice story about Emerson. 
                        But there’s a reason that we’re 
                        down here scrubbing scum off of 
                        pans. It’s the same reason as why 
                        Wringley is upstairs, sound asleep. 
                        It’s all just a matter of dollar 
                        signs and decimal points.

           Percy reaches over and takes the pan from John, running it 
           under SCALDING HOT WATER - steam rising through the slant of 
           morning light before evaporating between them.

                                 PERCY
                        It’s odd, the way they say money 
                        can’t buy happiness. Sometimes I 
                        think just the opposite is true. 
                        That the only way anyone can ever 
                        be truly happy is if they don’t 
                        have to worry about money. But 
                        there are more important things 
                        than happiness, John. Happiness is 
                        a trick of the light. We enjoy it 
                        by squinting at it from a distance. 
                        Because if we ever got too close 
                        for things to come into focus, we’d 
                        realize happiness wasn’t at all 
                        what we thought it would look like.

           The scalding water peels away at the grease.

                        But Resiliency. The ability to put 
                        in elbow grease when the going gets 
                        tough. To be the sheep, alive in 
                        the jaws of the wolf, and carry on. 
                        Now that’s a truly admirable skill.

                        I don’t think Ralph Waldo Emerson 
                        threw a piece of buttered toast. 
                        Harvard expelled the whole 
                        sophomore class that year for acts 
                        of resistance. Ralphie probably had 
                        nothing to do with the fight. But 
                        it makes for a better story when I 
                        tell it that way, don’t you think? 
                        Because Emerson would be Emerson 
                        regardless of Harvard, regardless 
                        of expulsion, regardless of 
                        buttered toast. Emerson was Emerson 
                        because he was better. He was 
                        special. Dollar signs and decimal 
                        points have nothing to do with it.

           At that ‘better’ John glows. Seeing his future. A vision 
           unlocked by Percy’s words - his Kryptonite.

           The grease peels off.

           He raises the steaming cast iron skillet into the light, 
           where the coal black SHIMMERS. A beat. Then:

                                 PERCY (CONT'D)
                        John, have you given much thought 
                        to how you’ll summer? I’ve never 
                        asked anyone before, but if you’d 
                        like, I’d very much enjoy your 
                        company out West with me and my 
                        family.

           John - magnetized - deep in thought.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        How strange it tasted. The word 
                        ‘summer’ as a verb.

                                 JOHN
                        I’ve never been out West before.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. WOODS - MONTANA - DAY

           THE ITALIAN (from the opening) bushwhacks his way through the 
           trees. Scraped, bruised, dragged through hell and back. 

           He fights exhaustion, clutching the DIAMOND BUNDLE - his only 
           salvation. Finally, stumbling upon a vista overlooking 
           THE PROVINCIAL TOWN OF FISH, MONTANA, marked by a prominent 
           CLOCK TOWER at its center.

           Upon spotting civilization, he weeps. Adrenaline amassing.

           EXT. TRAIN PLATFORM - FISH, MONTANA - TICKET WINDOW - DAY

           The Italian appears in the ticket window.

                                 THE ITALIAN
                        One-way to the capital.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. THE GREAT DIVIDE - DAY

           We soar over the GREAT PRAIRIE where it meets the ROCKY 
           MOUNTAINS. The beautiful crux where the tectonic plates of 
           our nation grind together as they do battle. As John fights a 
           battle of his own...

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        Dear Mother and Father,
                        I regret to inform you I will not 
                        be returning to Hades this summer. 

           A GOLDEN EAGLE glides across periwinkle sky. Linen clouds 
           draped over rolling hills as far as the eye can see. 

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        My absence speaks not as a 
                        reflection of you or of Hades, but 
                        rather as a testament to my hard 
                        work this year. For I have been 
                        afforded the opportunity to remain 
                        at St. Midas’ to conduct laboratory 
                        research during these months. 

           A HERD OF BUFFALO sleeps in the tall grass. The wind whispers 
           them a story during their afternoon nap. 

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        I shall write you frequently and do 
                        my best to visit before summer’s 
                        end. In the meantime, I think of 
                        you fondly. Love, John.

           A TRAIN BARRELS through the landscape, upsetting the Buffalo 
           from their slumber.

                                 JOHN (O.S.) (PRELAP)
                        I’ve never seen anything like it.
           INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           John stares wide-eyed out the window, awed by the Rockies. 

           Percy sits opposite, decidedly less impressed. Fiddling with 
           a FLASHY WRISTWATCH - a sizable DIAMOND set in its face.

                                 PERCY
                        I can never remember. Is it an hour 
                        ahead in the springtime or back?

                                 JOHN
                        Are you not seeing this?

                                 PERCY
                        Though you may be the wrong person 
                        to ask. Are they even using the 
                        daylight saving time in Missouri? 
                        They’re using back East, but not 
                        yet in Montana. I think forward, 
                        yes? Fall back. Spring forward.

                                 JOHN
                        Percy, you’re missing it.

                                 PERCY
                        What? The bumps in the ground? 
                        You’ll get used to them.

           John pulls his attention from the landscape, and sees the 
           DIAMOND WATCH. It casts a spell on him. Percy continues to 
           fiddle with the time, never directly addressing John.

                                 JOHN
                        What is that?

                        Unless spring-to-fall is the 
                        daylight saving time, in which case 
                        maybe I don’t change a thing. Are 
                        we saving daylight over summer?

                                 JOHN
                        I’ve never seen you wear that.

                        with an income of over five million 
                        a year. And another two with

           The air is sucked from the compartment. Things have taken a 
           turn for the weird. John is utterly lost. A beat, then-

           HAHAHA! Percy bursts. John, never more relieved for anything 
           in his life, laughs too because it was obviously a joke.
                                 PERCY (CONT'D)
                        Look at you! If you could see 
                        yourself.

                                 JOHN
                        You almost had me.

                                 PERCY
                        Almost. Just a good show, eh Unger? 
                        You should get some sleep.

           John tucks himself into the corner, gazing out the window as 
           the prairie sweeps past him, lulling him to sleep.

           On Percy’s WATCH -- we TIME LAPSE forward. The hands go round 
           and round. The world outside grows darker. As night falls, 
           the hands of the watch begin to GLOW NEON GREEN.

           LATER——

           Percy’s reflection in the window. Where we left him hours 
           ago, though it’s clear he hasn’t slept a wink. 

           He stares intently, unblinkingly, eerily at a sleeping John.

           Ding. A bell sounds throughout the train, waking John. Percy 
           quickly shuts his eyes, then feigns waking.

           John sees PERCY’S WATCH - puzzled by the shade of green. But 
           before he can say anything-

                                 LOUDSPEAKER
                        Next stop: Fish, Montana.

                                 PERCY
                        That’s us.

           EXT. TRAIN PLATFORM - FISH, MONTANA - DUSK

           There are TWO TRAINS at the station, facing opposite ways. 
           A FOOTBRIDGE arcs over the tracks, allowing passengers to 
           cross from one platform to the other.

           John and Percy walk down the platform, luggage in hand, and 
           start over the footbridge as an announcement sounds:

                                 LOUDSPEAKER
                        Train eastbound departs in one 
                        minute from platform B.

           WHEN-- A MAN BARRELS PAST THEM, colliding with John. They 
           both go down. The man looks up and we see it’s THE ITALIAN — 
           still clutching the BUNDLE of treasure-wrapped cloth. 
                                 THE ITALIAN
                        Mi scusa!

                                 PERCY
                        Christ, watch where you’re going!

           The train whistles. The Italian limps away... 

           John stares after him a moment, clocking the limp, the 
           foreign language, the disheveled mess. But before he can 
           think twice about it, the man is gone.

           EXT. FISH, MONTANA - DUSK - CONTINUOUS

           The two boys exit the platform into the dust-trap, ho-dunk, 
           nothing town of Fish, Montana.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        If it weren’t for the last bits of 
                        light peeking over the mountains, I 
                        could have tricked myself into 
                        thinking we got off the train in 
                        Hades. And unimpressive though 
                        Percy’s town was, I felt an odd 
                        kinship with him because of it. 
                        That by some divine kismet, we were 
                        fated to become friends.

           A DRIVER stands aside a HORSE & BUGGY, awaiting the boys.

                                 JOHN
                             (joking)
                        A horse and buggy?! Percy 
                        Washington, I expected a diamond 
                        encrusted Model T.

                                 PERCY
                        I’ll see what I can do. Come on.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL - NIGHT - LATER

           A SERIES OF SHOTS: 

           - The buggy exits town. The clock tower of Fish fading away.

                                 JOHN (O.S.)
                        We’re leaving town?

           - The buggy winds up a mountainside trail. The town gone.
                                 PERCY (O.S.)
                        You didn’t think we were spending 
                        all summer there did you?

           - A GIANT CLIFF with a SHIMMERING WATERFALL. The buggy rides 
           on cliff-side path that winds behind the waterfall.

                                 PERCY (CONT'D)
                        Where we’re going is far more 
                        magical.

           - John peers out the window to see DOZENS OF FISH FALLING IN 
           THE WATERFALL. RAINBOW SCALES FLASH SILVER in the moonlight.

                                 PERCY (CONT'D)
                        There’s a group of trout living in 
                        the headwaters of these mountains. 
                        Every year after they’re born, they 
                        must learn to fight the river’s 
                        current and find refuge in the 
                        still water or else they’re carried 
                        down stream forever. 
                             (re: the cascading fish)
                        Those are the ones that couldn’t 
                        make it.

           - The buggy emerges from behind the waterfall, and continues 
           on. But we linger on the FALLING FISH - gorgeous rainbow 
           prisms. Beautiful little failures, falling, doomed.

           INT. BUGGY - NIGHT - LATER

           The buggy comes to an unexpected stop.

                                 JOHN
                        Are we here?

                                 PERCY
                        Nearly. This way.

           Percy exits the buggy. John follows him to see

           EXT. MOUNTAIN PASS - THE WALL - CONTINUOUS

           A MASSIVE ROCK WALL - an 80 foot high natural cliff face - 
           towers over them. The road simply dead ends into it. 

           John gapes up. Unable to put his finger on exactly what it is 
           about the monolith blockade that makes him feel ill. 

           At the top of the wall sit two industrial CRANE DEVICES. 
           Thick cables dangle from them down to the bottom of the wall-
           Where there sits THE MOST LUXURIOUS AUTOMOBILE that John - or 
           any of us, for that matter - has ever seen.

           DIAMOND gems cover its headlights. GOLD trim frames its long 
           obsidian body. A limo that won the lottery and then some.

                                 PERCY
                        It’s not ALL made of diamond, but 
                        then again, it’s no Model T either. 
                        Shall we?

           A team of SIX MEN are stationed around the crane apparatus, 
           ready to operate what comes next. Percy leads John into the

           INT. LIMO - NIGHT - (INTERCUT)

           The door swings shut on an interior more elegant still. Silk-
           upholstered chairs. Gold fringe carpet. Pillows embroidered 
           in rare gems.

           John keeps his hands in his lap, as if his touch might stain 
           every surface. 

           CLANK! They feel a lurch on the car.

                                 JOHN
                        What’s going on?

                                 PERCY
                        They’re just hooking us in.

                                 JOHN
                        Hooking us in? To what? Who are 
                        those men?

                                 PERCY
                        You ask a great deal of questions, 
                        John Unger.

           OUTSIDE, the men attach the car to the crane cables. One man 
           flips a switch, and the cables pull taut until

           THE LIMO IS HOISTED VERTICALLY INTO THE AIR.

           John gapes out the window at the rock wall, seemingly falling 
           downward as they ascend. Finally, the limo peeks over the top 
           of the wall to reveal

           A MASSIVE VALLEY, BURSTING WITH LIGHT AND COLOR. 
           Soft glowing lamps line a long road that winds through the 
           valley, ending in a MASSIVE CHATEAU - light radiating from 
           every window. A SHIMMERING JEWEL BOX under puffy clouds.
           The stuff of dreams.
                                 PERCY (CONT'D)
                        This is where the United States 
                        ends. You are now on the five 
                        uncharted square miles of America.

           John stares out the window, reflecting The Jewel Box Valley.

                                 JOHN
                             (awestruck)
                        Did they miss it?

           INT/EXT. LIMO / EL DORADO VALLEY - (INTERCUT)

           The limo winds down the road approaching the MASSIVE CHATEAU.

                                 PERCY (O.S.)
                        The first time the government tried 
                        to chart the land, my grandfather 
                        corrupted a State survey department 
                        to stop it. The second time, he had 
                        official U.S. maps tinkered with. 
                        It bought them fifteen more years.

           A ways behind the chateau sits the outline of a MOUNTAIN - 
           the only prominent hill inside the valley. For all the light 
           around the house, the Mountain remains shrouded in darkness. 

           John continues gawking. Percy revels in impressing him.

                                 PERCY (CONT'D)
                        The third time was tricky. Father 
                        fixed the valley into the strongest 
                        magnetic field ever constructed, so 
                        that surveyors’ compasses would 
                        break upon nearing the land.

                                 JOHN
                        And that worked? 

                                 PERCY
                        Bought another ten years. But 
                        technology is getting better. 
                        Transportation more streamlined. 
                        There’s only one thing that poses a 
                        real threat to discovering us now.

                                 JOHN (O.S.)
                        What’s that?

                                 PERCY
                        The future.
                             (a beat. the car stops)
                        Welcome to El Dorado, John.
           The limo sits in front of the CHATEAU - dazzling at arm’s 
           length. A modest Versailles dropped in the Rocky Mountains.

           Percy, John climb the front steps. The doors open, revealing

           MRS. WASHINGTON - you could guess her age, but you’d be 
           wrong. It may be 1925, but money still buys a decade off the 
           face. She balances a tender warmth with a Stepfordy quality 
           that we’ll never quite shake. Never an eyelash out of place.

                                 MRS. WASHINGTON
                        Welcome home, Percy darling!

                                 PERCY
                        Mother.

           Percy steps inside to greet Mother like a good prodigal son. 

           John follows him in and...

           INT. FOYER - CHATEAU - CONTINUOUS

           Boom.

           “SWEET LIFE” by Frank Ocean serves us that delicious, buttery 
           chorus because that’s how it fucking feels inside this foyer.

           A CRYSTAL CHANDELIER showers the white marble floors in a 
           shimmering warmth. A disco ball for the one percent.

           A GRAND STAIRCASE straight ahead is flanked by TWO MASSIVE 
           IVORY TUSKS. Decor to kill for.

           JOHN is overcome with the sensation of bathing in liquid 
           gold. But only for a moment, because we snap back for intros.

                                 PERCY
                        Mother, this is John Unger.

           Mrs. Washington notices John for the first time. She misses a 
           breath - it’s almost nothing. She resets her smile instantly.

                                 MRS. WASHINGTON
                        John Unger. You must be quite 
                        special if Percy’s brought you to 
                        El Dorado.

           As she embraces John, she shoots Percy a weighted look.

                                 JOHN
                             (half-joking)
                        Percy did tell you I was coming, 
                        didn’t he?
                                 MRS. WASHINGTON
                        Of course, dear. I’ve simply had 
                        thing after thing to do, and only 
                        just remembered to make up your 
                        room. How inhospitable of me. 
                             (to the nearest servant)
                        See that the Amethyst room is 
                        prepared for John Unger.
                             (back to the boys)
                        Come. Let’s have a refreshment in 
                        the parlor before supper. Your 
                        father and I must hear all about 
                        your year...

           As they pass through the DINING ROOM in pursuit of beverages, 
           WE LINGER to watch two servants discreetly fetch another 
           chair and place setting for the table.

           The sounds of expensive cutlery PRELAP...

           INT. DINING ROOM - CHATEAU - LATER

           A PORTRAIT OF GEORGE WASHINGTON gazes down at a steaming 
           QUAIL for a beat. 

                                 MAN’S DEEP VOICE (O.S.)
                        Bless us, Oh Lord, and these Thy 
                        gifts which we are about to receive 
                        from Thy bounty through Christ, our 
                        Lord. Amen.

           On amen, GOLDEN UTENSILS pierce the bird. John calibrates 
           himself to the fancy fork and fowl.

                                 MAN’S DEEP VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Do you hunt, John?

                                 PERCY
                        Father, we’ve only just arrived.

                                 MAN’S DEEP VOICE (O.S.)
                        Well that quail you’re eating isn’t 
                        going to kill itself.

           ANGLE ON: A KEY and A CRUCIFIX, hanging around the man’s 
           neck. His face remains hidden.

                                 MRS. WASHINGTON
                        Oh Braddock, let them settle in.

                                 JOHN
                        I’m afraid I won’t be much help.
                                 BRADDOCK
                        Never shot a gun before?

           And with that we get our first angle on Percy’s father. 
           BRADDOCK WASHINGTON (55) holds fire in his chest and 
           brimstone on his tongue. Yet, somehow exudes a coziness.

           But perhaps we don’t feel cozy, because we recognize Braddock 
           as the WHITE HAIRED MAN from the teaser. The one who shot a 
           dog in the head. Perhaps instead, we think... Fuck.

                                 JOHN
                        No, sir. Never even held one.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Then you must learn. It’s a right 
                        of passage in a young man’s life.

                                 MRS. WASHINGTON
                        Let’s dispense with talk of 
                        firearms at the table. 

                                 PERCY
                        Mother despises violence.

           Just then, KISMINE (16) - Percy’s younger sister - whirls 
           into the dining room. Bursting with thought. 

                                 MRS. WASHINGTON
                        You’re late. Didn’t you hear the 
                        dinner bell?

                                 KISMINE
                        I don’t respond well to bells. In 
                        any case, I was dreadfully lost in 
                        my new book. It’s called Mrs. 
                        Dalloway by some Virginia woman 
                        everyone’s talking about.
                             (self-correcting)
                        Sorry. ‘About which everyone is 
                        talking.’ My, that sounds stuffy.
                             (back to business)
                        Mind you, I was convinced it would 
                        be a bore, but everyone who thinks 
                        they’re anyone in New York says 
                        it’s divine. Of course I wouldn’t 
                        know because you hardly let me—

           AHHEM. Mrs. Washington breaks her off. Kismine’s eyes land on 
           John. She panics. Like if a human could glitch. Then resets:
                                 KISMINE (CONT'D)
                        Percy it’s so good having you home. 
                             (to John)
                        I’m Kismine.

                                 JOHN
                        John Unger. 

                                 KISMINE
                        Pleasure to make your acquaintance.
                             (to Percy)
                        I hadn’t any idea you were bringing 
                        a friend this summer.

                                 PERCY
                        We were just telling John he needs 
                        to learn to shoot before the fall.

                                 KISMINE
                        I could show you.

                                 MRS. WASHINGTON
                        You’ll be helping me in the 
                        gardens.

                                 KISMINE
                        It’s 1925, Mother. Girls can be 
                        hunters AND gatherers now. 

                                 MRS. WASHINGTON
                        Oh, my darling girl. What ideas 
                        have these Flappers danced into 
                        your head?

           A phone rings from within the house.

                                 KISMINE
                        Where did you say you were from, 
                        John?

                                 JOHN
                        Hades. Missouri.

                                 KISMINE
                        My! Is it hot enough down there?

           John and Percy share a smile. Kismine clocks it.

                                 KISMINE (CONT'D)
                        What? What is it? Have I said 
                        something?

                                 PERCY
                        Too much, I’m afraid.
           A servant named GYGSUM (60s) enters the room. He holds 
           greater authority than other staff. He whispers to Braddock. 

                                 BRADDOCK
                        You all must excuse me. I need to 
                        take this. 

           Braddock rises from the table and strides out.

                                 KISMINE
                        It’s settled then, John Unger from 
                        Hades. I’ll teach you to shoot.

                                 MRS. WASHINGTON
                        Percy’s been hunting a decade. He’s 
                        more than qualified. And no more 
                        talk of shooting at my table.

                                 KISMINE
                        Mother simply abhors violence.

                                 JOHN
                        So I’ve heard.

           From the other room, we hear Braddock shouting on the phone.

                                 BRADDOCK (O.S.)
                        NO MORE EXCUSES. FIND HIM.

           Everyone at the table pretends as if they’ve heard nothing.

                                 MRS. WASHINGTON
                        You know, they’re saying this will 
                        be the rainiest summer we’ve seen. 
                        Storms almost every day.

                                 PERCY
                        We need not bore John with weather.

                                 JOHN
                        The meal’s lovely, Mrs. Washington.

                                 MRS. WASHINGTON
                        Braddock’s hunt from this morning. 

                                 KISMINE
                        Didn’t you just say no more talk of 
                        shooting?

           John lets out a chuckle. Who is this girl, catching adults in 
           their paradoxes? No one else laughs. John feels self 
           conscious. Kismine feels seen.
                                 MRS. WASHINGTON
                        We’re discussing cuisine, dear. 
                        Perhaps we’ll be eating your quail 
                        by summer’s end, John.

           Braddock reenters, taking his seat. A tense silence.

           In this moment John regards the WATCHES on the wrists of all 
           the Washingtons. Strange and unique, each of them. Not 
           matching, but clearly part of a set. It’s a family thing.

                                 JOHN
                        You must love coming out here. So 
                        quiet. Percy mentioned the land has 
                        never been surveyed.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Oh he did?

                                 PERCY
                        I was telling him all the creative 
                        ways our family has managed to keep 
                        things private.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Things are so fast today. So loud 
                        and free wheeling. The telephone, 
                        the aeroplane. Jazz clubs and 
                        motion pictures, my goodness. 
                        Privacy is an old man’s game. A 
                        slow man’s game. I fear privacy is 
                        an endangered species. 
                             (beat)
                        But we pray. We try and live in the 
                        light. It’s all anyone can do.

                                 KISMINE
                        Oh, Papa. It breaks my heart when 
                        you wax poetic. 

                                 PERCY
                        You sap.

                                 KISMINE
                        Am not!

           Kismine throws a roll at him. 

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Alright! I’m turning in before this 
                        table becomes a true Gomorrah. 
                        Gentlemen, see you in the morning 
                        for the hunt. Kismine my dear, 
                        goodnight.
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)

                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                             (kissing her on the head, 
                              then whispering:)
                        There’s nothing wrong with being a 
                        sap.

           Mrs. Washington melts, watching him love his children. 
           Braddock sends his wife a private wink. Then he’s gone.

                                 MRS. WASHINGTON
                        Dessert anyone? Gygsum, the port. 
                        John has had a long journey.

           Her hospitality unnerves. But John hasn’t a moment to 
           consider it because the room begins to SPIN with cinnamon 
           swirls, aromatic coffees, and ruby ports.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        Perhaps it was the wine talking, 
                        but I had long dreamt of a family 
                        like Percy’s. Where capital and 
                        common decency weren’t mutually 
                        exclusive.

           INT. JOHN’S ROOM - CHATEAU - LATER

           The SPINNING continues as John is dwarfed by a room dipped in 
           soft purples. Consumed by high ceilings and cascading drapes. 

           A MONOLITHIC FOUR POSTER BED - the centerpiece of the room. 
           John runs his hand along the bed. A motion we’ve seen before 
           upon his arrival at St. Midas.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        ...Where it was possible to grow up 
                        with everything in the world, and 
                        not wind up like one of the St. 
                        Midas’ meatheads.

           FLASH: The stack of hay, again. Again, a hand plunging in, 
           grabbing a fistful, and stuffing it in a sack. Again. Again.

           A dizzy, tipsy John falls back onto the bed. Respite at last.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        I had another thought then for the 
                        first time since meeting Percy...

           A KNOCK at the door and Percy peeks his head in just to say: 

                                 PERCY
                        We begin the hunt at eight.
                                 JOHN
                        The bill wasn’t fake.
                             (off Percy’s look)
                        I just realized. The night I first 
                        saw you. When you lit the cigar. 
                        The bill wasn’t fake like you said.

           Percy remains silent. Eyeing John calmly.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        I still don’t see a diamond as big 
                        as the Ritz.

           Beat.

                                 PERCY
                        Eight A.M.

           Percy smiles as we hear the BANG OF A GUNSHOT.

           EXT. WOODS - EL DORADO - THE NEXT DAY

           A QUAIL falls from the sky. The smoke of gunpowder lingers in 
           the morning air.

                                 PERCY
                        Capital shot, father.

                                 BRADDOCK
                             (to John)
                        You’re up, m’boy.

                                 JOHN
                        I really can’t—

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Did Percy tell you the story of how 
                        the Washingtons came to El Dorado?

                                 JOHN
                        No, sir.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        In the wake of the Revolution, my 
                        great, great granddaddy George 
                        started a family.

                                 JOHN
                             (as in...?)
                        George?

           FLASH: The Portrait of GEORGE WASHINGTON stares down upon the 
           dinner table as a fork pierces a quail.
           John looks at Percy. This must be some kind of joke. Except 
           Percy isn’t laughing, and it most certainly is not a joke.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        What the history books won’t tell 
                        you is that after the war, the 
                        Washingtons fell into obscurity. 
                        Worse than obscurity... poverty. On 
                        the brink of ruin, my grandfather 
                        Fitz-Norman Washington was forced 
                        to head West in search of gold. 
                        Eventually he separated from his 
                        scouting party and lost himself in 
                        these woods. For two days he 
                        wandered this valley, growing 
                        hungrier by the hour. Unable to 
                        find a single living thing. As if 
                        something in the land told all 
                        God’s creatures to stay away. On 
                        the third day, Granddaddy Fitz-
                        Norman came upon this mountain.

           He gestures up at the nearby MOUNTAIN. We hang on it.

                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                        By then he lost all will to go on 
                        and collapsed. Ready to die and let 
                        the Washington name forever 
                        extinguish. Only when he fell, it 
                        wasn’t onto a bed of soft leaves as 
                        expected, but instead on hard rock. 
                        Clearing away the leaves, he 
                        discovered something else 
                        entirely... Diamonds. As big as 
                        your fist. A rock bed full of them. 
                        You know what he did next? Starving 
                        Grandaddy Fitz-Norman on the brink 
                        of collapse picked himself up, 
                        stuffed every pocket full of stones 
                        and started walking. In the blink 
                        of an eye, he completely forgot his 
                        appetite and became a millionaire.

           Beat. A small flock of QUAIL bursts from the nearby bushes.

                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                        Sometimes it’s not that we can’t do 
                        something. So much as we haven’t 
                        been provided the right incentive.

           Braddock raises his shotgun directly at John’s heart. 

                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                        Shoot the bird.
           John is petrified.

                                 JOHN
                        What? I—

                                 BRADDOCK
                             (eerie calm)
                        Shoot the bird, or I’ll shoot you.

                                 JOHN
                        Percy!

           Percy stares back, silently.
           Not knowing what else to do, John raises the gun. 
           Birds darting in every direction. Winged blips of chaos.

                                 PERCY
                             (re: the gun position)
                        Higher. Against your shoulder.

           The flock begins clearing out.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Hurry John, before they’re gone.

           John struggles to lock in on one. There are so many.

                                 PERCY
                        Pick one. Make one the target.

           Flapping. Squawking.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Three... Two...

           Braddock COCKS the shotgun.

                                 PERCY
                        John.

           John spots one, locks in, and narrows his gaze.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        One.

           BAM! A shotgun fires as we FLASH TO:

           RAINBOW TROUT SPILLING OVER THE WATERFALL. 
           We linger here for some time, and then we’re BACK with a

           PLOP. A quail falls in a patch of trees ahead of them.
           Braddock nods approvingly, patting John lovingly on the back. 
           His touch puts John ill at ease. Yet John beams with pride, 
           exhilarated by the rush. Hands trembling. 

                                 JOHN
                        That felt... good.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Of course it did, lad. And for the 
                        record, I hadn’t any shells in the 
                        chamber. Go claim your catch. We’ll 
                        see you back up at the house.

           John heads into the woods toward the bird. When he’s gone...

                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                        I like this one.

           EXT. WOODS - MOMENTS LATER

           John searches for his kill.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        It scared me. Braddock pointing a 
                        gun at my beating heart. But I’d be 
                        lying if I said it didn’t make me 
                        feel more alive. To discover in a 
                        moment what I was truly capable of.

           He stumbles into a CLEARING. The quail lies a few paces ahead 
           twitching in the grass. But John barely sees the bird because

           TWO MASSIVE ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUNS stand in the middle of the 
           clearing. A small military bunker attached to them.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        It was the next bit that really 
                        made my heart explode.

           Slowly he inches toward it. He reaches out to touch the gun. 
           Just as he’s about to, A HAND REACHES FOR HIS NECK and—

                                 KISMINE
                        Bang!

           John jumps. Kismine laughs. She’s snuck up behind him.

                                 JOHN
                        Jeeze. Gave me a heart attack.

                                 KISMINE
                        That would be a waste of a heart.
           Chills. John grins a stupid schoolboy grin. And for a moment 
           he forgets the gun and forgets this place and loses himself 
           in her smile. Young love happens hard and all at once.

                                 KISMINE (CONT'D)
                             (re: the gun)
                        It’s just a precaution, you know.

                                 JOHN
                        That’s an awfully big precaution.

                                 KISMINE
                        There are awfully big things to 
                        protect.

                                 JOHN
                        You mean the mountain?

           Her face shifts. Something haunted.

                                 KISMINE
                        So you know?

                                 JOHN
                        It’s a mine. Right? Percy and your 
                        father keep talking about diamonds–

           She relaxes slightly but John is thrown.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        Are you alright?

                                 PERCY (O.S.)
                             (off in the woods)
                        John? You over here?

                                 KISMINE
                             (suddenly frantic)
                        Meet me tomorrow night in the grove 
                        beyond the gardens.

           She runs in the opposite direction and disappears, leaving 
           John alone in the clearing. The QUAIL twitches nearby, 
           fluttering between this life and the next.

                                 PERCY
                        You found our security system.

           John jumps. Percy has emerged into the clearing. 

                                 JOHN
                        It’s for the aeroplanes, isn’t it?
                                 PERCY
                        Ever since the Great War, they’ve 
                        been coming further and further 
                        west. Still, we’ve only had to use 
                        them once or twice.

           Percy spots the twitching quail. He picks it up.

                                 PERCY (CONT'D)
                        The world is changing, John. And we 
                        have to protect ourselves.

           CRACK. He wrings the bird’s neck, tossing it at John’s feet. 

                                 PERCY (CONT'D)
                        Shall we?
                             (walking away)
                        I’m sure you’ll make it a clean 
                        kill next time.

           Off John staring down at the QUAIL’S DEAD EYES. Lucky him.

           INT. FOYER - NIGHT

           The crystal chandelier hangs in silence, keeping watch over 
           the sleeping foyer. 

           John appears from the wing of bedrooms, and softly descends 
           the grand staircase.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        Sneaking out wasn’t hard. I’d long 
                        grown accustomed to moving in a way 
                        that went unnoticed. Nothing here 
                        was different. On my way out, it 
                        struck me how unremarkable the gold 
                        bannisters and ivory tusks and even 
                        the crystal chandelier seemed. All 
                        the things that dazzled upon my 
                        noisy arrival. They were all muted 
                        in the moonlight. I guess luxury 
                        isn’t really built for the quiet.

           He takes extra care to noiselessly click the front door 
           closed behind him on his way out. But as we pull focus to the 
           adjacent lounge, we find Gygsum watching from an armchair.

           EXT. GARDENS - CONTINUOUS

           A FULL MOON peeks out from behind a satin cloud. John moves 
           swiftly past rows upon rows of BLOOD RED ROSES. We linger on 
           a rose as John’s shadow passes over its thorns.
           EXT. FOREST CLEARING - CONTINUOUS

           John emerges in a clearing.

                                 JOHN
                             (whispering)
                        Kismine? Kismine?

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        It occurred to me then that she may 
                        be toying with me. Perhaps she 
                        wouldn’t come at all, and I would 
                        wait in this field all night. But 
                        it was the first time a girl had 
                        asked to meet me anywhere, so I was 
                        willing to risk the loneliness.

           Kismine appears. She awes in the midnight hour. Immediately 
           John gravitates to her necklace: a chain with a single PEARL.

                                 KISMINE
                        I thought you might not come.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        She was toying with me. I liked it.

                                 JOHN
                        No you didn’t.

                                 KISMINE
                        No. I didn’t. I just imagined 
                        that’s the sort of thing people 
                        say. Isn’t it?

                                 JOHN
                        I don’t know. I find people say a 
                        lot of things they wouldn’t back in 
                        Hades.

                                 KISMINE
                        Oh yes. Mother was a little 
                        startled when she heard that you 
                        were from... where you’re from.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        She can’t even say the name.

                                 KISMINE
                             (re: the mountain)
                        Shall we climb it?
           EXT. MOUNTAIN - TRAIL - NIGHT

           They hike a gradual slope. There are no animals around. No 
           sounds of nature. Like perhaps we’re in a vacuum. 

                                 KISMINE
                        Percy and I come here every summer, 
                        but I’m going to school out east in 
                        the fall. Miss Bulge’s School for 
                        Girls, do you know it? I hear it’s 
                        most strict. I hope I fit in.

                                 JOHN
                        I don’t imagine there’s a room you 
                        can’t charm your way through.

           Kismine struggles to take a compliment.

                                 KISMINE
                        Of course, I may only have a year 
                        or so at school anyway. You see, 
                        I’m coming out in London next fall 
                        where I’ll be presented at court.

                                 JOHN
                             (dispirited)
                        Oh.

                                 KISMINE
                        Don’t be like that. It’s a dreadful 
                        bore of a tradition. Not to mention 
                        entirely antiquated. Almost nothing 
                        ever comes of it, romantically. 
                        I’ve been to a million of them and 
                        the only thing you can count on is 
                        washing your hands for hours after 
                        all those strangers have kissed 
                        them.
                             (beat)
                        Goodness, I’ve made things worse 
                        haven’t I?

           John finds comfort in a topic change.

                                 JOHN
                        I like your necklace. 

                                 KISMINE
                        Pearl!

                                 JOHN
                        My mother has earrings like it.
                                 KISMINE
                        Oh! How delightful.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        I could hear her doing the math. 
                        Pearls and Hades didn’t add up.

                                 JOHN
                        They’re not real. 

                                 KISMINE
                        Well that doesn’t matter. A real 
                        pearl is just spit. Truly. I read 
                        it in a marine biology text. When a 
                        parasite latches to the inside of 
                        an oyster, the oyster secretes a 
                        substance that encases the 
                        intruder. So it goes, layer upon 
                        layer until one day, all those 
                        layers have created a pearl. Yet 
                        every year at court, ladies scoff 
                        at each other... trying to pick the 
                        fake pearls out of the crowd, 
                        insisting all along theirs are the 
                        real thing. I always chuckle to 
                        myself at how passionately they 
                        defend the fact that they’re just 
                        dripping in parasites and oyster 
                        spit. 

           John stares at her. A girl not quite what she seems.

                                 KISMINE (CONT'D)
                             (off his look)
                        What?

                                 JOHN
                        You’re much more sophisticated than 
                        I thought you were.

                                 KISMINE
                             (an affected childishness)
                        Am not! I wouldn’t DREAM of being.

           Kismine runs ahead. John gives chase. Clouds grow thicker, 
           ENSHROUDING THE MOON.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN - SUMMIT - CONTINUOUS

           Kismine approaches the SUMMIT, giggling. John and his 
           schoolboy crush in tow. A LARGE CLUMP OF FOLIAGE covering a 
           MOUND sits in the center of the summit. John chases her 
           around it. She coyly avoids him with her playground antics.
                                 JOHN
                        I didn’t realize you called me here 
                        to play a game of tag.

                                 KISMINE
                             (lingering defensiveness)
                        Sophisticated people are so 
                        terribly common, don’t you think? I 
                        mean, take Mother and Father, and 
                        Percy and this whole dreadfully 
                        sophisticated place. Just because 
                        we share genetics doesn’t mean-

                                 JOHN
                        I think you have the spirit for it.

                                 KISMINE
                        I mean, I wouldn’t mind it if I 
                        were but I’m not. I’m very innocent 
                        and girlish. I never even smoke, or 
                        drink. I think sophisticated is the 
                        last thing you can say about me.

           John ducks out of sight on the other side of the shrubs.

                                 KISMINE (CONT'D)
                        Oh no fair! I call foul!

           Kismine reverses direction, runs, and SMACKS into John. She 
           yelps as they collide. The two fall to the ground, laughing. 

           The first time they’ve been this close. The gravity stronger 
           now that they’re caught in each other’s orbit.

                                 JOHN
                        I’d never think you sophisticated 
                        for smoking, or drinking, or any 
                        other treacherous fraternity habit. 

                                                          JOHN (CONT'D)
                          KISMINE
           What is it then? You just met 
           me.
                                              Well— it’s like— the night I 
                                              arrived. You were talking 
                                              about your book.
           You think I’m sophisticated 
           because I read?
                                              No, I wasn’t saying—
           Literacy is a dismally low 
           bar. 
                                              There’s no bar—

           You simply must raise your 
           standards, Mr. Unger.
                                              My standards are perfectly—

           Well what is it?!
                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        You see things. 

           She stops. Listening now. 

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        You see things. And not the version 
                        of things that’s dressed up for 
                        appearances. You see things for 
                        what they’re trying to hide. You 
                        see proper grammar as stuffy, and 
                        polished pearls as oyster spit. I 
                        just never imagined someone like 
                        you existed.

           Something lands in Kismine’s eyes. An expectation subverted. 
           Here. Lying on the ground on the top of a mountain with a boy 
           she only just met. She can’t find the words to respond, and 
           instead, stands and gazes out over the valley in silence.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        Had I offended her? I wasn’t sure. 
                        I was about to apologize, when... 

           The MOON emerges from the clouds and illuminates the valley. 
           There in the dirt, where Kismine had lain, 

           A SPARKLE catches John’s eye. He sweeps away a thin layer of 
           dirt, revealing a SHIMMERING SLAB.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        It couldn’t be...

           Thunder RUMBLES in the distance. Rain starts to fall. 

           Kismine turns to find John looking at the shimmering earth. 
           She grabs him, kicking dirt over the uncovered patch.

                                 KISMINE
                        We should be getting back. It’s not 
                        safe to be up this high.

           INT. FOYER - NIGHT

           Rain is POUNDING now. John and Kismine stumble in, dripping. 
           John starts to climb the stairs.

                                 KISMINE
                        Wait. You haven’t even asked me to 
                        kiss you once. I thought boys 
                        nowadays always did that.

           John’s taken by her frankness.
                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        Boys nowadays did. But I had been 
                        so distracted by what I saw... or 
                        what I thought I saw on the 
                        mountain, that all I could muster 
                        was the embarrassing truth.

                                 JOHN
                        There’s not a lot of that sort of 
                        thing in Hades.

           Kismine melts, then offers her own confession.

                                 KISMINE
                        I’ve never been allowed to see boys 
                        alone. Promise me you won’t spend 
                        all your time here with Percy.

                                 JOHN
                        I shouldn’t get you in trouble.
                             (her face falls)
                        But now it’s all I want to do.

           His eyes find hers. Each moment, building confidence to break 
           the rules. To lean in. To close his eyes. Slowly. Tenderly. 
           Innocently. Awkwardly. Beautifully. 

           The distance between their lips vanishes. And again appears.  

           As they part, Kismine looks over John’s shoulder, where 
           PERCY stands silently in the shadow of the staircase. 

           She gasps, but covers well.

                                 KISMINE
                        I just realized Gygsum will be 
                        making the rounds. You should go. 

           A cloud-nine John disappears up the stairs. 
           Kismine lingers - ready to accept Percy’s chastising. 

                                 PERCY
                        Did you give him the “innocent and 
                        girlish” line?

           INT. JOHN’S ROOM - NIGHT - (INTERCUT)

           John falls onto the bed, swooning with post-date jitters. 

           Through the veiled French doors, he sees a FLASH of light. 
           Perhaps lightning. But the clap of thunder never comes. 
           Instead he sees another flash, and our needle drops to 
           Kanye West’s “ULTRALIGHT BEAM.” Building soft, slow. Poetry. 

           FOYER——

           Kismine transforms from a doe-eyed child into a cultivated 
           adult. She’s been playing us, or John, or both for fools.

                                 KISMINE
                        I don’t need a lecture, Percy.

                                 PERCY
                        Don’t get too attached.

                                 KISMINE
                        It’s just a bit of fun.

                                 PERCY
                        For whom?

           JOHN’S ROOM——

           John reaches the window and falls dumbstruck. Light grows 
           stronger on his face, dancing across his features.

           Kanye: “Deliver us serenity / Deliver us peace / Deliver us 
           loving / We know we need it”

                                 JOHN
                        Oh my god.

           FOYER——

                                 KISMINE
                        Don’t act like this is my fault. 
                        This was your mistake.

                                 PERCY
                        You haven’t the slightest clue what 
                        his life was like.

           JOHN’S ROOM——

           John’s silhouette against the doors - light grows around him.

           Kanye: “I’m tryna keep my faith / But I’m looking for more / 
           Somewhere I can feel safe / And end my holy war”

           John closes his eyes. Then opens them. It can’t be real.

           FOYER——

           Kismine’s eyes well with tears. Voice shaking.
                                 KISMINE
                        Why did you have to bring him!? He 
                        could’ve been happy.

                                 PERCY
                        He is happy. Or didn’t you pay 
                        attention on your midnight tryst?

           She SLAPS him, surprising both of them. She storms upstairs.

           JOHN’S ROOM/BALCONY——

           The doors swing open. Rain showers John as he steps out onto 
           the balcony. Finally we rotate to see what John sees:

           Muddy earth landslides down the mountain, revealing the 
           treasure that’s been buried beneath:

           A DIAMOND AS BIG AS THE MOTHERF$$KING RITZ CARLTON HOTEL.

           Kanye: “We on an ultralight beam / We on an ultralight beam / 
           This is a God dream / This is a God dream / This is 
           everything”

           If we could hear the wind howling it would be deafening. But 
           by now a CHOIR of a hundred voices takes us to church as the 
           moon, the lightning, and seemingly every last spectacle of 
           light refracts throughout the massive diamond and across 
           every raindrop suspended in the air. Tiny prisms casting tiny 
           auroras, and we live inside this kaleidoscope. 

           John laughs, amazed.

           100 Voice Choir: “...Faith / ...More / ...Safe / ...War”

           INT. ATRIUM - THE NEXT MORNING

           A floor-to-ceiling GLASS ATRIUM attached to the kitchen.

           The Washington family and John sit in silence over breakfast.

           Braddock reads a newspaper. If anyone looks closely, the 
           headline reads “U.S. POSTAL SERVICE TO PROVIDE MAIL BY AIR.”

           But neither John nor we are looking, because outside the 
           atrium windows stands THE ENTIRETY OF THE DIAMOND MOUNTAIN 
           glistening in the sober light of morning.

           WORKERS shovel dirt over the treasure, exposed by the storm.

           Kismine sips coffee. Mrs. Washington butters her toast. Percy 
           scoops cereal with a golden spoon. Just another day.
                                 MRS. WASHINGTON
                        John, can you pass the marmalade?

           John doesn’t hear her. He watches the workers. Shoveling dirt 
           over diamond. Camouflaging the impossible.

                                 PERCY
                             (getting his attention)
                        John. The marmalade.

           John snaps out. Percy cracks a grin.

           The SCREECH of a TRAIN WHISTLE PRELAPS...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT - NIGHT

           The Italian sits by a sleeping passenger with a NEWSBOY CAP. 

           A MUSTACHED MAN enters at the front of the compartment, scans 
           the crowd, locks eyes with The Italian. They stare at each 
           other. Just long enough to sense mischief afoot.

           Mustache walks slowly down the aisle and sits a few rows 
           behind The Italian.

           The Italian panics. His eyes land on the sleeping man’s CAP.

                                 LOUDSPEAKER
                        We’ll be arriving in Chicago in ten 
                        minutes. Connections to New York 
                        and Washington DC on platform six.

           INT./EXT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT/STATION - PLATFORM 5 - CHICAGO

           The same train pulls into the station. Passengers unload.

           The Italian stands to exit, wearing the NEWSBOY CAP. He walks 
           away from the Mustached Man, who follows ominously.

           INT. TRAIN STATION - PLATFORM 5 - CONTINUOUS

           The Italian moves briskly down the platform. Mustache hot on 
           his trail, watching the NEWSBOY CAP bob through the crowd.

           Mustache pulls a KNIFE from his sleeve. Closing in. The 
           Italian about to be mincemeat. 

           SHANK! Mustache plunges the knife into the man’s back. People 
           bustle by, distracted as people tend to be. 
           They notice nothing. Mustache embraces the man, as if to help 
           him, to mask his public death.

           As he does, the man’s newsboy cap falls to the ground to 
           reveal he’s NOT THE ITALIAN, instead an innocent bystander. 
           Mustache whips around, searching, abandoning the corpse.

           A woman SCREAMS. The body now drawing eyes.

           ELSEWHERE ON PLATFORM 5——

           The Italian walks away from the crowd. He has REMOVED the 
           newsboy cap, trashing it before boarding another train.

           BANG!

                                                              SMASH TO:

           EXT. EL DORADO - VARIOUS - DAY

           A SERIES OF SHOTS:

           - THE WOODS: John holds a smoking shotgun as a quail drops. 
           Braddock, and Percy look on approvingly. A clean shot.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        A month with the Washingtons and I 
                        was beginning to develop quite a 
                        knack for their hobbies.

           - ROOFTOP DECK: Percy, John, Kismine bask in the sun, 
           reading. Skin everywhere. Mrs. Washington lathers sunblock on 
           Percy’s back. Her diamond rings swirling with greasy lotion.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        We spent the days apricating. Which 
                        was, incidentally, a new word I 
                        learned during my time with the 
                        Washingtons. Apricate. Meaning ‘to 
                        bask in the sun.’ A word I 
                        previously had no use for.

           - THE GARDENS: The trio plays CROQUET. John strikes the ball. 
           It collides with Percy’s ball, which goes flying. As Percy 
           runs off to chase it, John and Kismine steal a brief smooch.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        And then there was Kismine. We 
                        stole our moments as they came. 

           - THE PATIO: Lemonade lands in a crystal goblet. Mrs. 
           Washington pours a round as they all play cards.
                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        Which was hardly ever, because the 
                        Washingtons spent nearly every hour 
                        together as a family.

           John and Kismine lock eyes. Their feet inch toward each other 
           under the table. Braddock and Percy preoccupied with cards. 
           John’s foot reaches for hers. RIGHT as they touch-

                                 BRADDOCK
                             (tossing down his cards)
                        Alright enough games. Senator Roach 
                        arrives soon. Clean yourselves up.

                                 PERCY
                        John can borrow a sport jacket.

           John, stiff upper lip, equal parts grateful and undermined. 

           INT. BATHROOM - DAY

           John soaks amid bubbles in a massive jacuzzi tub, expertly 
           navigating an array of perfumes and soaps around him. A 
           spread that would’ve left him overwhelmed mere weeks ago. 

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        It wasn’t just their hunting and 
                        lawn sports I had adapted to so 
                        easily. It was their way of life. 
                        Of all the tastes in the world, I 
                        thought, luxury is perhaps the 
                        easiest to acquire.

           FLASH: John standing before the mirror in his dingy dorm room 
           at St. Midas, dumbfounded by his newly acquired blazer.

           Out of the tub, a towel-wrapped John combs his hair in the 
           gold-framed mirror. He wields the jewel-encrusted comb 
           masterfully, noticing nothing out of place in his reflection.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        Braddock had invited a Senator from 
                        the capital. I wasn’t told why, but 
                        it was obviously important. Best 
                        behavior was expected. It wouldn’t 
                        have been an issue for John Unger 
                        from Hades.

           Out the window, John observes THE SENATOR stepping out of the 
           diamond limo, Braddock greeting him out front.
           INT. FOYER - DAY

           John - suit, tie, best behavior - descends the staircase, 
           stopping when he hears Braddock’s voice in the next room.

                                 BRADDOCK (O.S.)
                        I can’t thank you enough for your 
                        work on the State Survey 
                        department.

           INT. BRADDOCK’S STUDY - CONTINUOUS (INTERCUT)

           Close on Two Large Diamonds. THEN golden scotch rains down on 
           them, they crack, and we realize they’re just two ice cubes.

           Gygsum hands a whiskey to SENATOR CLAUDIUS ROACH (54) - 
           round, stubby, a Napoleon’s Napoleon. He examines the office: 

           A wall of cabinets displaying shotguns. Taxidermied hunting 
           trophies cover every surface, eavesdropping over them.

                                 CLAUDIUS
                        It wasn’t easy, Mr. Washington, but 
                        Uncle Sam should be out of your 
                        britches as long as Coolidge holds 
                        office.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        I am ever grateful, Claudius. 

                                 CLAUDIUS
                        Be grateful today, but fearful of 
                        tomorrow, Mr. Washington. Hiding 
                        from the map is becoming quite 
                        impossible. The administration 
                        insists you have a contingency.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        The administration? Or the senator 
                        drinking my Macallan single malt?

                                 CLAUDIUS
                        In this instance, there is no 
                        difference between the two.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        I should hope this will ease the 
                        administration’s trouble.

           Braddock opens a DRAWSTRING POUCH sitting on the desk. 
           Claudius softens at the shiny contents of the bag.
                                 CLAUDIUS
                        Jove! I’ll drink to that.

           John creeps closer to the study.

                                 CLAUDIUS (CONT'D)
                        And as for the more pressing matter-

           Claudius waits for Gygsum to leave. He does not.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Gygsum it appears our guest is more 
                        comfortable speaking privately.

                                 GYGSUM
                        Anything for the guest’s comfort.

           As Gygsum leaves the office, a flash of movement stops him...

           BEHIND A PILLAR in the foyer, John holds his breath, doing 
           his best to be invisible. Sweating through his suit.

           Gygsum moves on.

           BACK IN THE OFFICE——

                                 BRADDOCK
                        There’s been an escape.

                                 CLAUDIUS
                        I imagined my first visit to the 
                        property wouldn’t be a social call.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        I couldn’t phone or telegram. Eyes 
                        and ears are everywhere.

                                 CLAUDIUS
                        Precisely why I was unsure if we 
                        could speak in front of the staff.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        We have a unique understanding with 
                        each member under our employment.

                                 CLAUDIUS
                        The escape wasn’t an employee?

                                 BRADDOCK
                        A hiker from Boise on vacation. 
                        Took him two years ago.

           Angle on John. Took him? Two years? What the fuck’s going on?
                                 CLAUDIUS
                        And now you think he’ll talk.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        It wasn’t a particularly warm stay.

                                 CLAUDIUS
                        Who’s to believe him?

                                 BRADDOCK
                        He may have absconded with some... 
                        evidence.

           FOYER——

           John creeps toward the office. A HAND GRABS HIM. It’s Percy.

                                 PERCY
                             (re: suit)
                        I barely recognized you.  

           Percy ushers John into the STUDY, where Claudius swiftly 
           pockets the pouch. Percy towers over Claudius.

                                 CLAUDIUS
                             (embracing Percy)
                        A sycamore! A sycamore, I say. My, 
                        you’ve sprouted. How are you m’boy?

                                 PERCY
                        Healthy and happy, Senator Roach. 

                                 JOHN
                        John Unger. Pleased to meet you, 
                        Senator.

           John extends a hand to shake. Claudius skips a beat, shooting 
           a skeptical look Braddock’s way. Braddock doesn’t flinch.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        And there it was. I noticed that 
                        look when I first arrived at El 
                        Dorado. I figured at some point 
                        over the summer it would go away.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Percy’s friend, here for summer.

                                 CLAUDIUS
                             (shaking hands)
                        Oh. It’s a— Well it’s most, most 
                        wonderful to meet you, John Unger. 
                        Claudius. Claudius Roach.
           EXT. GARDENS - LATER THAT DAY

           Braddock and Percy give Claudius a tour. John follows behind.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        The look stung the same way it did 
                        the first day at St. Midas when 
                        Headmaster Perkins spewed out that 
                        wretched phrase “whoever you are.” 
                        What did he know - Senator Roach? 
                        Nothing, that’s what. Was Senator 
                        Roach hunting quail every morning? 
                        Was Senator Roach eating cereal 
                        with a golden spoon, and taking 
                        baths in exotic oils, and hiking 
                        under the light of the moon on a 
                        mountain made entirely of diamond? 

           Braddock, Claudius, Percy stop ahead. Admiring the mountain. 

                                 CLAUDIUS
                        And what about you John?

                                 CLAUDIUS (CONT'D)
                             (off John’s look)
                        What do you think?
                             (re: the mountain)
                        I was just saying what an oddly 
                        shaped hill it is. Don’t you agree?

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        For the first time in my life I was 
                        beginning to shed the scent of 
                        Hades. I wasn’t about to let 
                        Senator Roach lather it back on.

           John sparks. Those sparks turn to flames. Hubris ablaze.

                                 JOHN
                        “No, Senator, the shape of the 
                        mountain doesn’t appear odd to me. 
                        That’s just the cut of the diamond 
                        I suppose.”

           Beat. Holy shit. That was supposed to be in his head. 
           But John is changing.

                                 PERCY
                             (horrified)
                        I  think what John means to say is—

                                 BRADDOCK
                        EVERYONE, QUIET.
           Braddock stares at John. Unsettlingly. We wait for his 
           retribution for John’s outburst.

           But then his gaze SHIFTS over John’s shoulder, staring 
           directly in to the woods - at what we don’t yet know. But 
           it’s fucking terrifying.

                                 PERCY
                        Father—

           Braddock CLAPS his hand over Percy’s mouth, and continues to 
           stare at something faceless in the woods about to break free. 

           HUMMM. And then we understand Braddock isn’t staring. He’s 
           listening. A distant hum grows louder, and though John may 
           not be familiar with the sound, the rest of us sure are.

           A SINGLE PROPELLER PLANE breaks through the clouds. For a 
           moment, John is in awe of the spectacle. The future in the 
           heavens above. Man among the gods.

           BOOM BOOM. The bellow of an ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUN rocks the scene 
           and suddenly smoke trails from the plane, now descending to 
           El Dorado. Braddock and the others head in its direction.

           EXT. CRASH SITE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           As Braddock and the others emerge from the woods, the PILOT 
           drags himself from smoking rubble, coughing, bleeding.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Who are you? Who sent you?
                             (the Pilot groans)
                        Speak, man!

           Gygsum and two Servants appear, and drag the man to his feet.

                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                             (shaking him)
                        Tell me who sent you here!

           He passes out. Braddock releases him, then spots something in 
           the burning wreckage that stops his breath.

           There in the flames, painted on the airplane’s tail are RED 
           and WHITE STRIPES. A US government plane.

                        Gygsum, see this man is given the 
                        attention he needs. Send Kismine 
                        and Mrs. Washington to the bunker.

           Gygsum and servants drag the man away.

                        Senator, I find it mighty 
                        convenient that on the day of your 
                        arrival we’re graced with visitors 
                        from a government air fleet.

                                 CLAUDIUS
                        I assure you, sir, I have nothing-

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Your assurances don’t concern me. 
                        We’ll know in time. Quickly now... 

           EXT. DIAMOND MOUNTAIN - BASE - DUSK

           Braddock leads them to the base of the Mountain, where he 
           removes a veil of camouflage, revealing an IRON DOOR.

                                 CLAUDIUS
                        Mr. Washington! Where are you 
                        taking us?

                                 BRADDOCK
                        The contingency plan.

           INT. BUNKER - CONTINUOUS

           Braddock, Claudius, Percy, John pour inside a spectacular 
           room. Plush couches, beds, and a small kitchenette complete 
           with just enough appliances to ride out a small apocalypse. 

           A LARGE FISH TANK along one end of the wall.

           But hardly anyone notices the appliances or the fish because 
           the entire room is bathed in a NEON GREEN GLOW. Lining the 
           walls are translucent cylinders filled with liquid radiating 
           that hue of green belonging to the future.

                                 CLAUDIUS
                        What is this?

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Radium.

                                 CLAUDIUS
                        What on Earth—

                                 BRADDOCK
                        A French chemist won the Nobel 
                        Prize at the turn of the century 
                        for isolating the element from 
                        uranium.

                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                        The first synthetic radioactive 
                        element. Immediately we saw 
                        potential for cancer treatment.

           John face to face with the radium. Features ripple with neon.

           FLASH: The same NEON GREEN John saw on Percy’s WATCH.

                                 JOHN
                        It emits the light on its own?

                                 BRADDOCK
                        There was a brief moment when we 
                        thought we could give Edison a run 
                        for his money.

                                 JOHN
                        What happened?

                                 PERCY
                        You may want to back up.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        We’ve identified the most stable 
                        isotope and taken precautions with 
                        storage methods, but the element is 
                        by design... hazardous.

                                 JOHN
                             (lost)
                        It’s beautiful.

                                 PERCY
                        There’s a reason it cures cancer. 
                        Radium deposits in your bones, your 
                        teeth, your marrow. It sits there 
                        and eats you from the inside out.
                        It saves you by killing you.

                                 CLAUDIUS
                        Suicide? How on EARTH is this a 
                        contingency plan?

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Don’t be absurd, Claudius. 

           Braddock holds up the KEY hanging around his neck, gesturing 
           to a PANEL IN THE WALL alongside the radium cylinders. 

                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                        Should the situation become... 
                        unsalvageable, the kill switch is 
                        activated by this key.

                        The radium would compromise the 
                        structural integrity of the 
                        diamond. The mountain would cease 
                        to exist as we know it. 
                             (then)
                        The bunker’s equipped with enough 
                        food, water, and bare necessities 
                        until the damage is contained.

           Claudius gazes over the room, landing on the FISH TANK.

                                 CLAUDIUS
                        A bit more than the “bare 
                        necessities,” don’t you think.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        It’s important to have something to 
                        care for, Claudius. Otherwise life 
                        quickly becomes quite meaningless.

           The bunker door opens and an unraveling Mrs. Washington 
           spills in, sneering at the room. She beelines to the bar 
           cart. Kismine in tow.

                                 MRS. WASHINGTON
                        This green is ghastly. It upsets my 
                        nerves.
                             (then)
                        Are they coming for us, Braddock?

                                 BRADDOCK
                        We don’t know...

                                 PERCY
                        Christ, will someone tell me what’s 
                        going on?

           The Washingtons and Claudius dive into argument, but we lose 
           them and stay with John - mesmerized by the green, the room.

           A delicious needle drop. Something like molasses. A sweet, 
           molasses lullaby. Ella Fitzgerald’s “ROUND MIDNIGHT” will do.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        So this is where billionaires spend 
                        the end of the world.

           Washington WRISTWATCHES glow green in unison. A family thing.

           Distorted reflections dance over steel appliances. Fish swim 
           in neon. A GLOBE sits on a bookshelf - John spins the world 
           around. He stares at an AMBER PAPER WEIGHT beside it.
                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        At St. Midas’ I took a geology 
                        course where we learned about 
                        amber. How sometimes bugs got stuck 
                        in the resin, which then hardened 
                        and set forever.

           Kismine fans herself. At first a vaudevillian act, playing 
           the damsel in distress. But locking eyes with John, her guard 
           drops. Her fan slows. Something real locks in. Genuine fear.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        That’s suddenly how it felt. Like 
                        we were bugs trapped in resin. 
                        Watching the beauty around us 
                        harden into something enchanting. 
                        Something petrified.

           Tensions build under Ella’s molasses lullaby. John observes 
           them all. A fly on the (resin) wall. Watching father and son 
           shouting. Mother drinking. Daughter wilting. 

           Jarringly, suddenly, the music cuts out and we DROP into the 
           argument. Like whiplash. And now we’re floating through the 
           Washingtons in crisis mode. The cracks beginning to show.

                                 PERCY
                        An escape!?

                                 KISMINE
                        What’s happened? Did they find him?

                                 MRS. WASHINGTON
                        We have men on him. They will soon.

                                 PERCY
                        How’d he escape the pit?

                                 BRADDOCK
                             (biting, patronizing)
                        Yes how did he escape the pit?

           Mrs. Washington responds with an icy stare. Then to Percy...

                                 MRS. WASHINGTON
                        One of the men spoke Italian.

                                 PERCY
                             (that’s not a fucking 
                              explanation)
                        And...?

                                 MRS. WASHINGTON
                        Kismine wanted to learn. 
                                 KISMINE
                        Surely you’re not blaming me. 

                                 MRS. WASHINGTON
                        No one’s blaming anyone, dear, 
                        don’t be dramatic.

                                 KISMINE
                        Well it feels as though—

                                 MRS. WASHINGTON
                        So we arranged lessons, and let him 
                        out now and again.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        You. You arranged lessons.

                                 MRS. WASHINGTON
                             (to Kismine)
                        Dear, I misspoke, it appears we are 
                        blaming–

                                 BRADDOCK
                        You think this is funny?

                                 MRS. WASHINGTON
                        For God sakes. The girl has a 
                        coming out party next year. How do 
                        you think it reflects on us if she 
                        hasn’t the slightest ounce of 
                        culture?

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Culture? Look where culture got us.

                                 JOHN
                        Surely you can’t blame her for 
                        wanting to learn?

           A quick beat. Kismine glows - grateful for John coming to her 
           defense. But quickly backpedals to calm Braddock’s temper.

                                 KISMINE
                        Father’s right, I’ve made a mess.

                                 PERCY
                        Why wouldn’t you tell me!?

                                 BRADDOCK
                        You know we can’t risk public 
                        communication.

                                 PERCY
                        A courier then. Something?
                                 BRADDOCK
                        No need to trouble you at school.

                                 MRS. WASHINGTON
                        What would you have done, darling? 

                                 JOHN
                        We saw him. 

                                 BRADDOCK
                        You what?

                                 PERCY
                        John, don’t be ridiculous. You 
                        don’t know what you’re saying.

                                 JOHN
                        We saw him! At the train station in 
                        Fish. We ran into a man who was 
                        frantic and bloody. He said 
                        something in a different language. 
                        Italian maybe.

           Beat. That marinates. Braddock stews - both impressed by 
           John’s attention to detail, and infuriated by his words.

                                 BRADDOCK
                             (looking for verification)
                        Percy?

                                 PERCY
                             (small, reluctant)
                        Well we did see a man–

                                 BRADDOCK
                             (fury simmering)
                        You didn’t think to stop him!?

                                 PERCY
                        How should I have known!?

           Gygsum enters the bunker.

                                 GYGSUM
                        Sir-

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Not now, Gygsum.

                                 GYGSUM
                        But sir, it’s–
                                 BRADDOCK
                             (to Percy)
                        Where was he going?

                                 PERCY
                        He didn’t exactly stop to chat.

                                 CLAUDIUS
                        East or West? Which direction?

                                 JOHN
                        He boarded an eastbound train.

                                 GYGSUM
                        Sir–

           Braddock ROARS, grabbing the nearest object, which in this 
           case happens to be a MEAT FORK on the kitchen counter, and 
           HURLS it at Gygsum, skewering his shoulder. 

           Gygsum pauses. THEN-- like the impeccably trained butler he 
           is, calmly removes the meat fork from his bleeding shoulder.

                                 GYGSUM (CONT'D)
                        No new aeroplanes inbound. None 
                        expected. It appears our new guest 
                        belongs to the U.S. Postal Service - 
                        delivery routes by sky, I’m afraid.

           The others freeze, overcome by an overwhelming, slack-jawed 
           sense of what the fuck? Braddock eerily recalibrates himself.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Apologies, Gygsum. I forgot myself. 
                        My temper got the best of me.

                                 GYGSUM
                             (re: bloody meat fork)
                        I’ll have this rinsed and sanitized 
                        by morning. In the meantime I’ll 
                        replace it with the bronze one from 
                        the guest wing.

           He turns and is gone.

                                 BRADDOCK
                             (calm, cool, cautionary)
                        Senator. You’ve seen your 
                        contingency. I think it’s time you 
                        return to the capital. See that we 
                        find no more aviators in our midst.

           Claudius nods, eager to keep his shoulder free of meat forks. 
                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                        Come with me.
                             (Percy starts after)
                        Not you. John.

           John, terrified but thrilled, follows Braddock out of the 
           bunker. Percy lingers, seething with bitterness.

           EXT. THE PIT - EL DORADO - DUSK

           Braddock and John trek through darkness by the light of a 
           lantern. The dim glow of the chateau fades into the distance. 
           Uneasiness brews as we melt further away from humanity.

           They stop. An EXPANSIVE DIRT STRETCH lies ahead where 
           servants stand guard in a circle, armed with shotguns.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        God blesses each of us with 
                        talents, John. Wouldn’t you say 
                        it’s our responsibility to use 
                        those talents to help others? 

                                 JOHN
                        I should think so.

                                 BRADDOCK
                             (fatherly)
                        You’re a bright young man. From 
                        what Percy tells me, you were quite 
                        cunning at school. I’m having a 
                        problem. I’m hoping you can help.

                                 JOHN
                        I’ll do anything I can, sir.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Good. Do that. Go on then.
                             (re: guards)
                        Don’t mind them. Only a precaution.

           John walks toward the guards, fueled by Braddock’s trust. 

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        It was the first time I felt seen. 
                        Not just by Braddock. But by any 
                        adult. On one hand, I had just 
                        watched the man skewer his employee 
                        like a kebob. But I couldn’t help 
                        feel that I was different. Special. 
                        An answer to a problem.
           As he advances, John sees the guards are standing around a 
           MASSIVE PIT the circumference of a merry-go-round. Iron bars 
           covering the top of it. Beneath them is blackness.

           Braddock steps on a button in the ground and instantly the 
           pit bakes under SHARP FLUORESCENT LIGHT.

           John’s stomach churns at the sight.

                                 JOHN
                        Oh my god.

           TWO DOZEN MEN OCCUPY THE PIT. Most of them dressed in aviator 
           garb. Unshaven, reeking souls reduced to caged animals. They 
           shout up at John: desperate voices, piling over one another.

                                 AVIATORS
                        Hey kid, throw us a rope.../
                        How’s the air up there.../
                        Come down to hell, boy.../

           Braddock joins John at the edge of the pit.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        These are some of the adventurous 
                        mariners who had the misfortune to 
                        discover El Dorado over the years.
                             (then, to the men below:)
                        How’s our new guest?

           Our Pilot trembles in silence. As the shock wears off, it’s 
           replaced by this new nightmare.

                                 AVIATORS
                        Misfortune my ass.../
                        A prison you’re running here...

                                 BRADDOCK
                        As you can see, they’re a raucous 
                        bunch. It’s figuring out what to do 
                        with them that’s getting me.

                                 JOHN
                        I don’t understand why you need me.

                                 AVIATORS
                        To slit your throat.../
                        He’ll take you too...

                                 BRADDOCK
                             (to Aviators)
                        That’s quite enough, lads. Now I’ve 
                        told you the situation. I don't 
                        want you here.

                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                        I wish to heaven I'd never seen 
                        you. That you’d never seen our 
                        crown jewel. But your own curiosity 
                        got you here. Any time that you can 
                        think of a way out which protects 
                        me and my interests, I'll be glad 
                        to consider it.

           One of the aviators, MARCUS (30s), moves forward.

                                 MARCUS
                        Let me ask you a question. You 
                        pretend to be a fair-minded man?

                                 BRADDOCK
                        How could a man in my position 
                        possibly be fair-minded toward you?

                                 MARCUS
                        Fine then. We’ve argued this out 
                        before, and you’re not fair-minded-

           Marcus begins to crack. Hysteria and despair oozing out.

                                 MARCUS (CONT'D)
                        But you are human. You must be able 
                        to put yourself in our place long 
                        enough to see how— how— unnecessary-

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Not to me.

                                 MARCUS
                        How cruel then.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Cruelty doesn’t exist where self-
                        preservation is involved. You’re a 
                        soldier. You know that.

                                 MARCUS
                        Fine, then how stupid—

                                 BRADDOCK
                        There. I grant you that. But try to 
                        think of an alternative. I'd have 
                        any of you painlessly executed if 
                        you wish. I've offered to have your 
                        wives, sweethearts, children, and 
                        mothers kidnapped and brought here. 
                        I'll enlarge your pit and feed and 
                        clothe you the rest of your lives.

                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                        If there were some method of 
                        inducing permanent amnesia I'd have 
                        all of you operated on and released 
                        immediately. But that's as far as 
                        my ideas go. So tell me, gentlemen, 
                        what am I supposed to do?

           Marcus on the verge of tears, pleading for his life back.

                                 MARCUS
                        Trust us. We won’t rat.

           A beat. For a moment, we think he might consider this option.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        You don’t proffer that suggestion 
                        seriously. I did trust you. I took 
                        one of you out to teach my daughter 
                        Italian, and last month he got 
                        away. Ran the moment he could.

           A burst of whoops and hollers from the men below.

                                 AVIATORS
                        Thank God.../
                        We’re saved.../
                        I’ll teach your daughter Chinese.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Such a shame that he was stabbed 
                        dead in the Chicago train station.

           The whooping dies. Marcus climbs the ladder on the side of 
           the pit till he reaches the bars at the top.

                                 MARCUS
                             (his final plea)
                        She’s eight years old. June 25th. 
                        I’ve been counting the days. 
                        Today’s June 25, yes? That’s when 
                        my little girl turns eight. She 
                        hasn’t seen her father in nine 
                        months. Can you fathom it? Not 
                        holding your baby girl for nine 
                        months? Please. Please. Let me go.

           Braddock crouches by the bars. His face shifts. Real empathy.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        What’s her name?

                                 MARCUS
                        Janie.
                                 BRADDOCK
                        Janie.

                                 MARCUS
                             (you understand)
                        Yes.

                                 BRADDOCK
                             (leaning in, whispering)
                        If you worried so much about caring 
                        for Janie back home, you'd never 
                        have left her to take up aviation.
                             (standing to leave)
                        June 25th was a week ago.

           Braddock turns to John.

                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                        As you can see, we have quite the 
                        conundrum on our hands. Think on 
                        it, will you, boy?

           The Aviators’ shouts and curses chase Braddock, walking away. 
           Gygsum joins him to deliver news:

                                 GYGSUM
                        Sir, our man failed at the train 
                        station. Hit a civilian instead.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Double the sentry watch. Load the 
                        guns. We must be prepared.

           Braddock notices Gygsum still bleeding from the shoulder.

                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                        And get that looked at.

           John lingers at the edge of the pit. Frozen. Staring down. He 
           locks eyes with Marcus - finally drained of hope.

           EXT. CHATEAU - FRONT STEPS - LATER

           JOHN’S EYES replace GW’s eyes. He staggers through the night. 
           The reality of what he saw sinking in. He collapses on the 
           steps, nauseous, fighting to breathe. Insides revolting.
                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        Every year on Christmas, my mother 
                        made a pork roast. She baked it on 
                        low heat over hours to make it 
                        extra soft. Fall-off-the-bone 
                        tender, she called it. I couldn’t 
                        stop thinking about the men. Baking 
                        slowly under the fluorescents like 
                        a pork loin until they were soft 
                        enough to just...fall off the bone. 

           SHARP FLASH: Fluorescent lights. Iron bars. Agony.

           INT. KISMINE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           THEN-- Candlelight. Smooth skin. Tranquility.

           Kismine sits at her vanity, removing makeup. Something 
           saddens her, but she refuses to cry. 

           She adjusts the mirror, revealing John standing at her door.

                                 JOHN
                        Did you know?

                                 KISMINE
                        John, thank God! Did he hurt you?

                                 JOHN
                        Did you know?

                                 KISMINE
                        What are you talking about?

                                 JOHN
                        Did you know that, while you’re 
                        daydreaming in fields and playing 
                        croquet and sipping lemonade on the 
                        terrace, half a mile away a dozen 
                        men are rotting in the ground?
                             (no response)
                        They’re people, Kismine! They’re 
                        people with families. With lives. 
                        How can you be a part of that?

                                 KISMINE
                        It’s more complicated than that.

                                 JOHN
                        Why? Because of a diamond? A rock?

                                 KISMINE
                        Because I don’t have a choice!
           Beat.

                                 KISMINE (CONT'D)
                        You see how they look at me. How 
                        they treat me. How they dismiss and 
                        condescend my every thought. As a 
                        daydream. A fantasy. I’m a daughter 
                        of Washingtons. I’m expected to 
                        dress in pretty dresses, drape 
                        myself in pretty jewels, speak in 
                        pretty tones, smile pretty smiles, 
                        think pretty thoughts, dream pretty 
                        dreams, and bite my pretty little 
                        tongue. And a year from now, when 
                        they present me at court, I’ll be 
                        expected to make a pretty match to 
                        preserve the stability of the 
                        sterling Washington name. I am a 
                        show pony trapped in a pretty 
                        stable. So don’t scold me for being 
                        “a part of” anything. The only 
                        thing I’m guilty of is being the 
                        only Washington with a conscience. 

           Holy shit. John softens. Her guard is still up. A soldier.

                                 JOHN
                        I had no idea you felt that way.

                                 KISMINE
                        It’s why I lose myself in fiction. 
                        In anything that transports me even 
                        the tiniest distance from this 
                        place. Why I lost myself in you. 
                        All summer, you’ve been trying so 
                        hard to fit in here. And the thing 
                        that makes you so wonderful, John, 
                        is that you don’t. You never will. 

           John wilts inside. The life drained from his heart.

           Kismine returns to her vanity. Removing the rest of her 
           makeup. John goes. When she sees he’s gone, then she cries.

           INT. JOHN’S ROOM - NIGHT

           John lies in bed awake, staring up. Staring for an eternity.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        You can’t pick your family. It was 
                        as true for her as it was for me. 
                        For the first time, I thought of 
                        Hades. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOHN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                                 JOHN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I thought of Hades with some 
                        fondness. I thought of it the way 
                        people think about home.

           John BOLTS up and across the room to a desk, where pen and 
           blank paper sit. Shaming him. He begins to write.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        Dear Mother and Father,
                        I’m ashamed to inform you I have 
                        not been at St. Midas’ this summer-

           A slow fade to black - watching John write in a very small 
           corner of a very large room.

           INT. JOHN’S ROOM - MORNING

           A soft HISS brings us back and we fade in on

           Percy’s face, softer than we’ve ever seen it. He studies 
           something off screen for some time. Languish in his eyes,

           Watching John asleep at the desk across the room.

           The HISS continues. Percy grins. And finally we see why...

           A SPARK climbs down the wick of a SMALL STICK OF DYNAMITE, 
           sitting mere feet from John. About to blow him apart. The 
           spark reaches the end of the wick and SNAP, CRACKLE, POP! We 
           realize the dynamite was only a FIREWORK. 

           John startles awake, falling out of his chair, and scurrying 
           away from the attack. Percy giggles. It’s the simple things.

                                 PERCY
                        Good, you’re up. 

                                 JOHN
                        Jesus!

                                 PERCY
                        Jolly Independence Day.

           Percy’s smile fades as he regards JOHN’S LETTER on the desk.

                                 JOHN
                        I wasn’t going to say anything 
                        about- here. About the- ... I only 
                        wanted to let them know I’m okay.
                             (then)
                        And about last night, I didn’t mean 
                        to undermine you with your father.
           Beat. A rare tenderness from Percy.

                                 PERCY
                        You asked so many questions. You 
                        never asked why I brought you here.
                             (then)
                        Sometimes I forget the weight of 
                        this place is hard to bear. It’s 
                        not really fair that I thrust that 
                        on you without asking, is it. If 
                        it’s too heavy I won’t take offense 
                        if you’d like to leave. We can pick 
                        up in the fall back at St. Midas.

           A cloud of gunpowder hangs in the air between them.

           John hesitates. Kismine’s words last night echo in his head: 
           You’ve been trying so hard to fit in here... You never will. 
           He looks as though he’s about to accept Percy’s offer.

                                 PERCY (CONT'D)
                        But before you decide, you should 
                        know... it’s a rare thing when you 
                        recognize your own kind. I brought 
                        you here because you know what it 
                        is to sacrifice. To give up a part 
                        of yourself for something higher. 
                        You have perspective, John Unger 
                        from Hades. Perspective is scarce.
                             (then)
                        If you do go, take a little of El 
                        Dorado with you.

           Percy removes his WATCH, placing it in front of John.

                                 PERCY (CONT'D)
                        It’s a family thing. 

           Percy starts to leave. John stares at the watch.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        Percy was right. This brave new 
                        world was full of color. Trying to 
                        see it in black and white was short 
                        sighted. And not how great men 
                        become great.

           At the threshold, Percy’s stopped by the SOUND OF PAPER 
           RIPPING. Turning to find John - TEARING UP THE LETTER, 
           leaving it in the trash.

                                 PERCY
                             (glowing)
                        Let’s remember how to have some fun-
           EXT. LAWN - AFTERNOON

           A DRUM thumps. A HORN SECTION blares. Something festive, 
           though we don’t recognize it yet...

           We live in a PATRIOTIC PASTEL KALEIDOSCOPE. Muted reds, 
           whites, and blues swirl together. Willy Wonka spends the 
           Fourth here with the Easter Bunny.

           A HEAVILY JEWELED hand hovers over the colors - or what we 
           now see is a crystal bowl full of SALTWATER TAFFY. 

           The hand of Mrs. Washington, sitting aside Braddock, reclined 
           on lawn chairs, dressed head-to-toe in chic Americana.

           A beat on these American Royals. They fucking apricate in 
           their empire. Servants on the HORNS and DRUM behind them. 

           THEN-- the taffy bowl begins to VIBRATE, just as we recognize 
           the festive ditty as

           “BAD BLOOD” by that All-American Disciple Taylor Swift. 
           No lyrics. All horns and snare drum, baby. Oh yeah.

           Those vibrations turn into an earsplitting-

           EXT. FIELDS / LIMO CAR - SAME TIME - (INTERCUT)

           VROOM, VROOM!

           TWO DIAMOND-ENCRUSTED LIMO CARS tear through the fields of El 
           Dorado. American flags affixed to both. Ah, patriotism!

           John at the wheel of one, wearing his new WASHINGTON WATCH. 
           Percy driving the other with Kismine riding shotgun. 

           A 1920s BILLIONAIRE NASCAR FIASCO: the cars launch over a 
           hill. Swerving dangerously. Testosterone fun and games.

           John cuts Percy off.

                                 PERCY
                        That all you got, John Unger?

           INTERCUT WITH BRADDOCK & MRS. WASHINGTON——

           Their conversation interrupted by SHARP FLASHES to the race.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        He’s certainly controllable.

           Percy FLOORS the gas from behind John. His limo BUMPING the 
           rear end of John’s. A love tap. Kismine grows uneasy. 
                                 MRS. WASHINGTON
                        And what of his pedigree?

           John lurches forward, bumped HARDER from behind.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        People don’t know who they don’t 
                        know. We can give him a story.

           Percy RAMS his car again into John’s. This game of Nascar 
           suddenly feeling more Mad Max.

                                 KISMINE
                        That’s enough, Percy. 

           John stomps pedal to the metal to put distance between them. 

                                 PERCY
                        What’s a matter? Not like the 
                        ending to your love stories?

           John, hauling bonafide ass now, spots a SHARP CURVE up ahead. 
           Beyond it, ROCKS. He needs to slow down, but there’s no time.

           The Horns and Drum thumping.

                                 MRS. WASHINGTON
                        Very well. Let’s proceed.

           John races around the CURVE. His car TILTS onto two wheels.

           Percy LOCKS IN. Full speed ahead. He’s going to ram the 
           exposed underbelly of John’s car, WHEN--

           Kismine YANKS the steering wheel, forcing Percy to SLAM on 
           the brakes, as they SPIN OUT.

           John leans hard into the turn to LAND on all four wheels. The 
           two cars come to a stop. Kismine rushes to John’s car.

                                 KISMINE
                        John! Are you okay? Are you hurt?

           John emerges, shaken but fine. Kismine wraps him in her arms.

                                 KISMINE (CONT'D)
                        I’m so sorry, John. I’m sorry, I-

                                 JOHN
                        I’m alright. It’s okay.

           As she holds him, it’s clear she’s not just talking about the 
           cars. 
           That her apologies extend to her comments the night before, 
           and more troublingly, what lies ahead. That, for better or 
           worse, she now cares deeply for John.

                                 PERCY
                             (cheery, psycho)
                        Capital racing, John! A worthy 
                        competitor any time.
                             (re: cars)
                        Come now, let’s get these old 
                        horses back to the stable.

           INT. FOYER - CHATEAU - EVENING

           John, Percy, Kismine slink in after their day. Percy and 
           Kismine start up the stairs. John lingers, drained, WHEN--

                                 BRADDOCK (O.S.)
                        John. 

           He stops. Chilled by the voice. Kismine, Percy have 
           disappeared upstairs. His buffers gone. John inches toward-

           INT. BRADDOCK’S STUDY - CONTINUOUS

           Braddock gazes into the fire, glass in hand. Shadows and 
           scotch sedate him. When John appears behind him, he hardly 
           breaks his gaze from the flames.

                                 JOHN
                        Mr. Washington?

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Braddock. It’s Braddock by now. 
                        You’ve been here long enough, 
                        wouldn’t you say?

                                 JOHN
                        Braddock.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        You a religious man, John?

                                 JOHN
                        We went to church.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Do you know why God’s disciples 
                        sacrificed animals?
                             (John doesn’t respond)
                        Most people think it was to cleanse 
                        their sins, but that’s not it.

                        They did it because they had to. 
                        For Him to save them - as only He 
                        could - it was worth the most 
                        precious gift given in His honor - 
                        life.
                             (beat)
                        You know I must protect them.

           John remains skeptical. Which them?

                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                        The diamonds. You know it all must 
                        remain a secret.

                                 JOHN
                        I’m not sure it’s my place to say.

           Braddock finally turns, meeting John’s gaze.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        What you saw last night. What you 
                        see every day here in El Dorado. I 
                        think you’d agree it’s a unique 
                        place. And a unique place requires 
                        unique rules. Rules that, if 
                        necessary, break the laws of men.

           BRADDOCK’S MONOLOGUE CONTINUES UNDER AS WE INTERCUT WITH:

           EXT. WASHINGTON DC - DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - DUSK (INTERCUT)

           THE ITALIAN - ruined by his trek across the nation - stumbles 
           up the steps of a building labeled “DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.”

           He pauses to absorb the majesty of the MALL. Fireworks 
           EXPLODE overhead, showering the sky in patriotic hues.

                                 BRADDOCK (O.S.)
                        But here, we cannot be men, John. 
                        Because men are weak. Men succumb 
                        to power. Greed. Emotion. And so we 
                        have no choice. We must not be men 
                        here, but patriots.

           The Italian holds the BUNDLE close and barges inside.

           INT. D.C. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           A door reading “US ATTORNEY GENERAL” opens to reveal the MAN 
           at his desk. The Italian stumbles in - begging for help.
                                 BRADDOCK (O.S.)
                        By God’s will, we built this 
                        country. God chose the Washingtons 
                        to birth this nation. He chose us 
                        again with El Dorado.

           A bothered Attorney General calls for his guards, who drag 
           the Italian toward the door.

                                 BRADDOCK (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        And with the help of God, we have 
                        been able to protect it from its 
                        own undoing. To carry the burden on 
                        the shoulders of the Washington 
                        family of the secret that would 
                        change the world.

           As he’s being dragged out, The Italian drops the BUNDLE from 
           his grasp, and the FIST-SIZED DIAMOND rolls out.

                                 BRADDOCK (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        If the government discovers El 
                        Dorado, John... it is the end.

                                 JOHN (O.S.)
                        Of what?

           The AG and Guards see the diamond, gaping in disbelief...

                                                          SLAM BACK TO:

           INT. BRADDOCK’S STUDY

           Braddock gazes at John across the fire-lit study. Duty, 
           Prestige, Glory ignite in his eyes. A man consumed by legacy.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Everything. They will seize it all. 
                        Repossess the land to prevent a mad 
                        rush from the east.

                                 JOHN
                        And if they fail?

                                 BRADDOCK
                        WHEN they fail... There isn’t 
                        enough gold in the world to offset 
                        the value of El Dorado. The market 
                        will collapse. Economies will 
                        disintegrate. Society will crumble.

                                 JOHN
                        You can’t let them go. Those men.
           Braddock nods. The weight of his burden slightly lighter.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        We have a deal with God, John. God 
                        forgives all sins. Even the ones we 
                        can’t forgive in ourselves. Which 
                        is why we must sacrifice even the 
                        most precious of our ideals to 
                        protect what He has given us. If we 
                        are to live in a society where all 
                        men are free, then some of us 
                        cannot be. That is patriotism.

           John feels the burden now. Processing. Making peace with it.

           Braddock closes his eyes, gripping his CRUCIFIX. His other 
           hand TIGHTENS around the scotch. His lips begin to TWITCH.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        At first, I thought he meant the 
                        men in the pit - those unable to be 
                        free. But as he sat there...

           No. Not twitching. PRAYING. Conversing with their maker.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        ...it became clear that he meant he 
                        himself - Braddock - was not free. 
                        That the whole Washington family 
                        was held captive by their secret.

           Braddock’s GRIP on the glass tightens. Ice cubes vibrating.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        ...and that the cost of keeping it 
                        was taking its toll.

           THE GLASS SHATTERS in Braddock’s hands, drawing blood.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Damn clumsy old man!

                                 JOHN
                        Here, let me help.

           John begins picking up glass. Braddock eases in:

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Kismine is coming of age next fall. 
                        As is customary for young people in 
                        our circles, she’s to be presented 
                        at court. But as I see it, coming 
                        out parties are a noisy business. 
                        Fanfare, press. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                        And even when it’s all said and 
                        done, a proper pairing is rarely 
                        achieved. You never really know who 
                        you can trust. 

           At that ‘trust’ - the hairs on John’s neck stand on end. He 
           suddenly feels his proximity to a beast.

                                 JOHN
                             (diffusing)
                        She’s very outgoing, I’m sure 
                        she’ll excel.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        All the same, I should think it 
                        cleaner if the whole thing were 
                        orchestrated out of the public eye.
                             (then)
                        You and Kismine have become quite 
                        close over the past few months. 

           BEAT. John holds a handful of glass shards. Braddock’s blood 
           drips onto the floor.

                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                        You might consider the future of 
                        that closeness... if you really 
                        want to help.

                                 JOHN 
                             (re: blood)
                        I should get a bandage for that.

                                 BRADDOCK
                             (on John’s way out)  
                        I knew you’d understand, John. 

           EXT. GARDENS - NIGHT

           SPARKLERS dance through the rose gardens. Trails of light 
           ghost across petals and thorns. Kismine and Percy chase each 
           other with the flaming wands - children once again. John 
           halfheartedly joins, lost in thought.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        A week ago, I would’ve felt 
                        flattered if Braddock offered me a 
                        spot in the family. But now I knew 
                        it wasn’t an offer. It was a trap.

           A SPARKLER flashes before John’s eyes. Little flickers of 
           freedom - John’s freedom - spark, fade, and die in moments.
                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        Braddock knew that Kismine wouldn’t 
                        stand to be a prize up for auction. 
                        Which meant I had to lie. If she 
                        ever knew about this conversation, 
                        she’d want nothing to do with me. 
                        And I would become expendable.

           Mrs. Washington and Braddock - hand now bandaged - emerge to 
           watch their children play. Braddock locks eyes with John.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        I was an animal. Trapped in 
                        paradise. 

           John feigns a smile back - his best defense.

           EXT. ROOFTOP - ANOTHER DAY

           Mrs. Washington apricates on the roof. Ornate, bejeweled sun 
           glasses consume her face. Like some expensive big-eyed bug.

           A MOSQUITO lands on her arm. It begins to suck her blood.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        I was always good at doing the 
                        math. But this time the math wasn’t 
                        hard. Anything less than full 
                        cooperation with the Washingtons 
                        and I’d end up in that pit.

           Braddock stands at the railing of the roof, staring down at 
           the lawn below where Percy and John play croquet.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        I needed a way out. I needed to 
                        run. The problem was...

           The MOSQUITO continues to suck her blood, WHEN-- Mrs. 
           Washington flexes her bicep, TRAPPING the mosquito’s stinger 
           in her muscle. Blood continues to flow, unable to pull away, 
           the mosquito balloons with blood until it POPS on Mrs. 
           Washington’s arm. She smiles, satisfied.

           ON THE LAWN BELOW——

           John steals a glance at the roof. Braddock stares back.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        ...they were always watching.
           EXT. THE GROVE - ANOTHER MORNING

           John, Kismine lay in the grass exchanging kisses. Kismine 
           lost in a daydream. John floats a world away with each kiss.

                                 JOHN
                        Last night I had a dream. It’s our 
                        wedding day. Everyone we know is 
                        there. Even my parents, all the way 
                        from Hades. The string quartet 
                        begins to play, and the pastor 
                        begins to read, and everyone begins 
                        to weep. Even your father. Then I 
                        notice neither of us is actually 
                        there. I’ve never had a dream I 
                        don’t appear in. But here I am, 
                        watching a church full of folks who 
                        turned up for us and we’re nowhere 
                        to be found. And the strangest 
                        thing is, no one seems to notice. 
                        The quartet just keeps playing, the 
                        pastor keeps reading, the guests 
                        keep weeping...

           A beat.

                                 KISMINE
                        I don’t think I would care if we 
                        disappeared. So long as we did it 
                        together.
                             (then)
                        I think I’m sure I love you.

                                 JOHN
                        Let’s go.
                             (off her look)
                        I’m serious. Let’s do it. Let’s go.

                                 KISMINE
                        It was only a dream, John.

           She is quiet.

                                 JOHN
                        I am sure, Kismine. I do love you. 
                        And I hate seeing you like this.

                                 KISMINE
                        I can’t leave them.

                                 JOHN
                        The other night you said you feel 
                        trapped. This is a chance to escape 
                        all of that. Don’t you want that?
                                 KISMINE
                        Family is not something I want to 
                        escape, John.

                                 JOHN
                        So instead you’re just going to sit 
                        here while they turn you into one 
                        of them? You’re just going to do 
                        nothing?

                                 KISMINE
                             (loaded)
                        You don’t know what I’ve done.

                                 JOHN
                        From the diamonds around your neck, 
                        I’m guessing it wasn’t so radical.

           That stings. She lashes out, quick and hard.

                                 KISMINE
                        I won’t apologize for loving them. 
                        Though I wouldn’t expect you to 
                        understand. GOD, WHY CAN’T YOU BE 
                        MORE LIKE THE OTHERS?!

           She tries to swallow the words, but it’s too late. They’re 
           out - hanging in the air. Phantoms. Omens.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        I suppose there’s a moment when it 
                        all catches up to you.

                                 JOHN
                        Others? You’ve had others here?

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        When the shiny new toy loses its 
                        luster and you have to ask yourself 
                        was it worth it...

                                 JOHN
                        Isn’t your father worried they’d 
                        talk outside? Kismine? 
                             (no answer)
                        If you love me, tell me the truth.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        What you sacrificed along the way.

                                 KISMINE
                             (tears streaming)
                        Father doesn’t take any chances. 
                                 JOHN
                        But no one our age was in the pit-

           FLASH: Anti Aircraft Guns and Twitching Half-Dead Quail
           FLASH: George Washington’s portrait and Prisoners in the Pit
           FLASHES consume John, walls closing in, finally understanding

           HE’S NOT MAKING IT OUT OF EL DORADO ALIVE.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        You killed them? Your friends?!

                                 KISMINE
                        They were going to run.

                                 JOHN
                             (shaking)
                        You kept bringing them!?

                                 KISMINE
                        I didn’t. I never did. It was 
                        always Percy. He needed them.

                                 JOHN
                        You asked me to spend time with 
                        you. To kiss you. When all the 
                        while you knew what I was.

                                 KISMINE
                        They came and had such a good time. 
                        They’d never been so happy. You 
                        should’ve seen them.

                                 JOHN
                        A corpse. A CORPSE. HOW DOES IT 
                        FEEL TO LOVE A CORPSE.

           Kismine GRABS him by the jaw to silence him. It’s as 
           unfamiliar to her as it is shocking to us.

                                 KISMINE
                        You need to stop. Listen to me. If 
                        you panic, I can’t help you. If you 
                        run, I can’t help you. If you do 
                        anything other than carry on as if 
                        you know nothing, I cannot help 
                        you. But if you trust me. If you do 
                        what I say... I will get you out of 
                        here alive. 

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        I should’ve run.
           INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           GEORGE WASHINGTON - somehow tired, less brilliant - gazes 
           down from his portrait. John sits with the Washingtons at a 
           silent dinner. Blood pounding in his ears. Losing it.

                                 PERCY
                        Capital steak, mother.

           Braddock notices John isn’t touching his food.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Apparently not everyone thinks so. 
                        Not hungry, son?

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        “Son”

                                 JOHN
                        The steak’s very good, Mrs. 
                        Washington. Just feeling a bit ill. 
                        I think I’ll turn in.

                                 MRS. WASHINGTON
                        Poor dear! I’ll have Gygsum send up 
                        some ginger ale.

           He folds his napkin and rises to leave, but is stopped when:

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Unless you’re feeling too like a 
                        corpse.

           Fuck. John’s blood freezes. He finds Kismine’s gaze. Did she 
           say something? Percy won’t make eye contact. FUCK FUCK FUCK.

                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                        I was on my morning hunt and heard 
                        the strangest shouting in the 
                        woods. Corpse this and corpse that.

           With each “corpse,” Braddock SKEWERS a piece of his steak. 
           John grows dizzy. Kismine attempts to rescue him:

                                 KISMINE
                        Oh, that silly game? I used to play 
                        with my tutors. Shouting ridiculous 
                        things at the top of your lungs 
                        trying not to draw attention. I was 
                        teaching John. It works better in 
                        public, I suppose.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Sounds like a dangerous game.
                                 MRS. WASHINGTON
                             (to John)
                        Dear, you look positively faint. Go 
                        lie down and rest.

           As Braddock PUNCTURES another piece of meat, we follow John.

           INTO THE FOYER——

           John, head spinning, the walls of luxury closing in. Stumbles 
           up the stairs. Losing feeling. His head and body grow NUMB.

           INTO HIS ROOM——

           His legs give out. He collapses onto the bed. He lies there, 
           petrified, staring up at the canopy.

           We watch him panic. Then calm himself down. Then relax. THEN--

           CLAP! A CHLOROFORM CLOTH COMES DOWN OVER HIS MOUTH. JOHN 
           THRASHES AND FLOUNDERS. 

           FLASH: TROUT FIGHTING THE CURRENT OF A RIVER, THRASHING, THEN 
           ULTIMATELY SPILLING OVER THE WATERFALL

           JOHN EXHALES INTO DARKNESS.

           EXT. CHATEAU - NIGHT

           The chateau sits beneath a starry Montana-sized sky. 

           SILENCE draped across every inch of the house. 

           The Atrium. The Front Steps. The Rooftop. The Gardens. 

           Mute stillness everywhere. 

           We sit in this for a while.

           INT. MRS. WASHINGTON’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Mrs. Washington sits surrounded by MIRRORS - a vanity’s 
           vanity. Dripping in diamonds. She takes them off one by one 
           in the silence and stillness of the night. Until

           ACROSS EL DORADO, SIRENS BEGIN TO BLARE.

           She breathes deeply, knowing this day would come. 

           She starts putting all of the diamonds back on. Never one to 
           under-dress for an occasion.
           INT. CHATEAU - VARIOUS - SAME TIME

           KISMINE’S ROOM——

           KISMINE wakes in a fright. Senses firing in overdrive, 
           instinct kicking in. She bolts out of bed, and beelines to 

           JOHN’S ROOM——

                                 KISMINE
                        John, wake up, we have to–

           His bed is empty. Her mind racing. No way he could’ve left.

                                 KISMINE (CONT'D)
                             (hopeless)
                        John.

           HALLWAY——

           She barrels down halls, panicked, calling for John, WHEN--

           A DISTANT BUZZ overtakes the sirens. Coming from overhead. 
           She needs to know what’s happening...

           EXT. ROOF - CONTINUOUS

           Kismine bursts onto the roof, where she halts in her tracks - 
           FEAR splashing across her face, as we rotate to see

           A DOZEN PLANES descending on El Dorado. A Washington D-Day.

           Kismine steels herself. Meanwhile...

           INT. BRADDOCK’S STUDY - NIGHT

           Percy bounds into the study where Braddock, Gygsum, Mrs. 
           Washington, and a TEAM OF HOUSE STAFF remove guns from the 
           cabinets. Loading them. Preparing for battle.

                                 PERCY
                        How many?

                                 GYGSUM
                        A dozen aeroplanes, two passengers 
                        each. Armed. Government issue.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Percy, take your mother and sister 
                        to the bunker. Gygsum, I’ll meet 
                        you at the guns to launch the 
                        counter-offensive. 
                                 PERCY
                        I can fight, father. 

                                 MRS. WASHINGTON
                             (cocking shotgun)
                        We can all fight, Percy darling. 
                        That’s not the point.

           Braddock checks to ensure Gygsum and staff are gone.

                                 BRADDOCK
                             (hushed)
                        There must be a Washington in the 
                        bunker at all times. Once we’ve 
                        established a position against the 
                        invaders, I’ll join you and we’ll 
                        wait until the staff takes care of 
                        the rest. Claudius will handle 
                        things from the government end. All 
                        will be fine.

           Braddock removes the KEY hanging around his neck, handing it 
           to Percy. Before he does, he separates the CRUCIFIX and drops 
           it in his shirt front pocket. Not one to forsake God.

                             (concerned by the gesture)
                        Father–

                                 BRADDOCK
                        If I don’t make it to the bunker. 
                        If things take an unexpected turn. 
                        We cannot let Her fall into the 
                        wrong hands. You know what to do.

                                 MRS. WASHINGTON
                        We will weather the storm. The 
                        Washingtons have seen worse.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Quickly now. Collect your sister.

                                 PERCY
                             (only now noticing)
                        Where’s John?

                                 BRADDOCK
                        John Unger is no Washington.

           A sadness falls over Percy’s face. Then sadness turns slowly 
           to understanding. A whole mourning process in a matter of 
           seconds. Something he’s mastered by now. He exhales as-
           EXT. THE PIT - NIGHT

           A SHARP INHALE brings JOHN back to life. Adrenaline-pumping, 
           pupil-dilating life. He quickly realizes he’s in the pit. 
           Which also means he’s not alone...

           Aviators spread out, craning their necks to see the action.

                                 AVIATORS
                        Guards have abandoned their posts./ 
                        Probably to reinforce the defense./
                        Look! The kid’s awake./

           A frightened John backs into a wall. Men circle around him.

                                 JOHN
                        HELP! SOMEBODY! GET ME OUT OF HERE! 
                        I’M A GUEST. I’M PERCY’S-

           The men chuckle. Marcus advances toward John.

                                 MARCUS
                        Save your breath, kid.

                                 JOHN
                        Stay back. I- I’m warning you. I’ll-

                                 MARCUS
                        No you won’t. Who are you?

           John is sucker punched by the question.

                                 MARCUS (CONT'D)
                        Because unless your last name is 
                        Washington, you’re nothing. Blood 
                        is everything with those people.
                             (then, a softer approach)
                        Listen, kid. Your the only one who 
                        knows what’s going on up there. We 
                        got one shot to bust outta here. If 
                        we fail, that madman is gonna start 
                        popping off every one of us. So we 
                        need to know if now’s our chance. 
                        You may not trust me or any of 
                        these men, but we’re the best 
                        chance you got. So start talking. 

           John is silent - weighing his options. As this happens, the 
           SIRENS and AEROPLANES grow louder and louder and...
           EXT. PROP PLANE - HIGH IN THE SKY - NIGHT

           Now DEAFENING, as we fly high. The Italian rides shotgun to a 
           PILOT CAPTAIN and identifies the El Dorado property below.

                                 PILOT CAPTAIN (OVER RADIO)
                        Target identified. Circle in for a 
                        closer look. Approach with caution.

           BOOM! The plane next to theirs EXPLODES, going down in flame. 
           The Pilots open fire. It’s GAME FUCKING ON for attack mode.

           EXT. BATTLE GROUND/DEFENSE COMPOUND

                                 BRADDOCK
                        FIRE!

           BOOM BOOM! The A-Air guns roar. The Staff - now Soldiers - 
           loading shells, firing upon their invaders. Braddock moves 
           among them. To lead. To inspire.

                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                        El Dorado is our home. All of ours. 
                        Now these strangers come to rip 
                        apart our family, and ransack our 
                        lives. Are we going to let them?!

           The Staff BELLOWS “NO!”

           TK TK TK TK! The planes buzz the compound, spraying bullets. 
           Bodies drop. The Staff getting their first taste of combat. 

           Braddock looks to Gygsum, sensing doubt in the ranks - 
           perhaps not ready to die for El Dorado. Pulling him aside...

                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                        Gygsum. Gygsum, you’ve always been 
                        so much more than our steward. You 
                        are family. As good a Washington as 
                        I’ve ever known. And when we sit 
                        around our victory table, raising a 
                        glass, it’ll be because our brother 
                        Gygsum led us to triumph. These 
                        brave souls look to you now.

                                 GYGSUM
                        You’re leaving, sir?

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Loose ends need tying. We can’t 
                        take any more chances.

           Gygsum nods - reinvigorated by duty and blind hope.
                                 GYGSUM
                        FIRE!

           INT. CHATEAU

                                 PERCY
                        KISMINE! KISMINE, WHERE ARE YOU?

           Percy combs the halls of the chateau, tossing doors open left 
           and right. He throws open the door to

           JOHN’S ROOM——

           No one inside. A pang as Percy stares at John’s empty bed.

                                 MRS. WASHINGTON (O.S.)
                             (from below)
                        PERCY!

           Whatever feelings he may have, he buries them. Running to the

           FOYER——

           Shuffling downstairs to Mrs. Washington - shotgun on hip.

                                 PERCY
                        She’s nowhere.

           TK TK TK. Machine gunfire shatters the foyer windows. Percy 
           ducks beneath the marble bannister as glass rains down.

                                 MRS. WASHINGTON
                        She knows the protocol. We’ll meet 
                        at the bunker. We can’t stay here.

           EXT. THE SKY

           Shots COLLIDE with a fighter’s tail, igniting in flames. 

           The PILOT abandons ship, barreling out of the open cockpit. 

           We follow him over the edge, off the wing, and into freefall. 
           Falling with him. Plummeting toward paradise.  

           His PARACHUTE OPENS, but he’s flailing. Winds whipping him in 
           every direction. Stabilizing the chute just as he reaches the

           CHATEAU——

           Where Mrs. Washington and Percy burst out the front doors, 
           and spot the Pilot fast incoming.
           In one swift movement, Mrs. Washington SWINGS the shotgun to 
           her shoulder, plants herself, and FIRES!

           RED brain splatters on WHITE parachute against BLUE sky. 

           A beat. Percy gapes at his mother. The Pilot’s corpse falls.

                                 MRS. WASHINGTON
                        I abhor violence. Really I do.

           She treads on. We never really know our parents.

           EXT. THE PIT

           The men frantically pry dirt from the pit wall. John working 
           with them, seeing their slow progress, and doing the math...

                                 JOHN
                        We’re not going to make it.

                                 MARCUS
                        Hang in there kid. We gotta keep-

           BAM! MARCUS’ HEAD EXPLODES. John lets out a cry and falls to 
           the ground, looking for cover.

           Braddock stands at the top of the pit, smoking shotgun in 
           hand, picking off the men below. Fish in a barrel. 

           With each bang, a new corpse.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        I tried to be merciful. (BANG) 
                        Compassionate. (BANG) I offered to 
                        give you everything you possibly 
                        need. Each. Of. You. (BANG, BANG, 
                        BANG) And this is how you thank me. 

                                 JOHN
                        Braddock, stop!

                                 BRADDOCK
                        John Unger from Hades. How you like 
                        it down there? Remind you of home?

                                 JOHN
                        Braddock, I didn’t do any of this. 
                        These men. They aren’t to blame.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Oh, but they are. Don’t you see, 
                        John?

                        One man’s right to life, liberty 
                        and the pursuit of happiness is not 
                        worth the collapse of a nation. 
                        (BANG) The death of independence. 
                        (BANG) 

                                 JOHN
                        Please stop! Stop it, Braddock.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Okay, John. I’ll make it stop.

           He turns the gun on John, who backs into the dirt wall. 
           There’s no running. John tries one final plea...

                                 JOHN
                        You were ready to make me your son.

                                 BRADDOCK
                             (soft, almost tender)
                        Oh my dear boy. You really have no 
                        idea how the world works. I would 
                        never give my blessing to a nothing 
                        son-of-a-coal-miner who’s let 
                        himself be fucked again and again 
                        by the world. I told you what you 
                        needed to hear. But rest assured, 
                        you’ll leave this world the same 
                        way you came in... insignificant.

           He takes aim. This is the end. Braddock squeezes the trigger 

           Off the BANG of the gunshot, the SOUND DROPS OUT and

           A haunting rendition of “AMAZING GRACE” serenades us. 
           A boy’s choir. A hundred cherubs coo in falsetto over a 

           MONTAGE OF APOCALYPSE:

           - WHACK! A CROQUET MALLET SLAMS INTO BRADDOCK’S SKULL the 
           moment the gun goes off. He falls, unconscious.

           - Mrs. Washington and Percy enter the BUNKER. The room lit by 
           warm Edison bulbs. Mrs. Washington catches her reflection in 
           a mirror. Blood splattered on her DIAMOND EARRING. 

           - John collapses to the ground, shot.

           - An A-Air gun FIRES a shot. We fly with the SHELL into the 
           sky where it BLOWS THE WING CLEAN OFF A FIGHTER PLANE.

           - The wing plummets to the ground, landing on POWER LINES in 
           a burst of sparks. The valley goes DARK IN A BLACKOUT.
           - In the chateau FOYER, the CRYSTAL CHANDELIER extinguishes, 
           plunging the house into darkness.

           - In the BUNKER, Mrs. Washington meticulously wipes the blood 
           off her earring. As she does, the LIGHTS GO OUT, and they’re 
           left in the alien NEON GREEN GLOW of RADIUM.

           - We hover over the Diamond Mountain. Strobes of LIGHTNING 
           pulse ever closer. A storm rolling in.

           As the SONG ENDS we’re back at 

           THE PIT——

           Kismine stands over an unconscious Braddock. 

           BLOODY CROQUET MALLET in her hand. 

           John finds her eyes and, for a moment, lands safely there. 
           For the first time, it’s clear. Kismine has chosen a side. 
           She’s chosen John.

           But as the adrenaline fades, it’s replaced by SHOOTING PAIN.

                                 KISMINE
                        JOHN! JOHN, YOUR ARM!

           HIS ARM BLEEDING - he clutches it to staunch the flow.

           Kismine unlocks the cage over the pit and helps him out.

                                 JOHN
                             (fighting through)
                        I’ll be okay. 

                                 KISMINE
                        That doesn’t look okay.

                                 JOHN
                        We need to get out of here.

                                 KISMINE
                        We need to go back to the house. 

                                 JOHN
                        Are you crazy?!

                                 KISMINE
                        Listen to me. We can’t go to the 
                        train station. They’ll be waiting 
                        for us. Our only chance is to head 
                        north. The border isn’t far.

                        But we need food and water enough 
                        for three days. And unless you want 
                        to die of infection in that time, 
                        you need disinfectant for that arm.

           John nods - impressed, convinced. They head for the chateau.

           INT. BUNKER

           Darkness surrounds Mrs. Washington and Percy - frantically 
           flipping switches on a breaker.

                                 PERCY
                        Come on. Come ON!

                                 MRS. WASHINGTON
                        We need to switch on the generator. 

                                 PERCY
                        The generator is back at the house. 
                        Father said-

                                 MRS. WASHINGTON
                        The kill switch runs on 
                        electricity. If god forbid we need 
                        to use it, then we need power.
                             (grabbing shotgun)
                        Stay here. I’m going back.

                                 PERCY
                        It’s not safe. I’ll come with you. 

                                 MRS. WASHINGTON
                        NO. It’s not safe. Which is why you 
                        must stay here. There must always 
                        be a Washington in the bunker.

           She puts her hand over the KEY around Percy’s neck. He nods. 
           It’s perhaps the closest they come to saying I Love You.

           EXT. DEFENSE COMPOUND / BATTLEGROUND

           RAIN and WIND. The storm picks up. 

           Gygsum roars orders at the Staff, invigorated by the tempest.

           Fighters BUZZ the compound again, more bodies drop. THEN--

           Gygsum PAUSES in the chaos. Surveying the scene around him:  
           Morale dropping. Bloodshed spreading. Considering bringing an 
           end to the suffering. WHEN--
           He looks to the MOUNTAIN - earth beginning to slide away. 

           Braddock’s words echo in his mind, drooling over the treasure 
           of El Dorado. He’s so close. He can fucking taste it and 
           frankly, it doesn’t matter who has to die to get him there. 

           Galvanized by the promise of wealth and power and loyalty to 
           all things Washington, he COMMANDS THEM ONWARD. 

                                 GYGSUM
                        FIRE!

           INT. CHATEAU

           ATRIUM——

           RAIN POUNDS down on the atrium. The kitchen below swimming in 
           distorted moonlight. As though suspended underwater.

           John, Kismine pull food from shelves. Stocking a duffel bag.

           John groans, bleeding more intensely from the arm.

                                 KISMINE
                        There’s a first aid kit in my room 
                        under the vanity! I’ll finish this.

           John nods, takes off through the house... 

           (INTERCUTTING AS NECESSARY)

           FOYER——

           ...and up the grand staircase. 

           Stray bullets shower in HARD. John takes cover behind the 
           ELEPHANT TUSKS which splinter, crack. Ivory casualties.

                                 KISMINE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        JOHN!

                                 JOHN
                        I’M FINE. GET THE FOOD!

           He bounds down the hall upstairs and into...

           KISMINE’S ROOM——

           John rips apart her vanity, searching for the first aid kit. 
           Tearing through drawers, lavish jewels flying everywhere.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        Where are you?
           KITCHEN——

           Kismine frantically pulls food. Filling canisters of water. 

           The fighters BUZZ the house again. 

           The ATRIUM SHATTERS. Glass showers down over Kismine. 

                                 KISMINE
                        JOHN!

           BACK IN KISMINE’S ROOM——

                                 JOHN
                        I’M COMING!

           He yanks open a drawer to find the FIRST AID KIT! Finally. 

           He’s about to take off WHEN-- he’s PARALYZED by the 
           KALEIDOSCOPE OF GEMS scattered across the vanity. 

           He zeroes in on the PEARL NECKLACE rolling on the vanity.

           FLASH: The PEARL EARRING on his mother’s ear. His Mother, 
           smiling at him. On the Hades train platform. The last time he 
           saw her. The last time he might EVER see her.

           Something landing in him. And as John stares at the pearl, we 
           see something else in the REFLECTION OF THE VANITY MIRROR:

           OUTSIDE - A SMOKING FIGHTER PLANE BARRELS TOWARD THE CHATEAU.

           Closer... Closer... Collision imminent. John SPOTS it. He 
           grabs the PEARL and FIRST AID KIT, and runs back into the  

           FOYER——

           Just as John reaches the top of the stairs

           THE FIGHTER PLANE CRASHES THROUGH THE FOYER. 

           SMASHING INTO THE STAIRCASE, WHICH FUCKING COLLAPSES. 

           Leaving John stuck upstairs.

           Rubble flies, severing part of the cord suspending the 
           CHANDELIER. It hangs precariously over the foyer.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        KISMINE! Shit. KISMINE!

           Kismine appears with the duffel bag. Climbing over rubble.
                                 KISMINE
                        JOHN!
                             (beat, mind racing)
                        Give me the first aid kit, and go 
                        back to my room. Use the drain pipe 
                        outside my balcony to scale down 
                        the side of the building. It’s how 
                        I snuck out at night.

                                 JOHN
                             (re: his bleeding arm)
                        Sounds like you had two working 
                        arms for that.

                                 KISMINE
                        It’s either that, or you can jump 
                        and risk the legs too.
                             (then)
                        Come on. I’ll meet you out back.

           Out of options, he tosses her the first aid and disappears.

           Kismine turns for the door WHEN-- THE LIGHTS COME ON. The 
           generator turned on. Which means...

           MRS. WASHINGTON appears. She clocks the duffel bag. 

                                 MRS. WASHINGTON
                        Going somewhere, Kismine darling?

           Off Kismine, stuck.

           EXT. THE PIT

           Close on a CRUCIFIX in the mud. Braddock unconscious by it. 

           He stirs. Clutching his wounded head. As his vision comes 
           into focus, he sees the CORPSES in the pit - his victims.

           His eyes then fall on the crucifix, retrieving it with his 
           blood-stained hand. Blood and Mud and Jesus. 

           He crosses himself, begging forgiveness.

           EXT. THE SKY

           Wind WHIPS the fighters. Little toy planes in a downpour.

                                 PILOT CAPTAIN (RADIO)
                        Everyone, wheels down. That’s an 
                        order.
           CLOSE ON his goggles. As lightning flashes, we see the 
           reflection of the SHIMMERING MASS we’ve come to know so well.

                                 PILOT CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                        Oh. My. God.

           INT./EXT. KISMINE’S ROOM/BALCONY

           John charges through her room and onto the balcony where the 
           Diamond Mountain stands now fully revealed. Dazzling monster.

           He spots the DRAIN PIPE hanging off the side of the building, 
           loosened by stray gunfire. 

                                 JOHN
                        Shit. 

           He backs up into the room, giving himself a runway. 
           Then SPRINTS. Angling sharply toward the pipe.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                             (running)
                        Shit shit shit shit shit shit...

           HE LEAPS thorough the air and CATCHES the drain pipe. The 
           BOLTS fastening the pipe to the chateau loosen. His weight 
           dragging them down. Grip slipping.

           John hangs from the pipe.
           The Diamond Mountain looms behind him.
           Lightning hits the prism. Rays BURST from every angle.
           THEN-- he falls.

           INT. BUNKER

           Percy alone in the bunker. Pacing in that radium green glow. 
           For all the madness outside, there is a stillness here. 
           And Percy loves it. Relishes it.

           A PICTURE FRAME on a shelf catches his eye. He picks it up. 
           It’s a photo of the Washington family. A younger, livelier 
           Braddock, Mrs. Washington, Kismine, and Percy gaze back.

           Percy positions his hands over the photo in a way we can’t 
           quite make out until-

           The LIGHTS COME ON - the generator back to life.

           And we see that Percy has covered up the faces of his family. 
           All except a Younger Percy - smiling back at him.

           ON PERCY - legacy, birthright, hubris colliding within him.
           INT. CHATEAU - FOYER

           The CHANDELIER swings precariously, battered by the storm. 
           A ten thousand dollar wind chime.

           Kismine and Mrs. Washington argue below.

                                 MRS. WASHINGTON 
                        Don’t be absurd! You’re coming to 
                        the bunker with your brother.

                                 KISMINE
                        Father tried to kill him. 

                                 MRS. WASHINGTON
                        Braddock is doing his duty. To 
                        protect us.

                                 KISMINE
                             (look around)
                        Protect us!? It’s over.

                                 MRS. WASHINGTON
                             (knee jerk)
                        It’s over because some spoiled brat 
                        couldn’t go without learning 
                        Italian.

           Daggers to Kismine’s heart.

                                 MRS. WASHINGTON (CONT'D)
                             (softer)
                        We’ll be okay. Come now. Be a good 
                        girl and do as you’re told.

           Oh fuck no. Not anymore.

                                 KISMINE
                        Did any of you ever wonder how the 
                        Italian escaped? Did you ever even 
                        imagine that someone let him go.

           Jesus. Mrs. Washington shakes. Seethes. Boils. Furious. 

                                 MRS. WASHINGTON
                        You. You stupid fucking girl. 
                        You’ve doomed us all.

                                 KISMINE
                        No, Mother. I freed us.
                             (grabbing her bag)
                        And now I’m freeing myself.

           Mrs. Washington grabs the other end of the bag.
                                 MRS. WASHINGTON
                        We’re going to the bunker. And you 
                        will answer for your treason.

           With surprising strength, she tugs Kismine her way WHEN--

           CRACK! Thunder roars simultaneously with lightning. The 
           strike SHAKES the house. 

           A SINGLE CRYSTAL FALLS on Kismine’s head. They both look up. 

           THE CHANDELIER rocks violently. The storm prying it loose-

           THE CABLE SNAPS. Plummeting toward the floor. Toward Kismine. 

           She sees her life FLASH before her eyes, refracted in a 
           million little crystals. JUST AS--

           MRS. WASHINGTON SHOVES HER DAUGHTER OUT OF THE WAY, AND IS 
           CRUSHED UNDER THE CHANDELIER.

           Kismine SHRIEKS, tries and fails to pry the chandelier off.

                                 KISMINE
                        MOTHER! 

           It’s no use. As the light fades from Mrs. Washington’s eyes, 
           she extends a hand to her daughter’s cheek.

                                 MRS. WASHINGTON
                        John... is not your family. 
                        Promise me... there will always be 
                        a Washington... at El Dorado.

           She passes. Adrenaline courses in Kismine. Antidote to grief.

           OFF A FLASH OF LIGHTNING WE

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. JOHN’S CHILDHOOD HOME - HADES, MISSOURI (FLASHBACK)

           STRAW. A SCRATCHY TEXTURE. Antithesis of brilliant diamond.

           A Younger John STUFFS HAY into a LARGE SACK. Over and over. 
           An image we’ve seen before and now will find out why. 

           John’s parents BETTY & JAMES round the corner. 

                                 BETTY
                        How’s it going back here?
                                 JAMES
                        Bet you’re regretting that growth 
                        spurt about now. You might still 
                        fit on your old one.

                                 JOHN
                             (under breath)
                        Just regretting bargain-basement 
                        parents.

                                 JAMES
                        What did you say?!

                                 JOHN
                        Why can’t we just buy a mattress 
                        from Rudy’s dad’s general store? 
                        Rudy will give us a discount.

                                 JAMES
                        We don’t need the charity of Rudy’s 
                        family. I made my mattress, your 
                        mother made hers, and you can make 
                        yours or sleep on the ground.

                                 JOHN
                        Father, I didn’t mean-

           But James Unger is gone. Betty approaches her son warmly.

                                 BETTY
                        That’s very nice for Rudy to offer. 
                        But what if Rudy’s mattress is too 
                        hard? Perhaps you will toss and 
                        turn all night, and get no rest. 

                                 JOHN
                        I’ll make sure it’s soft enough 
                        before I take it home.

                                 BETTY
                        Ah, but what if it’s too soft and 
                        doesn’t support you? You won’t know 
                        until it’s too late and you’ve 
                        already spent the money. Perhaps 
                        you’ll sink into it and wake with 
                        terrible pain in your back.

           Betty stuffs a handful of hay inside the sack.

                                 BETTY (CONT'D)
                        You are responsible for building 
                        your own life, my wonderful boy. 
                        There’s dignity in creating 
                        something for yourself.

                                 (MORE)

                                 BETTY (CONT'D)
                        A dignity you can’t buy at Rudy’s 
                        dad’s general store.

           She tousles his hair and leaves him to it.

           Reinvigorated, John PLUNGES his hand into hay and STUFFS. 
           Again and again. Quick cuts. Sweat dripping. Working hard. 
           Before we know it, John stares down at his COMPLETED 
           MATTRESS. He falls onto it.

           HIS HEAD - resting on a sack stuffed with straw. Fulfilled. 

                                                              MATCH TO:

           EXT. SIDE OF THE CHATEAU

           JOHN’S HEAD - resting on wet, muddy Earth.

           Kismine shakes him awake. Something has changed in her. 

                                 KISMINE
                        John! John, let’s go. We need to 
                        get out of here.

                                 JOHN
                        We have to go to the bunker.

                                 KISMINE
                        We can’t go to the bunker, John. 

                                 JOHN
                        We have to get to the kill switch. 
                        We have to destroy it.

                                 KISMINE
                        John, we can’t. I can’t go-

                                 JOHN
                        Your father is wrong about the 
                        mountain, Kismine. Look what it did 
                        to him. Imprisoning men, killing 
                        them, like a monster. Right now, 
                        just a few people know it exists. 
                        But the world’s getting smaller, 
                        and when the government takes 
                        control, the fighting will get 
                        worse. It’s not our responsibility 
                        to hide it from the world. We need 
                        to destroy it before it begins. And 
                        I can’t do it alone.

           The words rattle around the shell of her mind - worlds away. 
           EXT. THE PIT

           Aviators pile out of planes. Gygsum appears with a row of 
           Soldiers. Everyone draws. A standoff. A powder keg. 

                                 PILOT CAPTAIN
                        Where is he?

           Gygsum is silent. The Pilot Captain pulls back the hammer on 
           his pistol. The others follow. A massacre waiting to happen. 

           THEN-- the Pilot Captain looks at THE PIT - now flooding. 
           Bodies of aviators rising to the top. Corpse buoys.

           He softens. Lowering his weapon. A sign of good faith.

                                 PILOT CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                        The United States Government is 
                        only concerned with the affairs of

                        Where is he?

           Off Gygsum, unreadable. 

           INT. BUNKER

           A soaked John and Kismine burst through the bunker door. John 
           moves to the PANEL IN THE WALL alongside the radium. 

                                  JOHN
                        Where’s the key? It should be here!

                                 PERCY
                        It’s good to see you, John. 

           Percy splayed out over an armchair, waves a PISTOL in the 
           air. Apocalyptic nonchalance. The KEY dangles on his neck. 

                                 JOHN
                        Percy, you need-

                                 PERCY
                        Tell you what. The only thing 
                        anyone needs to do is shut up and 
                        wait. We’ll sort this whole thing 
                        out when mother and father return.

           OFF Kismine - Unable to correct him.
           EXT. DIAMOND MOUNTAIN - SUMMIT

           P U L S A T I N G   B E A T S  begin to thump. At first soft 
           and low. They will become thunderous and furious. These 
           babies will bring us home. The STROBES of lighting. The 
           GLITTER of the mountain. Rain and SWEAT. You could blink and 
           mistake these Rocky Mountains for a Berlin nightclub. 

           Braddock climbs the mountain. Beating against the storm. He 
           reaches the summit where the LARGE PILE OF FOLIAGE sits and 
           begins pulling branches away, uncovering what lies beneath...

           INT. BUNKER

           Percy’s by the FISH TANK. Gun in hand. Increasingly unhinged. 

                                 PERCY
                        What do you think of ‘Ferdinand’? 
                        Ferdinand is a good name for a 
                        fish. Ferdinand the Fish! I think 
                        I’ll call this one Ferdinand.
                             (then)
                        Of course Archduke Ferdinand was 
                        shot in the neck and died... 
                        But oh how they remember him.  

           John and Kismine sit on the couch. Quietly unnerved.

                                 PERCY (CONT'D)
                        The generators are running. She 
                        should be back by now.

           John catches Kismine’s eyes. Hollow. Shock setting in. She 
           shakes her head - ever so slightly - No. John understands.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        Except Mrs. Washington wasn’t 
                        coming back. And it would be best 
                        to keep that thought from entering 
                        Percy’s head.

                                 JOHN
                        Is it easy to pick who dies?

                                 PERCY
                        Don’t do this, John. 

                                 JOHN
                        Why me? You could’ve picked anyone 
                        at St. Midas.

                                 PERCY
                        It wasn’t like that.

                           JOHN
           But you knew what it meant to 
           bring someone here. To your 
           godforsaken El Dorado. 
                                              You don’t know what you’re 
                                              talking about. 

                                              I haven’t killed anyone. 

                                              Stop talking, John.
                                              Stop TALKING.
                                              STOP IT.
                                              SHUT YOUR MOUTH.
                                              SHUT THE FUCK UP!
           A death sentence. Is what it 
           was. And you did it ANYWAY. 
           Did it get easier? Every time 
           you did it? Was it easier to 
           sit across from me in the 
           cafeteria and wave a blazer 
           in my face? Easier than the 
           last Tom, Dick, and Harry you 
           brought to their deaths?
           WHY? WHY SHOULD I?
                                              BECAUSE YOU WERE MY FRIEND!

           Beat. It catches both boys by surprise. Percy’s eyes mist.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        It was the first time I saw Percy 
                        for what he truly was. Lonely.

                                 JOHN
                             (walking on eggshells)
                        You could... give it up?

           As soon as the words are out there, Percy steels. Back in it.

                                 PERCY
                        The difference between you and me, 
                        John Unger, is that I won’t abandon 
                        my family. My legacy.

           THEN-- Percy spots the DUFFEL BAG. Gears turning.

                                 PERCY (CONT'D)
                        What’s in the bag?

                                 JOHN
                        Your legacy is greed.

                                 PERCY
                        What. Is in. The bag?

                                 JOHN
                        Your legacy is corruption.

                                 PERCY
                             (raising the gun)
                        I won’t ask again.

                                 JOHN
                        Your legacy is MURDER.
                                 KISMINE
                        I’m sorry, John. I can’t do this. 

           Kismine walks over to her brother. Choosing family.
           She opens the duffel bag and food, supplies spill out.

           Off John, stung.

           EXT. DIAMOND MOUNTAIN - SUMMIT

           Our BERLIN BEAT drumming considerably louder now. 

           Braddock removes the last of the branches, revealing

           A GIANT SLAB OF DIAMOND, RAISED ABOVE GROUND. AN ALTAR. A 
           Stone Table of Narnia if Aslan himself had chiseled it from 
           solid diamond. A monolithic offering block. Ripe for blood.

           Braddock stands upon it. Gazing over the VALLEY OF EL DORADO. 
           His life’s work, his purpose of being, crumbling around him. 
           Time for a Hail Mary.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        You out there!
                        I know You can hear me.

           INT. BUNKER

           Percy stands over the bag. Fuming.

                                 PERCY
                             (to Kismine)
                        And you were a part of this? You 
                        would run off with him? Abandon 
                        your family. 

                                 KISMINE
                        It doesn’t matter. I’m here now.

                                 PERCY
                             (turning the gun on her)
                        If I can’t trust you- 

                                 KISMINE
                             (moving toward him)
                        You’re not going to shoot me.

           BANG! He fires a warning shot over her shoulder. It hits the 
           GLOBE on the bookcase behind her which falls to the ground.
                                 PERCY
                        What changed? How do I know you’re 
                        not plotting with him?

                                 KISMINE
                        I’m a Washington.

                                 PERCY
                        Bullshit, you’ve always been a 
                        Washington. That didn’t matter when 
                        you packed this bag. WHAT. CHANGED?

                                 KISMINE
                        What changed is I watched Mother be 
                        flattened by a chandelier.

           The air is sucked out of the room. Percy is petrified. 

                                 KISMINE (CONT'D)
                        I’m so sorry, Percy. I was standing 
                        under the chandelier, she pushed me-

                                 PERCY
                        IT’S YOUR FAULT SHE’S DEAD. YOU 
                        KILLED HER. YOU KILLED ALL OF US. 
                        YOU BROUGHT THESE DEVILS TO OUR 
                        DOORSTEP BECAUSE OF YOUR 
                        SELFISHNESS. 

                                 JOHN
                        That’s enough!

                                 PERCY
                        THIS DOESN’T CONCERN YOU JOHN.

                                 JOHN
                        Kismine, it’s alright. Listen to me- 

           Percy ROARS. He HURLS THE PICTURE FRAME at John. It misses, 
           hits the wall, and CRACKS the Washington family portrait.

           IN THAT MOMENT-- 

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                             (to Kismine)
                        NOW!

           As Percy’s distracted, Kismine lunges for the KEY. She RIPS 
           it from his neck just as he SWATS her hand. 

           The KEY flies through the air and lands IN THE FISH TANK. 

           PERCY BACKHANDS HER HARD. She stumbles back, hits her head on 
           the bookshelf, and falls unconscious to the ground.
                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        KISMINE!

           Percy raises his PISTOL as John LUNGES at him. BANG!

           EXT. DIAMOND MOUNTAIN - BASE

           The Pilot Captain and his Aviators gather at the base of the 
           Diamond Mountain. The BUNKER DOOR ahead of them.

                                 PILOT CAPTAIN
                        This is it. Weapons at the ready. 

           GYGSUM APPEARS. Bruised, beaten, broken by the Aviators.

                                 GYGSUM
                        The self-destruct controls are in 
                        there, but he won’t be. Not until 
                        he’s played all his cards. 

           He points to the peak of the mountain. The others look up: 
           Braddock stands atop the altar at the mountain’s summit. 
           Macbeth at Dunsinane. Hands to the sky. Afire with hubris.

                                 PILOT CAPTAIN
                        What’s he doing?

                                 GYGSUM
                        Negotiating. 

           EXT. DIAMOND MOUNTAIN - SUMMIT

           Braddock bribes God.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Even You have a price. You made man 
                        in Your image and every man has a 
                        price. Men built You cathedrals. 
                        Slaughtered beasts and fellow man 
                        and civilizations in Your name. 
                        Crusaded for Your glory across the 
                        globe. All to buy the Divine 
                        Alleviation of Your Wrath. But no 
                        man could give You what I do now:

           He offers the mountain to God.

                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                        Take it. As Your own. All I ask is 
                        that You take these men away. 
                        Swallow them into the abyss. 
                        Do we have a deal?
           Braddock gazes at the heavens. Listening for an answer. 
           Willing it to be favorable.

           But the rain refuses to relent. Braddock’s hair grows whiter. 
           His offer rebuked. A darkness consumes him.

           As LIGHTNING FLASHES, we see the Pilot Captain hovering 
           behind Braddock, gun in hand, using Gygsum as a human shield.

           INT. BUNKER - CONTINUOUS

           THE KEY sinks in the tank as fish dart around it.

           John and Percy fight. Grappling over control of the GUN. It’s 
           scrappy. Elbows and teeth scrappy. At last, John gains enough 
           control to point the gun at the FISH TANK. 

           BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! John empties the gun into it.

           Glass shatters. The tank’s contents spill to the floor. Fish 
           flopping everywhere, gasping for breath. Shards of glass 
           sprinkled around, twinkling in the NEON GREEN RADIUM GLOW. 
           The KEY lands in the center of it all. 

           THEN-- BANGING on the door. The Aviators are outside. 

           Percy and John dive into the broken glass after the key. 
           PERCY PLUNGES A SHARD OF GLASS INTO JOHN’S HAND. 
           John recoils, HOWLS in pain. Percy grabs the KEY. 

           EXT. DIAMOND MOUNTAIN - SUMMIT

           The Pilot Captain and his shield (Gygsum) stand on the 
           Diamond Altar behind Braddock.

           The BERLIN BEAT now hammering away.

                                 PILOT CAPTAIN
                        Give it up, Washington. We have you 
                        surrounded.

                                 GYGSUM
                        I tried to stop them, sir. 

                                 BRADDOCK
                        Very disappointing, Gygsum.

                                 PILOT CAPTAIN
                        If you come quietly, no one else 
                        needs to suffer. Haven’t your men 
                        sacrificed enough?
                                 BRADDOCK
                             (considered, to himself)
                        Sacrifice.

                                 PILOT CAPTAIN
                        The only way you’re getting out of 
                        here alive is by taking the deal 
                        I’m about to offer yo—

           BAM! Braddock turns and BLOWS A HOLE STRAIGHT THROUGH GYGSUM. 

           THE PILOT CAPTAIN FALLS - bleeding, coughing, sputtering. 
           Braddock places his foot on the man’s throat. 

                                 BRADDOCK
                        I already tried to make one deal 
                        tonight and that was with the 
                        Almighty Himself. Now if He told me 
                        ‘no,’ then what the fuck do you 
                        think I’m going to tell you?

           Braddock steps down on his neck. The CRACK perfectly in time 
           with the hammering BEAT.

           INT. BUNKER

           John bleeds on the floor. Hand pierced with glass. 
           Kismine is passed out. She twitches. 
           Percy holds the KEY. Manic with victory.

                                 PERCY
                        The Washingtons built an empire. 
                        The greatest nation on Earth. Now 
                        it’s my duty - my birthright - to 
                        take my proper place at the head of 
                        it. And I’ll be damned if I let 
                        some Hades swine John Unger ruin it 
                        for me.

           Percy SWALLOWS the key.

                                 JOHN
                        PERCY, NO!

           Kismine’s eyes flutter open.

                                 PERCY
                        It’s people like John Unger that 
                        are everything wrong with this 
                        country. You think this nation is 
                        built on dreams, on goodwill, on 
                        love.
                                 JOHN
                        What have you done?

                                 PERCY
                        But this country is built on sweat. 
                        On sacrifice. On blood. Someone has 
                        to bleed for this nation, John. 
                        Today, that someone is you.

           He stands over John, brandishing a shard of glass. As he 
           brings it down over John’s head

           BAM! THE GLOBE cracks across Percy’s skull, SNAPPING his 
           neck, and he falls DEAD to the ground, revealing

           KISMINE standing behind him, weeping. She drops the GLOBE:

           A STREAK OF WASHINGTON BLOOD SMEARED ACROSS THE U.S. OF A.

           Kismine finds John’s eyes. Her heart breaking. For the family 
           she’s lost. For the new family she’s chosen in John.

           BANGING on the door intensifies.

                                 JOHN
                        Kismine. We need that key. 

           He eyes Percy’s body - sickened by what he must do next. 

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        Don’t look.

           As John grabs a SHARD OF GLASS and moves to dissect his 
           friend, we find...

           Our FISH - Ferdinand - twitching quietly on the floor. In a 
           puddle of water. Surrounded by shimmering glass. Or diamonds. 
           We hardly know the difference anymore. 

           EXT. DIAMOND MOUNTAIN - SUMMIT

           BLOOD POOLS ACROSS DIAMOND. Swirling as the rain falls. 

           The trail of blood ends in Braddock - having dragged the 
           bodies to the center of the Altar.

           He casts his gaze heavenward. HIS WHITE HAIR STAINED CRIMSON.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        God Almighty, hear my prayer.
                        Hear me from this Garden of Eden.
           EXT. BUNKER

           The Aviators hoist a fallen tree, which they now use as a 
           THUMPING BATTERING RAM AGAINST THE BUNKER DOOR. 

                                 BRADDOCK (O.S.)
                        For if not, we gather here today to 
                        mourn the death of a great nation. 
                        If not, let this be Her Eulogy...

           THUMPING.

           A pulse to the eulogy in sync with a THUNDEROUS BERLIN BEAT. 
           Everything in harmony. Everything part of the rhythm. A 
           symphony of chaos.

           INT. BUNKER

           Kismine watches RADIUM course through the tubes in the wall. 

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        The human body is softer than I 
                        imagined it to be. Unfortunately, I 
                        know that now.

           A blood-soaked John emerges from PERCY’S CORPSE - splayed 
           open like a frog dissected in science class. 

           He holds the KEY, dripping in blood and bile.

           THUMP.

           John moves to the panel by the RADIUM WALL. He inserts the 
           key, looking to Kismine for reassurance. Looking for her to 
           okay the destruction of her legacy. 

           She stares, vacant, transfixed by the noxious neon green. 
           Barely there. She nods. Or flinches. Hard to say which.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        But I suppose that was always the 
                        case. That we’ve always been soft 
                        clay that can be shaped and 
                        sculpted in any image. Good or 
                        Evil. Wicked or Benevolent.

           John turns the key. THE MOUNTAIN BEGINS TO  V I B R A T E.

           EXT. DIAMOND MOUNTAIN - SUMMIT

           From the heavens we look down on Braddock flanked by corpses.
                                 BRADDOCK
                        We are impure. We have failed you. 
                        But do not forsake us, O Lord. 
                        “Indeed according to the law all is 
                        purified by blood, and sins are 
                        forgiven if only blood is poured 
                        out.” Let this blood forgive us.

           WHEN-- VIBRATIONS from within the mountain. 

           The sounds of the storm fall away. 

           The throbbing Berlin Beat now distant, muffled.

           Braddock thinks he’s been heard. Been saved. Been seen by the 
           Almighty, Himself.

                                 BRADDOCK (CONT'D)
                        Yes. Yes, Lord thank you. Take 
                        them. Swallow them up, Lord. But 
                        spare your humble servants. 

           THEN-- SICKLY NEON GREEN THREADS spread in all directions 
           from underneath his feet. A radium dye injected into the 
           heart of the mountain, it disperses throughout.

           Hairline green radium roots taking hold in the diamond. 
           Expanding beneath pools of blood swirling with rain. 
           Mirroring off every prismatic angle.

           THE BEAT DIES AND WE FREEZE. IN SILENCE. A VACUUM: 

           RAIN SUSPENDED IN AIR. LITTLE ATOMIC CRYSTALS. 
           NEON GREENS, BLOOD REDS, MOONLIGHT SILVERS CONVERGE.
           AN APOCALYPTIC DISCO. 

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        And perhaps it is our softness that 
                        makes us human. That makes us the 
                        very opposite from the hardest 
                        substance in all the world.

           THE WORLD UNFREEZES.

           The surface of the diamond begins to HEAT.

           Realization splashes across Braddock’s face. His battle 
           fought. His hand played out. The dominoes are falling now and 
           he’ll die here along with his legacy.

                                 BRADDOCK
                        So it is.

           The SIZZLING of flesh. Cooking in radiation. 
           The light leaves his eyes.

           As the mountain MELTS DOWN, we fly into the heavens. 

           Past earth. Past the moon. And the sun. And star after star 
           and galaxy beyond galaxy. We continue soaring out until they 
           are but a million tiny gems strewn across the universe.

           At some point the CONSTELLATIONS OF GALAXIES become SHARDS OF 
           GLASS and we’re back inside the

           INT. BUNKER - LATER

           We are a ghost. A spectre. A witness to what remains.

           We’re floating across the floor of shattered glass and come 
           upon a white sheet, being pulled over Percy’s flayed corpse. 
           A modicum of decency. As the sheet falls over the body, it 
           stains instantly with blood. Washington blood.

           John finishes covering his friend. He looks around.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        So this is where billionaires spend 
                        the end of the world. 

           Floating further, we find Kismine - petrified, resolute, 
           steadfast - the shadow of her past girlish demeanor banished.

                                 KISMINE
                        How long do we wait?

                                 JOHN
                        The thumping stopped hours ago.

                                 KISMINE
                        Do you think there’s any thing 
                        left?

                                 JOHN
                        Anyone?

           Beat. That’s not what she said. But is it what she meant? 
           John marinates in uncertainty. Ever-guessing at her resolve. 
           She chose a side, but was it freely, or out of necessity?

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        I don’t know what we’ll find when 
                        we open the door. If there will be 
                        anyone or anything for us. But I 
                        know this. It doesn’t matter. Even 
                        if there’s nothing. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        No house or limo or gold spoons or 
                        diamonds - I could never see 
                        another diamond so long as I live - 
                        and it wouldn’t matter because you 
                        are more brilliant than all of 
                        them. We could go back and live the 
                        rest of our lives in Hades. I 
                        wouldn’t care. I can introduce you 
                        to my parents. You’ve no idea how 
                        much they’d love you. I don’t care 
                        what happens now so long as we grow 
                        old and fat together with little 
                        Johns and Kismines - little Ungers - 
                        running around tugging at our 
                        shoestrings. And they’ll be good. 
                        Caring and kind. Just like their 
                        mother.

           As John narrates the rest of their lives, Kismine stares at 
           the WATCH on John’s wrist. Percy’s watch.

           We may never know where her head lives. But she smiles.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        I managed to save this.

           John reaches into his pocket and removes the PEARL NECKLACE 
           that he took from Kismine’s vanity, placing it in her hand.

           If Kismine has a thought, she keeps it locked within.

                                 KISMINE
                        May I have a moment alone with him?

           John studies her face. He’s warm with empathy. 

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        There’s a time to be tender. A time 
                        to let ourselves be the softest 
                        creatures in the world.

           He disappears. 

           Kismine waits until she can no longer feel, or see, or smell 
           John. 

           With sturdy hands she pulls back the sheet, revealing Percy’s 
           face. A trail of dried blood snakes from his mouth. 

           Kismine rests a hand against his cheek. A final gesture of 
           love. THEN-- her hand hovers over his mouth for a moment and 
           we are left only with his piercing eyes. And we follow as-

           Kismine stands and walks to the other side of the room. 
           To John. 

           To the door. 

           To the world or whatever’s left of it outside.

           As she moves in one direction, we peel off in the other and 
           look down again at PERCY’S FACE.

           The PEARL NECKLACE rests upon his mouth. 

           At home upon the crest of his lips.

           Right where she left it. 

           Shattered glass or diamonds or both strewn around his head. 

           Like a crown. 

           Like a halo.

           “ROYALS” by LORDE sings us home.

           “I’ve never seen a diamond in the flesh... “

                                         THE END.
