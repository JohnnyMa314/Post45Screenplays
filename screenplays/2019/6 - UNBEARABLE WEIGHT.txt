           EXT. SUNSET TOWER HOTEL - MORNING

           NICOLAS CAGE is drinking a cappuccino high up on the balcony  
           overlooking the city. The movie star sparkle lurks in there 
           somewhere, but he looks like he needs this coffee. He 
           needs... something. 

           Brings the cup to his lips. Tastes it. Little milk mustache 
           as he looks out at the city. Then, curiously...

                                 NIC
                             (in a heavy Boston accent)
                        It’s a foregone conclusion, Jimmy.

           He starts to smile. A big, charismatic grin. 

           INT. THE FOUR SEASONS RESTAURANT - DAY

           Nic’s having lunch with QUENTIN TARANTINO. He’s barely 
           touched his salad. Excited. 

                                 NIC
                        ...that’s exactly what I love about 
                        it. It manages to be simultaneously 
                        cerebral and thought-provoking, but 
                        also, like, I want to know what 
                        happens. Have you ever seen 
                        Manckeiwicz’s House of Strangers...

                                 QUENTIN
                        I restored the print.

                                 NIC
                        Of course you did.
                             (then)
                        And that’s what this script 
                        reminded me of. The power struggle. 
                        The fight for relevance. It’s...
                          QUENTIN
                                                           NIC (CONT'D)
           King Lear.
                                              King Lear.

           They take a second. This is good. 

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        And, look, if you’re worried about 
                        the accent, I can do the accent. 
                        I’ve been working on it all week. 
                        It’s not a problem.

                                 QUENTIN
                        I’m not worried, Nic. I’ve always 
                        admired your acting.
           Nic can’t help himself. Doesn’t want to say it, but-

                                 NIC
                        Like in what? 

                                 QUENTIN
                        What?

                                 NIC
                        No, nothing. Sorry.
                             (then)
                        Just like in what movies 
                        specifically?

                                 QUENTIN
                             (slightly confused)
                        Vampire’s Kiss. Wild at Heart.

                                 NIC
                        Quentin. I’m kidding.

           He wasn’t. 

                                 QUENTIN
                        Oh. Shit. That was good. Okay. You 
                        got me.

                                 NIC
                        Anyway, this is... this is the role 
                        of a lifetime. You know that. 
                        That’s why you’re making it. And I 
                        just...I’d love to be a part of it.

           EXT. FOUR SEASONS HOTEL - VALET STAND - DAY

           At the valet stand. Quentin’s car pulls up.

                                 QUENTIN
                        Well, we’re still figuring things 
                        out on our end, but I’ll be in 
                        touch in a couple days.

                                 NIC
                        Well, if you have any other 
                        questions for me, or want to talk 
                        or, y’know, if you want me to 
                        read... 

                                 QUENTIN
                        Nic, come on, I would never ask you 
                        to read. 
                                 NIC
                             (laughs)
                        Yeah, no, I’m not gonna read. 

           Quentin’s car pulls up.

                                 QUENTIN
                        This is me. 

                                 NIC
                        You want me to read.

                                 QUENTIN
                        I don’t.

                                 NIC
                        Yeah. Course not. Ha. Look forward 
                        to hearing from you.
                             (a beat, then...)
                        You know what? I’m gonna read.

           As Quentin goes to get in the back, he freezes.

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                             (thick Boston accent)
                        It’s a foregone conclusion, Jimmy. 
                        It takes thirteen milliseconds for 
                        the human brain to send a message 
                        to the body. So by the time your 
                        bullets hit me, my cerebral cortex 
                        will have transmitted a signal to 
                        the seventeen healthy muscles that 
                        operate my trigger finger. 

           Quentin is bewildered, looks around. People gathering. Nic is 
           gathering steam.

                                 QUENTIN
                             (quietly)
                        Nic, you don’t have to---

                                 NIC
                        And before your asshole has had a 
                        chance to pucker up, your medulla 
                        oblongata will be splattered on the 
                        fucking wall behind you. And if 
                        that’s the last thing I accomplish 
                        on this beautiful green earth, 
                        well, then... 
                             (moving closer to Quentin)
                        WHAT A WAY TO FUCKING GO.

           A long BEAT.

                        I can do another scene if you want.

           INT. NIC’S CAR - DAY

           Nick is driving along. No radio, just the sounds of Los 
           Angeles. Distant music from car stereos. A weather report. 
           Old billboards and their sun-drenched sadness.

           In the reflection of his sunglasses, curiously, a man is 
           sitting in the passenger seat. Flowing, shoulder length hair. 
           Leather jacket over a white t-shirt. Brash and cocky as he 
           lights up a cigarette. He’s... 

           YOUNG NIC CAGE. Con Air-era Cage.

                                 YOUNG NIC
                        Damn, man. 

           Nic takes off his sunglasses. Looks over at YOUNG NIC, who is 
           smoking. 

                                 NIC
                        That was good, right? It felt good. 

                                 YOUNG NIC
                        You just went for it.

                                 NIC
                        I went for it.

                                 YOUNG NIC
                        And Manciewicz? Incredible pull.  

                                 NIC
                        I know, that just popped into my 
                        head. Just like...thank you “head.”

                                 YOUNG NIC
                             (inhaling)
                        I’m happy for you, man. Because, 
                        honestly...
                             (exhaling)
                        ...you really need this. 

           A beat. 

                                 NIC
                        Sorry, what’s that supposed to 
                        mean? 
                                 YOUNG NIC
                        What? You get it. This could be a 
                        game changer. 

                                 NIC
                        Uhhh, I don’t need a game changer.

                                 YOUNG NIC
                        Oh yeah? Okay, sure.

                                 NIC
                        Okay. Yeah, I hear your tone. But 
                        I’m not gonna be baited into this. 
                        By you.  I mean, if it happens, it 
                        happens. If not... I’ll just keep 
                        working. It’s what I do. 

                                 YOUNG NIC
                        Uhh, yeah, I’ve noticed. 

                                 NIC
                        Humphrey Bogart made like a hundred 
                        movies. 

                                 YOUNG NIC
                        Great, here we go with Bogart. I’m 
                        just saying you could be a little 
                        more strategic. Make movie star 
                        choices...

           Young Nic exhales.

                                 NIC
                        Can you open a window or something?

                                 YOUNG NIC
                        It’s like Miles Davis said, man... 
                        “sometimes it’s the notes you don’t 
                        play.” 

                                 NIC
                        Miles Davis was a heroin addict. 
                        And you know what? I’m happy when 
                        I’m working. I’m an actor!

                                 YOUNG NIC
                        No! You’re a fucking movie star!
                             (then, pointing at Nic 
                              with his cigarette)
                        And you should never forget it. 

           This lands with Nic. He looks away...
                                 NIC
                        I’m not interested in being a movie 
                        star. In being a “celebrity.” And, 
                        you know what man? I don’t need 
                        this.

           When he looks back... Young Nic is gone.

           INT. THERAPIST’S OFFICE - DAY

           Nic is on a couch in a THERAPIST’S modern office.

                                 NIC
                        I need this. This could be, I don’t 
                        know, like a game changer for me.

                                 THERAPIST
                        So, you’re not happy with how your 
                        career is going? You seem to be 
                        working all the time. 

                                 NIC
                        I mean, why is everyone-- Bogart 
                        made like a hundred films.

                                 THERAPIST
                        Okay, then what’s this actually 
                        about? You’re worried that you’ve 
                        lost some of your ability... your 
                        talent as an actor?

                                 NIC
                        Or people have lost their ability 
                        to recognize it, which is arguably 
                        more terrifying. 

                                 THERAPIST
                             (not buying it)
                        Mmmm hmmmm. Well, it certainly 
                        sounds like you have a lot of 
                        anxiety around the issue. 

                                 NIC
                        And if I’m being honest, the tools 
                        are sharper than ever. I feel like 
                        I’m doing great work.

                                 THERAPIST
                        Okay, so how do you think your 
                        relationship with your work affects 
                        your relationship with your 
                        daughter? Let’s bring Addy into 
                        this, shall we...  
           We REVEAL young ADDY CAGE, 15, in FAMILY THERAPY with her 
           father. She’s in jeans and a t-shirt. Old Chuck Taylors and 
           an LA attitude. She’s sitting there reading her phone at the 
           other end of the couch.

                        Yeah, definitely, but can I just 
                        keep going on this for a minute.

                                 NIC
                        I just feel like we’re making real

                        Addy, how has your Dad’s anxiety 
                        over his career affected you? 

                                 ADDY
                        I mean, his work is pretty much the 
                        only thing we talk about.

                        So are we officially moving off of 
                        me? Off the Tarantino thing?

                                 ADDY
                        That or he makes me watch old 
                        movies and then “discuss” them, 
                        which is actually just him 
                        lecturing me for, like, two hours.

                        I mean, the other day my friend 
                        Lizzie was over and he forced us to 
                        watch “Viva Los Angeles”--

                                 ADDY
                        And then he started pretending I 
                        was Ann Margaret and he was dancing 
                        and moving his hips all weird and 
                        like, serenading me. 
           Nic is dumbfounded.

                        Is that a real question? What do

                        Help who? Help you? Because it’s 
                        not helping. She doesn’t tell you 
                        the truth. You live in this weird

           INT. NIC’S CAR - DAY

           Nic is driving with Addy in shotgun. Her weekend duffle bag 
           jostles around on the back seat.

                                 NIC
                        Look, hon. I’m sorry, okay? I know 
                        I’m been working a lot and we 
                        haven’t gotten to spend a lot of 
                        time together and... 

           Addy’s texting and not really looking at him. 

                                 ADDY
                             (texting)
                        It’s fine. We don’t need to talk 
                        about it.
                                 NIC
                        But I heard what you said in there. 
                        And you’re right, okay? I have been 
                        selfish. So this weekend’s gonna be 
                        all about you. 

           Addy looks up at him. 

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        So here’s what I’m thinking. I’m 
                        thinking Chinese to start. Genghis 
                        Cohen. You love that place. Wait, 
                        are you still a vegetarian? 

                                 ADDY
                        No, I’m not. But--

                             (getting excited)
                        Okay, good. Then we start with the 
                        pork dumplings. Maybe a lo mein. 
                        Then the Peking duck. You used to 
                        love that. Remember? You make the 
                        little tacos? Anyway, then we can 
                        head to the New Beverly. They’re 
                        playing The Island of Dr. Caligari. 
                        I know you’re, like, super visual - 
                        and this German Expressionist stuff 
                        - I just think it’s really gonna 
                        shape your palate-

                        Katie is coming to get me from the 
                        hotel at six. 

           A long beat.

                                 ADDY
                        Sorry. It’s just... we had plans.

                                 NIC
                        No, hon. It’s okay. Don’t... Don’t 
                        be sorry.

           They drive in silence for a second.

                        She’ll be in an uber, so I’ll just 
                        get in with her.

                                 NIC
                        Cool cool, yeah. Whatever’s 
                        easiest. And I have a bunch of 
                        stuff that I should get done 
                        anyway, so...

           INT. SUNSET TOWER HOTEL -  NIGHT

           Nic is lying on the hotel bed, eating Chinese takeout, alone. 
           He takes out his phone, starts looking through his contacts.  

           We do a SERIES OF QUICK CUTS as Nic calls some old friends 
           and tries to make plans.

                        what’s happening. I don’t know. 
                        Have some fun.

                        me as well.

           He takes a deep breath. Stares at himself. Closely. Music 
           swells as we...

           perched on his chest. He drops some chicken.

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        Shit.

           He wipes it off his computer right onto the bedspread. 

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        Shit.

           He looks over at Addy’s made up bed in the corner of the 
           room. Checks his watch. Sighs.

           INT. NIC’S CAR - DAY

           Nic’s dropping Addy off at her mother’s. Addy’s getting out 
           of the car.

                                 ADDY
                         Bye, Dad.

           But she’s already on the way up to the house as OLIVIA, his 
           ex-wife, leans in the door.

                                 OLIVIA

                        I don’t know, Liv. When I 
                        originally suggested the therapy - 
                        it seemed like a good idea. But now

                        I mean, I tried to take her to eat 
                        Chinese and to see Dr. Caligari at 
                        the New Beverly.

                                 OLIVIA
                        You tried to take her to a sixty

                        I tried to take her to a classic.

                        But it’s something YOU like. Nic, 
                        you can’t keep trying to mold our 
                        daughter into someone you want to 
                        hang out with. 

           A beat.

                        But she’s never read Jane Austen. 
                        She’s never even seen Casablanca -- 
                        She thought Humphrey Bogart was a

                        Uh huh.

                                 OLIVIA
                        That’s disappointing.

                        Look, she’s at a really critical 
                        stage. And she needs to know that

                        matter what she’s into. Because

                        You are.

           Nic tries not to smile.

                                 NIC
                        Nuh uh. 

           He’s smiling.

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        Okay. Okay. I’m up for a role. 
                        Definitely can’t say for who... 
                        it’s Taranti--

                                 OLIVIA
                        Just do me a favor, okay? Just make 
                        it to her birthday this year.

                                 NIC CAGE
                        Definitely. Definitely.

           She turns and walks back up to the house.

                             (calling out)
                        It’s Thursday.

                                 NIC
                        I know!

           Nic picks up his phone as he starts driving away.
                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        Let’s get a salad. I’ve got some 
                        questions. 

           INT. SUNSET TOWER - DAY

           Nic is having lunch with his agent, PATRICK FINK. An Old 
           school agent in suit. 

                                 NIC
                        ...and Quentin knows I’ve been 
                        working on the accent, right? I 
                        mean, the character’s from the 
                        South Shore, so the accent really 
                        resonates in the throat. Less 
                        nasal. Much more glottal. 

                                 PATRICK
                             (no idea)
                        That sounds right.

                                 NIC
                        But maybe we email him that? 

                                 PATRICK
                        Email him what?

                                 NIC
                        I don’t know. Fuck. I just really 
                        want this.

                                 PATRICK
                        Nic. Just sit tight and let it play 
                        out. 

                                 NIC
                        I know. I know. It’s just... this 
                        is the role of a lifetime.

                                 PATRICK
                        I hear you. And I don’t want to get 
                        ahead of myself here, but I got a 
                        good feeling about this one.
                             (then)
                        In the meantime, I got another 
                        offer. Came down the pike this 
                        morning.

                                 NIC
                        Yeah?

                                 PATRICK
                        Million bucks. 
                                 NIC
                        When it rains it pours. Oscar bait?

                                 PATRICK
                        You head down to Mexico.

                                 NIC
                        Love it there. Killer role?

           Patrick leans in.

                                 PATRICK
                        It’s to attend a wealthy Mexican 
                        gentleman’s 45th birthday party. 

           A long beat.

                                 NIC
                        Patrick, what in the FUCK are you 
                        talking about?

                                 PATRICK
                        Million bucks, Nic. Five days. It’s 
                        the easiest role ever. You go to 
                        this guy’s birthday. You be Nic 
                        Cage. You just play yourself. 

                                 NIC
                        I would never do that.

                                 PATRICK
                        It’s an interim gig. Go tell some 
                        stories, make ‘em laugh, and-

                                 NIC
                        What, like, like I’m some sort of 
                        fucking circus performer? Like a 
                        trained seal- 

           Patrick takes a breath. 

                                 PATRICK
                        Nic, I got a call from your 
                        business manager, Kenny. You’ve 
                        been living in this hotel for over 
                        a year.

                                 NIC
                        Year and a half. Like a king.

           Nic smiles. Patrick doesn’t.
                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        Patrick, relax. It’s good for them 
                        to have a celebrity living here. 
                        They don’t even charge me. 

                                 PATRICK
                        You owe them six hundred thousand 
                        dollars. They sent the bills to 
                        Kenny. 

           A long beat.

                                 NIC
                        That’s disappointing. 

                                 PATRICK
                        And then he told me...
                             (looking around, quietly)
                        He told me you’ve also got some 
                        substantial tax debts, and with the 
                        divorce and some of your spending 
                        habits- 

                                 NIC
                        Stop. Just stop. You know I’m going 
                        to deal with all that, Patrick. I 
                        will. But I get this role and 
                        everything changes, okay? Then I’m 
                        back. 
                             (beat)
                        Not that I went anywhere.

           Nic stands up, chucks his napkin on the table.

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        Gonna head to Santa Barbara for a 
                        few days. Put this accent on its 
                        feet.

           Off Nic’s look, we CUT TO:

           EXT. PCH - MORNING

           Nic rides his motorcycle up the PCH.  He listens to a Boston 
           accent tape inside his helmet as he passes a sign for Santa 
           Barbara.

                        Foregone conclusion. 

           INT. PUBLIC BATHROOM - DAY

           Nic enters and locks the door. He takes a few items out of a 
           bag. A pair of thick rimmed glasses. A dad hat and pea coat. 
           He looks at himself in the mirror. He doesn’t look like Nic.

           EXT. OCEAN/BOAT - DAY

           Nic slowly walks to the railing as the boat cruises out of 
           the harbor. An WOMAN and her young child are there. Nic talks 
           in a thick, Boston accent.  

                                 NIC
                        How ahh yas? 

           She smiles.

                        Said we might see some whales, but 
                        it’s not a foregone conclusion. 
                             (then)
                        I’m not from around here but where 
                        I’m from they got whale watching 
                        too. In my hometown.

           He smiles back at the woman.

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        Any idea where that is?

                        No...I, uh...sorry.

                        Close. Framingham. 

           His phone rings.

                        To what?

                                 OLIVIA (O.S.)
                        To our daughter’s birthday party 
                        and-

           EXT. PCH - DAY

           Nic is speeding, twisting the throttle on the Ducati as he 
           weaves through traffic. He’s clearly late.

           INT. OLIVIA’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Nic pulls up on the bike. Olivia clocks his arrival from a 
           front window of the house. As he approaches the house, he 
           gets a call. It’s Patrick.

                                 NIC
                             (answering)
                        Patrick. Tell me there’s news... 

           Olivia comes out of the house.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Nic, are you kidding me?!

                                 NIC
                        One second, Liv. Please.
                             (then, into phone)
                        You talked to Tarantino? 

                                 PATRICK (O.S.)
                        Can you hear me? 

                                 NIC
                             (getting excited)
                        I can, yeah.
                                 PATRICK
                        Spoke to Tarantino, and he loves 
                        you, but he ultimately went in a 
                        different direction for the role...

           On Nic, devastated... Closes his eyes. Slowly exhales as he 
           hangs up. Olivia is right in front of him. 

                                 OLIVIA (O.C.)
                        You’re two hours late. I mean, it’s 
                        the one thing--you know what? Just 
                        go...

           She goes to walk back inside. 

                                 NIC
                        I got in an accident on the bike. 
                        I’m a little shaken up, okay? 

           Olivia turns.

                                 OLIVIA
                             (softens)
                        You...got in an accident? Are you 
                        okay? What happened?

                                 NIC
                        Yeah. This idiot blindsided me. I 
                        was turning left, and-

           She rushes over.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Are you hurt? Do you need to go to 
                        a hospital?

           A beat.

                                 NIC
                        I wasn’t in an accident. I don’t 
                        know why I said that. I’m sorry. 

           Olivia just stares at him in disbelief.

           INT. OLIVIA’S KITCHEN

           No one’s in here. Nic opens a cupboard, grabs a bottle of 
           Vodka and pours himself a drink. 

                                 MUFFLED CROWD (O.S.)
                        Happy Birthday to you...

           Nic slams the drink. Pours another. 
           INT. OLIVIA’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

           Large room, filled with people. A baby grand piano in the 
           corner. Olivia walks in with a cake. Everyone is singing. 

                                 EVERYONE
                        Happy birthday to you...Happy 
                        birthday dear Addy...

           In the background, we see Nic walk in. He’s got a good buzz 
           going. A man on the outside looking in. 

                                 EVERYONE (CONT'D)
                        Happy birthday to you....

                                 NIC
                        Alright, everybody! Come on. Gather 
                        round the piano. Here we go. 

           Olivia swoops in.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Nic what are you doing?

                                 NIC
                        Giving my daughter her birthday 
                        present.

                        Mom, please--

                        Nic--

                                 NIC
                        Five minutes. Just five minutes.  

           MOMENTS LATER

           Nic is at the piano. Cocktail perched on the lid. He’s in 
           performance mode. Playing the piano softly. Setting a mood. 

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        When she was nine years old, my 
                        daughter and I took our first trip 
                        together. Drove overnight, straight 
                        across the desert to the grand 
                        canyon - and when the sun came up, 
                        we pulled over to the side of the 
                        road, she leaned her head on my 
                        shoulder... and we just watched. 

           Olivia allow herself a smile.
                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        That was one of the happiest 
                        moments of my life. 
                             (then)
                        There was a song playing faintly  
                        in the background from the radio. 
                        And it always makes me think of 
                        you...the most incredible human 
                        being I’ve ever met.  So, happy 
                        birthday, baby. Here goes...

           Nic begins playing more loudly. Clears his throat. It’s 
           “November Rain” by Gun’s N’ Roses.

                        see a love restrained/But darlin’ 
                        when I hold you/Don’t you know I 
                        feel the same...

           Nic stops down...He’s starting to get emotional:

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        I’m just so excited to see what 
                        you’re going to do with your life. 
                        Be a scientist, the governor, a 
                        rich divorce attorney...I just 
                        wouldn’t recommend a life in the 
                        arts. Especially given all the 
                        talent you have, and how often real 
                        talent is unappreciated and 
                        overlooked in this shithole town.    

                                 OLIVIA
                        Okay, thank you, Nic--

           Nic starts back up, sings louder.

                                 OLIVIA

           He hits the wrong chord.

           Nic sits next to Addy. He’s drinking a coffee.

                        I’m so sorry, Adds.

                        It’s fine.

                        Oh, I almost forgot. I got you

           He takes a necklace out of his pocket. 

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        I remember you said you liked it in 
                        a magazine. I don’t know. If you 
                        don’t like it-

                                 ADDY
                        No. I like it. Thank you.

           A long silence...

                                 ADDY (CONT'D)
                        Hey dad?

                                 NIC
                        Yeah.
                                 ADDY
                        Are you okay?

           Nic takes a long sip.

                             (covering)
                        Of course I’m okay.  You don’t have 
                        to worry about me, Adds. Ever.

           Olivia appears at the door.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Nic, I’ll give you a ride home.

           INT. OLIVIA’S CAR - NIGHT

           They cruise down Sunset Blvd. The bright lights flicker off 
           Nic’s face. Nic, trying to sober up, sips coffee... 

                                 NIC
                        It’s just hard, Liv.

           Olivia nods.

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        When she was little she, like, 
                        loved everything I did. And now... 
                        I don’t know.

                                 OLIVIA
                        You guys will find a rhythm. You’ll 
                        just have to work at it.

           She pulls up in front of Sunset Tower. 

                                 NIC
                        You remember when we used to just 
                        lie on the living room floor in the 
                        New York place? And just talk for 
                        hours? Was so easy...

           Olivia takes a second. 

                                 OLIVIA
                        I’m gonna say something I’m not 
                        sure I should...

                        Say it. 
                                 OLIVIA
                        I need you...

                                 NIC
                        Yeah?

                                 OLIVIA
                        I need you to get your shit 
                        together, because Addy needs her 
                        Dad. She doesn’t need... this guy.

           Nic is crestfallen. Off his look we CUT TO:

           EXT. SUNSET BLVD - NIGHT

           Nic watches Olivia drive away. He takes a deep breath.

                                 YOUNG NIC (O.S.)
                             (laughing)
                        Damn.

           Nic turns to see Young Nic standing next to him.

                                 YOUNG NIC (CONT'D)
                        That was hard to watch. Because a 
                        little part of you thought you were 
                        about to get laid. Am I right? 

                                 NIC
                        Okay, you know what? I’m not in the 
                        mood for this right now, so...

           Nic starts to walk away. Young Nic follows.

           INT. SUNSET TOWER / ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

           Nic walks in followed by Young Nic.

                                 YOUNG NIC
                        Oh what? You’re upset because she 
                        said you’re a shitty dad? 

                                 NIC
                        She didn’t say that.

                        Come on. You bought them a 
                        beautiful home in Brentwood. 
                        Private schools. Tennis lessons.

                                 NIC
                        But maybe I could have been, like, 
                        more present or whatever.

                                 YOUNG NIC
                        Bullshit!

           The elevator door opens...

           INT. SUNSET TOWER / HALLWAY

           Nic comes around the corner followed by Young Nic...

                                 NIC
                        Maybe I was being selfish. 
                        Traveling so much. Maybe I should 
                        have worked less--

                        I don’t even know what that means.

                                 YOUNG NIC
                        It means you can’t deny the world 
                        your talent. That would be selfish. 
                        Addy wouldn’t want that. 

           Nic nods. Considering...

                        I don’t know. You think so?

           Nic sighs and slumps down on the floor. He takes out his 
           phone and dials.

                        Well, he’s paying me. 
                             (off her look)
                        Yeah, the whole thing is pretty 
                        sad. 
                             (then)
                        For him.
           The plane suddenly takes a HARD RIGHT TURN. She almost falls.

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        You okay?

           She nods as Nic helps her up.

                                 CAPTAIN (O.S.)
                        We’re encountering a little 
                        electrical problem. Gonna stay low 
                        and look for a place to put her 
                        down nearby. Might be a little 
                        bumpy til we get on the ground. Sit 
                        tight...

           The plane bounces a little in the turbulence. The Flight 
           Attendant straps in.

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        Are you okay?

           Nic puts on his sunglasses.

                                 NIC
                        Is anyone?

           EXT. SMALL, RUNDOWN AIRFIELD - DAY

           Nic is standing outside the plane on a dusty small runway 
           talking on his phone. A black SUV pulls up and a casually 
           dressed MEXICAN MAN steps out, approaches Nic. 

                                 NIC
                             (on phone)
                        Yeah, the plane had a little 
                        trouble. But I’m meeting the driver 
                        now.

           Nic hands the man his duffel. 

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                             (pointing to phone)
                        Sorry. It’s my agent. Gotta take 
                        this.

           The Man nods as he throws the bags into the back of a black 
           SUV, then holds the back door open for Nic.

           INT. VAN/EXT. MEXICAN JUNGLE

           Nic sits in the back, still talking on the phone.
                                 NIC
                        Hey what do we know about this guy 
                        anyway? He just some sad, weird 
                        loser?

                                 PATRICK
                        Allan did some research.
                             (yelling to his assistant)
                        Allan, what’s this guy do? 

           The van moves through the gates of a compound. Two armed 
           GUARDS are outside with semi automatic rifles.  

                                 PATRICK (CONT'D)
                             (to Nic)
                        He owns orange groves or something. 
                        You’re fine. It’s not like he’s 
                        gonna want you to suck his dick or, 
                        like, fuck his wife or something-

                                 NIC
                        People ask that more than you 
                        think. For me to do that kind of 
                        stuff or whatever.

           Inside the sprawling walled compound, we see a number of 
           Spanish style houses. The van stops in a carport area. 

           INT./EXT. MEXICAN COMPOUND - CARPORT

           The Driver gets the duffle out of the back, and brings it 
           around to Nic. 

                                 MAN
                        Senor Nic. Your bag, sir.

           Nic cradles the phone on his shoulder as he gets out his 
           wallet to tip the Man. Looks in it, then puts it away.

                                 NIC
                        Thanks. Thank you. Hey, can I ask 
                        you a question? The guy who owns 
                        the house...

                                 MAN
                        Javi.

                                 NIC
                        Yeah. Javi. Is Javi gonna want me 
                        to, you know...?

                                 MAN
                        I’m not sure that I understand what-
                                 NIC
                             (into phone)
                        Hey can I call you back?
                             (then)
                        Look man, if this Javi guy is gonna 
                        want me to suck his dick, or fuck 
                        his wife, or watch me watch him 
                        fuck his wife. That’s a no go. 
                        That’s no bueno. You understand?

                                 MAN
                        That’s not why you’re--

                                 NIC
                        Sounds crazy, right? But people ask 
                        that way more than you’d think. For 
                        me to do that stuff. And this Javi 
                        guy-

                                 MAN
                        I am Javi. 

           A longer beat. Extends his hand.

                                 NIC
                        Nic Cage.

           Javi smiles. 

                                 JAVI
                        I would have introduced myself 
                        earlier but I didn’t want to 
                        interrupt you.  

                                 NIC
                        Yeah, no, of course. And for the 
                        record, not that many people want 
                        me to, y’know, suck their- 

                                 JAVI
                        I wouldn’t think so.

           An awkward beat.

                                 JAVI (CONT'D)
                        Look, I know this is all pretty 
                        strange. For me too. But I just 
                        want you to enjoy yourself. Have 
                        fun. There’s a swimming pool, 
                        stables if you like to ride...My 
                        house, as they say, is your house.

                                 NIC
                        Terrific.
                                 JAVI
                        Carlos will show you to your room. 
                        Welcome to Mexico, Mr. Cage...

           Javi smiles and walks off as CARLOS DIAZ, a burly security 
           guard in khakis and a linen shirt - a gun on his belt, grabs 
           Nic’s bag.

           EXT. NIC’S ROOM

           Carlos drops Nic’s bag in front of his door. 

                                 NIC
                        Thank you.

                                 CARLOS
                        Not a problem, sir. But I will need 
                        you to sign this. It’s an NDA.

           Carlos produces a piece of paper...

                                 NIC
                        Oh yeah, I don’t sign things. You 
                        can send it to my lawyer.  

                                 CARLOS
                        Well, I need you to sign it because 
                        you’re not permitted to talk about 
                        anything that happens here. 

                                 NIC
                        Trust me, that’s not gonna be a 
                        problem.

                                 CARLOS
                        Sir, please, just sign the 
                        contract. 

                                 NIC
                        I’m not doing it. 

                                 CARLOS
                        It’s my job, man.

                                 NIC
                        Look, I’ve honestly signed some 
                        pretty terrible contracts in Mexico 
                        over the years, and-

                                 CARLOS
                        Jesus, you don’t have to be a... 
                        whatever.
                             (then, in Spanish)

                                 CARLOS (CONT'D)
                        Fucking Hollywood asshole. I don’t 
                        like you. I don’t like your face. 
                        And I don’t like your fucking 
                        movies.

           Nic just stares at him a beat, then...

                                 NIC
                             (sadly, in Spanish)
                        Well you’re not alone on that one. 

           And Nic shuts the door.

           INT. NIC’S ROOM

           Nic puts his bag down. Looks like a very nice, Spanish style 
           hotel room. A welcome package sits on a small desk. A bottle 
           of wine. Various snacks. Like a wedding. Nic picks up a 
           greeting card attached to the wine. He reads aloud.

                                 NIC
                        “Hello Nic Cage.”

           Nic turns it over. That’s it. He goes over and collapses on 
           the bed. He pulls the covers over him. And turns on his side, 
           and finds himself looking up at...

           A big Hollywood MOVIE POSTER with Nic’s face, dead center. 

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Well, how was he?

           Nic stares at the poster, a pained expression on his face...

                                 JAVI (O.S.)
                        He was incredible. 

           INT. JAVI’S MANSION / BEDROOM

           A room resembling a library. A bunch of monitors on a desk. 
           Javi’s talking to GABRIELA RODRIGUEZ, the dark haired, very 
           focused, head of his various companies. She sits at the desk 
           as Javi perches on the side, talking excitedly.

                                 JAVI (CONT’D)
                        Incredible, but also like super 
                        cool. A little taller in person 
                        than I had imagined because they 
                        say actors are pretty short.

                                 GABRIELA
                        But he wasn’t short?
                                 JAVI
                        No. He was, like, just right.

                                 GABRIELA
                        So what did you guys talk about? 

                                 JAVI
                        All kinds of stuff. I mean, not 
                        that much. He was on the phone the 
                        entire time. So we didn’t, like, 
                        “talk”, but we definitely 
                        communicated. Not with words. Or 
                        looks. But there was a vibe.

                                 GABRIELA
                        I’ve never seen you this excited. 
                        You’re honestly glowing. 

                                 JAVI
                        I’m not THAT excited.

                                 GABRIELA
                        You look like you’re pregnant.
                             (then, handing him papers)
                        Hey, I need you to sign off on 
                        these before I forget... We’re 
                        selling some farm equipment, and 
                        moving money out of corn futures 
                        because of the drought-

                                 JAVI
                        Gabi. Stop. You know that I don’t 
                        understand any of this. 

                                 GABRIELA
                        I know you don’t.

                                 JAVI
                        Then why do you insist on asking 
                        me? You’re in charge.

                                 GABRIELA
                        I guess I just like hearing you say 
                        you don’t understand.

                                 JAVI
                             (smiling)
                        I’m sure you do...

           She gets up to leave...
                                 GABRIELA
                        So...did you get a chance to tell 
                        Mr. Cage you’re a writer? That you 
                        have some ideas-

                                 JAVI
                        Gaby, come on. Look who we’re 
                        talking about here. It’s not 
                        realistic. 

           She looks at him skeptically.

                                 JAVI (CONT'D)
                        What? That’s not why I asked him to 
                        come here. 

                                 GABRIELA
                        Oh come on. Your whole life you’ve 
                        wanted to make movies. I know how 
                        much this means to you. 

           They share a long moment...

                                 GABRIELA (CONT'D)
                        And there’s nothing sadder than a 
                        crazy old man babbling incoherently 
                        about the time he almost asked Nic 
                        Cage to read his script.

           Javi laughs, as she grabs her papers back. And walks out...

           EXT. JAVI’S COMPOUND / POOL - NEXT DAY

           Nic, in sunglasses, is lounging hard on a wooden pool chair. 
           Still in the bathrobe and bathing suit. Javi, Gabriela and 
           LUCAS (DESCRIBE) enter. Javi nervously walks up, and lays 
           down on the chaise next to Nic. They look out over a large 
           untamed jungle.  

                                 JAVI
                        Hi.

                                 NIC
                        Hey.

           Beat.

                                 JAVI
                        Cool, so... 

           A longer beat. Javi think he hears something.
                                 JAVI (CONT'D)
                        Huh?

                                 NIC
                        What?

                                 JAVI
                        No. Thought you said something. 
                        Never mind. 
                             (then)
                        I want to introduce you to my 
                        business partner Gabriela and my 
                        cousin Lucas. 

           Gabriela and Lucas approach. 

                                 GABRIELA
                        Mr. Cage, we’re so excited to have 
                        you here. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Damn. A million bucks just to show 
                        up and drink by the pool. I want 
                        your job. 

           Nic smiles wryly. 

                                 JAVI
                        So... what’re you working on next?

                                 NIC
                        That’s honestly like the worst 
                        thing you could ask an actor.

                                 JAVI
                        Oh, yeah. No. I’ve very sorry--

                                 NIC
                        But it’s fine, since I’m no longer 
                        an actor.

                                 JAVI
                        What? 

                                 NIC
                        I’ve done everything I set out to 
                        do acting wise, you know? Time for 
                        a new challenge. Time for something 
                        that scares me. 

                                 JAVI
                        So what are you going to do?
                                 NIC
                        I think I want to build furniture. 
                        Work with my hands, y’know? Chairs. 
                        Bookcases.  Maybe a table. No! 
                        Wait. Not chairs. I don’t love 
                        chairs.

                                 GABRIELA
                        My uncle makes furniture in Mexico 
                        City. Beautiful stuff. Gorgeous 
                        wood and natural rivets. 

                                 NIC
                        What a life.

                                 GABRIELA
                        He apprenticed with my grandfather 
                        for twenty five years before 
                        feeling comfortable enough to go 
                        out on his own.
                             (then, realizing)
                        Not that...

                                 NIC
                        Yeah, no. Some things take... 
                        longer for certain people.

           Some uncomfortable shifting.

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        Not that he’s not truly skilled.

                                 LUCAS
                        He’s truly skilled.

                                 NIC
                        Well, maybe I could visit his shop, 
                        or--

                                 GABRIELA
                        The prolonged exposure to the 
                        furniture stain left him 
                        permanently brain damaged. 
                        Unfortunately. 

           A long beat.

                                 JAVI
                        So tell us about making the Rock. 

                                 GABRIELA
                        You and Sean Connery were so good 
                        together. 
                                 NIC
                        Sean’s the best. Yeah, that was a 
                        long time ago. 

                                 LUCAS
                        It was a very long time ago. Bet 
                        you wish you were still making 
                        movies like that. 

           What the fuck is this guy’s problem? Nic stands up, still 
           holding his drink. 

                                 NIC
                        Okay, well...
                             (to Gabriela)
                        It was nice meeting you. 

           Nic heads off, carrying a bottle of tequila. 

                                 JAVI
                        Mr. Cage, wait, I’m sorry, he 
                        didn’t mean it like that...

           But Nic walks off. 

                                 JAVI (CONT'D)
                        Mr. Cage?

           EXT. JAVI’S COMPOUND / LONG LAWN - NIGHT 

           Nic is passed out on the lawn. An empty tequila bottle next 
           to him. The sprinklers start to come on.

           OFF NIC’S FACE, starting to get wet, Javi walking towards 
           him. Javi picks Nic up, holding him draped across his arms, 
           and begins to carry Nic towards the house.

           INT. JAVI’S COMPOUND / NIC’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Javi lays Nic down on his bed. Starts to take his shoes off. 
           Nic stirs...his eyes flutter open.

                                 NIC
                        Hey Jav, you ever feel like the 
                        best day of your life has already 
                        happened? Like, the best day you’re 
                        ever going to have...

                                 JAVI
                        I think you have a lot of great 
                        days ahead of you, Nic Cage. 
                                 NIC
                             (covering)
                        What? No, I know. I was talking 
                        about you. 

                                 JAVI
                        Oh, well...I don’t know. I guess-

           He realizes Nic’s eyes are closed. 

                                 JAVI (CONT'D)
                        Nic?

           Nothing, as we CUT TO:

           INT. JAVI’S MANSION / SCREENING ROOM

           Javi is watching the Nic Cage film, “Captain Corelli’s 
           Mandolin” in his private theater. He’s silently mouthing 
           along to the words. Gabriela comes and sits next to him.

                                 GABRIELA
                        You okay?

                                 JAVI
                        I’m fine. But Nic’s in a pretty 
                        dark place, emotionally.
                             (then)
                        I mean, he can’t quit acting. Look 
                        at this...

           Javi gestures to a scene where Captain Corelli tenderly 
           strums the mandolin...

                                 GABRIELA
                        Well, maybe he just needs to reset. 
                        Remember what he loves about it. 

           Javi considers. 

                                 GABRIELA (CONT'D)
                        You could take him to the ruins. 
                        That always seems to work for you.

                                 JAVI
                        Yeah, maybe he’d like that. I’ll go 
                        first thing.

           INT. NIC’S ROOM - THE NEXT DAY

           We’re on Nic as he sleeps hard. We hear a knock on his door. 
           Nic keeps sleeping. We hear several more knocks. 
           Nic doesn’t flinch. We hear the door unlock. And open. 
           Footsteps. We stay with Nic, until he slowly comes to, 
           rubbing his head and neck. He suddenly realizes someone’s 
           there.

                                 NIC
                        WHOA! Hello?

           It’s Gabriela. And she doesn’t look happy.

                                 GABRIELA
                        I’m sorry to wake you. But it’s 
                        nearly 4pm, and-

                                 NIC
                        I’m sorry, do you need something?

                                 GABRIELA
                        Yes, Mr. Cage. Mr. Gutierrez has 
                        been waiting all day for you to 
                        wake up so he can take you on a 
                        trip to the Mayan ruins.

                                 NIC
                        Yeah, can you let Javi know I’m not 
                        gonna make that? 

           He goes back underneath the covers.

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                             (from under the covers)
                        Thank you. 

           She rips them off.

                                 GABRIELA
                             (gets intense)
                        Mr. Cage. I believe you’ve been 
                        more than fairly compensated for 
                        your time here. So if Mr. Gutierrez 
                        wants to drive out to the temples, 
                        you’re going to get out of bed and 
                        join him. And you’re going to enjoy 
                        it. Do I make myself clear?

           Off Gabriela...

           INT. JAVI’S JEEP - DUSK

           Nic rides in the open top jeep next to Javi. He looks fucking 
           miserable. 
                                 JAVI
                        Gabriela said you were very excited 
                        to see the temple. 

           Nic forces a wry smile.

                                 NIC
                        Big time.  

           A long moment.

                                 JAVI
                        I don’t think you should quit 
                        acting.

                                 NIC
                        Yeah, well, I appreciate your 
                        concern, but-- Hey, so how far are 
                        these temples? It’s starting to 
                        rain.

                                 JAVI
                        If you quit now, you’ll regret it 
                        forever. Because you have a gift, 
                        Nic. A gift from God or the 
                        universe or whatever- 

                                 NIC
                        Is there a top for this jeep? I 
                        mean, it’s really coming down-- 

                                 JAVI
                        For crissakes, Nic Cage! You love 
                        acting! You love playing make 
                        believe! And as your friend, I 
                        won’t stand by while you--

                                 NIC
                        Dude! Stop! You’re paying me to be 
                        here, okay? You don’t know me, 
                        we’re not friends, and you 
                        definitely don’t know what the fuck 
                        will make me happy! 

           Nic is breathing hard. Staring at Javi as this lands. 

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        But I do. Furniture.

           Javi, exasperated, SLAMS his foot on the brake. The Jeep 
           skids to a stop in the now pouring rain. Javi jumps out, 
           grabs his backpack, and takes off running.

                        Jesus. What are you doing?

                                 JAVI
                        We’re on the run, Nic.

                                 NIC
                        From what? 

           Javi takes off running. Nic looks around. No one there.

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        Where are you going? Javi! JAVI!

           By now it’s dark. And actually scary. Nic, not wanting to be 
           left alone, jumps out of the car. In the distance he sees 
           Javi’s flashlight. Nic starts running after him.

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        Will you just stop for a second and-  

           LIGHTNING crackles through the air. DEEP THUNDER FOLLOWS.

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        HOLY SHIT. 

                                 JAVI
                        Faster! 

           Nic has no choice. He keeps running. And running. Chasing 
           after Javi. Finally he moves through some thick bushes and 
           finds Javi at the edge of a CLIFF.

           EXT. MEXICAN JUNGLE / CLIFF - NIGHT

           Nic, breathing heavily, lays into Javi...

                                 NIC
                        Okay, man. You’re need to tell me 
                        right now what the hell is going 
                        on, or I’m getting my shit and 
                        going back to LA. I don’t care 
                        about your birthday or--

           LIGHTNING strikes again. Startles them. Javi is clearly 
           “acting.” He’s trying to get Nic to play along...

                                 JAVI
                             (overacting)
                        They’re coming! And when they do, 
                        that’ll be it for us. Adios. 
                        Finito. Bye bye. 
                                 NIC
                        What? Why are you talking like 
                        that??

                                 JAVI
                        The General is coming! He forbade 
                        his daughter Matilda - I called her 
                        Maddy - he forbade us to see each 
                        other. But we defied him. And now 
                        he wants to END MY LIFE.

           Nic looks around. There’s obviously no one there.

                                 NIC
                        Oh, okay. Great. I get what you’re 
                        doing. A little Stanislavski acting 
                        thing? Well you can stop now. 

                                 JAVI
                             (undeterred)
                        These people, they’re not like you 
                        and I. They smell blood? They come 
                        running. We have to jump. 

           The rain BARRELS down on Javi. He’s backlit at the edge of 
           the cliff. He looks completely unhinged as he starts 
           stripping down.

                                 NIC
                        Come on, man. Just stop. I want to 
                        go back to the house and--

                                 JAVI
                        THEY WILL FUCKING KILL YOU. And I 
                        can’t let that happen. Come on! 
                        They’re almost to the edge of the 
                        jungle! I can hear them!

           Nic looks back at the jungle. Takes a deep breath. Closes his 
           eyes. And when he turns back to Javi, Nic has transformed. 

           He is MOVIE STAR NIC CAGE. 

                                 NIC
                             (intense)
                        Just tell me one thing...do you 
                        love her?

                                 JAVI
                             (begins smiling)
                        I’ve always loved her. 

           Nic starts stripping down.
                                 NIC
                        Then that means getting you out of 
                        here alive. We have to jump.

                                 JAVI
                        You serious?

                                 NIC
                        They’re at the edge of the jungle! 

                                 JAVI
                             (calmly)
                        Let’s do this.

           They run and LEAP through the air just as LIGHTNING HITS THE 
           EDGE OF THE CLIFF. They hit the water. When Nic surfaces, 
           looks up the charred rock. 

                                 NIC
                        HOLY SHIT! We almost died. Right 
                        there, Javi. We actually almost 
                        died right up there!

                                 JAVI
                        But look at the bright side, Mr. 
                        Cage... 
                             (whispering)
                        We got away.

           A moment, then Nic just starts LAUGHING.

           EXT. JUNGLE  / CLIFF SIDE

           The rain has passed. Nic and Javi lie under the stars on 
           smoking a joint.

                                 NIC
                        You’re crazy man. I like that about 
                        you.

           Javi smiles as he takes a hit of the joint, passes to Nic.

                        girl.

                        Underrated, for sure. She was the 
                        makeup artist. She was fun, smart, 
                        beautiful. I mean, we were super 
                        similar.

           A couple bottles of wine on the floor. Nic and Javi are

                        Pass me the wine.

           LATER 

           Nic is showing Javi how to disarm a man. 

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        Don’t be scared. Hold the gun up to 
                        my head. 

                                 JAVI
                        I’m pretty drunk.

                                 NIC
                        Doesn’t matter. Because in a
                        high pressure situation, I can just 
                        do... this.
           Nic very quickly fucks up the disarm. The gun falls to the 
           ground. Tries it one more time. Fucks it up.

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        I think you’re holding the gun 
                        wrong or something. Whatever.

           LATER

           They continue to drink. 

                                 JAVI
                        So...you ever written anything?

                                 NIC
                        Like a screenplay? No. 
                             (then)
                        Actually, yes. But more with my 
                        acting than with words. Most times 
                        you can say way more with a look 
                        than with just like, stupid 
                        dialogue written by some depressed 
                        fucking slob in Los Angeles.

                                 JAVI
                        That look you did in Wild at Heart 
                        at the end of the-

                                 NIC
                        Opening scene? After he’s killed 
                        the guy... 

                                 JAVI
                        And Sailor Ripley looks up at the 
                        girl. Points. Crazy look on his 
                        face. That honestly said more than 
                        any line of dialogue ever could.

                                 NIC
                        I fucking love that you get that!

           Javi is beaming.

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        Hey, what do you think I should do 
                        next? Like as a fan, what would you 
                        want to see?

                                 JAVI
                        Honestly, you should do some more 
                        character work. Turn in a couple 
                        great performances in an ensemble, 
                        you know?
                                 NIC
                        Yeah.

                                 JAVI
                        Remind people of how great you are. 
                        But like in a subtle way.
                             (then)
                        Hey, didn’t want to tell you this 
                        before, but I’ve actually written a 
                        few screenplays myself, and one in 
                        particular--

                                 NIC
                        I’d love to read it. 

                                 JAVI
                        Are you serious?

                                 NIC
                        I’ll read it right now. Do you have 
                        a hard copy? 

                                 JAVI
                             (getting nervous)
                        I don’t.

                                 NIC
                        Email it.

                                 JAVI
                        There are a few tweaks I need to 
                        make. I want you to have the best 
                        draft.

                                 NIC
                        I’m used to reading works in 
                        progress.

                                 JAVI
                        Dude stop pressuring me!

           Nic realizes something.

                                 NIC
                        Ohhh. Okay. How long you been 
                        working on this thing?

                                 JAVI
                        Four, five years. Maybe six all 
                        together.
                             (off Nic’s look)
                        The third act isn’t finished. 
                                 NIC
                        It’s not finished because you know 
                        that as soon as it is, you’ll have 
                        to put it out there. And that 
                        terrifies you, because you’ll face 
                        rejection. And that hurts. Hurts 
                        deep down in here. 

           He points to Javi’s chest.

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        The question is, do you have the 
                        courage to keep going? To keep 
                        writing? To walk through the fire? 
                        Because that’s what being an writer 
                        is. But you’re not a writer yet, 
                        are you? You’re just a liar.

           Javi looks crushed. He gets up off the floor.

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        Whatever, though. Being a writer 
                        fucking sucks anyway. 
                             (then)
                        Hey, should we go into town and get 
                        a mezcal? 

                                 JAVI
                        Aaah, y’know I think I’m gonna call 
                        it a night. 

                                 NIC
                        Yeah, yeah. Okay. Me too. 

           EXT. MEXICAN ROAD - NIGHT

           Nic walks down the side of the road, when he hears something. 

                                 YOUNG NIC
                        Wow. You really gave it to that 
                        guy.

                                 NIC
                        You think it was too harsh? I was 
                        just trying to be honest with him.

                                 YOUNG NIC
                        It was brutal. I mean, just tell 
                        him what he wants to hear. The 
                        guy’s got nothing else going for 
                        him.
                                 NIC
                        I think he’s alright. He’s got good 
                        taste in movies. And he had some 
                        good ideas about my career.

                                 YOUNG NIC
                        Yeah?

                                 NIC
                        Yeah. I think it might be a good 
                        idea to take a couple cool, smaller 
                        roles. Do some challenging 
                        character work.

                                 YOUNG NIC
                        Interesting. So like... the gay 
                        uncle in the next Duplass Brothers 
                        movie kind of thing? 

                                 NIC
                        Exactly--

           SLAP! Young Nic open hand slaps Nic across the face. Nic 
           screams.

                                 YOUNG NIC
                        What the fuck are you talking 
                        about?

                                 NIC
                             (re: his lip)
                        Jesus Christ, I’m bleeding.

                                 YOUNG NIC
                        We haven’t worked for thirty years 
                        so you can be 7th on the call sheet 
                        for some goddamn student film! 

                                 NIC
                        I think it’s a good idea--

           SLAP! He hits him again. 

                                 YOUNG NIC
                             (softens a little)
                        Listen to me. You are Nicolas 
                        Fucking Cage. You are a once in a 
                        generation talent. 

           Young Nic takes Nic’s face in his hands. 

                                 YOUNG NIC (CONT'D)
                        Addy doesn’t need a goddamn

                        She needs you to be a star. You’ll 
                        get the next role. I promise. And 
                        then we’ll start climbing our way 
                        back up.

           Not that we went anywhere.
                                              Not that we went anywhere.

                                 YOUNG NIC (CONT'D)
                        You trust me, right?

                                 NIC
                        Yeah. Yeah.  

                                 YOUNG NIC
                        I love you, baby.

           Young Nic takes his face, kisses him on the cheek, as a LONE 
           CAR approaches headed into town. Nic waves it down. It’s a 
           PICKUP TRUCK.

                                 NIC
                             (approaching)
                        Amigo. ¿Vas a la ciudad?

           The DRIVER turns around. Waves him into the back. Another MAN 
           sits in the back with a blanket around his shoulders.

           INT. MEXICAN PICKUP TRUCK

           Nic settles back into his seat. He looks over at a weary, 
           overweight man who looks like he’s had just about enough.  
           This is IRVING DUQUESNE.

                                 IRVING
                        How’re you liking Mexico? 

                                 NIC
                        Honestly, I’m having a great time. 

                                 IRVING
                        Where are you staying?

                                 NIC
                        Oh, with a friend. Beautiful 
                        spread. Nice little working 
                        vacation. You’re American?

                                 MAN
                        And what does this friend do for a 
                        living?
                                 NIC
                        Something with fruit. I don’t know. 
                        I’m sorry who are you?

           The pickup truck takes a HARD right turn and speeds up. Nic 
           is on alert.

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        Hey, hold on. What the fuck is 
                        happening here? Can you slow down a 
                        little bit?

           But the Driver doesn’t slow down. Nic looks at the Man.

                                 IRVING
                        Nic. I need you to listen to me 
                        very carefully. My name is Irving 
                        Duquesne. And for the last 7 years 
                        I’ve been living in a slum outside 
                        of Tijuana, mining my contacts, 
                        looking for a way to take down an 
                        organization that makes an 
                        estimated 32 billion dollars a year 
                        and is responsible for more than 80 
                        percent of the cocaine that enters 
                        the United States. One organization 
                        linked to more than sixteen 
                        thousand murders in the last ten 
                        years alone. 

           Nic goes to talk. Irving holds up his hand. 

                                 IRVING (CONT'D)
                        And I’m getting nowhere, until one 
                        day, out of the blue, I see a wire 
                        from a Cayman bank account linked 
                        to El Dios Rojo - a known 
                        psychopath, a mass murderer, and 
                        one of the most dangerous men in 
                        the entire world. A man believed to 
                        pull the strings for the exact 
                        organization I’ve been trying to 
                        destroy. A man who sits at the top 
                        of the Juarez Cartel. A wire from 
                        that man went into the bank account 
                        of none other than actor Nicolas 
                        fucking Cage. A wire from a man 
                        you’ve come to know only...as Mr. 
                        Javier Gutierrez.

                        don’t think we’re talking about the 
                        same Javi. 

           Irving grabs an ipad from a knapsack and gives it to Nic.

                        Here he is with the head of the 
                        Colombian cartel. Next one with the 
                        head of security for the Juarez. 
                        With a reported liaison from 
                        Chicago, the main distribution hub 
                        in the US. Nic, why do you think 
                        your plane diverted mid flight to a 
                        shitty, off the grid airfield?

                        They said electrical problems.

                                 IRVING
                        Or was it because our guys were 
                        tracking that plane in conjunction 
                        with the Mexican government?  

           Nic, resigned, hands the ipad back. He’s seen enough.

                        So what do you want from me?

                                 IRVING
                        The Mexican presidential election 
                        is in two weeks. President Chavez, 
                        who is cartel friendly, is running 
                        against media baron Marcos Lopez.

                                 NIC
                        So the United States supports 
                        Lopez. 

                                 IRVING
                        Exactly. Now Lopez’s daughter was 
                        kidnapped in the middle of the 
                        night last week from a Vanderbilt 
                        University dorm. It’s a blatant 
                        effort to force Lopez out of the 
                        race. And we believe one man is 
                        responsible - Mr. Javier Gutierrez.

                        daughter back?

                        working this from a million 
                        different angles, but you are 
                        uniquely positioned to gather intel

                        valuable to the US government.

                        I’m sorry, Irving. But I can’t do 
                        it. I have a family-

           Irving takes the ipad and pulls up a video. There’s a girl in 
           a small, dirty room, sobbing. 

                                 IRVING
                        They sent this to us yesterday as 
                        proof she’s alive.

           Irving just stares at him. Nic takes a deep breath.

           Irving knocks on the cab window twice. The pickup truck slows 
           down, and begins to make a U-turn.

           EXT. JAVI’S COMPOUND - NIGHT

           Party in full swing. People begin to sit down at an elaborate 
           dinner table. Waiters in tuxedos buzz around...

                        dinner. The moment it’s served...

           EXT. JAVI’S MANSION

           As plates are put onto the tables, Nic stands up. Mouths 
           “excuse me.”

                                 IRVING (V.O.)
                        ...you excuse yourself. Say you’re 
                        headed to the bathroom.

           EXT. JAVI’S COMPOUND WALL - NIGHT

           Nic watches the people at the party in the distance, then 
           makes his move to the back of Javi’s mansion. 

                                 IRVING (V.O.)
                        Once you’re in, we believe there’s 
                        a secure computer system in his 
                        personal office.
           Nic pulls out a gadget and attaches it to his phone. A high 
           tech gadget analyzes the lock on a back door, then picks it. 
           Nic slips inside.

           EXT. JAVI’S MANSION

           At the dinner table, Javi calls Carlos over.

                                 JAVI
                        Carlos. My eyes are going. I can’t 
                        read my speech off my phone. Print 
                        a copy off the computer in my 
                        bedroom. Thank you.

           Carlos nods, heads off...

           INT. JAVI’S MANSION - NIGHT

           Nic creeps into the master bedroom. Through an open door, he 
           sees a book lined office with a computer...  

                                 IRVING (V.O.)
                        A computer technician we were 
                        monitoring installed a computer in 
                        an office just off the master 
                        bedroom. 

           INT. JAVI’S OFFICE - SAME

           Nic crouches in front of the computer on the desk.

                        We’ll need you to insert a drive 
                        into the machine, and run an 
                        operation to download its entire 
                        contents. 

           Nic struggles trying to fit the drive in the computer. 
           Finally gets it in. Hitting keys. Not working. Tries again.

                        Come on... one more time.

           OUTSIDE THE HOUSE Carlos walks toward the front door.

           IN JAVI’S OFFICE Nic holds his breath. Starting to sweat. 

           ON SCREEN: The contents of Javi’s computer start downloading. 
           A progress report shows up. 1%...5%... Nic exhales. 
           OUTSIDE THE HOUSE Carlos opens the front door. As the door 
           SLAMS. 

           IN JAVI’S OFFICE Nic’s ears perk up.

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        Fuck.

           Nic hears footsteps on the tile. He immediately runs for the 
           bedroom door - the only entrance to the office. He very 
           quietly shuts the bedroom door. And turns the lock. 

           Seconds later. The DOORKNOB jiggles.

                                 CARLOS (O.S.)
                        Hello? Someone in there?

           IN JAVI’S OFFICE Nic looks at the computer. 60%...65%...

                                 NIC
                             (quietly)
                        Hurry up!

           Nic opens the window, looking for an alternate way out. It’s 
           a long way down. 85%...90%... The doorknob jiggles again. 

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        Come on. Come on. Come on.

           ON CARLOS as he KICKS OPEN THE BEDROOM DOOR.

           ON NIC in the office, now frantic. ON screen: 100%. Nic 
           silently removes the drive. Puts in his jacket.

           ON CARLOS as he walks through the bedroom. He enters the 
           office, weapon drawn...

           But no one is there. He walks over to the open window.

           OUTSIDE THE WINDOW Nic drops down from a hanging, vine 
           covered trellis. Pins himself up against the wall. Carlos at 
           the window above him. 

                                 CARLOS
                        Hello?

           Nic holds his breath. Finally, the window SHUTS. Nic lets out 
           a sigh of relief, as we CUT TO:

                             (taking a deep breath)
                        A few years ago, my relationship 
                        with my father had deteriorated to 
                        the point where we were no longer 
                        speaking. He could be extremely 
                        difficult, and to be fair, maybe 
                        I’m not much better.

                        But when he got sick, I realized I 
                        couldn’t lose him before we 
                        repaired our broken relationship. I 
                        knew we needed to find some common 
                        ground, but I didn’t know how. And 
                        as my father got sicker and sicker, 
                        I got more and more depressed. And 
                        then, one day, as he lay dying in 
                        the bed next to me, it just 
                        happened. It was a miracle.  I 
                        looked up and saw... 

           Everyone leans forward.

                        High up on a tiny hospital TV, 
                        Showtime was playing Guarding Tess.

           People are slightly confused. Nic is not.
                                 JAVI (CONT'D)
                        We disagreed about literally 
                        everything when he was alive. 
                        Except for that movie. We both 
                        loved it. And we’d quote it back 
                        and forth all day long after that. 
                        Only later, after he passed, did I 
                        realize that my father was Tess, 
                        and I was Doug Chesnic, the Secret 
                        Service agent taking care of him.

                        of my father and I, I want to thank 
                        you.

           Nic is moved. Almost to tears...

                                 NIC
                        You don’t know how much that means 
                        to hear you say that.

                                 JAVI
                        Bet you never knew Doug Chesnic 
                        could mean so much to someone...

           Nic wipes his eyes.

                                 NIC
                        Wellllll, no. I did. 
                             (then)
                        I mean, I knew Doug was a great 
                        character. I knew that.

                                 JAVI
                        Yeah, yeah. Of course.

                                 NIC
                        But at the same time, I like that 
                        you recognized what I brought to 
                        the role. 

                                 JAVI
                        Uh huh. 

                                 NIC
                        Because it wasn’t all on the page, 
                        so to speak. A lot of that - most 
                        of it - was in the performance. So, 
                        that’s cool.
                                 JAVI
                        It was extraordinary.

                                 NIC
                        I’m so happy it helped you. And 
                        your father. May he rest in peace.

           Nic picks up a champagne glass. Holds it up, as we CUT TO:

           INT. OLD SHED - DAY

           Nic sits waiting as the Irving analyzes the data. Nic talks 
           to him, but he’s not really listening.   

                                 NIC
                        It just didn’t feel great. 
                        Betraying Javi like that. 

                                 IRVING
                        I know this was hard on you. 

                                 NIC
                             (not really listening)
                        But what’s crazy is I could 
                        definitely see myself doing more of 
                        this. Particularly if the money was 
                        right-

                                 IRVING
                        Well, good. Because we need you to 
                        stay at his place for a while 
                        longer. 

                                 NIC
                             (very scared)
                        What? No, no, no that’s...no. Fuck! 
                        I mean, this wasn’t part of the 
                        deal--

                                 IRVING
                        Deal’s changed. I need a couple 
                        more days to finish analyzing this 
                        stuff... 

                                 NIC
                        Okay, very cool but I’m supposed to 
                        be on a plane home in five hours. 

                                 IRVING
                        And you’re five million dollars in 
                        debt to the US government. You help 
                        us, Nic, and the Attorney General 
                        is prepared to erase it.
           Nic thinks this over.

                                 NIC
                        And if I don’t?

                                 IRVING
                        Then given your current financial 
                        situation,  you’re probably looking 
                        at a long stint in a federal 
                        penitentiary. I like you Nic. And I 
                        didn’t want to put you in this 
                        position. But the guys upstairs are 
                        offering you - and your family - a 
                        damn good deal here.

           Nic looks up at Irving. He knows what he has to do.

                                 NIC
                        Well we’ll have to invent a reason 
                        for me to stay, won’t we?

           Irving nods.

           INT. JAVI’S MANSION - NIGHT

           Nic and Javi are having dinner. Javi has a black moleskine 
           notebook. 

                                 NIC
                        ...I just have a feeling we can 
                        really knock something out of the 
                        park. 

                                 JAVI
                        This is... you have no idea how 
                        honored I am. Writing a movie with 
                        you, it’s....

                                 NIC
                        No, it’s gonna be great. We’ll 
                        build this thing from the ground 
                        up. 

                                 JAVI
                        I love it.

                                 NIC
                        But if we’re gonna do it, we should 
                        get on the same page. 

                                 JAVI
                        Yes. Of course.  
                                 NIC
                        I think the film should be 
                        completely character driven. 

                                 JAVI
                        Definitely. I agree.

                                 NIC
                        Something that doesn’t rely on 
                        special effects. Or big explosions. 

                                 JAVI
                        It has to be nuanced.

                                 NIC
                        And work on multiple levels. 

                                 JAVI
                        It should be completely about the 
                        performances.

                                 NIC
                        Fuck yes. Man, this is gonna be 
                        good.   

           A long beat as they both take a sip of wine.

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        So...what is it?

                                 JAVI
                        I don’t know. 

           A long beat. They think.

                                 JAVI (CONT'D)
                        Maybe it’s just about... this.

                                 NIC
                        This?

                                 JAVI
                        You and I. A movie about us. Our 
                        relationship. I mean, you coming 
                        down here for my birthday party. 
                        Two guys who don’t yet realize they 
                        need each other.

           Off Nic, considering.

           10 MINUTES LATER

           Nic is pouring some wine. They’ve started drinking.
                                 NIC
                        So I guess if you boil it 
                        down...it’s a story about how your 
                        character finally gets to meet his 
                        hero, right?

                                 JAVI
                        Maybe, yeah...

                                 NIC
                        And normally they say “Don’t meet 
                        your heroes.” But in this case it’s 
                        like “Meet your hero and watch him 
                        change your life.” 

                                 JAVI
                        Right, right...OR maybe we have a 
                        thing where my character helps your 
                        character change too. Like he helps 
                        him awaken as an artist... and as a 
                        father. 

                                 NIC
                        That’s interesting. 

                                 JAVI
                        See, I think of my character as 
                        this kind of guru, sort of a Christ 
                        figure.

                                 NIC
                        Your character is a Christ figure? 
                        Hm. I don’t love that. 
                        Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. 

           Off Nic’s “Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm”....

           10 MINUTES LATER

                                 JAVI
                        Okay, so they’re both Christ 
                        figures. 

                                 NIC
                        Dueling Christ figures. That makes 
                        sense.

                                 JAVI
                        But, like, who are these guys?  
                        Like, on a deep level, you know?
                                 NIC
                        Right, right...
                             (then)
                        The word “genius” gets thrown 
                        around a lot, so I’m thinking of my 
                        character as more of a 
                        misunderstood genius. 

                                 JAVI
                        Okay. So still a genius, though?

                                 NIC
                        Yeah. Misunderstood one. 

                                 JAVI
                        Got it.

           Writing it down.

                                 NIC
                        At this point, he’s being slightly 
                        overlooked by Hollywood. Which 
                        sucks because his tools are sharper 
                        than ever. Almost too sharp. But he 
                        needs the right role. The right 
                        opportunity. 

                                 JAVI
                        Right, totally... but maybe he also 
                        needs to fix his relationship with 
                        his daughter. Just to keep the 
                        stakes more personal.

                                 NIC
                        Yes, definitely... but that’s not 
                        his main problem. His main problem 
                        is he’s not getting the right 
                        chances.

                                 JAVI
                        Yup, love that... but maybe once he 
                        fixes his relationship with his 
                        family, then the roles start to 
                        come because-- 

                                 NIC
                        Right, that’s perfect. But I think 
                        it’s actually the other way around. 
                        If he just gets the right role, 
                        then everything else in his life 
                        will get fixed. Right? 

           Javi can see Nic’s not budging on this. 
                                 JAVI
                        Okay, okay. So, maybe my character 
                        is secretly in love with a co-
                        worker, but he can’t act on it 
                        because--

                                 NIC
                        I’m sorry. Can we keep going on my 
                        character for a bit? I just felt 
                        like we were getting on a roll. 

                                 JAVI
                        Oh, yeah. Of course. 

                                 NIC
                        And he probably speaks a couple 
                        languages. Maybe three. Or, if he’s 
                        a real man of the world, maybe five 
                        is better.

           10 MIN LATER

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        Actually, I think five IS better. 
                        It gives my character pathos. And 
                        it’s something I can really latch 
                        onto. 

                                 JAVI
                        Speaking of, I was thinking... 
                        maybe my character has some sort of 
                        big painful secret.

                                 NIC
                        Yeah, maybe. 

                                 JAVI
                             (getting excited)
                        And it torments him. He’s lived a 
                        life of denial and anguish. He 
                        longs for some kind of inner peace. 
                        And always has.

                                 NIC
                        That’s cool. But I guess if we’re 
                        doing secrets, then... just for 
                        symmetry’s sake, maybe both 
                        characters should have one? 

                                 JAVI
                        Right, right. Yeah. So each 
                        character is lying to the other? 
                        That kinda what you’re thinking?
                                 NIC
                        Yeah. But, like, if it ends up 
                        being too much or whatever, we 
                        could just make it my character. 
                        And that would probably work just 
                        as well. Maybe even better.

           INT. NIC’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Nic is sitting next to the running shower in his room. He’s 
           on the phone with Irving. 

                                 NIC
                        It’s actually been...amazing. I 
                        know it wasn’t the plan, but, I 
                        mean, Irv... this could be a viable 
                        project. An awards play. 

                                 IRVING
                        Sure, but--

                                 NIC
                        Granted, we still need to figure 
                        out act three, but the movie 
                        totally works.

                                 IRVING
                        Nic--

                                 NIC
                        And I know Javi has his issues, but 
                        my god, he has an unbelievably 
                        intuitive sense for story--

                                 IRVING
                        He kidnapped a 16 year old girl! 
                        And every day that passes, the 
                        likelihood goes up that girl is 
                        going to be murdered by Javi or one 
                        of his men. 

                                 NIC
                        Okay. Okay. Jesus. What do you want 
                        me to do?

                                 IRVING
                        We’re figuring out an actionable 
                        plan, but in the meantime, you’re 
                        going to add a plot line to the 
                        movie...
                                 NIC
                        That could be tough. It’s just more 
                        of a character study at the moment--

                                 IRVING
                             (ignoring)
                        A plot line where your daughter - 
                        with whom you have a pretty screwed 
                        up relationship - comes to visit 
                        you in Mexico, and is immediately 
                        kidnapped. That way you can ask 
                        Javi where he might “theoretically” 
                        hold a hostage.

                                 NIC
                        I get what you’re going for, here. 
                        But do really expect that to work?

                                 IRVING
                        Get him talking. Maybe he slips up. 
                        Reveals something. It’s worth a 
                        shot.  

                                 NIC
                        Irv, this is a small, grounded, 
                        adult drama about two tough, 
                        beautiful, sensitive men and their 
                        unlikely friendship. They’re kind 
                        of, like, dueling Christ figures. 
                        Or maybe just my character is a 
                        Christ figure, we still have to 
                        figure that out, but we can’t have 
                        a kidnapping. If I bring this into 
                        the mix, he’s gonna know 
                        something’s up. Javi’s a real 
                        hardliner when it comes to “tone.”

           Irving starts to lose it. 

                                 IRVING
                        Jesus fucking Christ! 
                             (then, calming down)
                        You know what, Nic...

           Irving thinks for a beat, realizes Nic’s weakness...

                                 IRVING (CONT'D)
                        I just think a kidnapping could 
                        give the movie a wider appeal. I 
                        mean, it’s pretty tough to find an 
                        audience these days, right? 

           Nic considers.
                                 NIC
                        Unless you’re, like, the Hunger 
                        Games or whatever.

                                 IRVING
                        Doesn’t sound like this is that. 

                                 NIC
                        No. This is an intelligent, mature, 
                        film for grown ups. 

                                 IRVING
                        Now, personally, I want smart, 
                        character driven adult dramas about 
                        real life. Real people. But, the 
                        reality is -- I’m not most people.

                                 NIC
                        You certainly are not.

                                 IRVING
                        And I just think most people need a 
                        bit of a hook. Just to get them in 
                        the theater. 

                                 NIC
                        Right. You just need to get them in 
                        the theater. 

                                 IRVING
                        Gotta get them in the theater. And 
                        for that, you need a trailer 
                        moment. You know what I’m thinking?

           INT. JAVI’S MANSION

           Nic paces, a little nervously, while Javi lays on his back on 
           the floor.

                                 JAVI
                        Hold on, hold on. Your daughter 
                        gets kidnapped? 

                                 NIC
                        Uh huh. It’s a trailer moment.

                                 JAVI
                        But who kidnaps her?
                                 NIC
                        I don’t know. Bad guys. It’ll give 
                        our characters something to fight 
                        for. They put their lives on the 
                        line to save the daughter, and 
                        become better men for it. It’s 
                        classic.

                                 JAVI
                        It feels like a completely 
                        different movie. 

                                 NIC
                        No. It’s the same movie. Now it 
                        just has a big hook. 

                                 JAVI
                        The relationship IS the hook. This 
                        is a character piece about a man in 
                        turmoil.

                                 NIC
                        This is an adult drama with a mid 
                        level budget. And it’s tough to 
                        find an audience for that kind of 
                        film. Just walk down the road with 
                        me on this.

                                 JAVI
                        Oh, okay. You wanna walk down this 
                        road? Fine. So what is it? A cartel 
                        kidnaps the girl?

                                 NIC
                        That’s good. But where would they 
                        even take her?

                                 JAVI
                        I don’t know. Does it matter? A 
                        warehouse they control by the port 
                        city. 

                                 NIC
                        Ohh, yeah. A warehouse. I love 
                        that.

                                 JAVI
                        And then what? Act three is all 
                        about saving her?

                                 NIC
                        Solves our act three problems. And 
                        what’s more primal that a man 
                        trying to save his daughter?!
                                 JAVI
                        I don’t know. Maybe a movie I 
                        haven’t seen a thousand times 
                        before?! 

           Javi comes very close to Nic.

                        Enough of this bullshit. Time for 
                        you to come clean, Nic. Tell me why 
                        you’re really pitching this. 

                                 NIC
                        What? I, I told you why.

                        You feel guilty about your

                        you’ve been there. About what kind 
                        of father you’ve been.

                        learning to become a better man. A 
                        transformation. That’s the Nic Cage 
                        I want to know. And that’s the 
                        movie I want to see. 

           Off Nic’s face, we CUT TO:

           INT. JAVI’S COMPOUND / NIC’S ROOM

           Nic is on the phone Irving...

                                 NIC
                        Javi HATED the kidnapping idea.

                                 IRVING
                        Oh yeah?

                                 NIC
                        Like really hated it. End of the 
                        day, he’s right. It doesn’t work. 
                        The movie is a full on character 
                        piece. Like a tour de force awards 
                        grab for an actor, and-- 

                                 IRVING
                        There is no FUCKING movie! There is 
                        a young girl named Maria in the 
                        custody of the goddamned cartel! 
                             (composing himself)
                        You have a daughter right?
                                 NIC
                        Yeah, but listen...

                                 IRVING
                        Well let’s just pretend for a 
                        second that it was her in there. 
                        Scared for her life.

                                 NIC
                        First of all, I’d never let that 
                        happen. Second of all, Javi told me 
                        he’d keep the girl in a warehouse 
                        by the port. 

                                 IRVING
                        What? Why didn’t you tell me that 
                        up front?

                                 NIC
                        Because I think secretly you know 
                        this could be a good movie. There 
                        could be a real win for both of us 
                        here.

                                 IRVING
                        I have to go.

                                 NIC
                        Okay, fine. Whatever. But we’re not 
                        doing the change in the script-

           CLICK. Irving’s gone. 

           INT. JAVI’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Javi is on the phone. He looks pained.

                                 JAVI
                        Uh huh. Uh huh. Fuel up the jet. 
                             (then)
                        As much as I hate to say it. Nic 
                        Cage is...he’s a dead man.

           Javi rubs his forehead, and off his conflicted look...

           INT. JAVI’S COMPOUND / NIC’S ROOM - NEXT MORNING

           Nic casually wakes up. He fishes around under his pillow and 
           finds the CIA phone. 28 missed calls. It’s RINGING.

                                 NIC
                        Irv- What’s going on?
                                 IRVING
                        Nic. I was checking out a location 
                        from your intel. And I picked up a 
                        tail.

                                 NIC
                        A tail? 

                                 IRVING
                        But if they’ve made me...they’ve 
                        likely made you. Nic, we can no 
                        longer guarantee your safety and 
                        the faster you get out of there--

           Nic jumps out of bed, starts throwing on clothes. He shoves 
           some of his things in his pockets.

                                 NIC
                        Shit. Okay, okay. 

                                 IRVING
                        Have you spoken to your family?

                                 NIC
                        My family? No? Why? 

                                 IRVING
                        The cartels have been know to move 
                        on family members. We have our 
                        people on the way to safeguard your 
                        wife and daughter. 

                                 NIC
                        Fuck, Irving?! Addy and Olivia? You 
                        better make sure--

                                 IRVING
                        Nic. Stay calm and meet me at the 
                        safe location. Sending to you now. 
                             (then)
                        You’ll get through this.

           Nic hangs up, freaking out. Takes a breath. Composing 
           himself. Then, ready to go, he swings open the door, and runs 
           right into Javi.

                                 NIC
                        Jesus Christ! You scared the shit 
                        out of me. 

                                 JAVI
                        I’m sorry. But I need you to come 
                        with me. It will be quick. I 
                        promise.
                                 NIC
                        Like, right now? You know, because- 

                                                           SLAM CUT TO:

           INT. JAVI’S MANSION / HALLWAY

           Nic and Javi walk side by side, not saying a word. At the 
           double doors leading to the living room, Javi stops Nic. 

                                 NIC
                        Please, please, can we just talk 
                        about this--

                                 JAVI
                        Nic, I’m sorry I have to take this 
                        step. 

                                 NIC
                        You don’t though. You really don’t. 

                                 JAVI
                        No. This is the only option. 

                                 NIC
                        Then can you just send a message to 
                        my family? Tell them that I love 
                        them. 

           Javi nods, pushes the door open. Addy and Olivia are standing 
           there.  Carlos looms in the background, carrying his rifle.

                                 JAVI
                        Tell them yourself.

                                 ADDY
                        Dad! Are you okay? 

                                 OLIVIA
                        Nic! What’s going on? Your friend 
                        called us last night. Said you were 
                        in such bad shape that you couldn’t 
                        talk.

                                 NIC
                        He did? 

           Nic looks at Javi, who shrugs.

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        One sec, Liv.

           Nic pulls Javi aside.
                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                             (whispering)
                        You want to deal with me, Javi, you 
                        deal with me. But please, I’m 
                        begging you, just keep my family 
                        out of it.

                                 JAVI
                        Unfortunately I can’t do that. 
                        You’ve left me no choice.

           They stare each other down as Addy chimes in.

                                 ADDY
                        Are you dying, Dad? 

                                 JAVI
                        He is. Creatively. 
                             (beat)
                        Now physically, he’s tremendous. 
                        Probably outlive us all.

                                 ADDY
                        Wait. So you’re not dying?

                                 NIC
                        No, no, of course not. I’m fine. 
                        Everything’s fine.

                                 OLIVIA
                             (re: Javi)
                        So he lied to us? I want on the 
                        next goddamn plane out of here.

                                 JAVI
                        Look, I’m sorry for misleading you. 
                        But I have come to care deeply for 
                        your ex-husband. We’re working on a 
                        project together - a beautiful 
                        character driven adult drama - but 
                        he has so many unresolved issues 
                        with the two of you that it’s 
                        beginning to bleed into our work. 
                        In a negative way.

           A beat. 

                                 OLIVIA
                        Have you guys lost your fucking 
                        minds?

                                 JAVI
                        He has a lot of regrets. About the 
                        type of father he’s been. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 JAVI (CONT'D)
                                 JAVI (CONT'D)
                        About the type of husband he was. 
                        Just have lunch with us and let him 
                        say what he needs to say. 
                             (then)
                        Don’t you think that’s a great 
                        idea, Nic?

           Nic doesn’t break eye contact with Javi.

                                 NIC
                        Lunch is a wonderful idea. And then 
                        afterwards, they can get on the 
                        plane back to Los Angeles, right 
                        Jav?

                                 JAVI
                        As long as you’re open and honest 
                        with them. I don’t see any reason 
                        why not.

           Nic, satisfied, turns to Olivia and Addy.

                                 NIC
                        Come on, guys. Have a little food. 
                        Let me say my piece, and then we’ll 
                        get you out of here. What do you 
                        say? 

           Off Nic’s forced smile...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. JAVI’S MANSION - DINING ROOM

           Nic, Olivia, Javi and Addy all eat. Silence, then...

                                 JAVI
                        So, Nic, is there something you 
                        want to say?

                                 NIC
                        Ummm, yeah. There is. I want to 
                        apologize. To both of you.
                             (to Addy and Olivia)
                        I mean, from the beginning I never 
                        felt prepared to be a father. It 
                        just never came easy to me, you 
                        know, the way it did for you, Liv. 
                        I mean, maybe I could have tried 
                        harder. Maybe I could have been 
                        home more. Like for dinner once in 
                        a while. Maybe I could have taken 
                        more jobs in LA.
           Olivia and Addy are listening, intently.

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        But here’s what I always come back 
                        to. Would either of you have really 
                        wanted me to hold myself back? As 
                        an actor? As an artist? I could 
                        never ask you to do that. It’s not 
                        who you are.

           A long beat.

                                 JAVI
                        Wow. That was fucking pathetic.

           Addy starts laughing.

                                 ADDY
                        Nice, man. That’s all time. 

                                 JAVI
                        Honestly, I’m speechless. 

                                 OLIVIA
                        Oh, you’re just not used to him 
                        yet. 

                                 ADDY
                        That’s pretty much par for the 
                        course.

           Nic is not loving this. Interjects--

                                 NIC
                        Look, maybe we just focus on the 
                        good times we did have, okay? Build 
                        on that moving forward. Addy, that 
                        trip we took across the desert? 
                        When we stayed in those cabins out 
                        there? I think about that all the 
                        time. It was one of the best 
                        moments we ever shared.

           Nic takes out his wallet.

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        And I didn’t tell you this on your 
                        birthday, but I keep this polaroid 
                        in my wallet. Just to remind me...

           Nic hands it to Addy. The photo is of Nic and her sitting on 
           the steps of a house in the desert. 
                                 ADDY
                        The polaroid is a nice touch. It 
                        must help make you feel better.

                                 NIC
                        What?

                                 ADDY
                        Proof of the one time you were 
                        actually there. 

                                 NIC
                        Addy--

                                 ADDY
                             (ignores him)
                        The thing is, I was so young I 
                        barely even remember it. I don’t 
                        remember sitting by the side of the 
                        road. I don’t remember sitting on 
                        your lap and watching the sun rise. 
                        And I definitely don’t remember 
                        that stupid song that was playing 
                        on the radio. 
                             (getting emotional)
                        You know some dads go on trips with 
                        their daughters every year? Crazy 
                        right? I mean, we’ve taken one trip 
                        in ten years, and you want me to 
                        sit here and talk about a three day 
                        trip from a decade ago like you’re 
                        father of the fucking year.

                                 NIC
                        I... I always had to shoot.

                                 ADDY
                        No. You didn’t have to. You had a 
                        choice. And you chose your job over 
                        me.  

           Beat. Nic looks devastated. 

                                 JAVI
                        Jesus. Wow. Okay yeah, we may have 
                        more work than I realized. 
                             (then)
                        But this is good. A good first 
                        step.  

           Javi’s phone buzzes. He looks at it. Stands up.
                                 JAVI (CONT'D)
                        Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to 
                        take care of something but I’ll be 
                        back shortly. This was good.    

           As Javi leaves he gives Nic a pat on the back.  Nic watches 
           him go, then:

                                 NIC
                             (manic)
                        Okay, Addy, I’m sorry that you feel 
                        that way, and I will do everything 
                        I can to make it up to you, but 
                        right now, I need you guys to just 
                        sit tight and we’re gonna get you 
                        back to LA. Everything’s gonna be 
                        fine.

           Nic takes out his phone and begins to dial.

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        Everything. Is gonna. Be fine.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Umm, what’s going on, Nic? You seem 
                        a little on edge.

                                 NIC
                        What? No. I’m good. Just need to 
                        make a quick call. Gimme a sec 
                        okay?

           Nic puts the phone to his ear, and turns away, running his 
           hand through his hair.

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                             (to himself)
                        Come on, Irving. Pick up.

           INT. JAVI’S COMPOUND / JAVI’S HOUSE

           Javi walks in to find Lucas standing there. Carlos is 
           standing nearby. Javi nods to him. He doesn’t nod back.

                                 JAVI
                        Lucas. What was so urgent that you 
                        came all the way down here?

                                 LUCAS
                        I had some news that I couldn’t say 
                        over the phone... I’m going to 
                        execute a deal with Hector Selada. 
                                 JAVI
                        The head of the Sinaloa Cartel? I 
                        thought he was dead.

                                 LUCAS
                        No one’s seen him in years, but 
                        apparently he’s still calling the 
                        shots. It’s in our best interests 
                        to merge our operations when 
                        Ramirez is re-elected.

                                 JAVI
                        You’re the boss. It’s your call. 
                             (then, realizing)
                        Oh my god. You took Marcos Lopez’s 
                        daughter.

           Lucas ignores him, comes over very close to Javi.

                                 LUCAS
                        But I can’t do a deal with a rival 
                        cartel if I’m being betrayed.

                                 JAVI
                        What? Who’s betraying you?

           Off Lucas’ face, dead serious...

           INT. JAVI’S DINING ROOM

           Nic is on his CIA phone. Olivia and Addy wait nearby, out of 
           earshot. Olivia’s watching him intently.

                                 NIC
                             (whisper yelling)
                        Irving! Where are you?

                                 IRVING
                        Stay calm, Nic. We’re working on an 
                        extraction plan. 

                                 NIC
                        He brought my wife and daughter 
                        down to the fucking house. My 
                        family! 

                                 IRVING
                        Shit.

                                 NIC
                        Don’t say “shit.” Just get us out 
                        of here!
                                 IRVING
                        We can’t mobilize an operation in 
                        time.

                                 NIC
                        Then what do I do? What am I 
                        supposed to do?

           Irving takes a deep breath.

                                 IRVING
                        I would never ask you to do this 
                        ordinarily, Nic. And I know you 
                        don’t have the necessary training. 
                        But there is one other option we 
                        have to safeguard your family. Do 
                        you have access to a weapon?

                                 NIC
                        You want me to... kill Javi?

                                 IRVING
                        It’s the safest way out. For all of 
                        you.

           Nic nods and hangs up the phone just as Olivia comes over.

                                 NIC
                        Good news. We’ll get you out of 
                        here within the hour. 

                                 OLIVIA
                        Nic. Can I talk to you for a 
                        second? 

           Olivia takes him aside.

                                 OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                        I’ve known you for fifteen years. I 
                        know when you’re nervous. And I 
                        know when you’re lying. And right 
                        now, you’re both.

                                 NIC
                        Okay, I’m gonna tell you something, 
                        but you can’t freak out.
                             (deep breath)
                        I’m working for the CIA. 

           Long beat.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Are you having a nervous breakdown? 
                                 NIC
                        I promise you, I’m not. They wanted 
                        some information on some of Javi’s 
                        business dealings. So I’ve been 
                        helping them because they were 
                        like, impressed with some of my 
                        previous training or whatever. 
                        Point is, I need an hour to get the 
                        final piece of information, and 
                        when I get back, all of us will go 
                        back to Los Angeles. Together. 
                        Okay? 

                                 OLIVIA
                             (stunned)
                        Wow. Um, okay. I don’t even know 
                        what to say.

                                 NIC
                        Don’t say anything. Just take Addy 
                        back to my room. Don’t talk to 
                        anyone. And don’t go anywhere. One 
                        hour. I promise.

           Off Nic’s look...

           INT. JAVI’S HOUSE / LIVING ROOM

           Lucas continues talking with Javi.

                                 LUCAS
                        You’ve very smart, Javi. Incredibly 
                        charming. You always were. But you 
                        also like to see the good in 
                        people. And that can leave you 
                        vulnerable. 

                                 JAVI
                        Who is betraying us?!

                                 LUCAS
                        Your friend Mr. Cage is working for 
                        the US government.

                                 JAVI
                        Bullshit.

           Lucas throws the folder down in Javi’s lap. Javi looks at the 
           pictures of Nic meeting with Irving. 

                                 LUCAS
                        I had Carlos trail him.
           Javi looks over at Carlos. He can’t look at Javi.

                                 JAVI
                        You work for Lucas?

                                 LUCAS
                        Everyone down here works for me. 
                        Except for your friend Mr. Cage.

           Lucas pulls out a pistol. Points it at Javi’s head. 

                                 LUCAS (CONT'D)
                        And I think you knew about it.

                                 JAVI
                        What? Lucas, please. I had no idea. 

           Lucas SLAPS him. Hard. Javi takes it.

                                  LUCAS
                        Get on your knees. Face the wall.

                                 JAVI
                        Lucas-

                                 LUCAS
                        NOW!

           Javi gets on his knees. 

                                 LUCAS (CONT'D)
                        I know you think I’m disgusting. 
                        You think I’m a monster. But you 
                        take my money, cousin. You take 
                        this house. You take, take, take, 
                        while I do all the FUCKING work.

                                 JAVI
                        Please! DON’T DO THIS, LUCAS!! I 
                        DIDN’T KNOW!

           Javi closes his eyes. Lucas cocks the gun.  A LONG MOMENT. 
           Lucas lowers the gun. Kneels down in front of Javi. 

                                 LUCAS
                        I believe you, cousin. 

           Lucas hands Javi the gun. 

                                 LUCAS (CONT'D)
                        But you know what you have to do. 

           Off Javi’s face... BADASS MUSIC KICKS IN...
           EXT. JAVI’S DRIVEWAY

           In glorious SLOW MOTION... Nic walks across the driveway, 
           jacket flowing in the wind. Javi, equally badass, adjusts the 
           PISTOL tucked in his back waistband. They meet in the middle. 

                                 NIC
                        Hey.

                                 JAVI
                             (awkwardly)
                        Hello.

           A long beat. They feel each other out.

                                 NIC
                        So, I’m sorry about lunch. 

                                 JAVI
                        No, I should have asked you before 
                        bringing them down. And I’ve been 
                        thinking about it. Maybe the 
                        kidnapping can work. Our movie 
                        would start out as a beautiful 
                        character piece, and slowly change 
                        into a more thrilling, action 
                        driven--

                        Hollywood blockbuster.

                        Then there’s something for 
                        everyone. 

                                 JAVI
                        Wanna go for a drive out to the 
                        cliffs? Clear our heads and think 
                        through the third act...

                                 NIC
                        That’s perfect.

           INT. JAVI'S JEEP - DAY

           Nic and Javi drive in silence. They look at each other. 
           There’s an overwhelming sadness.

                                 JAVI
                        So... how does it end? How does it 
                        all end?
                                 NIC
                        I don’t know. I guess I just want 
                        everyone to... be okay.

                                 JAVI
                        Yeah. Me too. But that doesn’t feel 
                        real does it?

           They arrive at the trail leading to the cliffs. Javi parks 
           the Jeep. They sit there. Neither of them wants to get out.

                                 NIC
                        Guess we should go.

                                 JAVI
                        Yeah.

           A long moment.

                        I’m glad we did this.

                                 JAVI
                        Me too. 

           They sit there for a beat, then...

                        Really?

           Nic and Javi, still sitting in the Jeep, looking out at the 
           forest. Neither wants to get out. Stalling.

                                 JAVI
                        Guess we should go.

                                 NIC
                        Yeah.

           Nic slowly looks down, looking for something, anything...

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        Are those new shoes?

                                 JAVI
                        These? No, I’ve had these.

                                 NIC
                        Hmmm. I guess I just haven’t seen 
                        ‘em before. 

                                 JAVI
                        I don’t wear them that much. I’m 
                        not sure they’re really “me.”

                                 NIC
                        What? I think they look great. 
                        They’re totally you. I love them. 

                                 JAVI
                        You wanna try them on? I think they 
                        might look better on you. 

           Nic and Javi AWKWARDLY exchange shoes in the JEEP. 

                                 JAVI (CONT'D)
                        Oh wow. Those look incredible on 
                        you. 

                                 NIC
                        You think? 
                             (then)
                        Because I like how those look on 
                        you. 

                                 JAVI
                        They fit really well. 

                                 NIC
                        Do you want to trade?

                        Like permanently? 
           Nic nods, excitedly. 

                                 JAVI (CONT'D)
                        Okay.  

                                 NIC
                        Cool. 

           A beat.

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        I just wanted to say, that I’m, 
                        like, really glad I got to meet 
                        you. You’re the kind of friend I 
                        could not for like five years, not 
                        really even talk, and then pick 
                        right up where we left off. 

                                 JAVI
                        I totally agree. It’s just...

                                 JAVI (CONT'D)
                        It’s time to figure out how this 
                        ends.

                                 NIC
                        Let’s do it.

           Nic takes a deep breath, and OPENS HIS DOOR.

           EXT. FOREST - MOMENTS LATER

           They’re walking along. Silently. Palpably tense. Nic is in 
           front of Javi. 

                                 JAVI
                        Nic, I meant what I said back 
                        there.

                                 NIC
                        Oh man. Me too.

                                 JAVI
                        Which is why this really hurts. 

                                 NIC
                        What?
           Nic turns around and is looking straight down the barrel of 
           Javi’s gun.

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        Whoa. Okay. Okay. Fucking Javi. You 
                        brought me out here to kill me?

                                 JAVI
                        I’m sorry, Nic.

                                 NIC
                        I’m sorry too. But you pull that 
                        trigger...and we both die.

           REVEAL Nic has the two golden guns from Face/Off at his 
           waist, pointed at up at Javi’s head. 

                                 JAVI
                        Wait you were gonna kill me? And 
                        are those my golden guns?!

                                 NIC
                        Looks like we both had a little 
                        secret.

                                 JAVI
                        Why the fuck would you kill me?

                                 NIC
                        What? You’re the head of the 
                        cartel, and-

                                 JAVI
                        My cousin Lucas is the head of the 
                        cartel! He’s the boss. 

                                 NIC
                        But the CIA said you ran it. 

                                 JAVI
                        The whole world thinks I run it! 
                        When my father died, Lucas took 
                        over the cartel. He forced me to 
                        act as the figurehead. I’m just a 
                        puppet. 

                                 NIC

                                 JAVI
                        You don’t leave the cartel, Nic. 
                        You and anyone you care about is in 
                        constant danger. Why do you think I

                                 JAVI
                        Are you fucking kidding me? We 
                        can’t be together because that 
                        would put a target on her back! Did 
                        you seriously not realize that we 
                        liked each other? You’re in the 
                        CIA!

                                 NIC
                        I’m not in the CIA! I was forced to 
                        help them out. For money. I’m an 
                        actor, Javi. You know that! The 
                        only organization I’m a part of is 
                        the Screen Actors Guild of America.

                        more of a theater thing. Whatever. 
                        Just put your fucking gun down!

           They have their guns pointed at one another. It starts to 
           rain.

                                 JAVI
                        No WAY. You go first!

                        fucked!

                                 JAVI
                        I don’t want to kill you!

                        You’re like the last person I want

           BANG! BANG! Shots ring out, one barely grazing Nic’s 
           shoulder. Javi ducks down.

                        support!

           They burst through the clearing and are at the edge of the 
           cliff. They hesitate for a second. They hear MEN’S VOICES 
           coming closer...

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        We have to get to Olivia and Addy.

                                 JAVI
                        I’ve got another Jeep hidden about 
                        a mile down the shore.

                                 NIC
                        Let’s do this.

           And they run and jump off the cliff, just like at the 
           beginning. And as they hit the water, we CUT TO:

           EXT. SMALL JUNGLE SHED - DAY

           Javi pulls open the camouflaged door. They get in. Nic, in 
           the driver’s seat, starts it up.

           EXT. JUNGLE ROAD

           Javi and Nic speed along the road back to Javi’s compound. As 
           they crest a hill, Javi slams on the brakes. It skids to a 
           halt right before it hits Olivia, who is with Gabriela, tears 
           streaming down her face.

                                 NIC
                        Liv?

                                 OLIVIA
                        THEY TOOK HER, NIC. THEY TOOK ADDY! 
           Motorcycles can be heard in the distance.

                                 NIC
                        What? Oh my god.

                                 JAVI
                        We need to go now! There are more 
                        soldiers coming!

                                 OLIVIA
                        I’m not getting in the car with 
                        you! Either of you!

                                 NIC
                        Please, Olivia! Just get in the 
                        car. We’ll find Addy!

           Gabriela turns to Olivia.

                                 GABRIELA
                        They have your daughter Olivia, and 
                        there’s nothing we can do about it 
                        if you don’t get in the car. Trust 
                        me.

           INT. JAVI’S JEEP 

           As it speeds away from the site. Olivia is shotgun. Nic grabs 
           her hand.

                                 OLIVIA
                        We have to go to the police. We 
                        need help.

                                 JAVI
                        The police are in Lucas’ pocket. We 
                        can’t do that. 

                                 OLIVIA
                        The US Embassy? The army? Someone. 
                        (starting to lose it)
                        We can’t do this alone! We need 
                        help here!

           Nic fumbles with his phone... dials.

                                 NIC
                        Irving, my CIA contact. If anyone 
                        can help us in this situation, it’s 
                        Irving. He’ll know what to do. 

           Nic is calling on SPEAKER. Irving picks up.
                                 IRVING
                        Nic.

                        I know. I know. I’m sending an 
                        address. Get here as soon as you 
                        can. 

                                 NIC
                        What do they want with Addy?

                                 IRVING
                        She’s being used to put pressure on 
                        the US government. The Cartel told 
                        Mexican and US authorities that 
                        unless Marcos Lopez drops out of 
                        the election, at exactly 12:30pm 
                        tomorrow... they’ll execute both 
                        girls on a live stream. 

           Nic looks at Olivia, who covers her mouth...

                                 NIC
                        Oh my god. You have to get him to 
                        drop out, right? You’re gonna get 
                        him to drop out?! 

                                 IRVING
                        Just get here as soon as you can.

           CLICK. Irving hangs up.

           EXT. MEXICAN TOWN / ALLEY - NIGHT

           They creep along side of a building on the edge of a jungle. 

                                 NIC
                        Shhhh.

           Nic pulls out his gun and he pushes the door open. 

           Irving is slumped on the floor. A BULLET HOLE in his 
           forehead. 

           The reality of the situation hits Nic. Starting to unravel...

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        Irv... I thought. I thought he’d be 
                        able to help. I don’t...
                                 JAVI
                        We have to go. Now. They could 
                        still be in the area. 

                                 OLIVIA
                        Where? What do we do? Who’re we 
                        supposed to call?! 

                                 GABRIELA
                        There’s no one to call. But we have 
                        to move.

                                 NIC
                        There’s got to be someone! I mean, 
                        Javi you have to help us here. You 
                        got us into this!

                                 JAVI
                        What do you want me to say? Huh? 
                        That I fucked up?! I fucked up, 
                        okay?! But we will get your 
                        daughter back. But right now, we 
                        have to go.

           This sinks in...

                                 JAVI (CONT'D)
                        Come on. I’ve got a place...

           EXT. SAFEHOUSE - NIGHT

           The Jeep pulls into a small, rundown, jungle house...

           INT. SAFEHOUSE - NIGHT

           Sparsely furnished. A balcony off the back. Nic is pacing 
           while Javi, Gabriela and Olivia sit on the couch, watching. 

                                 JAVI
                        The compound’s a fortress. If 
                        there’s a way in, my cousin has 
                        thought of it. 

                                 NIC
                        But you said there were tunnels?

                                 JAVI
                        There are. But they have a series 
                        of metal doors that only open from 
                        the inside. Even if there weren’t 
                        armed guards, it would take weeks 
                        to get through them. 
                                 OLIVIA
                        Well, what’re we supposed to do, 
                        then? Huh? This psychopath is going 
                        to kill our daughter in twelve 
                        hours, so don’t tell me it’s 
                        impossible. Okay? Just think a 
                        little fucking harder about how 
                        we’re gonna get in there and stop 
                        them.

           A moment.

                                 JAVI
                        We’re gonna walk right in through 
                        the front gate.

                                 NIC
                        Okay, cool. Very, like, dramatic 
                        answer, but how’s that going to 
                        work?

                                 JAVI
                        My cousin is trying to cut a deal 
                        with Hector Selada - the head of 
                        the rival Sinaloa Cartel. 

                                 GABRIELA
                        Hector Selada? No one’s seen him in 
                        15 years.

                                 JAVI
                        Exactly. And since no one’s seen 
                        him, no one knows exactly what he 
                        looks like. I’m thinking that with 
                        a little prosthetic and some 
                        makeup...

           He looks at Nic.

                                 NIC
                        That I could play Hector.

                                 JAVI
                        You were looking for the role of a 
                        lifetime...

           Nic nods.

                                 JAVI (CONT'D)
                        Olivia, Nic said you were a make up 
                        artist when you met. Here’s a 
                        picture of Hector Selada.

           Javi holds out an old picture on her phone. 
                                 OLIVIA
                        Oh wow. That wouldn’t be easy. But 
                        I guess we could mix up a homemade 
                        latex... 

                                                        MUSIC KICKS IN:

           *IN A MAKEUP CHAIR - Time lapse. Olivia is mixing a solution 
           in a bowl. It’s goopy as she starts to apply it to Nic’s 
           face... 

                                 OLIVIA (V.O.)
                        We’ll adjust the cheekbones and 
                        nose. And then I’ll need as much 
                        foundation as we can get our hands 
                        on... 

           *SITTING ACROSS FROM JAVI - In chairs, facing each other. Nic 
           speaks Spanish with Javi. It’s not bad.

                                 JAVI (V.O.)
                        We can help you get the accent 
                        down. 

           *IN A MAKEUP CHAIR - Time lapse. Nic is starting to look like 
           a different person.

           *IN THE ROOM - Nic walks with a slight gait. Comes over and 
           looks at a video on Javi’s phone of Hector Selada. 

                                 NIC (V.O.)
                        I’ll need to study his little 
                        quirks. His mannerisms. They way he 
                        carries himself. His gait.

           IN THE MAKEUP CHAIR - Nic is really transforming...

           ON THE KITCHEN TABLE - Gabriella lays out a drawing she’s 
           made with Javi.

                                 GABRIELA (V.O.)
                        I can walk you through the floor 
                        plan of the main structure within 
                        the compound. Establish where Addy 
                        might be. And how to get out.

           Javi points to a X marked “Tunnel.”

           *IN THE MAKEUP CHAIR - Olivia finishes Nic’s makeup. Nic is 
           transformed. We hang on his face for a beat. Then the chair 
           swings around. The transformation is remarkable. Javi and 
           Gabriela are on the bed.
                                 NIC
                        How do I look?

                                 GABRIELA
                        Wow, that’s amazing...

                                 JAVI
                        It could actually work.

                                 OLIVIA
                        The only problem is, it’s not gonna 
                        hold up too long in the heat before 
                        it starts breaking down... 

           INT. AIRBNB - LATER

           Javi is sitting on the bed staring at a picture on his phone 
           of himself and Lucas. Gabriela comes in and sits next to him.

                                 GABRIELA
                        You think this is gonna work?

           Javi shrugs, “Best we got.”   

                                 GABRIELA (CONT'D)
                        Yeah. 

           Beat. 

                                 JAVI
                        I’m such a fucking coward.

                                 GABRIELA
                        Javi--

                                 JAVI
                        No. I never stood up to him. I just 
                        looked away and took his money 
                        while he killed people, and--

                                 GABRIELA
                        He’s an evil man, Javi. And you had 
                        the misfortune of being born into 
                        his family.

                                 JAVI
                        But I didn’t do anything. Okay? I 
                        could have stopped him.  We could 
                        have been together if-

                                 GABRIELA
                        If what?
                                 JAVI
                        If I walked in there and put a 
                        bullet in his head. I don’t know. 
                        There were things I could have 
                        done. And I did nothing.

           They stare at each other...

                                 GABRIELA
                        You did what most people would do.

           ...Javi knows that’s true. And it kills him...

           EXT. AIRBNB / BALCONY - NIGHT

           Olivia is outside on the balcony. Nic comes out...

                                 NIC
                        Hey, I was looking at this picture 
                        of Hector, and I think we need a 
                        little more in the cheek--

                                 OLIVIA
                        I’m coming with you.

                                 NIC
                        What? No, Liv...I got us into this.

                                 OLIVIA
                        And I’m gonna help get her out. 

                                 NIC
                        I’m sorry, Olivia. I’m sorry.

           He goes to hug her.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Don’t touch me. This has nothing to 
                        do with you. I’m doing this for 
                        her.

           Olivia walks back inside and slams the door. Nic turns and 
           looks out into the dark jungle. The lights that illuminate 
           the deck suddenly die. Blackness all around. 

           Two floodlights click on, as if on a black box stage. Nic 
           sits on a crate, while Young Nic stands next to him. Both 
           illuminated. 

                                 YOUNG NIC
                        Wow. This is pretty fucked up. How 
                        you holding up?
                                 NIC
                        I’m a goddamn wreck. How do you 
                        think I am?
                             (then)
                        But I know that every thing I’ve 
                        done in my life has led to this 
                        moment. And-

                                 YOUNG NIC
                        You don’t have to do this.

           Nic looks up at Young Nic.

                                 NIC
                        What?

                                 YOUNG NIC
                        You don’t have to do this. 

           Young Nic pulls Nic into a hug.

                                 NIC
                        But there’s no one else-

                                 YOUNG NIC
                        You don’t have to do this.

           Nic pushes him away.

                                 NIC
                        Stop saying that. I have to! 

                                 YOUNG NIC
                        He’s a lunatic-- 

                                 NIC
                        He’s just a guy-

                                 YOUNG NIC
                        And a killer.

                                 NIC
                        I HAVE TO DO THIS!

                                 YOUNG NIC
                        HOW DOES YOU BEING DEAD HELP YOUR 
                        DAUGHTER?!

           A long beat as this sinks in.

                                 YOUNG NIC (CONT'D)
                        I love you, dude. And I’ve ALWAYS 
                        looked out for you...
                             (definitively)
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 YOUNG NIC (CONT'D)
                                 YOUNG NIC (CONT'D)
                        But this isn’t a role. And you’re 
                        not a hero. You’re a guy who’s 
                        about to get us killed.

           This lands with Nic. Young Nic walks away.

                                 NIC
                        Wait. Don’t walk away. We need to 
                        figure this out. HEY!

           But Young Nic is gone. The lights click off and Nic is back 
           on the deck. Off his uncertainty, we CUT TO:

           EXT. JUAREZ CARTEL COMPOUND - DAY

           Lucas watches as two pickup trucks acting as a makeshift gate 
           part, revealing Nic and his wife who are being patted down by 
           guards. Nic steps inside the gate.

           (Following scene is spoken entirely in Spanish...)

                                 NIC AS HECTOR
                        Lucas Gutierrez. How are you my 
                        friend?

           We’re following Lucas as he moves quickly down a dusty road 
           toward Nic. A switchblade flicks open in his hand.

                                 NIC AS HECTOR (CONT'D)
                        I’d like to introduce my wife. 
                        She’s from Santa Barbara.

           Lucas doesn’t stop moving, just kicks Nic’s leg dropping him 
           to his knees, grabs Nic around the head and starts to CUT OFF 
           HIS EAR.

                                 NIC AS HECTOR (CONT'D)
                        WHAT THE FUCK???

                                 LUCAS
                        You think I’m fucking stupid? Huh, 
                        Hector? Huh? You think you’re just 
                        gonna walk in here after 15 years 
                        and kill me you motherfucker??

                                 NIC AS HECTOR
                        HE’S CUTTING MY FUCKING EAR OFF.

           Olivia is STUNNED. Frozen. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Who are you working for? Three 
                        seconds.
                                 NIC AS HECTOR
                        IT’S JUST ME!

                                 LUCAS
                        Two.

                                 NIC AS HECTOR
                        I PROMISE YOU! HELP!

           Lucas pivots, moves the knife to Nic’s throat. Looks directly 
           at Olivia. 

                                 LUCAS
                        YOU THINK SHE CAN HELP YOU, HECTOR?

           Olivia, panic in her eyes, then...

                                 OLIVIA
                             (calmly)
                        Go ahead.

           A long beat.

                                 OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                        We call the shots. Both of us. You 
                        kill him, our business proposition 
                        still stands. You kill me, you’re 
                        only hurting yourself. 

                                 LUCAS
                        You don’t think I’ll kill him?!

           Lucas moves the knife, drawing blood. Olivia crouches down 
           and looks Lucas directly in the eye.

                                 OLIVIA
                        A real man wouldn’t sit here 
                        talking about it. It would already 
                        be done. So no, I don’t think 
                        you’ll do it. But I am wondering 
                        why the FUCK you think you can 
                        intimidate me.

           Lucas suddenly pulls the knife back, and Nic slumps forward. 
           Lucas smiles.

                                 LUCAS
                        Show them to a room. And it is good 
                        to see you, Hector. Been far too 
                        long. 

           Lucas puts the knife in his cargo pocket, and walks away as 
           we CUT TO:
           INT. JUAREZ CARTEL COMPOUND / GUEST ROOM

           Nic and Olivia’s bags are dropped off in a nicely furnished 
           guest room. They shut the door...

                                 NIC AS HECTOR
                        Oh my god. How does my ear look? He 
                        almost cut off my ear!

                                 OLIVIA
                        It’s 12:15 Nic. We have to go.

                                 NIC AS HECTOR
                        I know. But it hurts. Does it need 
                        stitches? Just take a look. 

           Olivia is looking at the map and out the window.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I think that’s the building over 
                        there.

                                 NIC AS HECTOR
                        Oh fuck, I think I’ve lost the 
                        hearing in that ear. I can’t hear 
                        shit. Say something in my ear.

           She leans over to Nic’s ear.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Let’s fucking go.

           A beat.

                                 NIC AS HECTOR
                        My ear’s actually fine. 

           EXT. JUAREZ CARTEL COMPOUND BUILDING - DAY

           Nic as Hector and Olivia wait until two cartel guys exit a 
           door. As the door is closing, Nic runs out and grabs it. 
           Olivia follows as they slip inside.

           INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY

           Nic and Olivia come down to a long hallway with lots of 
           doors. They whisper to each other. Nic is studying his map.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Come on. 
                                 NIC AS HECTOR
                        There’s supposed to be a door here. 
                        Where’s the door?

           She grabs the map.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Shit. It’s one floor down.

           INT. STAIRWELL

           Nic and Olivia race down the stairs. As they reach the bottom 
           a Cartel Soldier opens the door. He sees them and Nic, 
           without missing a beat, LEVELS the guy with a right cross. 
           He’s knocked out. Nic shakes his hand. Stifles a yell.

           Olivia grabs the guy’s gun and chucks it to Nic. And they 
           move through the door.

           INT. HALLWAY

           They look down the hallway. No one coming. A closed door...

                                 NIC AS HECTOR
                        That’s the door.

           They run down the hallway, take a deep breath, and move 
           through the door, Nic first, holding up the gun.

           INT. ROOM

           Total blackness...

                                 NIC
                             (whispering)
                        Get the light. 

           Olivia finds the switch and turns it on... AND THERE’S 
           NOTHING THERE.

           They look at each other. Oh shit.

                                 CARLOS
                        Don’t fucking move, Hector. Drop 
                        the gun.

           Carlos, gun trained on Nic. Nic closes his eyes. And drops 
           the gun on the floor. 

                                 CARLOS (CONT'D)
                        Come with me.
           INT. DIFFERENT HALLWAY

           Carlos knocks on a door, and is let inside by a Cartel 
           Soldier. He ushers Nic as Hector and Olivia in.

           INT. BASEMENT HOLDING CELL

           Nic and Olivia walk in to Lucas holding a gun. Addy and MARIA 
           LOPEZ, the Presidential Candidate’s daughter, are bound and 
           gagged, on their knees in front of him.  There are bright, 
           hot lights and a video setup for the execution.

                                 CARLOS
                        I found them down the hall. He had 
                        a gun. Something isn’t right.

                                 LUCAS
                        A gun? Okay, Hector. What’s the 
                        deal, my man? You got a fucking 
                        problem you like to tell me about?

           Nic is starting to sweat under the lights. Olivia sees his 
           face starting to run.

                                 NIC AS HECTOR
                        I was beginning to think you didn’t 
                        have the girl. And since our deal 
                        is based on Lopez dropping out...

                                 LUCAS
                        He’ll drop out.

                                 NIC AS HECTOR
                        Well he hasn’t done it yet! So how 
                        are you gonna guarantee it?

                                 CARLOS
                        Fuck this guy! 

                                 LUCAS
                        Carlos!

                                 CARLOS
                        I’m telling you, something isn’t 
                        right. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Then go check the perimeter. 

           Carlos, in a huff, walks off... Lucas turns to Nic.
                                 LUCAS (CONT'D)
                        You know if we’re gonna be in 
                        business together, Hector, you’re 
                        gonna need to trust me.

           He comes over closer to Nic. He sees Nic’s face coming off.

                                 LUCAS (CONT'D)
                        What the fuck-

                                 NIC AS HECTOR
                        What the fuck what?

                                 LUCAS
                        Your face...

           He reaches over to grab a bit of Nic’s face and Nic 
           immediately grabs Lucas’ gun, wraps him around the neck, and 
           points the gun at Lucas’ head in front of Olivia and the 
           girls. All the Soldiers immediately draw their weapons.

                                 NIC AS HECTOR
                             (in English)
                        ANYBODY MOVES, AND I BLOW HIS HEAD 
                        OFF. DON’T. FUCKING. MOVE.
                             (then, to Olivia)
                        Liv, take the girls and go.

           Nic rips the rest of the prosthetics off his own face.

                                 LUCAS
                        Oh my god... Nic Fucking Cage.

           Olivia and the girls move out of the doorway behind Nic. 
           Olivia stops...

                                 OLIVIA
                        What’s your plan here, Nic?

                                 NIC AS HECTOR
                        My plan is you and the girls get 
                        out of here alive. 

           Addy is removing her gag as Olivia is pulling her away.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Let’s go, Ads. We have to go.

                                 ADDY
                        We can’t. Not without Dad!
                                 NIC AS HECTOR
                        I’ll be okay, honey! I love you 
                        very much. Now go with your mother. 
                        NOW!

           A Cartel Soldier moves. Nic cocks the gun.

                                 NIC AS HECTOR (CONT'D)
                        Don’t even think about it.

           EXT. CARTEL COMPOUND

           Carlos is exiting the compound, automatic rifle around his 
           shoulder. He’s pissed off...

           INT. CARTEL TUNNEL

           Olivia, Addy and Maria are climbing down into a drug tunnel. 
           They hit the ground.

                                 OLIVIA
                        This way. 

           They both help Maria, who is very weak.

           EXT. JUAREZ CARTEL COMPOUND / TUNNEL EXIT

           Olivia opens the gate from the inside. Javi helps pull open a 
           large metal gate as Olivia, Addy and Maria exit the tunnel. 

                                 JAVI
                        Let’s get you two in the Jeep. 
                        Where’s Nic?

                                 OLIVIA
                             (out of breath)
                        He’s got a gun on Lucas... bought 
                        us some time. But there’s others. 
                        About seven others.

                                 JAVI
                        He’ll never make it out of there 
                        alive.

           Olivia looks at Javi. He realizes what Nic did...

           INT. JUAREZ CARTEL COMPOUND / HOLDING CELL

           Nic still has the gun on Lucas.
                                 LUCAS
                        Here’s what I know, Nic Cage. I’ve 
                        got seven guys with guns pointed 
                        directly at your head, and that 
                        means you’re not getting out of 
                        here alive. 

                                 NIC AS HECTOR
                        And here’s what I know, Lucas. 
                             (takes a beat, centers)
                        It takes thirteen milliseconds for 
                        the human brain to send a message 
                        to the body. So by the time your 
                        bullets hit me, my cerebral cortex 
                        will have transmitted a signal to 
                        the seventeen healthy muscles that 
                        operate my trigger finger. 

           Lucas’ hand creeps down to the pocket where he put his knife. 
           Nic doesn’t notice, because he’s deep in the speech.

                                 NIC AS HECTOR (CONT'D)
                        And before your asshole has had a 
                        chance to pucker up, your medulla 
                        oblongata will be splattered on the 
                        fucking wall behind you. And if 
                        that’s the last thing I accomplish 
                        on this beautiful green earth, 
                        well, then...  WHAT A WAY TO 
                        FUCKING GO.

           Lucas suddenly grabs his knife, flicks it open and SLAMS it 
           into Nic’s leg. Nic goes down.

                                 NIC AS HECTOR (CONT'D)
                        Ahhhhhh. Shit.

           Lucas grabs the gun, and jumps on top of Nic, the gun to 
           Nic’s forehead. 

                                 LUCAS
                        There he is! There he fucking is! 
                        American Hero. Nicolas Cage!

           As Lucas is about to pull the trigger, Nic turns to the side, 
           and sees Young Nic on the floor staring back at him.

                                 YOUNG NIC
                        Well... you did it.

                                 NIC
                        I did what I came to do. I got my 
                        daughter out.
                                 YOUNG NIC
                        You got us killed you fucking 
                        idiot! I tried to help you, but you 
                        wouldn’t listen. Now get up!

           Suddenly the POV swings around and Nic and Young Nic are 
           standing, facing each other in a fantasy sequence inside 
           NIc’s head--

           INT. FACE/OFF - HALL OF MIRRORS

           But a German Expressionist version of the Face/Off mirror 
           scene. It’s the angular, tilted, Cabinet of Dr. Caligari 
           meets 90’s action version. Visceral, but not quite real... 

           Nic draws a gun from his belt. Almost surprised he has it...

                                 NIC
                        You’re not here to help me.

                                 YOUNG NIC
                        What’re you doing?! Put the gun 
                        down. 

           Nic starts following Young Nic. An intensity we haven’t seen.

                                 NIC
                        You were never here to help me.

                                 YOUNG NIC
                        I’ve always looked out for you. 
                        Always.

                                 NIC
                        No. NO NO NO NO NO. 

                                 YOUNG NIC
                        Yes. We can get you out of this. We 
                        just need a plan. You have the 
                        training...

           Nic wavers. Young Nic sees this and comes out from behind a 
           mirror. He slowly approaches Nic, arms out.

                                 YOUNG NIC (CONT'D)
                        I’m not gonna hurt you. And you’re 
                        not gonna hurt me. Just put the gun 
                        down, and we focus on getting you 
                        out of here. 

           Nic nods.
                                 YOUNG NIC (CONT'D)
                        I love you. You know I love you. 

           Young Nic suddenly lunges forward, punches Nic in the face. 
           The gun falls, skidding across the floor. They fight and 
           wrestle in a brutal fashion. Both clamoring for the gun.

                                 NIC
                        You’re a liar. You don’t care about 
                        me. You only care about you. You’re 
                        selfish and arrogant and just, 
                        like, a total fucking dick. 

                                 YOUNG NIC
                        What? I’m a dick? I’m the only 
                        thing that’s keeping you alive!

           Nic slams a fist into Young Nic, who falls back. Nic grabs 
           the gun, turns and shoots. Young Nic dives behind a mirror. 
           Nic follows, shooting. Mirrors shatter. 

           Young Nic runs directly THROUGH A MIRROR. On the other side, 
           there’s a warehouse district. He jumps on a (strangely) 
           idling Ducati motorcycle. Nic runs through sees a waiting 
           grey Mustang Fastback. He jumps in, jams the gas and we’re...

           EXT. GONE IN 60 SECONDS SEAPORT - DAY

           Still in the Caligari-esque, expressionistic sets... But this 
           time, a car chase, Gone in 60 Seconds style. Nic is gaining 
           on Young Nic in traffic. Suddenly next to each other.

                                 YOUNG NIC
                        You’re hysterical right now! You’re 
                        not thinking clearly!

           They weave and dodge oncoming traffic. Then back together...

                                 NIC
                        This is the clearest I’ve ever 
                        been!

           Nic swerves into Young Nic, dropping the motorcycle on it’s 
           side. Young Nic skids and SLAMS into a wall. 

           Nic skids the Mustang to a stop, grabs his gun, and exits. 
           Young Nic is limping away. Nic shoots, but Young Nic has 
           disappeared around a corner. Nic runs to catch up. He sees a 
           LONE HOTEL ROOM DOOR.
           INT. LEAVING LAS VEGAS HOTEL ROOM

           Nic enters the fun house version of the hotel room from 
           Leaving Las Vegas. Alcohol strewn about everywhere. Young Nic 
           sits on the bed, nursing his leg.

                                 YOUNG NIC
                        Don’t do this. I’m the only friend 
                        you’ve got in this world.

                                 NIC
                        Friend? 

                                 YOUNG NIC
                        I always--

                                 NIC
                        Shut the fuck up. 
                             (then)
                        For the past twenty years, you made 
                        me think the most important thing 
                        in the world was... being you. With 
                        your cool hair. Your cool jacket. 
                        And that cool fucking attitude. 

           Nic paces...

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        But here’s what I’ve come to 
                        realize: I don’t like you. In fact, 
                        I think you might be mentally ill. 
                        You’re a small man ruled by fear. 
                        And that fear has turned you into 
                        the biggest, most selfish coward 
                        I’ve ever met. You’re chasing a 
                        moment in time, man. But the chase 
                        is over...

           Nic cocks the gun.

                                 YOUNG NIC
                        So this is it, huh? This is where 
                        it ends for you?  

                                 NIC
                        No. This is where it ends for you.

           Nic fires off a couple rounds. But they DO NOTHING to Young 
           Nic. Young Nic laughs maniacally.

                                 YOUNG NIC
                        You can’t let me go, you fucking 
                        coward! Because you’re too scared 
                        to be alone. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 YOUNG NIC (CONT'D)
                                 YOUNG NIC (CONT'D)
                        To do this on your own. Because the 
                        greatest trick I’ve ever pulled... 
                        is that I’m you. 

           Nic’s distress turns to... a smile. 

           And he TURNS THE GUN ON HIMSELF. 

                                 YOUNG NIC (CONT'D)
                        No!!!!!!!!

           Nic pulls the trigger. AND WE’RE BACK IN....

           EXT. JUAREZ CARTEL COMPOUND - DAY

           Nic’s eyes SLAM open as he EXECUTES A PERFECT GUN DISARM, 
           shooting Lucas in the shoulder.  Nic jumps up. Cartel 
           Soldiers aim, Nic in their sights.

           Nic’s face: PANIC. About to be gunned down when...

           Javi comes racing around the corner, gun drawn. Bullets 
           flying. A couple Soldiers go down or dive for cover.

                                 JAVI
                        Nic! Let’s go!

           Javi grabs Nic and pulls him to his feet. He catches Lucas’s 
           eye. Rage 

                                 LUCAS
                        You motherfuc--

           INT. JUAREZ CARTEL COMPOUND BASEMENT / HALLWAY

           Javi and Nic speed down the hallway. Soldiers come into the 
           hallway, firing. They turn the corner just in time. 

           EXT. JUAREZ CARTEL COMPOUND - DAY

           Addy, Gabriela, Olivia, Maria - who is lying down on the 
           floor in the back seat - are in the Jeep. Gabriela starts it, 
           then checks her watch.

                                 GABRIELA
                        We have to go now.

                                 ADDY
                        We’re not going without my dad.
                                 GABRIELA
                        I don’t want to leave Javi either. 
                        But the cartel finds us...

                                 OLIVIA
                        One more minute.

           They all stare at the tunnel exit. We’re pushing on their 
           hopeful faces, when-

                                 CARLOS
                        Hands in the air. All of you.

           It’s Carlos. Slowly approaching, gun aimed at the women. They 
           all slowly raise their hands.

                                 GABRIELA
                        Carlos, please. You do not want to 
                        do this. Javi has been nothing but 
                        nice to you. And your family.

           Carlos slowly approaches the back of the Jeep.

                                 CARLOS
                        Javi is nothing. He’s weak...
                             (into walkie talkie)
                        I’ve got them. By the tunnel.

           Maria stirs in the back seat. Gabriela catches her eye. 
           Glances at the shifter. Maria grabs the stick shift. Gabriela 
           jams the gas. 

           The Jeep slams into the Carlos, knocking him off his feet. 

                                 GABRIELA
                        Where is he?

                                 ADDY
                        Behind us!

                                 GABRIELA
                        Where?

           Carlos pops up. His arm is broken. 

                                 CARLOS
                             (dazed)
                        You fucking... bitches. You’re 
                        dead. All of you!!

           He goes to fire his automatic rifle. BOOM. Carlos drops. Shot 
           in the back. As he falls, we see Nic aiming his gun. Javi at 
           his side. Zoom in on Nic...
                                 NIC
                        Sorry I’m late. Now let’s get the 
                        fuck out of Mexico. 

           EXT. MEXICAN DESERT - DAY

           Hot sun. A hill of dirt and sand. An engine howls. A cloud of 
           dust. Then, the Jeep sails into the air, landing in a plume 
           of sand. Tires screaming and clawing for traction as Nic 
           wails on the accelerator as we find... 

           About TEN OTHER CARTEL PICKUPS giving chase. Men with guns 
           dangling like evil ornaments.

           INT. JAVI’S JEEP

           Nic drives. Olivia’s shotgun. Javi is in the back with Addy 
           and Maria and Gabriela. Flying down little jungle roads... 

                                 NIC
                        Everybody okay?! 
                             (looking back at Addy)
                        It’s just really really great to 
                        have you back. That’s all. I missed 
                        you. I missed the shit out of you.

                                 ADDY
                        Just watch the road, dad!

                                 NIC
                        Okay, honey. No problem.

           Addy SMILES as bullet rips through the glass windshield. Nic 
           pushes the windscreen down flat. Gabriela is using a pocket 
           knife and a lighter to cauterize the wound.

                                 JAVI
                        Ahhhgggh. 

                                 GABRIELA
                        Stop screaming you baby.

                                 OLIVIA
                        They’re getting closer...

                                 NIC
                        This thing doesn’t go any faster!

           Javi grabs the Cartel Soldier’s automatic rifle.
                                 JAVI
                        Let me out of the jeep! I can slow 
                        them down.

                                 NIC
                        No fucking way!

                                 JAVI
                        We’re two kilometers from the 
                        border. We only have two guns. If I 
                        slow them down, you can make it. 

                                 NIC
                        Javi, I can get us there, and then 
                        we’ll get you to a real doctor. 
                        Like at Cedars. I can see if Cohen 
                        is available. You’ll love him. 
                        Actually, he goes to Italy in the 
                        summers. Whatever.

           Javi jumps out of the moving jeep, slamming into the dirt, 
           rolling.

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        Javi!!!

           Nic STOMPS on the brakes. The Jeep comes to a stop.

                                 JAVI
                        I won’t have any kind of real life 
                        if I don’t stand up to my cousin. I 
                        need this, Nic. Now go. 

                                 NIC
                        Javi-

                                 JAVI
                        GO!!

           Nic jams the gas. The Jeep speeds off. And as clears frame, 
           Gabriela is standing there holding the remaining pistol. Her 
           dress blows in the wind. Dust swirls around. She looks 
           beautiful.

                                 JAVI (CONT'D)
                        You stayed.

                                 GABRIELA
                        Of course I stayed. 

           She runs over and KISSES JAVI. And as the WAILING guitar solo 
           from NOVEMBER RAIN hits...
           Javi and Gabriela face the approaching convoy, and start 
           firing round after round in glorious slow motion. A couple 
           cartel trucks veer off the road and crash.

           IN A CARTEL TRUCK Lucas is shooting back. JAVI IS HIT. He 
           crumples to the ground and rolls off the side of the road as 
           the remaining trucks roar past. Gabriela runs to his side...

           IN NIC’S JEEP Nic slams the Jeep into fifth and jams the 
           accelerator. 

                                 NIC
                        Get down! Everyone down! They might 
                        fire on us...

           EXT. UNITED STATES BORDER

           An BORDER PATROL GUARD with a gun stands in front of a wooden 
           barrier. He waves at Nic to slow down. His waving gets more 
           and more frantic.

           Lucas’ truck is the only one left. Gaining on the Jeep.

           Finally, the Border Patrol Guard dives out of the way as 
           Nic’s truck barrels through the wooden divider, blowing out a 
           tire and slamming into an embankment on the other side.

           We’re tight on Nic. Hunched over the wheel. Bleeding. Barely 
           conscious. Suddenly, Lucas, heavily bleeding himself, grabs 
           Nic around the neck and drags him out of the Jeep. 

           The Border Patrol have drawn their weapons. Lucas puts his 
           back against the Jeep, uses Nic as a shield.

                                 LUCAS
                        Come near me and I’ll shoot him. 
                        I’m going to make my way back 
                        across the border.

           Addy grabs the blade Gabriela was using to get the bullet out 
           of Javi’s shoulder, stands up in the back of the Jeep, and 
           slams it into Lucas’ back. Lucas falls and lands hard on the 
           ground. Nic looks back at Addy and Olivia.

           Except it’s NOT OLIVIA AND ADDY. It’s Naomi Watts. And a 
           young actress. “Addy” hugs her dad.

                                 OLIVIA
                        We made it.

                                 NIC
                        All of us. 
                                 ADDY
                        I love you, daddy.

           We realize we’re watching the movie version of their 
           adventure. Credits begin to roll.

           ON SCREEN: A FILM BY: QUENTIN TARANTINO

           And we PULL OUT we find Nic in the audience, wearing a suit. 
           Handsome. Put together. Back in the fucking saddle. He looks 
           over at real Addy and Olivia.

                                 ADDY (CONT'D)
                             (mocking)
                        I love you daddy??

           Nic shrugs.

                                 NIC
                             (mouthing)
                        I don’t know. Javi wrote it.

           EXT. PREMIERE - NIGHT

           Nic is swarmed by reporters.

                                 REPORTER
                        Your performance was extraordinary. 
                        How much of this was based on your 
                        real experience? What actually 
                        happened down there?

                                 NIC
                        Well, you know, sometimes you get 
                        an opportunity to be a real life 
                        hero---

           Nic sees Olivia and Addy waving at him. 

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        You get the, uhhh..

                                 OLIVIA
                             (mouthing)
                        Stay. Have fun.

           And they leave.

                                 NIC
                        You get the opportunity to be a 
                        real life hero. And you know what, 
                        excuse me...
           And Nic heads for the door after his family.

           INT. OLIVIA’S HOUSE / LIVING ROOM

           Nic, Olivia and Addy are lying on the living room floor. A 
           fire burns in the background....

                                 OLIVIA
                        You sure you didn’t want to stay?

                                 NIC
                        I never liked doing press. You know 
                        that. Those people are vultures.

                                 ADDY
                        Who chose Naomi Watts to play mom?

                                 NIC
                        I don’t know. Doesn’t really do 
                        your mother justice, though. Do you 
                        think?

                                 OLIVIA
                        Oh come on. She’s Naomi Watts. 
                        She’s one of the most beautiful 
                        women in the world.

                                 NIC
                        So are you, Liv.

                                 ADDY
                        Eww. Dad, stop hitting on mom.

                                 NIC
                        I’m not “hitting on” her. It’s 
                        just, as an actor, I’m always 
                        searching for the truth. And that’s 
                        the truth.

                                 ADDY
                        Gross. I can’t watch this.

           Addy gets up and leaves as Nic sits up. Olivia sits up too. 
           They face each other.

                                 NIC
                        I should get going.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Yeah.
                             (then)
                        Tonight was nice.
           Nic nods. And off them staring at each other....

           INT. SUNSET TOWER - NIGHT

           Nic walks in. The man at the FRONT DESK waves.

                                 FRONT DESK
                        Welcome home, Mr. Cage.

           He smiles.

           INT. SUNSET TOWER / NIC’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Nic walks out on the balcony. Looking out over the lights of 
           the city. He gets a call. Smiles while looking at it.

                                 NIC
                             (into phone)
                        Hello?

                                 JAVI 
                        Niccccc Caggggeeeeee!!

                                 NIC
                        Javi!

           EXT. BEACH - DAY

           Javi sits on a beach somewhere next to Gabriela. 

                                 JAVI
                        How did it go? We got a hit on our 
                        hands or what, baby?

           INT. SUNSET TOWER / NIC’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Nic smiles...

                                 NIC
                         Well, seems like...

           CLOSE on Nic’s face, just like in the beginning.

                                 NIC (CONT'D)
                        ...a foregone conclusion.
