          Dear reader,

          We chose to write this because we've been fans of Mac for as long 
          as we can remember. Like so many others out there, we grew up with 
          him, made dumb decisions with him, and even found some success 
          with him. While yes, he was a celebrity, he seemed like a regular 
          guy, which is why so many felt connected to him, including us. Mac 
          was addicted to life. All aspects of it. And he'll be forever 
          missed.

          Here's to the legend that is Mac Miller. Rest easy, kid.

          Your fans,

          KA & V

           INT. NPR TINY DESK CONCERT - DAY

           It’s your standard, cluttered office space, except it’s 
           packed with MUSICIANS and a piano that takes up half the 
           room. Front and center, singing “What’s The Use?,” is our 
           slightly stoned tattooed hero, MAC MILLER (26).

           Mac boogies in his seat, throwing funny faces back and forth 
           with THUNDERCAT (33), whose pink dreads dance around his head 
           as he slaps the bass, closing out the song.

           A booming roar of cheering and applause begins. Mac and his 
           band are playing in the NPR Office in front of a sea of 
           EMPLOYEES, PHOTOGRAPHERS, and JOURNALISTS.

           Thundercat gets up to exit the office space that’s now become 
           a stage, but not before he daps up Mac.

                                 MAC
                        Make a little bit more noise for 
                        Thundercat one time!

           Thundercat comes back into frame. 

                                 THUNDERCAT
                        Make a little bit more noise for 
                        Mac!

           Mac lets out a laugh as three VIOLINISTS and one CELLIST take 
           Thundercat’s place behind the desk.

                                 MAC
                        I thought this desk would be 
                        tinier.

           The crowd loves him. They hang on to his every word.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        I really wanted to have strings for 
                        this song because, um, this one--
                        this means a lot to me--off the 
                        album.

           Mac fidgets in his seat, removing his cap and rubbing his 
           head before throwing it back on.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        It’s a beautiful thing, man. Music 
                        is a beautiful thing. Alright.

           He realizes how ridiculous he sounds.
                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                             (mocking himself)
                        Music is a beautiful thing, man. 
                        It’s a beautiful thing, baby. It’s 
                        a beautiful thing. Let me tell you 
                        something about music--it’s 
                        beautiful.

           The laughter dies down as the musicians ready their 
           instruments.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Ah, god. Alright, let’s do it.

           The string quartet begins playing the one minute intro to 
           Mac’s song, “2009.” The intimate sound sends Mac’s eyes to 
           the floor. He’s more still than we’ve seen him.

           Off Mac, lost in thought...

                                 TEACHER (PRE-LAP)
                        Theodore Jones?

           INT. ALLDERDICE HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

           An elderly TEACHER sits in front of a chalkboard that reads: 
           9-7-2009.

           She looks through a SEATING CHART and back up at a class of 
           bored HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. Two seats are empty.

                                 TEACHER
                        Theodore? Nope.

           She takes pleasure in marking him absent.

                                 TEACHER (CONT’D)
                        Malcolm McCormick?

           EXT. ALLDERDICE HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY

           A seventeen year old Mac Miller, rocking a Pittsburgh 
           Steelers jersey and smoking a cig, sits on the hood of a 
           WHITE CROWN VICTORIA, sipping from a bottle of JAMESON, 
           spitting a flow. If he has any tattoos, they aren’t visible.

           TATTOO COUNTER: 0

                                 MAC
                        Name’s Mac Miller, who the fuck are 
                        you? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MAC (CONT'D)
                        Crew too live, but I ain’t Uncle 
                        Luke. 
                        I shine bright, can you handle the 
                        light? 
                        They can’t stand that I’m white. 
                        With an ego, find me like Nemo. 
                        Chillin’ with the homies and you 
                        know we let the trees blow. 
                        I’m fucked up, the room is 
                        spinnin’, the ceiling is gone. 
                        I’m spittin’ game on a girl, but 
                        I’m feelin’ her mom.

                                 CROWD (O.S.)
                        Ooooooohhhhh!!!!!

           Mac is surrounded by his homies JIMMY (18), REGGIE (17), 
           TREEJAY (17), who holds a CAMCORDER, and several other pimply 
           faced STUDENTS wearing clothes they’re swimming in.

           A SECURITY GUARD (23) runs up on the boys. All the students, 
           aside from Mac’s immediate crew, run away.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Get your little punk ass off my 
                        car!

           Mac and the boys laugh as he gets off the car.

                                 SECURITY GUARD (CONT’D)
                        Why’s it always gotta be my car? 
                        Why can’t it be Mr. Jones’ car--or 
                        fuck it--Principal Davies’?

                                 TREEJAY
                        Because your dumb ass drives an 
                        unmarked cop car and that shit’s 
                        cinematic as fuck.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Oh, is it Theodore?

                                 TREEJAY
                        It’s TreeJay!

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Ya’ll fake ass motherfuckers need 
                        to get back to class before I beat 
                        ya ass.

                                 JIMMY
                        You can’t touch us!
                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        I’ll gladly lose my job if that 
                        means whooping your scrawny ass!

           Jimmy steps up to fight, but Mac runs in between them.

                                 MAC
                        We cool--we cool! We just having 
                        fun.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        You need to get your mans! And take 
                        your Shel Silverstein ass back to 
                        class.

                                 MAC
                        Alright. Alright, we goin’. 

           But Jimmy doesn’t move. He motions like he’s going to punch 
           the guard, who flinches through his entire body.

                                 JIMMY
                        Bitch!

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Get the fuck outta here.

           Mac and his boys laugh their way back to class.

                                 SECURITY GUARD (CONT’D)
                             (sotto)
                        Kid thinks he’s the next Wiz 
                        Khalifa...

           INT. ALLDERDICE HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

           We’re now in math class, where a LAME TEACHER writes on the 
           board, blabbing on about Pi, the mathematical constant. Mac, 
           in the back of the room, writes a note on a torn piece of 
           paper. 

           He looks up, but only to study the prettiest girl in class, 
           NOMI (17), drawing inspiration from her mocha skin and 
           perfectly placed nose ring. He goes back to writing.

                                 JIMMY (O.S.)
                             (whispering)
                        Yo. Mac.

           Mac looks up, but nobody’s there.

                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        Mac.
           On the floor next to him is Jimmy.

                                 MAC
                        Fuck you doing?

                                 JIMMY
                        Central Catholic party tonight at 
                        that douchebag Braylen’s. All the 
                        bitches goin’.

                                 MAC
                        You had to army crawl all the way 
                        over here to tell me that?

                                 JIMMY
                        Time to get paid.

           Mac laughs and Jimmy begins army crawling back to his seat.

                                 MAC
                        Hold up, give this to Nomi.

           Mac hands him the folded note. Jimmy opens it to read.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Don’t fucking read it.

           Mac looks back to Nomi who is now staring at him. Their eye 
           contact lingers until...

           Lame Teacher finally finishes writing Pi on the chalkboard 
           and turns around to catch Jimmy crawling back to his seat.

                                 LAME TEACHER
                        Jimmy. What are you doing?

           Jimmy thinks fast, grabbing a pencil off the floor.

                                 JIMMY
                        Sorry, Mr. Walters, I dropped my 
                        pencil and wanted to make sure I 
                        got it back so I could finish 
                        taking notes on Pi because there 
                        are just so many numbers and I 
                        didn’t want to miss one. 

                                 LAME TEACHER
                        There are a lot of numbers! That’s 
                        what makes Pi so remarkable.

           Jimmy’s in the clear. He hands the note to Nomi.

           She finishes reading and looks back to Mac as the teacher 
           continues his lecture.
           EXT. FRICK PARK MARKET - DAY

           Mac slangs his mixtape, THE HIGH LIFE outside the market with 
           Jimmy, Reggie, and TreeJay.

           A WHITE BOY (16) listens to Mac’s song, “Musical Chairs,” 
           blasting from a boombox.

                                 WHITE BOY
                        Shit’s tight. I got five on it.

           He slaps Mac a five dollar bill as TreeJay hands him a 
           mixtape.

           As the kid walks off, Mac hands the money to Reggie. 

                                 JIMMY
                        Why’s Reggie the money guy?

                                 MAC
                        ‘Cause he’s the one going to 
                        college. 

                                 TREEJAY
                        And ‘cause he can count.

                                 JIMMY
                        Count this.

           Jimmy playfully flicks off TreeJay.

           MS. WALTERS (71) strolls out of the market.

                                 MAC
                        Ms. Walters. Yo! Ms. Walters.

           She reluctantly turns around.

                                 MS. WALTERS
                        Hi, Malcolm.

                                 MAC
                        Did you pick up the new tape yet?

                                 MS. WALTERS
                        I did. Last week, remember?

                                 MAC
                        Ms. Walters, that’s the old stuff. 
                        This right here is brand new.

                                 MS. WALTERS
                        But I haven’t even finished 
                        listening to the last one.
                                 MAC
                        Don’t even worry about it. This is 
                        the one you wanna hear. Only 5 
                        bucks.

           Ms. Walters thinks about it.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        You know what, I’m gonna hook you 
                        up with the senior discount. Two 
                        tapes for 10 bucks.

                                 MS. WALTERS
                        That’s not a discount.

           Mac flashes her a huge smile. She digs into her purse and 
           gives him the money.

                                 MAC
                        God bless you, Ms. Walters.

           She walks off as Mac pulls out and sips from a flask.

           Three BLACK DUDES (21) walk up, smoking a blunt.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Yo, you guys want a piece of The 
                        High Life?

                                 BLACK DUDE #1
                        The what?

                                 MAC
                        My mixtape--The High Life.

           Black Dude #1 grabs the mixtape as he and his boys peep the 
           artwork. They clock the boombox.

                                 BLACK DUDE #1
                             (enthusiastically)
                        This you?

                                 MAC
                        Yup. Brand new.

           The black dudes listen intently, vibing to the beat.

                                 BLACK DUDE #1
                        That bar was you?

                                 MAC
                        All me. You dig it?
                                 BLACK DUDE #1
                        Do I dig it? Bro. This shit is...

           This guy loves Mac.

                                 BLACK DUDE #1 (CONT’D)
                        Fucking garbage.

           Nope.

                                 BLACK DUDE #1 (CONT’D)
                        He corny as fuck with his Asher 
                        Roth ass!

           Black Dude #1 tosses the mixtape into a trash can nearby as 
           he and his boys all laugh.

           Jimmy catches Mac doing his best to cover up how hard that 
           line just hit him.

                                 JIMMY
                        Yo, pick that shit up!

           The black dudes immediately stop laughing. They’re not 
           messing around.

                                 BLACK DUDE #1
                        The fuck you say, faggot?

           Jimmy doesn’t respond. These dudes are bad news.

                                 BLACK DUDE #1 (CONT’D)
                             (changing tone)
                        You gentleman enjoy your day.

           The black dudes walk off, but turn around for one more word 
           before they disappear.

                                 BLACK DUDE #1 (CONT’D)
                        And turn that shit off! You’re 
                        making Pittsburgh look bad.

           Mac holds his head high as Reggie throws his arm around him, 
           showcasing the money.

                                 REGGIE
                        Those guys don’t know what they’re 
                        talking about.

                                 JIMMY
                        Dude’s lucky I didn’t beat his ass.

           The guys stare at Jimmy and laugh. Dumbfuck.
                                 MAC
                        Who’s hungry?

           Mac leads the guys inside the market.

           INT. FRICK PARK MARKET - DAY

           It’s your classic mom and pop convenience store full of 
           everything you need. Mac’s crew heads toward the deli.

                                 MAC
                        Get whatever you want! It’s on me.

           Jimmy fills his hands with everything he can carry.

           Mac approaches the deli counter manned by the only employee 
           in the store, BOBBY (70). 

                                 BOBBY
                        Mr. Malcolm. The usual?

                                 MAC
                        Egg salad, ham, and lettuce--you 
                        already know.

                                 BOBBY
                        And I’ll never understand.

           Mac clocks a couple SHADY KIDS (10) in the back of the store, 
           cuffing their pant legs à la Harmony Korine’s film, “Kids.” 

                                 MAC
                             (re: his crew)
                        Oh, and whatever these guys want.

           Mac heads back to the kids. They’re stealing Cokes, sliding 
           them down their pant legs.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        You getting ready for basketball 
                        season?

           The kids freeze. Huh?

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                             (pointing at the Cokes in 
                              their pants)
                        The ankle weights.

           The kids have no excuse.

                                 SHADY KID #1
                        It was his idea! 
                                 SHADY KID #2
                        No, it wasn’t

                                 SHADY KID #1
                        Yes, it was!

                                 MAC
                        We don’t boost from Frick Park 
                        Market. Other places, sure, but not 
                        our own neighborhood.

           They nod and begin putting the Cokes back in the fridge.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        C’mon, I got you.

           Mac grabs the Cokes from the kids.

           EXT. FRICK PARK MARKET - DAY

           Mac and his crew exit, all holding sandwiches. Jimmy has an 
           absurd amount of food. The kids follow right behind with 
           their drinks.

                                 MAC
                        Enjoy the Cokes.

                                 JIMMY
                        And stay in school!

           Shady Kid #1 nudges #2 to speak.

                                 SHADY KID #2
                        Oh, uh, Mac, we were wondering--

                                 SHADY KID #1
                        Can we have a CD?

           TreeJay goes into his backpack to grab a mixtape, but Mac 
           stops him.

                                 MAC
                        I’m working on something better. 
                        I’ll get you on the next one.

           INT. REGGIE’S CAR - NIGHT

           Reggie drives a MAROON HONDA ODYSSEY. Mac sits shotgun with 
           Jimmy and TreeJay in the back.

           Mac’s song, “Knock Knock” blasts on the stereo.
                                 ENTIRE CREW
                        1, 2, 3, 4 some crazy-ass kids come 
                        and knock up on your door, so
                        let ‘em in, let ‘em in, let ‘em in!

           The guys are knocking on the windows to Mac’s new track. 
           Jimmy is going nuts, peaking his head in the front seats.

                                 JIMMY
                        This shit is fire!

                                 REGGIE
                        Jimmy, put your seat belt on!

           The lyrics to the song end and just the beat continues.

                                 JIMMY
                        You gotta finish this ASAP.

                                 MAC
                        I talked to Jerm and he said he’ll 
                        hook it up, but it’s still gonna be 
                        like five bills.

                                 TREEJAY
                        Well, now we have a goal for the 
                        night.

                                 JIMMY
                        Whoever pulls the most gets a 
                        feature on the next tape!

                                 MAC
                        Then let’s pray to god it’s not 
                        you!

           Everybody laughs. Jimmy gets more defensive than usual.

                                 JIMMY
                             (freestyling)
                        I got bars. Driving in cars. I’m 
                        gonna go to Mars and give your girl 
                        SARS.

                                 MAC
                        Jesus, bro! You got fucking SARS?

           Everybody clowns Jimmy as the car speeds off down the road.

           EXT. CENTRAL CATHOLIC PARTY - NIGHT

           Reggie parks. The guys take in the “MTV Cribs” style house 
           and neighborhood.
                                 TREEJAY
                        Did they add another fucking wing 
                        to the house?

                                 MAC
                        I heard his Dad got promoted.

           Reggie reaches under his seat and pulls out a HAND DRAWN 
           BLUEPRINT of the house.

                                 JIMMY
                        Dude, you’re getting a lot better 
                        at this.

           Reggie gives him a look.

                                 REGGIE
                        So look, last time we fucked up 
                        because we had no idea which rooms 
                        we were hiding in. We’re not making 
                        that same mistake.

           Reggie circles a bedroom on the blueprint.

                                 REGGIE (CONT’D)
                        TreeJay and Jimmy, you’ll take the 
                        master. Up the stairs to the left.

           Reggie circles what looks to be the master bedroom.

                                 REGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Mac, I’ll be in the guest bedroom 
                        right by the pool. Easy escape.

           The boys are distracted as several HUNNIES (17) with designer 
           bags on their arms walk by the car and into the house.

                                 JIMMY
                        Jackpot.

           INT. CENTRAL CATHOLIC PARTY - NIGHT

           The party is bumping! Mac and his crew stand around the keg, 
           cups in hand, surveying the party.

           They spot the hunnies from outside doing shots of Fireball.

                                 TREEJAY
                             (to Jimmy)
                        I’ll be upstairs with the brunette 
                        in 30.

           Jimmy nods and walks upstairs.
           EXT. CENTRAL CATHOLIC PARTY - BACKYARD - NIGHT

           Mac, smoking a cig and housing a beer, and Reggie, with a 
           water bottle, stand in the busy backyard, admiring the pool.

                                 MAC
                        Man, I’m gonna have an infinity 
                        pool one day. Only it’ll be in the 
                        front yard, so everyone can see it.

                                 REGGIE
                        It’d be pretty hard to skinny dip.

                                 MAC
                        I ain’t hiding nothin’.

           Two BABES (18), on the other end of the yard, scream after 
           hitting the final shot of their beer pong game! As they hug 
           each other, it’s clear they too have designer bags.

                                 REGGIE
                        Target acquired.

                                 MAC
                        Gimme 15.

           Reggie heads inside as Mac walks off towards the girls.

           As he crosses the yard, Mac sees a group of BROS (17) in the 
           middle of a rap battle. He looks away, shaking his head.

           But he quickly looks back. Nomi is on the outskirts of the 
           rap circle nodding her head with her friend, TASHA (17).

           Mac pulls an audible. He tosses his cig, slams his beer, and 
           makes his way through the crowd, positioning himself right 
           next to Nomi. He nods at her. She nods back.

           BRAYLEN (17), a muscular red head, finishes roasting his 
           opponent.

                                 BRAYLEN
                        Your girl comes to my house, you 
                        wait in the whip.
                        I play lacrosse but she cradles my 
                        stick.

           The crowd goes wild! Ooh’s and ahh’s across the party. The 
           opponent leaves the circle, defeated, but Braylen’s cocky.

           He spots a random FAT KID (16) happily cheering, while eating 
           a burrito, and decides to go at him.
                                 BRAYLEN (CONT’D)
                        And look at you, living your best 
                        life. 
                        Eating everything in sight, getting 
                        fatter than Shrek’s wife!

           Mac doesn’t like it. He begins laughing obnoxiously, mocking 
           Braylen, until everyone’s eyes are on him. It’s quiet.

                                 MAC
                        Oooooh, baby!

                                 BRAYLEN
                        You want some, bitch?

                                 MAC
                             (pointing to himself)
                        Ladies first?

           Braylen motions for him to go.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Okay, Braylen actin hard but I’m 
                        gonna make this look easy
                        Can someone tell me who the fuck 
                        invited Ron Weasley?

           The crowd laughs!

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        I’m McDonalds pimpin’, They call me 
                        the Big MAC
                        Carrot Top called. He said “he 
                        wants his wig back!”
                        Okay, you play Lacrosse, but you

                        he’ll be your manager.
                        No wait. He’ll be CEO. And you’ll 
                        be his janitor!

           The crowd roars.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        I was there in the sixth grade,

                        The peach fuzz on ya face be 
                        looking like some Cheeto dust

                        Cuz I come with the strong raps
                        And you, you get no ass. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Like a chick with a long back
                        So Braylen next time ya step to me, 
                        dead is what you gonna be
                        I’m the best in the Burgh, you just 
                        a Mac Miller wannabe!

           The crowd goes even crazier than earlier. They jump up and 
           down around Mac, praising him. 

           During the madness, a RANDOM KID (16) accidentally spills his 
           beer all over Mac’s shirt.

                                 RANDOM KID
                        Fuck! Sorry bro. My bad--my bad.

           Mac doesn’t care. He’s got Nomi and good vibes.

                                 MAC
                        All good homie! I needed another 
                        one.

           Random Kid pulls out a bag of BLOW and his keys.

                                 RANDOM KID
                        You’re a legend bro! You want a 
                        bump?

           Mac wants it, but sees that Nomi is watching.

                                 MAC
                        Naw, I’m straight.

                                 RANDOM KID
                        Suit yourself.

           Random Kid snorts the fattest bump and begins horribly 
           rapping Sammy Adams’, “I Hate College” as he walks off.

           Off Mac, smiling and shaking his head at Nomi.

           INT. CENTRAL CATHOLIC PARTY - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           TreeJay enters the master bedroom making out with his target, 
           Hunny #1, who still has a designer purse around her shoulder.

           He brings her to the edge of the bed where they both sit and 
           continue to kiss.

           TreeJay slyly removes the purse from her shoulder, dropping 
           it on the floor. They both fall into the bed as the camera 
           pans down to find...
           Jimmy! He’s hiding under the bed. He grabs the purse and 
           rummages through until he finds CASH.

           BINGO! As he pockets the money, he overhears TreeJay and the 
           girl going at it.

                                 HUNNY #1 (O.S.)
                        Oh my god. It’s huge.

           Jimmy is disgusted. He does his signature army crawl out of 
           the room. Mission accomplished.

           EXT. CENTRAL CATHOLIC PARTY - BACKYARD - NIGHT

           Mac, still soaking wet, sits off to the side with Nomi in a 
           middle of a conversation.

                                 MAC
                        So, you know where you’re going?

                                 NOMI
                        Not yet. Thinking Temple. You?

                                 MAC
                        Home of Bill Cosby--alright! Great 
                        basketball too. But you’re probably 
                        not going for that.

                                 NOMI
                        I’d love a career like Cosby’s.

                                 MAC
                        Honestly, dude creeps me out. Wait, 
                        you trying to be a movie star?

           Nomi just smiles.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Oh, shit! We got the next Halle 
                        Berry right here.

                                 NOMI
                             (laughing)
                        Yeah, right.

                                 MAC
                        Whatchu mean, yeah right? I’ve 
                        never even seen you act and I 
                        already know you’re a star.

                                 NOMI
                        What about you? What’s big mac 
                        trying to do?
                                 MAC
                        You liked that one, didn’t you?

                                 NOMI
                        It was alright.

                                 MAC
                        Better be better than alright 
                        ‘cause that’s what I’m trying to 
                        do.

                                 NOMI
                        Rap?

                                 MAC
                        Yeah.

                                 NOMI
                        Really?

                                 MAC
                        Yeah. It’s the only thing I love... 
                        Actually--that’s not true. I love 
                        my mom, I love the Pirates--Damn, 
                        if I can make a rap about my mom 
                        and the Pirates I’ll die happy.

           Nomi cracks up again.

                                 NOMI
                        Well, what if it doesn’t work out?

                                 MAC
                        It will. And it will for you too.

           Nomi appreciates his ridiculous confidence.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        I’ve got a mixtape coming out soon 
                        actually. Playing with a new sound. 
                        Maybe I’ll get you a signed copy. 

                                 NOMI
                        Maybe I want a signed copy. What’s 
                        it called?

                                 MAC
                        Kids. Kickin’ Incredibly Dope Shit.

           A rolled up SHIRT flies into frame, hitting Mac in the chest.

           Mac looks up to see QUENTIN “Q” CUFF (18).
                                 Q
                        Had an extra in my car. Q.

           They dap up.

                                 MAC
                        Mac. This is Nomi. Good looks, but 
                        I can’t--

                                 Q
                        You’re soaked. And after that 
                        performance, you deserve it. ‘Bout 
                        time someone shut Braylen up.

           Mac unravels the shirt. It has Nas’ “Illmatic” album artwork 
           on it.

                                 MAC
                        Oh, shit! Love me some Illmatic.

           Mac immediately changes shirts.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Thanks, bruh. Good meeting you.

           Q doesn’t leave. Mac starts motioning his eyes towards Nomi, 
           letting Q know he’s cock blocking him.

                                 Q
                        Right. My bad. Hit me up sometime.

           Q hands Mac a BUSINESS CARD.

                                 MAC
                        Who the fuck has business cards in 
                        high school?

                                 Q
                        Dudes who know what they want. I 
                        think you can relate.

           Q walks off.

                                 NOMI
                        Looks like you got your first 
                        groupie.

           Mac examines the card. It has Q’s contact info, accompanied 
           by “Music Extraordinaire.”
           INT. CENTRAL CATHOLIC PARTY - FIRST FLOOR BEDROOM - NIGHT

           A frustrated Reggie has been hiding under the bed, waiting 
           for Mac, just as Jimmy did. 

           Bored out of his mind, he stares up at the SCREEN SAVER of a 
           nearby desktop computer monitor.

           The logo on the screen bounces around until it finally hits a 
           corner. 

                                 REGGIE
                             (celebrating)
                        Ahh! It hit.

           Reggie immediately snaps out of his trance.

                                 REGGIE (CONT’D)
                        The hell’s taking him so long?

           EXT. CENTRAL CATHOLIC PARTY - BACKYARD - NIGHT

           Nomi and Mac are sharing a laugh as Jimmy approaches, 
           counting the cash he stole. He nods to Mac.

                                 JIMMY
                        You guys talking math class without 
                        me?

                                 NOMI
                        Never.

           A HAMMERED BRO runs out of the house screaming.

                                 HAMMERED BRO
                        Cops, cops, cops! We got cops!

           Nomi’s friend, Tasha runs up and grabs her.

                                 TASHA
                        Let’s go girl.

           She drags Nomi off in a hurry as everyone in the backyard 
           scrambles for safety.

           But not before Mac grabs Nomi, spins her around, and lays a 
           kiss on her!

           Although the backyard is chaos, time has stopped for these 
           two. They slowly pull apart.

                                 NOMI
                        What was that?
                                 MAC
                        Cops don’t like rappers. I may 
                        never see you again.

                                 NOMI
                        I’ll see you in class.

                                 MAC
                        I never go to class.

                                 NOMI
                        True.

           This time, Nomi kisses Mac. 

           Jimmy, watching patiently with Tasha, decides he should make 
           a move too.

           But Tasha shuts him down. She’s had enough.

                                 TASHA
                        Yo, it’s just a house party! Ya’ll 
                        aren’t getting arrested.

           Mac and Nomi smile their goodbyes as Tasha drags her away.

                                 NOMI
                        I’ll wait for you!

                                 MAC
                        You better!

           TreeJay runs out and joins Jimmy and Mac.

                                 TREEJAY
                        Motherfuckers are in the house, 
                        let’s cruise!

           The guys run for the backyard fence, where a sea of kids are 
           climbing over, escaping into the forest preserve.

           Jimmy is the first one to jump the fence, followed by TreeJay 
           and Mac. 

           EXT. FOREST PRESERVE - NIGHT

           They sprint through the woods. Mac abruptly stops as Jimmy 
           ducks a TREE BRANCH.

                                 MAC
                        Yo! Where the fuck’s Reggie?
           EXT. CENTRAL CATHOLIC PARTY - BACKYARD - NIGHT

           SMASH. 

           A DESKTOP COMPUTER goes flying out a bedroom window, 
           shattering the glass, landing in the pool.

           EXT. FOREST PRESERVE - NIGHT

           Partygoers sprint past Mac, Jimmy, and TreeJay.

                                 MAC
                        I’m going back.

           Mac turns to run back.

                                 JIMMY
                        Wait! Let me. You got a future. If 
                        I get caught, shit doesn’t matter.

           Mac, surprised by his friend, stops.

                                 MAC
                        For real?

           Jimmy nods. Then...

                                 JIMMY
                        Fuck no, you asshole! I was just 
                        testing you--

                                 TREEJAY
                        Dudes!

           The guys look to see another wave of kids sprinting towards 
           them.

           Amongst the crowd is Reggie, holding a DESKTOP MONITOR.

           Braylen is behind him, gaining speed, followed by several out 
           of shape COPS (40s).

                                 BRAYLEN
                        Give me back my fucking computer!

           Reggie shouts to his friends.

                                 REGGIE
                        Go, go, go!

           Mac and TreeJay turn and sprint away. They realize Jimmy’s 
           not with them. 
                                 MAC
                        Where the fuck’s Jimmy?

           The guys turn around to see Jimmy hiding behind a tree, 
           bending back the branch he ducked earlier.

           Reggie passes the tree safely, but as Braylen passes, Jimmy 
           let’s go of the branch.

           WHACK.

           It snaps back, clotheslining Braylen. He hits the ground.

                       MAC (CONT’D)

           Damn!
                                              Ooooh!

           Reggie finally catches up to them.

           Jimmy gets one final word in with Braylen.

                                 JIMMY
                        There goes lacrosse season.

           He runs off as the cops, all exhausted, pile on Braylen.

           Jimmy joins his boys. They watch Braylen get cuffed and 
           manhandled by all three cops. It’s awesome.

           Once Braylen is secured, one of the cops gets up to pursue 
           the boys.

                                 TREEJAY
                        Oh, shit.

           The guys remember they’re being chased and sprint away. We 
           hear them as they run off.

                                 JIMMY
                             (to Mac)
                        Can’t believe you wanted me to go 
                        down for you!

                                 MAC
                        I thought it was a cool friend 
                        moment!

                                 JIMMY
                        You’re selfish!

           The boys disappear into the night.

                                 TREEJAY (O.S.)
                        Is that a computer monitor?
           INT. ID LABS - LOBBY - DAY

           BIG JERM (23) stands in the lobby of a recording studio, 
           shaking his head.

                                 BIG JERM
                        What the fuck am I supposed to do 
                        with that?

           Mac stands across from him, holding the computer monitor. 

                                 MAC
                        This shit’s practically new.

           Reggie, Jimmy, and TreeJay stand behind him.

                                 BIG JERM
                        I can’t pay my bills with that.

           Jimmy leans forward, handing him cash, which Jerm pockets.

                                 JIMMY
                        We got $243 bucks.

                                 MAC
                        And this brand new, piano black...

           Mac reads the label on the monitor.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Dell-SE17-LED--damn, this is a good 
                        one--has gotta be worth at least 
                        $100.

           Big Jerm stares down the young hustlers. He’s not budging.

           Q walks in.

                                 BIG JERM
                        What up, Q!

                                 Q
                        Jerm, how you living bro? 

                                 BIG JERM
                             (re: Mac)
                        I’m trying to make a living.

           Q nods to Mac.

                                 Q
                        My boy’s giving you trouble?
                                 BIG JERM
                        Your boy is trying to pay me with a 
                        stolen computer.

                                 MAC
                        You don’t know it’s stolen!

           Q motions to Big Jerm and they step aside to talk privately.

           Jimmy leans in to Mac.

                                 JIMMY
                        Who the fuck is this kid?

                                 MAC
                        That’s Q.

           Big Jerm and Q finish talking and re-approach the boys.

                                 BIG JERM
                        Three hours in the studio. That’s 
                        it. 

                                 MAC
                        Big Jerm, you’re a legend!

                                 BIG JERM
                        Don’t thank me.

                                 MAC
                             (to Q)
                        Music extraordinaire, huh?

           Mac, carrying the monitor, walks off towards the door of the 
           studio with Q. The guys follow.

                                 BIG JERM
                        And take that fucking monitor with 
                        you when you leave.

                                 JIMMY
                             (whispering to Reggie)
                        You know the computer would have 
                        been worth way more than the 
                        monitor, you dumbass.

           INT. ID LABS - STUDIO - DAY

           Big Jerm sits at a desk, controlling several computer screens 
           and a sound mixing board.

           A familiar beat plays throughout the room.
           Across from him, behind glass in the recording booth, is Mac. 
           He walks out to join the guys.

                                 MAC
                        Something’s missing.

           Jimmy, lounging on the couch, smokes a blunt dipped in liquid 
           PROMETHAZINE.

                                 JIMMY
                        Get your juices flowing!

           He tosses the prescription bottle of promethazine to Mac.

                                 REGGIE
                        Where’d you even get that?

                                 JIMMY
                        My mom’s got strep.

                                 REGGIE
                        That’s so fucked.

                                 JIMMY
                        What? She’s milking it!

           Mac finishes a big swig and hands the bottle to Reggie.

           Reggie actually takes a sip, but immediately grimaces. He 
           looks up to see TreeJay filming him with his camcorder.

                                 REGGIE
                        Dude, my scholarship!

           Everyone busts up laughing as Reggie puts his hands up, 
           blocking himself from being filmed.

                                 TREEJAY
                        Relax, bro!

           TreeJay grabs the bottle and takes a swig as Mac joins Big 
           Jerm and Q behind the monitors.

                                 MAC
                        Whatchu think?

                                 BIG JERM
                        I think you got 15 minutes left.

                                 MAC
                        Come on, bro. I need more time.

           Mac looks to Q.
           Jimmy, leaning hard off the promethazine, chimes in.

                                 JIMMY
                        Sell him the Nikes on your feet.

           Mac and Q’s eyes light up.

                                 MAC
                        Jerm, pull up that Nas remix.

                                 BIG JERM
                        Which one?

                                 Q
                        Illmatic--“The World Is Yours.”

           Big Jerm begins pulling it up.

                                 MAC
                        May I?

           Mac grabs the computer mouse and scrolls to a specific 
           section of the song. He presses play.

           It’s the remix of Nas’ song, “The World Is Yours.”

                                 NAS
                             (from computer)
                        Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit 
                        the phlegm on the streets. And the 
                        Nikes on my feet keep my cypher 
                        complete--

           Mac starts playing with the keys, editing the song.

                                 NAS (CONT’D)
                        And the Nikes on my feet keep my 
                        cypher complete. 
                        Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike 
                        Nike Nikes...

           The guys begin nodding their heads.

                                 MAC
                        Jerm, take it from the top.

           Mac heads back into the recording booth, behind the glass. He 
           puts HEADPHONES on as he approaches the microphone.

           INT. ID LABS - RECORDING BOOTH - DAY

           Mac’s rendition of the Nas track begins to play. He begins 
           rapping off the dome.
                                 MAC
                        Aye lace 'em up, lace 'em up, lace

           The guys love it! They go nuts as they watch Mac continue.

           Q bobs his head as he spots WIZ KHALIFA (21) and BENJY 
           GRINBERG (31) walking down the hallway outside the studio.

           Q immediately gets up and exits the room.

           INT. ID LABS - LOBBY - DAY

           Wiz hugs Benjy and leaves just as Q enters.

                                 Q
                        Yo, Benjy! 

                                 BENJY
                        Q, what’s new?

                                 Q
                        Come see for yourself.

           INT. ID LABS - STUDIO - DAY

           Benjy, now in the room with Q and the guys, stands watching 
           Mac spit his latest verse in the booth.

                                 MAC
                        I make 'em so mad, they got no swag
                        Pippens on my feet they the 
                        throwbacks

                        So they stay attached to my 
                        gonads...

           Jimmy, really feeling that last line, jumps up and 
           aggressively humps the air.

           As Mac continues, Benjy gives Q a nod of approval.

           Nomi cuddles up on Mac’s lap as Jimmy, Reggie, TreeJay, Q, 
           and Tasha are all sitting around the park’s blue slide, 
           watching Mac’s music video for “Nikes On My Feet” on YouTube.

           Q’s phone rings, disrupting the video. Everyone groans.

           The caller ID says “Rostrum.”

                                 Q
                        Oh, shit.

                        launch you into a different 
                        stratosphere.

                                 JIMMY
                        I say, fuck ‘em!

           Nomi smacks him on the head.

                                 NOMI
                        Nobody ever accomplished anything 
                        remarkable alone.

                                 MAC
                        I’m not alone. I got the most dope 
                        family. And the most dope girl!

                                 TREEJAY/JIMMY/REGGIE
                        Amen!
                                 JIMMY
                        Yeah, she fine as hell!

           Mac pretends to back hand Jimmy.

                                 NOMI
                        Rostrum is a Pittsburgh label. That 
                        makes them family.

                                 TREEJAY/JIMMY/REGGIE
                        True!

                                 MAC
                        Why you so smart?

                                 NOMI
                        Because I go to class.

                                 JIMMY
                        Our boy Mac is about to blow the 
                        fuck up!

                                 TREEJAY
                        Shit’s about to be different, bro.

           TreeJay passes Mac the blunt. He takes a huge hit.

                                 MAC
                        Shit is about to be different. But, 
                        no matter where we go or how big we 
                        get, this slide--this slide is 
                        always gonna be blue. 

           The crew looks at each other. 

           Mac, feeling prolific, takes another hit of the blunt and 
           continues.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        This will always be Blue Slide 
                        Park.

           Everyone bursts out in laughter.

                                 JIMMY
                        How fucking high are you?

           Jimmy grabs the blunt from Mac.
           INT. MAC’S MOM’S HOUSE - DAY

           Mac and his mom, KAREN (48) sit at the kitchen table in front 
           of a huge spread of food including bagels, lox, challah 
           french toast, and salad. 

           Karen finishes laying out some pickles as Mac reaches for 
           one. She slaps his hand.

                                 KAREN
                        You’ll mess up the presentation!

                                 MAC
                        Nobody’s gonna notice if one 
                        pickle’s missing.

           DOORBELL RINGS.

                                 KAREN
                        Ahh, they’re early!

           Mac heads for the door.

                                 MAC
                        Naw, that’s just Q.

                                 KAREN
                        Who’s Q?

                                 MAC
                        My business manager.

                                 KAREN
                        And what business is he managing?

           Mac yells from the front door.

                                 MAC (O.S.)
                        Me! I ain’t a businessman. I’m a 
                        business, man.

           Karen just rolls her eyes as Mac comes back in with Q.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Mom, meet Q--Q, meet my mom. Mom, 
                        you are the reason I’m here. And Q, 
                        Q’s the reason Rostrum’s here.

                                 Q
                        Mac’s the reason. I just 
                        facilitated.
                                 KAREN
                        Well, is there any way you can 
                        facilitate better grades for 
                        Malcolm?

                                 Q
                        You might need someone a little 
                        more powerful than me for that.

                                 KAREN
                        Any suggestions?

                                 Q
                        God.

           Karen smiles, easing the tension.

                                 KAREN
                        So, who is Rose Thumb again?

                                 MAC
                        Rostrum. It’s Rostrum, Mom.

                                 Q
                        They’re a record label that wants 
                        to sign your son as a rapper.

                                 MAC
                        It’s the same label that put Wiz 
                        Khalifa on the map.

                                 KAREN
                        Who?

                                 MAC
                        He went to ‘Dice with me. He didn’t 
                        get good grades.

           DOORBELL RINGS.

           INT. MAC'S MOM'S HOUSE - DAY - LATER

           Mac, Karen, Q, and now Benjy, sit around the table. Most of 
           the food has been eaten and everyone is enjoying themselves.

                                 KAREN
                        Okay, so if we do this, does that 
                        mean Malcolm is going to have to 
                        continue rapping in his room in the 
                        middle of the night? 
                                 MAC
                        Mom, Rick Rubin started Def Jam in 
                        his room!

                                 KAREN
                        Did he get that name from his 
                        mother going deaf?
                             (to Benjy)
                        Look, I love Malcolm’s rapping and 
                        clearly you do too, but if he signs 
                        with you, I want him to have an 
                        office?

                                 BENJY
                        We’ll make sure he has unlimited 
                        studio time to record--

                                 KAREN
                        After school.

                                 BENJY
                        Of course. After school.

           Mac rolls his eyes.

                                 KAREN
                        And when does Malcolm get paid?

                                 MAC
                        Mom, it’s not about--

                                 BENJY
                        No, it’s totally fine. Valid 
                        question. He’ll make his money once 
                        the next record blows up. In my 
                        experience, it’s best to put out 
                        your mixtapes for free, garner some 
                        die hard fans, and capitalize off 
                        the hype through concert sales and 
                        merchandise. Mac’s next tape will 
                        drop this summer and the kids--pun 
                        intended--will be all over it. 
                        We’ll get him touring college 
                        campuses right away. Same strategy 
                        that worked for Wiz. Then, after 
                        the tour, we release Mac’s debut 
                        album, which fans will have to pay 
                        for. And by then, they’ll want to.

                                 MAC
                        Damn right.
                                 BENJY
                        We’re not a big label. But a big 
                        label’s not what you need. You need 
                        a fighter--someone who has your 
                        back and isn’t afraid to get 
                        scrappy. Someone from Pittsburgh.

                                 Q
                        What about YouTube? That can be 
                        another revenue stream at the 
                        beginning. Mac’s homies are always 
                        filming anyway. I’d like to set up 
                        a channel for Mac where he shares 
                        everything he’s doing while on tour 
                        and making music.

                                 BENJY
                        I love that. Justin Bieber’s doing 
                        that right now and he’s crushing. 

                                 KAREN
                        Oh, I love him! He’s adorable.

                                 MAC
                        I’m essentially hip-hop’s Justin 
                        Bieber, Mom!

           Everyone chuckles.

                                 BENJY
                        So, we doing this?

           Mac looks at his mom.

                                 MAC
                        We doing this?

           She stares back at him.

                                 KAREN
                        Oy vey! We’re doing this.

           Mac jumps up from his seat and gives her a huge hug.

           BEGIN MONTAGE

           Taio Cruz’s 2010 jam, “Dynamite” begins playing.

           - On a computer screen showcasing Mac Miller’s Facebook page, 
           someone types, “K.I.D.S. OUT NOW!!!,” accompanied by a link 
           to datpiff.com. They press “share” and put up the post.
           - Mac, Nomi, and the guys sit behind the screen, staring at 
           the downloadable link on datpiff.com, waiting for the first 
           download. They refresh the screen several times, until the 
           downloads read: 1. They start high-fiving.

           - Shady Kid #1 and #2 from Frick Park Market bust into a 
           bedroom, fighting for control of the computer. Shady Kid #1 
           finally gets a hold of the mouse and we cut to the screen.

           - The download count begins rapidly ascending until it hits 
           750,000+

           - Headlines from various music blogs and magazines such as 
           Complex, Fader, and 2 Dope Boyz, litter the screen, all 
           praising Mac’s new mixtape. 

           - Mac sits in the booth at Shade 45, a premiere satellite 
           radio station, spitting a flow. It’s clear he’s getting more 
           and more love. 

           - Mac, being filmed and followed by TreeJay, leads him onto a 
           tour bus where they find Jimmy sleeping. Mac puts shaving 
           cream on Jimmy’s hand and proceeds to tickle his nose. Jimmy 
           immediately scratches his itch and wakes up to a face full of 
           shaving cream.

           - Mac’s Twitter page hits one million followers.

           - A TATTOO ARTIST inks a large TRIBAL EAGLE on Mac’s chest, 
           adding to several new tattoos across his body.

           - The marquee of a concert venue reads, “Mac Miller - SOLD 
           OUT.”

           - Mac and a few other rappers chill at a photoshoot. They dap 
           each other up and have some laughs before posing for a photo.

           - We cut to the edited image, which is the cover of XXL 
           Magazine’s 2011 Freshman Class. The rappers surrounding Mac 
           were YG, Kendrick Lamar, and Meek Mill to name a few.

           - An actual video of Donald Trump praising Mac Miller appears 
           on screen. Donald says Mac is the next Eminem.

           END MONTAGE

           INT. IHOP - NIGHT

           TATTOO COUNTER: 19

           Mac and Jimmy sit in a booth with their hands behind their 
           backs, each with their face submerged in a stack of pancakes. 
           TreeJay sits across from them, filming on his camcorder. He 
           turns the camera around to get a quick word in. 

                                 TREEJAY
                        International house of idiots, 
                        people.

           Mac finishes his stack and immediately comes up celebrating.

                                 MAC
                        Booyah, bitch!

           Mac stands up in the booth and dances. Jimmy argues the win.

                                 JIMMY
                        Bullshit, there’s still scraps on 
                        your plate!

           Mac raises his arms, doing a self-clasping victory handshake.

                                 MAC
                        Winner! By PKO, Mac Fucking Miller!

           A group of COLLEGE GIRLS (20) walk up to their table. 

           Mac and the guys immediately freeze.

           One of the girls slides a folded up napkin across the table, 
           giving Mac a smile before she walks off.

           Dumbfounded, they silently watch the girls exit.

           Mac sits back down and opens the napkin. 

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Looks like we got an after party.

           He laughs and holds the napkin up to TreeJay’s lens. It 
           reads, “812-629-3592 - 1020 N. Jordan Ave. - Mallory.”

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        That’s how it’s done boys!

                                 JIMMY
                        You didn’t do shit!

                                 MAC
                             (singing)

           TreeJay, still filming, follows Jimmy and Mac walking out of 
           a liquor store as Mac opens a bottle of Jameson. They step 
           onto a busy street lined with fraternities and sororities.

                                 MAC
                             (sipping Jameson)
                        So, this is what Reggie’s getting 
                        into?

                                 JIMMY
                        Maybe we shoulda went to college.

                                 TREEJAY
                        Yo, Mac! Whatchu think about people 
                        calling your music frat rap?

                                 MAC
                        I think it’s hilarious, man. It’s 
                        like--

           A group of FRAT BROS (20s) crushing beers notice Mac walking 
           past their house.

                                 FRAT BRO
                        “Name’s Mac Miller!”

           Mac diverts his attention to the guys.

                                 MAC
                        “Who the fuck are you?!”

           The guys laugh, taking in Mac’s fame. Mac turns back to 
           camera.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        What was I saying? Oh yeah, frat 
                        rap! Fuck’s that even mean? I’m 
                        gonna drop Blue Slide Park and just 
                        keep making my own category of 
                        music.

           Mac and the guys spot the ZETA TAU ALPHA house.

           EXT. ZETA TAU ALPHA - NIGHT

           They near the front door. Loud music blasts inside.

                                 JIMMY
                        Well, whatever you’re doing. It’s 
                        working.
           Mac opens the door to a wild party full of SORORITY GIRLS.

           Mac turns back to TreeJay’s camera before walking in.

                                 MAC
                        And this is where we say goodnight.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

           A RINGING PHONE on the nightstand reads, “Nomi <3.” A 
           tattooed hand reaches into frame, silencing the phone.

           The phone RINGS again. Mac, lying in bed alone, nursing a 
           headache, quickly answers annoyed.

                                 MAC
                        What’s up, baby?
                             (beat)
                        Oh shit--Q. My bad.
                             (beat)
                        Yeah, yeah. Be there in 20.

           INT. FRAT HOUSE - DAY

           Leftover red solo cups and frat bros line the room. Jimmy and 
           TreeJay chat up a couple girls doing a beer bong in the 
           corner of the room where an INDIANA UNIVERSITY FLAG hangs.

           Mac sits on a beat up La-Z-Boy, holding a can of beer to his 
           head and smoking a cig. One of the frat bros approaches, 
           doing a bump of COCAINE off a key.

                                 COKE BRO
                        You were sleeping on Indiana, 
                        weren’t you?

                                 MAC
                        Bro, I didn’t do any sleeping. You 
                        mind if I do a line?

                                 COKE BRO
                        You wanna do a line with me?

                                 MAC
                        Yeah.

                                 COKE BRO
                        Fuck yeah, I’ll do a line with Mac 
                        Miller.

           Coke Bro sets up two lines of cocaine on the table. He 
           quickly rolls up a dollar bill.
                                 COKE BRO (CONT’D)
                        None of my homies are gonna believe 
                        this. Here, you first.

           Mac rips the line, immediately feeling more alive.

                                 COKE BRO (CONT’D)
                        That shit’s gonna have you crowd 
                        surfing.

           Coke Bro eagerly extends his hand for Mac to give him the 
           rolled up bill, but Mac ignores him and rips the second line.

           Q comes in the room and yells to Mac.

                                 Q
                        You’re up, kid!

                                 MAC
                        Thanks, homie.

           Off a disappointed Coke Bro.

           MAC’S POV:

           Mac, now feeling like a beast, shoots out of his chair.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                             (to Jimmy and TreeJay)
                        Showtime, boys!

           Mac walks out of the room, down a long hall way, dapping up a 
           variety of college guys and girls.

           A group of girls flash Mac. He pauses, takes them in, and 
           continues.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Woo! Tits!

           Mac claps his hands and right before he exits the house, he’s 
           handed a beer.

           EXT. FRAT HOUSE - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           Mac, drinking his beer, passes a FRESHMAN (18) puking on the 
           pavement.

                                 MAC
                        Better out than in, baby!

           The Freshman gives Mac a thumbs up.
           Across the lot is the back of a large BLACK STAGE. Loud 
           screams and clapping can be heard behind it.

           Mac heads for the stage through the parking lot. He passes a 
           YOUNG COUPLE (19) making out on the hood of a car.

           As Mac nears a small staircase leading into the back of the 
           stage, his song, “Donald Trump” begins to play. Mac busts 
           through the curtains.

           EXT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Mac enters the stage, looking out upon a sea of 5,000 college 
           kids screaming his name.

           He passes a DJ (30) on stage who tosses him a CORDLESS 
           MICROPHONE. Mac begins. 

           END MAC’S POV

                                 MAC
                        Ay yo, the fliest muthafucka' in 
                        the room
                        Yeah, you know it's me
                        Bitches hating on him, 'cause he 
                        started out here locally
                        Hopefully, I'll be at the top soon
                        For now, I'm at my house on the 
                        couch, watching cartoons
                        You know how much you love it when 
                        you get it in abundance
                        Give a fuck about a budget...

           Mac performs the rest of the song as the audience sings every 
           lyric with him.

           Coke Bro watches Mac perform from backstage. He turns to a 
           group of girls standing next to him.

                                 COKE BRO
                        We just did coke together! Me and 
                        Mac!

           The girls don’t care at all.

           Mac finishes and tosses the mic on stage. High out of his 
           mind, he rips his shirt off and stage dives into the crowd.

           Mac is on top of the world as he surfs the students. 
           EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT

           Mansions litter the hills of Los Angeles. One specific house 
           has an infinity pool in the front yard...

           INT. MAC’S LA MANSION - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Nomi gets to the top of the stairs and heads into a hallway 
           where she finds Q, leaning against a bedroom door.

                                 NOMI
                        How’s he doing?

           Q shakes his head.

                                 Q
                        He won’t come out.

           Nomi knocks on the door.

                                 NOMI
                        Malcolm?

           INT. MAC’S LA MANSION - BEDROOM - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           TATTOO COUNTER: 34

           Mac disappointingly stares at himself in the mirror. He knows 
           he has to open the door.

                                 NOMI (O.S.)
                        Malcolm, baby, it’s me. Open up.

                                 MAC
                        Fuck this shit.

           He digs under the marble bathroom sink and pulls out 
           PRESCRIPTION PILLS.

                                 NOMI (O.S.)
                        Malcolm!

           He pops a few and hides them before walking towards the door.

                                 MAC
                        I’m coming, I’m coming!

           INT. MAC’S LA MANSION - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Mac sits at the edge of a California King, burying his face 
           in his hands.
           Nomi rubs his back, comforting him.

                                 NOMI
                        Baby, come on. Look at this room--
                        this house. The amount of people 
                        that are here for you... You just 
                        need to be grateful.  

           Mac launches up from the bed.

                                 MAC
                        I am fucking grateful!

                                 NOMI
                        I know you are. Baby, I know. 

                                 MAC
                        If you knew, you wouldn’t be saying 
                        this dumb shit. You don’t know.

                                 NOMI
                        What I do know is that you have a 
                        number one album out and you’re 
                        moping because of some nerd’s 
                        review.

                                 MAC
                        It’s fucking Pitchfork, Nomi!

                                 NOMI
                        I’ve never even heard of Pitchfork.

                                 MAC
                        They gave the album a one--a 
                        fucking one! 

                                 NOMI
                        Who cares? The reviews don’t 
                        matter.

                                 MAC
                        No shit they don’t matter! They 
                        don’t even know what the fuck 
                        they’re talking about--my sound’s 
                        already completely different!

           Nomi can’t take Mac’s yelling. He finally notices her tears.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Ah, baby, come on--I’m sorry.

           He sits back down, wiping her tears.
                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. I’m just stressed as 
                        fuck and taking it out on you.

                                 NOMI
                        Why?

                                 MAC
                        I don’t know.

                                 NOMI
                        I’m not a punching bag.

                                 MAC
                        Of course not.

                                 NOMI
                        You used to always make me laugh. 
                        Like, always. Now you just make me 
                        cry.

           Jimmy comes barging in the room with a bottle of champagne as 
           Q tries to stop him.

                                 Q (O.S.)
                        Dude, give him a min--

                                 JIMMY
                        Mac! The people be asking for the 
                        champ. Get your ass down here!

           Jimmy runs out as fast as he came in.

           Mac has no words. He just stares at her.

                                 NOMI
                        You better go, champ. 

                                 MAC
                        That’s not fair.

                                 NOMI
                        No. It’s not.

           Nomi leaves the room.

           Mac grabs a cup off his nightstand and heads to his bathroom.

           INT. MAC'S LA MANSION - BEDROOM - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Mac opens his medicine cabinet and grabs a bottle of 
           PROMETHAZINE. He pops the top and chugs.
           Halfway through the bottle, he stops and pours the rest in 
           his cup.

           Mac looks up and stares at himself in the mirror.

           INT. MAC'S LA MANSION - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

           A chandelier hangs above Mac’s mom, Karen, who stands amongst 
           a crowd of select friends, chatting with Benjy and Q.

           A banner reading “Blue Slide Park” hangs behind them.

                                 BENJY
                        Remember when you were worried 
                        about Malcolm getting paid? What do 
                        you think now?

                                 KAREN
                             (scanning the room)
                        I think he’s getting paid a little 
                        too much.

                                 Q
                        We’re just getting started, Ms. M.

                                 KAREN
                        That’s what scares me. Malcolm’s 
                        never not working. He needs a 
                        break.

                                 BENJY
                        That’s just tour life. Things’ll be 
                        different now that he’s settled in 
                        LA.

                                 KAREN
                        I hope so.

                                 MAC (O.S.)
                        Ladies and gentleman!

           Everyone looks to the top of the stairs where Mac stands, 
           holding his cup in the air.

           Nomi studies Mac, who now looks happier than ever. Their eyes 
           meet for a brief second before Mac looks away.

                                 JIMMY
                        There he is!

                                 MAC
                        Thanks, Jimbo.
                                 JIMMY
                        The man of the hour!

                                 MAC
                        I think they got it.

                                 JIMMY
                        Speech!

                                 MAC
                        What do you think I’m doing?

                                 JIMMY
                        Speech, speech, speech--

           TreeJay puts his hand over Jimmy’s mouth, shutting him up.

                                 MAC
                        Okay. Let me tell you why we’re 
                        here. We’re here because I just 
                        dropped my first album, Blue Slide 
                        Park. 

           The party cheers!

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Hold on, hold on. It gets better. 
                        Blue Slide Park is the first 
                        independently distributed album to 
                        top the charts since like ninety-
                        fucking-five. Thank you Youtube! 
                        Thank you Bieber!

           The crowd goes crazy!

           Q gives Benjy a look. Told you so.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        No, but for real. I’m really proud 
                        of this album. It means a lot to 
                        me. So, yeah--this is pretty chill. 
                        And honestly, I couldn’t have done 
                        this without everyone here. 

                                 JIMMY
                        Damn straight!

                                 MAC
                        Jimmy, shut the fuck up!

           The crowd laughs.
                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        But yeah, Q, TreeJay, Jimbo, Benjy--
                        Mom! Yup, my fucking mom is in the 
                        house right now.

           Some of the party begins to clap. Mac encourages them.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Fuck yeah! Give it up for moms!

           The crowd cheers louder as Nomi looks down, forgotten in his 
           shout outs.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        It takes a lot of guts to let your 
                        baby boy follow his dreams, 
                        especially when that dream is 
                        becoming a rapper-- 

                                 THUNDERCAT
                        A white Jewish rapper!

           Thundercat, much younger than we last saw him at the Tiny 
           Desk show, entertains the laughing crowd.

                                 THUNDERCAT (CONT’D)
                        What? It’s true. That shit’s hard.

                                 MAC
                        Thanks, Cat. It is hard. But I 
                        wouldn’t have it any other way. 
                        Cheers to the most dope family. 
                        Love you all!

           Everyone takes a big drink.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                             (singing)
                        We’ve only just begun!

           Mac looks back to where Nomi was standing, but she’s gone.

           Jimmy, aggressively shaking his champagne bottle, pops the 
           top. It hits him in the forehead, sending him to the ground.

           INT. MAC'S LA MANSION - NIGHT

           The house is empty, aside from cups and clutter. We pan 
           through the silent house into the backyard.
           EXT. MAC’S LA MANSION - BACKYARD - NIGHT

           We navigate the bare, concrete yard overlooking Studio City. 

           In the back of the yard is a recording studio. Music blasts 
           inside.

           INT. MAC'S LA MANSION - RECORDING STUDIO - NIGHT

           Mac, sipping from a new cup, sways in his sound booth, 
           creating his future hit song, “Loud.” 

                                 MAC
                        I got codeine in my cup, you can 
                        bet your ass I'm sippin'
                        Groupies fall in love, I’m like 
                        bitch you must be trippin’
                        I’m just tryna fuck and she just 
                        need tuition
                        Why you tryna stunt, you need to 
                        play your own position

           INT. MAC'S LA MANSION - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Nomi stirs awake in bed. She reaches for Mac. He’s not there.

           She checks the clock: 4:34AM.

           As she stares at the ceiling, she hears the faint sound of 
           music coming from outside.

           Nomi heads for the window. She stares at the studio in the 
           backyard, worried about Mac.

           EXT. MAC’S LA MANSION - BACKYARD - NIGHT

           TIME LAPSE

           Over the next few days, Mac never comes out of the studio, 
           but guests including Thundercat, SCHOOLBOY Q (25), EARL 
           SWEATSHIRT (17), VINCE STAPLES (18), come in and out.

           Nomi infrequently joins the guys. 

           END TIME LAPSE

           INT. MAC’S LA MANSION - RECORDING STUDIO - DAY

           Jimmy, Q, TreeJay, and Earl Sweatshirt sit around the room as 
           Thundercat creates a new beat at the computer.
           TYLER, THE CREATOR (20) walks in, passing a poster on the 
           wall of the PITCHFORK ARTICLE that rated Mac’s album a one, 
           and tosses a pack of smokes to Earl.

                                 TYLER
                        Fuck! Smells like burnt pubes in 
                        here.

           Mac stumbles out of the recording booth laughing, styrofoam 
           cup in hand.

                                 MAC
                        How many times have you singed your 
                        pubes?

                                 TYLER
                        You tell me.

           Tyler flashes the boys his out of control bush.

                                 EARL
                        Fuck, bro--you need some Roundup 
                        for that shit.

           The guys laugh as Mac, barely standing, tops his cup off with 
           more lean.

                                 MAC
                        Who needs another dose?

                                 THUNDERCAT
                             (playfully)
                        That shit’s too strong, bro.

                                 MAC
                        It’s nothing.

           Mac continues to pour.

                                 THUNDERCAT
                        That’s too much though.

                                 MAC
                        I just wanna taste it.

                                 THUNDERCAT
                        You’re gonna miss a couple of 
                        shows.

                                 MAC
                        No way.

           The group laughs as Mac takes a sip.
           Nomi walks in.

                                 NOMI
                        Mac, I’m leaving.

                                 MAC
                             (to Thundercat)
                        My finest concoction yet! 

                                 NOMI
                        Malcolm! I’m leaving.

           All the guys look to Nomi.

                                 MAC
                        Alright, I’m coming, I’m coming.

           Mac and Nomi head outside as Thundercat watches his boy 
           closely.

           EXT. MAC'S LA MANSION - BACKYARD - DAY

           Nomi stands across from Mac, her suitcase on the ground.

                                 MAC
                        Damn, it’s bright out.

                                 NOMI
                        It’s been bright out.

           Mac doesn’t know what to say.

                                 NOMI (CONT’D)
                        I’m going home.

                                 MAC
                        I know.

                                 NOMI
                        I’m worried about you.

                                 MAC
                        Me? Nomi, I’m good--we are good. 
                        Look at all this.

                                 NOMI
                        Yeah, look at all this, have you 
                        seen it? You spend every god damn 
                        hour of the day in your studio.

                                 MAC
                        I’m working!
                                 NOMI
                        You’re always working!

                                 MAC
                        That’s why I’m the best!

           Nomi takes her time with what she’s about to say.

                                 NOMI
                        No, Mac. You’re the best because of 
                        your heart. Your loyalty. You’re 
                        the best because of that cheesy ass 
                        smile--because of how you treat 
                        your mom. That’s why you’re the 
                        best. Work has nothing to do with 
                        it.

           Mac’s too high for her words to resonate. He gets defensive.

                                 MAC
                        What’s paying for your flight home? 
                        Work. What paid for that necklace? 
                        Work. So, what the fuck are you 
                        talking about, Nomi?

           Nomi breaks down, but it’s more disappointment than anything.

           She takes her necklace off and hands it to Mac.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        No. That’s yours. I don’t want it.

           She lets the necklace fall to the ground as she kisses him on 
           the cheek.

                                 NOMI
                        Bye, Malcolm.

           Nomi walks off with her suitcase as Mac stares at the 
           necklace on the ground.

           He takes a big sip of lean and heads back into the studio.

           INT. MAC’S LA MANSION - RECORDING STUDIO - DAY

           Mac is sitting in front of his DRUM KIT, finishing up a beat, 
           as Thundercat records.

                                 THUNDERCAT
                        Shit’s hype.

           Thundercat plays the recording back. It’s awesome.
           As the guys listen to the beat, Mac wanders off in thought, 
           pulling out his phone. He begins scrolling through NOMI’S 
           INSTAGRAM PAGE.

           EXT. MILK STUDIOS - DAY

           TATTOO COUNTER: 40

           Mac, repping a vibrant sweatshirt and a new NECK TATTOO, sits 
           in an alley, back against the brick, smoking a cig and 
           casually sipping from a red solo cup. 

           He takes a long drag and looks up from his phone where he’s 
           been scrolling through NOMI’S INSTAGRAM PAGE once again.

           Mac glares in awe through the open studio door where a large 
           crew sets up for a colorful music video shoot.

           Before going back to his phone, he catches a glimpse of 
           ARIANA GRANDE (19) changing her shirt in private.

           Mac quickly looks away, but can’t help but take another 
           glance as he puffs his cig.

           Busted. Ariana is staring right at him.

           Mac, caught off guard, abruptly coughs from the smoke as 
           Ariana laughs, watching him wheeze.

                                 Q (O.S.)
                        You good, bro?

           Q walks up, holding MOUTHWASH.

                                 MAC
                        Oh, yeah--I’m straight.

           Mac looks back to Ariana, but she’s gone.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        These studio budgets are insane.

           Q tosses Mac the mouthwash.

                                 Q
                        Free mouthwash.

           INT. MILK STUDIOS - DAY

           Mac and Ariana, surrounded by balloons, dance in front of a 
           projector, shooting the music video for her song, “The Way.”
           As the song winds down, Mac pulls Ariana close, his hands 
           around her waist.

           Ariana moves in closer. He licks his lips. She bites hers.

           They kiss. Passionately. Mac goes for her neck and then back 
           to her mouth.

                                 DIRECTOR (O.S.)
                        Beautiful--cut!

           Mac and Ariana gently separate from one another. He keeps his 
           hands around her waist, basking in the moment.

           Ariana just stares at him. Are they going to kiss again?

                                 ARIANA
                        You taste like cigarettes and 
                        whiskey.

           Nope. She pulls away completely as Mac laughs it off.

                                 MAC
                        That’s just the new toothpaste 
                        flavor I’ve been using--cigarettes 
                        and whiskey. Cool mint gets old 
                        after a while, you know?

                                 ARIANA
                        I prefer cool mint.

                                 MAC
                        I’ll keep that in mind for next 
                        time.

           Ariana shakes her head, flashes a coy smile, and walks off.

           INT. MAC’S G-WAGON - DAY

           With the windows down, Q drives through the hills of Los 
           Angeles as Mac rides shotgun.

           Mac closes his eyes, taking in the buzzing sound of nature. 

           He extends his arm out the window, making waves through the 
           wind, absorbing the sun.

           INT. SOHO HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           TATTOO COUNTER: 51

           Mac, heavier than we’ve seen him, sits in a stall doing blow.
           He puts the bag away and wipes cocaine from his patchy beard.

           Mac exits the stall and throws $100 into the tip jar of the 
           BATHROOM ATTENDANT (40).

                                 MAC
                        Thanks, brother.

           Mac playfully slaps him on the back and leaves.

           INT. SOHO HOUSE - NIGHT

           Mac gets back to his table where his manager, Benjy, and 
           Mac’s half-eaten ribs wait for him. A WAITER (30) passes by.

                                 MAC
                        Excuse me, two more Jamo’s please!

           Mac slams the rest of his whiskey.

                                 BENJY
                        I still have a full one.

           While Mac just smiles back at him, Benjy clocks some coke 
           residue on his beard, but doesn’t say anything.

                                 MAC
                        I know.

           Benjy lets out a reluctant laugh.

                                 BENJY
                        So, how are Q and the boys?

                                 MAC
                        They’re good. Yeah, really good--
                        Listen, Benjy, I just gotta say 
                        something.

                                 BENJY
                        Okay...

                                 MAC
                        I love Rostrum. I’m grateful for 
                        everything you guys did for me. 
                        It’s been a hell of a ride--

                                 BENJY
                        Yeah, it has.

                                 MAC
                        But I think this next album is the 
                        last one we do together. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MAC (CONT'D)
                        Nothing to do with you, man. I love 
                        you. You’re my fucking man, but 
                        don’t you feel like it’s time for a 
                        new story?

                                 BENJY
                        New story? Where’s this coming 
                        from?

                                 MAC
                        Our contract’s up, man.

                                 BENJY
                        The same contract you said we 
                        didn’t need because a handshake’s 
                        worth more?

           Mac’s whiskeys get dropped off at the table, saving him from 
           having to respond. He chugs one and moves on to the other.

                                 BENJY (CONT’D)
                        Mac, I get it, but don’t just jump 
                        to something new for the hell of 
                        it. This is working.

                                 MAC
                        For you. This is working for you. 
                        And while I love the indie shit, I 
                        want to see what I can do with a 
                        bigger budget.

                                 BENJY
                        I’ll get you a bigger budget.

                                 MAC
                        What about Rick Rubin? Can you get 
                        him? ‘Cause I did... I’m talking to 
                        him every day. He loves my sound 
                        and he thinks Warner Brothers can 
                        take me to a new level.

                                 BENJY
                        Of course he does. You know how 
                        much they pay him to say that shit? 
                        As much as it fucking takes. When I 
                        met you, it wasn’t about the money.

                                 MAC
                        Still isn’t. But it’s Rick fucking 
                        Rubin--hip-hop’s Ben Franklin. And 
                        he’s like us.

                                 BENJY
                        Like us?
                                 MAC
                        Yeah. Chosen.

                                 BENJY
                        Oh, I’m supposed to be happy you’re 
                        leaving me for another Jew?

                                 MAC
                        Come on, Benjy. I just wanna see 
                        what I can do with a studio behind 
                        me. It’s nothing personal.

           Benjy watches Mac pound his other whiskey.

                                 BENJY
                        I’m worried about you. I think 
                        you’re--

                                 MAC
                        Benjy. I’m not asking for your 
                        advice or your permission. I’m 
                        telling you. And I’d really like to 
                        have your support on this.

           Benjy takes his time.

                                 BENJY
                        You know I have your back with 
                        whatever you do. Even if I don’t 
                        think it’s the right move.

                                 MAC
                        I know. That’s why I love you.

           The waiter approaches.

                                 WAITER
                        Anything else I can get you?

                                 MAC
                        I’ll take two more Jamo’s. Benjy?

           Benjy just shakes his head, “no.”

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Make it three.

           The waiter walks off and two BLONDES (20s) approach Mac.

                                 BLONDE #1
                        Mac, how are you?

                                 BLONDE #2
                        I love the beard.
           Benjy takes a sip of water while staring at Mac, who’s 
           completely wrapped up in the girls playing with his beard.

           Benjy gets up and walks off. Mac doesn’t even notice.

           INT. MAC'S LA MANSION - BATHROOM - DAY

           TATTOO COUNTER: 59

           COMPUTER SCREEN: Mac, wearing a bucket hat, colorful 
           sunglasses, a buttoned up shirt, and boxers, makes his way 
           into a BUBBLE BATH.

           We pull out of the screen and see the laptop sitting on the 
           edge of the bath tub. Mac is live streaming on USTREAM.TV. 

           He lights up a cigarette and gets comfortable in the tub, but 
           just stares into the laptop, high out of his mind.

                                 MAC
                        What’s poppin’? Today’s the day. 
                        Haven’t done one of these in a 
                        while.

           Mac’s head bobs as he’s barely able to formulate words. He 
           gets close to the laptop to deliver his message.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Alright, it’s 5:30. I’m gonna 
                        announce--I hate these built up 
                        fucking announcements. So, 
                        anyways... The album, Watching 
                        Movies With The Sound Off. It’s 
                        coming--

           Mac’s phone RINGS from across the room. He stares at it.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Man, who the fuck’s calling me? 
                        Can’t they see I’m busy? 

           Mac lowers his sunglasses, revealing severely dilated pupils.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                             (putting the sunglasses 
                              back on)
                        Whoa, whoa, crazy--I don’t like 
                        that.

           Mac leans back against the tub wall. His phone RINGS again.
                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                             (unfazed)
                        There’s something stabbing me in 
                        the back right now.

           But Mac doesn’t adjust his seating.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Let me clear up a couple things 
                        here. There’s a lot--there’s been a 
                        lot of talk about me being on 
                        drugs. And that’s--I’m not--look at 
                        me. Do I look like someone who’s on 
                        drugs to you? If you look at me 
                        right now, do I look like someone 
                        who’s on drugs? No. No. No, I 
                        don’t. I don’t look like I’m on 
                        drugs. I look like a very wholesome 
                        individual right now.

           Mac leans forward again, right into the laptop camera.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        I’m not on drugs. Drugs are on me. 

           Mac freezes, staring into the camera.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        That was--that was the fucking 
                        quote. That was the quote.

           Mac’s phone RINGS again.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Ugh! I’m busy.

           INT. THUNDERCAT’S CAR - DAY

           Thundercat drives through LA. His phone rings. The caller ID 
           reads: Mac’s Mom.

                                 THUNDERCAT
                        What’s up, Karen?

           Although Mac’s mom, Karen is inaudible on the phone, it’s 
           clear something’s wrong.

                                 THUNDERCAT (CONT’D)
                        Okay, okay, don’t worry! I got 
                        this. Yup. Heading there now. I’ll 
                        call you.
           Thundercat hangs up and immediately dials Mac, but it goes 
           straight to voicemail.

                                 THUNDERCAT (CONT’D)
                        Mac, it’s Cat. You need to turn 
                        that fucking live stream off right 
                        now, bro. Your mom’s freaking out!

           Thundercat hangs up as he speeds down the street.

           INT. MAC'S LA MANSION - BATHROOM - DAY

           Mac, still leaning into frame, waits for the phone to stop 
           ringing.

                                 MAC
                        Okay. Before I was rudely 
                        interrupted--the album--did I say 
                        the album title? Whatever. The 
                        album title,
                             (slurring)
                        Watching Movies--Watching Movies 
                        With The Sound Off will be released 
                        on June 18th. There it is. June 
                        18th. Three days after the 15th. 
                        Two days prior to the 20th. You 
                        heard it first from the dude on 
                        drugs in the bathtub. 

           Thundercat busts through the bathroom door.

                                 THUNDERCAT
                        The fuck you doing, bro?!

           Thundercat throws the laptop in the water. 

           Mac’s so high he’s hardly startled.

                                 MAC
                        Oh, shit. The cat is in the 
                        building! Coulda just called, bro.

           Thundercat can’t believe his eyes.

                                 THUNDERCAT
                        Coulda just called?

           Thundercat grabs Mac’s phone from the countertop.

                                 THUNDERCAT (CONT’D)
                        I did call! And your mom called. 
                        And Q called too.
                                 MAC
                        Too many calls, man.

                                 THUNDERCAT
                        You look like a crackhead. Get your 
                        self changed.

           Mac just stares at him.

                                 THUNDERCAT (CONT’D)
                        Now!

           Mac throws his hands up in surrender.

                                 MAC
                        Alright, alright.

           Thundercat leaves the room before he completely snaps.

           Mac stands up in the tub, staring at the submerged laptop.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        You owe me a laptop!

           EXT. MAC'S LA MANSION - POOL - SUNSET

           Mac, now dry and in a new set of clothes, sits beside 
           Thundercat as they dangle their legs in the water, high above 
           Los Angeles.

           Mac sips from a coffee cup as he and Thundercat smoke cigs.

                                 THUNDERCAT
                        I gotta ask... Why the fuck do you 
                        have a pool in your front yard?

           Mac laughs. That wasn’t what he expected.

                                 MAC
                        It’s just something I said I’d have 
                        once. So, I had to have it.

                                 THUNDERCAT
                        How many times have you used it?

                                 MAC
                        All the time. Jimmy was just in 
                        here last night with--

                                 THUNDERCAT
                        No, how many times have you used 
                        it?
           Mac gets the point.

                                 THUNDERCAT (CONT’D)
                        You gotta jump in to swim, homie. 

                                 MAC
                        I’m swimming.

                                 THUNDERCAT
                        You’re drowning. And your dumbass 
                        is too stubborn to ask for help.

                                 MAC
                        I don’t need help.

                                 THUNDERCAT
                        You do. And it doesn’t have to be 
                        from me. You know what I do when 
                        I’m fucking up? I call my mom. 

                                 MAC
                        Well, I’m not calling mine. Not 
                        about this.

                                 THUNDERCAT
                        Why not?

                                 MAC
                        ‘Cause that makes it real.

                                 THUNDERCAT
                        Shit’s been real. Look, I don’t 
                        care who you call--me, Earl, Tyler, 
                        Rick Rubin, Jesus--they’re 
                        basically the same person--it don’t 
                        matter. Just make the fucking call.

                                 MAC
                        Alright.

                                 THUNDERCAT
                        Alright?

                                 MAC
                        Alright.

                                 THUNDERCAT
                        Damn right, alright. That was some 
                        Denzel shit right there. Some 
                        Training Day monologue shit.

                                 MAC
                        Pretty sure there’s no monologue 
                        like that in Training Day.
                                 THUNDERCAT
                        Shh. This is my moment.

           Thundercat turns to a fake audience and gives a speech.

                                 THUNDERCAT (CONT’D)
                        I’d like to thank the Academy.

           Mac pushes him as they share a laugh.

                                 MAC
                        You stupid, bro.

           Thundercat splashes Mac with water, driving him to run away.  

                                 THUNDERCAT
                        Oh, now he doesn’t wanna get wet?!

           But Mac comes running back towards the pool. He does a 
           cannonball and soaks Thundercat.

                                 THUNDERCAT (CONT’D)
                        You mother--

           Thundercat jumps in the water, chasing a laughing Mac.

           BEGIN MONTAGE

           INT. MAC'S LA MANSION - DAY

           Mac pulls countless bottles of liquor from his cabinets, 
           under his bed, in his closets, and sets them on his kitchen 
           table. 

           He dumps all of his liquor down the sink.

           Pills begin flying into his toilet, followed by bags of blow.

           Mac pauses before flushing them away.

           Mac goes into his studio with a trash bag in hand. He flips 
           on the lights, looks around, and shuts them off without 
           touching a thing.

           END MONTAGE

           INT. MAC'S LA MANSION - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Mac lounges on his couch, smoking a cig. The mound in his 
           ashtray makes it look like he’s already smoked two packs. 
           He laughs as he watches Bill Murray give his “It Just Doesn’t 
           Matter” speech in the film, Meatballs.

           Mac reaches for a blanket, trying to get comfortable, but 
           it’s too short for his body.

           He grabs a HOODIE laying on the arm rest of his couch and 
           throws it on, casually putting his hands in the front 
           pockets.

           As he continues watching, his facial expression changes. He 
           slowly pulls his hand from his pocket, revealing a bag of 
           COCAINE and some lint.

           It lingers in Mac’s hand, but eventually gets thrown on the 
           table as he goes back to lounging.

           Mac continues watching until his phone, sitting right next to 
           the bag, RINGS on the table.

           His mom, Karen is calling.

           He let’s the phone RING. And RING. And RING.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MAC'S LA MANSION - RECORDING STUDIO - LATER

           Mac, beyond fucked up, rips a huge line. He aggressively 
           lines up more as he blasts a beat. An open bottle of lean 
           sits next to the cocaine.

           He does another line and dances in his chair, manipulating 
           the beat with his keys.

           Mac reaches for his cup and drinks until there’s nothing 
           left. He rolls his chair over to his liquor cabinet, reaching 
           for an open, almost empty bottle of Jameson.

           Mac’s phone rings. It’s his mom, trying him again. He let’s 
           it ring.

           INT. MAC'S MOM'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Karen holds the phone to her ear as she gets Mac’s voicemail.

                                 MAC (V.O.)
                        You’ve reached Larry Fisherman. You 
                        know what to do.
                                 KAREN
                        Malcolm, it’s Mom. Thinking about 
                        you, sweetie. Wanted to see how 
                        everything’s been working out with 
                        Warner Bros. Alright. Love you, 
                        baby. Call me back.

           INT. MAC'S LA MANSION - RECORDING STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

           Mac pours the rest of the Jameson in his cup and stands to 
           grab another bottle. But he’s too messed up. He gets the 
           spins and falls back into his chair.

           He attempts to get up once more, but falls again, this time 
           missing his chair. Mac hits his head on the ground, causing 
           his eyebrow to split open.

           As his face bleeds and he tries his best to come to, his eyes 
           become transfixed on a wall-mounted TV playing, Turtle: The 
           Incredible Journey (Mac has said this movie plays perfectly 
           with his album, Watching Movies with the Sound Off).

           On screen, two small turtles run for their life, attempting 
           to escape a giant crab.

           Mac grabs his phone from the table and dials a number.

           As the phone rings, Mac stares at the TV and we fade out as 
           one turtle escapes into the ocean, while the other gets 
           eaten.

                                 RICK RUBIN (PRE-LAP)
                        Tell me everything.

           EXT. MALIBU BEACH - DAY

           A turtle runs across the glowing sand as Mac and a Jesus-like 
           figure stroll down the beach.

           They walk in silence until it’s revealed it’s not Jesus. It’s 
           RICK RUBIN (51), who as Thundercat said, is basically Jesus.

                                 MAC
                        Everything?

                                 RICK
                        Everything.

                                 MAC
                        I don’t even know where to begin.
                                 RICK
                        How about the beginning?

           Mac smiles.

           EXT. RICK RUBIN’S MALIBU HOME - SUNSET

           Mac and Rick sit on the deck of Rick’s beautiful, 
           minimalistic home. Rick, not wearing shoes, casually sits in 
           his chair as Mac takes a sip of TEA.

                                 MAC
                        This tea shit’s pretty good.

                                 RICK
                        I’m glad you like it.

                                 MAC
                        What do you call this flavor?

                                 RICK
                        Black.
                             (beat)
                        So, what happens next?

                                 MAC
                        You tell me.

           Rick laughs.

                                 RICK
                        If only it worked that way. Why’d 
                        you call me?

                                 MAC
                        Because you’re Rick fucking Rubin.

                                 RICK
                        I should have legally changed my 
                        name to that. But you didn’t answer 
                        the question... Why me?

                                 MAC
                        I don’t know. I guess because we 
                        were both thrown into the music 
                        industry at a young age. Didn’t you 
                        start Def Jam at like 18? I think 
                        you figured it out.

                                 RICK
                        I don’t know if I figured it out.
                                 MAC
                        Compared to me? You have.

                                 RICK
                        I hope so. I’m 51.

                                 MAC
                        Damn, the beard makes you look 
                        older.

                                 RICK
                        Thanks.

                                 MAC
                        I just need balance, man. All I do--
                        all I know, is music.
                             (beat)
                        And I fucking hate being sober.

                                 RICK
                        I know what it’s like being 
                        obsessed with work. It works. But 
                        there’s a lot more to life than 
                        work. “Life is a balance of holding 
                        on and letting go.” Rumi.

                                 MAC
                        I like that.

           Rick gets up.

                                 RICK
                        Alright, get some rest. We’ll 
                        continue tomorrow.

                                 MAC
                        You’re going to bed? It’s like 
                        8:30.

                                 RICK
                        This planet has a certain gravity. 
                        It rises in the morning, it sets at 
                        night.

                                 MAC
                        Who said that--Rumi?

                                 RICK
                        I just did.

           Ricks heads inside, leaving Mac with his thoughts.
           INT. RICK RUBIN'S MALIBU HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Mac lies in bed, staring at the ceiling, unable to sleep.

           INT. RICK RUBIN'S MALIBU HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Mac fills up a glass of water and begins exploring the house.

           INT. RICK RUBIN'S MALIBU HOME - EXERCISE ROOM - NIGHT

           Mac flips on the lights to find a room with GYMNASTIC RINGS 
           hanging from the ceiling. He hangs, stretching his body. 

           INT. RICK RUBIN'S MALIBU HOME - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Mac walks down the hallway, scanning the bare walls. He 
           reaches a door at the end of the hall and opens it.

           INT. RICK RUBIN'S MALIBU HOME - WINE CELLAR - NIGHT

           Hundreds of bottles of wine surround Mac. He grabs one, 
           contemplating if he should drink it.

           Several excruciating seconds pass. Mac puts the bottle down 
           and exits the cellar.

           EXT. MALIBU BEACH - NIGHT

           Mac stands with his bare feet in the water, smoking the end 
           of a cig. He closes his eyes, takes a long drag, and opens 
           them upon his exhale.

           He tosses his cig butt in the sand and walks off.

           After a beat, he re-enters frame, grabs the cig, and exits.

           INT. RICK RUBIN'S MALIBU HOME - HOT/COLD ROOM - DAY

           Rick relaxes in a large ICE BATH that’s been plunked down 
           next to a barrel-shaped SAUNA. Floor to ceiling windows fill 
           the room with natural light.

           Mac dips a leg in as he enters the tub.

                                 MAC
                        Holy fuck! How are you just 
                        chilling in there?

                        It’s only cold if you allow it to 
                        be cold.

                                 MAC
                        No. It’s fucking cold.

           But Mac doesn’t get a reaction from Rick. 

           He submerges the rest of his body in the ice.

                                 RICK
                        There you go. Feel the warmth.

                                 MAC
                        I’m pretty sure my dick just 
                        shriveled into itself.

                                 RICK
                        We call that turtling.

           Mac laughs.

                                 RICK (CONT’D)
                        There’s no balance without 
                        experiencing the extremes. 
                        Transitioning from intense cold to 
                        intense heat increases your heart 
                        rate and constricts blood vessels. 
                        It induces a rush of adrenaline and 
                        endorphins.

                                 MAC
                        Kinda like drugs.

                                 RICK
                        Kinda like drugs.

           INT. RICK RUBIN'S MALIBU HOME - SAUNA - DAY

           Mac, with his hands in his face, sweats with Rick.

                                 RICK
                        You’re heavier than people think.

           Mac looks up at Rick.

                                 MAC
                        I know I’ve put a few on, Rick, but 
                        I’m still sexy.
                                 RICK
                        You know what I mean.

           Mac doesn’t respond.

                                 RICK (CONT’D)
                        How many projects have you put out?

                                 MAC
                        With mixtapes, maybe like 8.

                                 RICK
                        Wow.

                                 MAC
                        Yeah. Like, let me think... We can 
                        go through this. Jukebox, High

                                 RICK
                        Sure.

                                 MAC
                        Okay, let’s count ‘em.

                                 RICK
                        Yeah, it’s a project.

                                 MAC

                        had those little, like random 
                        offshoot EP’s. There was Larry 
                        Lovestein, Delusional Thomas--
                        that’s 9. Then, Faces, 10. Yeah.

                                 RICK
                        That’s a lot. How old are you 
                        again?

                                 MAC

                                 RICK
                        Just so I understand, why do you 
                        make so much?

                                 MAC
                        Because I want to be the best.

                                 RICK
                        The best?
                                 MAC
                        I want to be the best of all time.

           Rick takes this in.

                                 RICK
                        Sounds like you’re chasing 
                        something you’ll never catch.

           Mac wonders if that was an insult.

                                 RICK (CONT’D)
                        There is no best of all time. 
                        There’s only the best you. And 
                        maybe the best you is the best of 
                        all time. But you can’t control 
                        that. You can only control your 
                        choices. Not their outcomes.

                                 MAC
                        Rick. Fucking. Rubin.

                                 RICK
                        You put a lot of pressure on 
                        yourself. And that’s okay. 

                                 MAC
                        It is?

                                 RICK
                        Sure. The pressure fuels you 
                        creatively. But I bet it also sends 
                        you looking for an escape.

                                 MAC

                                 RICK
                        Balance will minimize your need to 
                        escape. It’ll quiet your mind.

           Mac laughs. That’s ridiculous.

                                 MAC
                        My mind’s never gonna be quiet.

                                 RICK
                        Maybe. But that’s okay. Hopefully 
                        your time here will show you that 
                        you can allow the thoughts to pass, 
                        instead of feeling like you need to 
                        numb them. Speaking of numb. Ice 
                        bath time!
           Rick exits the sauna.

                                 MAC
                        Aw, come on! Thought we were done 
                        with that!

           Mac shakes his head. Before getting up, he takes a moment to 
           process this new knowledge.

           EXT. RICK RUBIN'S MALIBU HOME - GARDEN - DAY

           Rick and Mac sit on pillows across from one another. Mac 
           struggles to sit with his legs crossed.

                                 RICK
                        Deep breaths. In. Out...

           Mac begins breathing in and out with Rick.

                                 RICK (CONT’D)
                        In. Out...

                                 RICK (CONT’D)
                        Now, on this next exhale, I want 
                        you to close your eyes, but 
                        continue your deep breathing. In. 
                        Out...

           Mac and Rick close their eyes.

                                 RICK (CONT’D)
                        I want you to only concentrate on 
                        your breaths. In. Out... All that 
                        should be on your mind are the 
                        breaths.

                                 MAC
                        I’m thinking about sandwiches.

                                 RICK
                        That’s fine. Note that you’re 
                        thinking about sandwiches and let 
                        the thought pass. Back to your 
                        breaths. In. Out...

           Mac opens his eyes.

                                 MAC
                        Fuck, I can’t stop thinking about 
                        sandwiches.
                                 RICK
                        You think this is hard? Wait until 
                        you see what we’re doing next.

           EXT. RICK RUBIN'S MALIBU HOME - CHICKEN COOP - DAY

           Rick cheers Mac on as he chases CHICKENS. Every time Mac gets 
           close to catching one, they escape his grip.

                                 MAC
                        What is this, some Karate Kid shit?

                                 RICK
                        Nope. I just thought it would be 
                        funny.

           Mac stops dead in his tracks.

                                 RICK (CONT’D)
                        What? I wasn’t wrong.

           INT. RICK RUBIN'S MALIBU HOME - MUSIC ROOM - DAY

           Mac and Rick enter a room full of instruments.

                                 MAC
                        Now, this is what I’m talking 
                        about.

           His eyes land on a beautiful GUITAR. 

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                             (picking up the guitar)
                        Holy shit. This looks like the 
                        guitar Lennon used. 

                                 RICK
                        It is.

                                 MAC
                        Knew it.

                                 RICK
                        No. That’s the actual guitar.

           Mac is in awe. He slowly puts it down, making sure he doesn’t 
           damage the instrument.

                                 RICK (CONT’D)
                        Play it.
                                 MAC
                        You sure?

                                 RICK
                        That’s what this room’s for. 
                        Playing. It’s why I don’t have any 
                        recording equipment.

           Mac studies the room again, realizing there is no recording 
           equipment.

                                 MAC
                        I don’t remember the last time I 
                        played without recording.

           He sits, gets comfortable, and begins to play.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                             (to the tune of Creed’s 
                              song, “Higher”)
                        Can you take me higher?

           Rick and Mac share a laugh at his ridiculousness.

                                 RICK
                        Alright, alright. Why don’t you try 
                        playing some of your frustration?

                                 MAC
                        You don’t like Creed?

                                 RICK
                        They’re my guilty pleasure. But 
                        they’re not you. I’ll give you the 
                        room.

           Rick walks out, leaving Mac completely alone. He looks a bit 
           uncomfortable, not sure where to go from here.

           He sets the guitar down and heads for the PIANO.

           Mac sits and begins fiddling with the keys.

           He begins to play. As he gets more and more into it, he 
           closes his eyes.

           What comes out is an emotional, raw version of the piano riff 
           from his song, “2009.”

           BEGIN MONTAGE

           The riff continues as we examine Mac’s journey over the next 
           few days.
           EXT. RICK RUBIN'S MALIBU HOME - GARDEN - DAY

           Mac sits still, deep in meditation. The wind blows strong, 
           but he is unfazed. 

           EXT. MALIBU BEACH - DAY

           Mac jogs on the beach.

           INT. RICK RUBIN'S MALIBU HOME - BEDROOM - SUNSET

           As the sun sets out the window, Mac shuts off his light and 
           lays in bed. This time, he falls asleep.

           INT. RICK RUBIN'S MALIBU HOME - KITCHEN - SUNRISE

           Rick groggily enters the kitchen to find Mac already awake, 
           pouring him a cup of black tea.

           INT. RICK RUBIN'S MALIBU HOME - HOT/COLD ROOM - DAY

           Mac settles into the ice bath. It’s not so bad this time.

           END MONTAGE

           INT. RICK RUBIN'S MALIBU HOME - MUSIC ROOM - DAY

           Mac, in a different outfit, sits in the same spot at the 
           piano, still playing “2009.” He’s got a vibrant glow to him.

                                 RICK (O.S.)
                        It’s beautiful.

           Mac stops and turns to Rick, who has been watching him play 
           from the doorway.

                                 RICK (CONT’D)
                        What is it?

                                 MAC
                        I have no fucking idea.

                                 RICK
                        That’s my boy.
           EXT. RICK RUBIN'S MALIBU HOME - FRONT DOOR - DAY

           Mac walks out BAREFOOT, holding a packed bag. He waves to Q, 
           Jimmy and TreeJay, all waiting at the end of the driveway in 
           Mac’s G-Wagon.

           Rick steps outside.

                                 RICK
                        Come here, kid. I’m proud of you.

           Mac and Rick share a long hug.

                                 MAC
                        Thanks for everything, man. You 
                        saved my life.

           They finally pull apart from each other.

                                 RICK
                        I didn’t do anything. It was all 
                        you.

                                 MAC
                        Most people go to rehab, I went to 
                        Rick Rubin’s.

                                 RICK
                        Rick. Fucking. Rubin’s.

           Mac laughs, tips his cap, and walks off. 

                                 RICK (CONT’D)
                        And Mac. If you ever feel like you 
                        need a drink, you call me.

           Mac nods.

                                 RICK (CONT’D)
                        I’ll have one with you.

           Mac smiles and continues down the driveway.

           Rick watches as his friends shower him with love.

                                 Q
                        Bro, you been gone three weeks. How 
                        the fuck do you look this much 
                        better?

                                 JIMMY
                        And where the fuck are your shoes?

           We fade out of Rick’s POV as the guys drive off.
           INT. THE FONDA - STAGE - NIGHT

           All eyes are on Thundercat as he rips a solo on his bass.

           Mac, sporting a baggy shirt and a calmer, more collected 
           demeanor, begins dancing around him.

           TATTOO COUNTER: 64

           The two are performing Mac’s song, “My Favorite Part.”

           The funky stage lighting shines bright on Mac goofily 
           circulating the stage. He turns to address the CROWD as 
           Thundercat finishes and the BAND resumes playing.

                                 MAC
                        Woo! Thundercat, ladies and 
                        gentleman. 

           The crowd cheers for Thundercat.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        And it’s his daughter’s birthday 
                        tonight--so happy birthday, Sanaa!

           SANAA (7), out in the crowd, smiles as her MOM (33) puts her 
           arm around her. 

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        I hope I grow up to be as cool as 
                        you one day! Alright, here comes my 
                        favorite part!

           The band picks up playing in full force as a more mature 
           Ariana Grande struts on stage, heading straight for Mac.

           The two dance, face to face, rarely taking their eyes off one 
           another as Ariana begins singing.

                                 ARIANA
                        If you wanna stay, we're taking it 
                        slow baby
                        Cause you and me, and I got enough 
                        on my mind
                        But I can make some time for 
                        something so divine--

           Ariana laughs as Mac is absolutely cheesing, repeatedly 
           trying to crack her up by making funny faces. 

           The two begin singing together.
                                 MAC/ARIANA
                        Said, you just don't know how 
                        beautiful you are
                        And baby that's my favorite part
                        You walk around so clueless to it 
                        all
                        Like nobody gonna break your heart
                        It'll be alright babe, see, me, I 
                        got you covered
                        I'm gon' be your lover, you might 
                        be the one
                        If it's only tonight, ayy, we don't 
                        need to worry
                        We ain't in a hurry, rushin' into 
                        love

           Keeping up the fun, the two starting ad-libbing together.

                                 MAC
                        Uh huh. Well, okay.

                                 ARIANA
                        Okay.

                                 MAC
                        Well, alright.

                                 ARIANA
                        Alright.

                                 MAC
                        Well, alright. Well, okay.

           Ariana raises her hand, playfully telling him to stop.

                                 ARIANA
                        Cease.

           Mac, pretending to be offended, runs away from her before 
           coming back immediately to continue their duet.

                                 MAC/ARIANA
                        It'll be alright babe, see, me, I 
                        got you covered
                        I'm gon' be your lover, you might 
                        be the one
                        If it's only tonight, ayy, we don't 
                        need to worry
                        We ain't in a hurry, rushin' into 
                        love

           As the song ends and the band stops playing, Mac and Ariana 
           have a fun, quick dance off before Ariana extends her hand 
           for a hand shake.
           Very business-like, Mac stops and rigidly extends his hand. 
           The two shake.

                                 MAC
                        Good. Good job.

                                 ARIANA
                        See ya.

                                 MAC
                        See ya.

           Ariana walks off stage, never taking his eyes off her.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Pleasure working with you. Good 
                        stuff.

                                 ARIANA (O.S.)
                        I’ll be in touch.

                                 MAC
                        For sure.

           EXT. THE FONDA - BACK ALLEY - NIGHT

           The band and their friends stand around bullshitting. Off to 
           the side, Mac, Jimmy, Q, and TreeJay chat with Thundercat, 
           Sanaa, and her mother.

                                 MAC
                        What’d you think of your dad 
                        tonight?

                                 SANAA
                        He was okay.

           The guys crack up as Thundercat defends himself.

                                 THUNDERCAT
                        That’s not what you said a minute 
                        ago! Come on. What’d you say?

           A sleepy Sanaa thinks for a second and yawns.

                                 SANAA
                        That you were shredding?

                                 THUNDERCAT
                        Shredding! And on that note, we’re 
                        out.
                                 MAC
                        Hold up, Costanza. Your boy needs a 
                        sec with the birthday girl.

           As Mac leans down to be face to face with Sanaa, Ariana walks 
           outside, watching their interaction.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                             (whispering)
                        In case your dad didn’t get you 
                        everything you wanted...

           Mac slides her a one hundred dollar bill.

                                 SANAA
                        Thanks, Uncle Mac.

                                 MAC
                        Happy birthday.

           Sanaa gives him a big hug before leaving with her parents.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Night guys!

                                 JIMMY
                        You didn’t give me a hundred on my 
                        birthday.

                                 TREEJAY
                        He employs your dumb ass.

           Ariana approaches. The guys awkwardly walk away to give Mac 
           some space.

                                 ARIANA
                        Big spender, huh?

                                 MAC
                        Hip hop’s Robin Hood.

           Ariana gives him a smile.

                                 ARIANA
                        Tonight was fun.

                                 MAC
                        I think the handshake was the 
                        highlight of the show. Nice, firm 
                        grip.

                                 ARIANA
                        So firm.
                                 MAC
                        The firmest.

                                 ARIANA’S FRIEND
                        Ariana, let’s go!

           Ariana looks to her friend and turns back to Mac.

                                 ARIANA
                        Our friend is throwing a party. 
                        What are you doing?

                                 MAC
                        Probably pick up some food and go 
                        home. I’m an old ass man.

                                 ARIANA
                        What are you gonna get?

                                 MAC
                        Tacos.

                                 ARIANA
                        I like tacos.

           Oh shit! Off Mac cheesing once again.

           INT. MAC’S GWAGON - NIGHT

           Mac and Ariana pull up in front of LEO’S TACOS TRUCK. Mac 
           parks and reaches into the back seat, pulling out an AFRO WIG 
           and ridiculous SUNGLASSES.

                                 ARIANA
                        What are you doing?

           Mac puts on his costume.

                                 MAC
                        I gotta hit the streets as Larry 
                        Lovestein, otherwise I get flooded 
                        with paparazzi. Not sure if you 
                        know what that’s like.

           Ariana laughs as he starts digging in the back once again.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        But just in case.

           He pops up with a pair of GROUCHO GLASSES.
           EXT. LEO’S TACOS TRUCK - NIGHT

           Mac and Ariana, in costume, step up to the window, ordering 
           with vaguely recognizable accents.

                                 MAC
                        Hi. I’ll take 3 al pastor tacos, 3 
                        carnitas, 3 asada--guac on those, 3 
                        pollo, and 3 chorizo--you know 
                        what? Make it 6 al pastor.

           The CASHIER (47), who happens to look like the real life 
           version of Ariana’s costume, wipes his mustache as he punches 
           numbers in a CALCULATOR. 

                                 CASHIER
                        That’ll be--

                                 MAC
                        Oh no, the lady still needs to 
                        order.

                                 ARIANA
                        You sure that’s all you want?

                                 MAC
                             (to Cashier)
                        Always with the jokes, this one.

           Cashier just nods.

                                 ARIANA
                        I like your mustache. 

           Cashier just blinks.

                                 ARIANA (CONT’D)
                        I’ll take half of a half dozen al 
                        pastor tacos and a large horchata. 

                                 CASHIER
                        Anyone else?

           Mac slides the cashier a fifty dollar bill.

                                 MAC
                        Keep the change Sonny Jim.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. LEO’S TACOS TRUCK - LATER

           Cashier sticks his head out the window, calling a number.
                                 CASHIER
                        92! Number 92!

           Ariana and Mac approach, grabbing the food and walking off.

                                 MAC
                        Thank you, kind sir.

                                 CASHIER
                        Wait! Ms. Grande, would you mind 
                        signing my hat?

           Mac and Ariana turn back.

           Cashier takes off his GREASY LEO’S TACOS HAT.

                                 CASHIER (CONT’D)
                        I’m a huge fan.

           Ariana gives Mac a playful look. He just shakes his head.

           EXT. ARIANA’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Mac pulls up Ariana’s driveway in awe. If his house is a 
           mansion, her’s is an estate.

           He goofily jumps out of the car with the bag of food and runs 
           to the other side before Ariana can get out. Mac collects 
           himself and opens the door for her.

                                 MAC
                        My lady.

           He grabs her hand, escorting her out of the car. 

                                 ARIANA
                        Kind sir.

           They walk up to the door, Mac examining the house.

                                 MAC
                        So, this is what having a Mac 
                        Miller feature will get you?

                                 ARIANA
                        Please. Nickelodeon paid for this.

           Ariana opens the door and they head inside.
           EXT. ARIANA'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT

           Mac and Ariana eat next to a FIRE PIT overlooking her pool 
           and the LA skyline. Ariana works on her first taco while Mac 
           finishes his last.

                                 ARIANA
                        You want a drink or anything?

                                 MAC
                        I don’t drink.

                                 ARIANA
                        I meant like--water.

                                 MAC
                        No water either.

                                 ARIANA
                        How long’s that been going?

           Mac pulls out his phone and opens up an app. He scrolls.

                                 MAC
                        132 days.

                                 ARIANA
                        No water for 132 days? That’s 
                        impressive.

                                 MAC
                        I’m better without it. Trust me. It 
                        gets me all bloated. Like Gucci 
                        Mane.   

           Mac lights up a cig, inhaling deeply.

                                 ARIANA
                        But you’re still smoking?

                                 MAC
                        I’ll put it out if you ask.

           Ariana just smiles at him.

           Mac puts it out.

           INT. ARIANA'S HOUSE - STUDIO - NIGHT

           Ariana leads Mac into her studio full of instruments.

                                 ARIANA
                        And this is my sanctuary.
                                 MAC
                        Damn, I didn’t know you played so 
                        many instruments.

                                 ARIANA
                        Can I tell you a secret?

                                 MAC
                        Anything.

                                 ARIANA
                        I don’t. Well, a little piano by 
                        ear.

           Mac takes a seat at a beautiful PIANO, sliding over to make 
           room for Ariana.

                                 MAC
                        Prove it.

           She joins him, sitting closer than she needs to.

           Mac slowly brings his fingers to the keys. He stares at her 
           and begins playing the beginning of his song, “2009.”

           Ariana joins in and Mac begins to sing.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        I hop on the keys and I’m sweet 
                        like Franken Berry
                        And this room is way cleaner than 
                        my sanctuary
                        And your house is colossal, kinda 
                        like Napoleon
                        She said “it’s not cuz of Mac,” 
                        Thanks Nickelodeon.

           Ariana laughs but quickly collects herself. She looks 
           longingly at Mac.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        She keeps looking at me, maybe I 
                        should take the hint
                        But I’m nervous cuz my breath 
                        doesn’t smell like cool mint
                        But if I’d just stop singing, 
                        that’d probably be a great start.

           Ariana smiles and nods her head “yes.”

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Being next to you girl, “baby 
                        that’s my favorite part.”
           Mac stops playing. He scooches closer to Ariana.

           They stare at each other until they finally kiss.

           INT. ARIANA'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Mac and Ariana lay atop messy sheets. Mac, shirtless, stares 
           at the ceiling smiling.

           He looks over to Ariana, makes sure she’s asleep, and sneaks 
           out of bed, heading for his jeans. He digs for something 
           before creeping out to the bedroom balcony.

           EXT. ARIANA'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - BALCONY - NIGHT

           Mac steps outside and pulls out the pack of cigarettes he 
           fished from his jeans. He lights up as he stares off towards 
           the lit up sky.

           He smiles.

           EXT. PNC PARK - DAY

           TATTOO COUNTER: 71

           The seats are packed at PNC Park as the crowd gets ready for 
           the Pirates to take the field against the Cubs.

           Several PLAYERS finish warming up, while Mac, TreeJay, Q, 
           Jimmy, and even Reggie, goof around in front of the dugout.

           Mac glances around the stadium at all the fans on their feet. 
           His eyes lock in on a group of friends SLAMMING BEERS.

           Mac’s song “100 Grandkids” begins playing throughout the 
           stadium and Mac runs out towards the mound.

                                 ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        Ladies and gentleman, here with an 
                        honorary pitch... Would you please 
                        welcome Pittsburgh native, Mac 
                        Miller!

           Mac’s buddies pull out their phones to record his throw as 
           Mac takes the mound.

                                 JIMMY (O.S.)
                        Don’t blow it!

           Mac laughs as he stretches and stares down the catcher. 
           Jimmy, who’s behind the catcher, pretends to jerk off. 
           Mac’s throw is catchable, but high.

                                 ANNOUNCER
                             (laughing)
                        Thank you, Mac!

           Mac fist pumps in victory, ignoring the announcer’s laughter. 
           He runs to shake the catcher’s hand. They pose for a quick 
           picture.

           INT. PNC PARK - SKYBOX - DAY

           It’s the bottom of the 3rd. The guys sit in a fancy skybox 
           full of food and booze. Everyone’s eyes are on the game, 
           while Mac stares at the mini bar, lost in thought.

                                 Q
                        Oh, shit!

           Mac snaps his eyes back to the field.

           Reggie points to the JUMBOTRON. Their entire skybox is in 
           frame! They cheer even louder.

                                 TREEJAY
                             (re: jumbotron)
                        Yo Reggie, you think you could make 
                        it outta here with that TV?

           Everybody laughs.

                                 REGGIE
                        Fuck you guys! I’m still waiting on 
                        my royalties from K.I.D.S.

                                 JIMMY
                        Everyone got paid while you were 
                        away. 

                                 REGGIE
                        You’re acting like I was in prison. 
                        It was college.

                                 JIMMY
                        Same shit!

           Mac’s phone rings. He gets up to take the call in the back of 
           the skybox, while his friends continue to rag on each other.

                                 MAC
                             (answering)
                        What’s up, girl?
           INT. TOUR BUS - DAY

           Ariana watches the Pirates game from her tour bus.

                                 ARIANA
                        Thought you were gonna throw a 
                        strike.

           INTERCUT BETWEEN MAC AND ARIANA ON THE PHONE

                                 MAC
                        Looked like a strike to me. You 
                        might just have a tight zone.

                                 JIMMY (O.S.)
                        Yeah she does!

           Mac looks to Jimmy and just shakes his head.

                                 ARIANA
                        What’d you say?

                                 MAC
                        How was the show?

                                 ARIANA
                        It was great. Wish you were here. 

                                 MAC
                        Me too.

                                 ARIANA
                        You excited for tonight?

           The CROWD ERUPTS and the guys begin jumping up and down, 
           commanding Mac’s attention!

                                 TREEJAY
                        Get down! Get down!

                                 JIMMY
                        Fuck yeah! Safe!

                                 MAC
                        Sorry, what’d you say?

                                 ARIANA
                        Does it feel good to be home?

           Mac watches Jimmy pour shots for the guys as they celebrate.

                                 MAC
                        It’s exactly what I needed.
                                 ARIANA
                        I always get so nervous when I 
                        perform at home.

           The crowd cheers even louder as Jimmy and the guys scream.

                                 JIMMY
                        Get the fuck out! Fuck you, get 
                        out!

                                 REGGIE
                        See ya!

           Mac doesn’t seem to care about the home run. Instead, he’s 
           focused on the guys cheering and pounding their drinks.

                                 MAC
                        Baby, I love you, but I gotta go.

                                 ARIANA
                        No worries! Call me later, I feel 
                        like we haven’t spoken in weeks.

                                 MAC
                        We’re speaking right now!

           Ariana lets out a reluctant laugh.

                                 ARIANA
                        You’re right. Okay. Call me before 
                        your show.

                                 MAC
                        I will. Love you!

                                 ARIANA
                        I love you--

           But Mac has already hung up.

                                 ARIANA (CONT’D)
                        Too.

           Ariana puts the phone down and stares at the TV.

           INT. STAGE AE - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

           Mac, Jimmy, and the rest of the guys are scattered throughout 
           the room talking to different groups of GIRLS. Mac chain 
           smokes cigs as he watches everyone, except him, pass around 
           bottles of alcohol.

           One specific group of girls won’t leave Mac alone.
                                 GIRL #1
                        So that’s when you knew you wanted 
                        to be a rapper?

                                 MAC
                        Yup.

                                 GIRL #2
                        That’s so cool. 

                                 MAC
                        Definitely.

           Jimmy runs up and puts his arm around Mac.

                                 JIMMY
                        Excuse me, ladies. But I gotta 
                        borrow this man. 

           Jimmy pulls Mac to the side.

                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        Yo, I got like 3 more people--not 
                        people, girls--trying to get back 
                        here. That’s straight, yeah?

                                 MAC
                        Yeah. Q’s got the bands.

                                 JIMMY
                        That’s right!

           Jimmy runs off, but not before noticing Mac is a little down.

                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        You good?

                                 MAC
                        For sure.

           Jimmy’s too drunk to pry. He runs off to find Q.

                                 JIMMY
                        Hometown hero, baby!

           Mac is left alone in the corner of the room, standing next to 
           a table of alcohol. He eyes one specific bottle of JAMESON.

           He looks up and sees the group of girls he was talking to 
           heading his way.

           Without thinking, he grabs the bottle of Jameson and slips 
           out the back door, but not before Reggie takes notice from 
           across the room.
           EXT. STAGE AE - PRIVATE PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Mac puts the bottle of whiskey on the ground and stares at 
           it. He’s completely alone, while a cheering crowd can be 
           heard from the other side of the stage.

           He takes out his phone and makes a desperate call. It rings. 
           And rings. And rings.

           INT. RICK RUBIN'S MALIBU HOME - BACKYARD - DUSK

           A ringing cell phone sits on a table.  

           Finally, Rick Rubin walks up and answers.

                                 RICK
                        Mac, how are you?

           INTERCUT BETWEEN MAC AND RICK.

                                 MAC
                        I’m good, Rick. Real good. Back 
                        home for a show right now.

                                 RICK
                        Nice. When’s the show?

                                 MAC
                        ‘Bout 30 minutes.

                                 RICK
                        You looking for a pep talk? 

           Mac laughs.

                                 MAC
                        Something like that. I’m thinking 
                        about having a drink.

           Rick takes a seat in his backyard, watching the sunset.

                                 RICK
                        Oh yeah? Why’s that?

                                 MAC
                        Shit, I’m home. Things are good.

                                 RICK
                        Makes sense. I’d want a drink too. 
                        How long’s it been?

                                 MAC
                        9 months.
                                 RICK
                        Wow. Impressive. You wanted to go 
                        at least a year though, yeah?

                                 MAC
                        Yeah. But I feel great. I’m in 
                        control finally.

                                 RICK
                        You sure about this?

                                 MAC
                        I think so--yeah.

                                 RICK
                        Alright. I’ll have one with you.

           Rick heads inside his house towards the liquor cabinet.

                                 RICK (CONT’D)
                        What’s on the menu? Jameson?

                                 MAC
                        You know me so well.

                                 RICK
                        Alright, let me grab a glass.

           Rick grabs whiskey and a glass, before heading back outside.

                                 MAC
                        What are we drinking to?

           Mac picks up his bottle. No glass needed.

                                 RICK
                        9 months.

                                 MAC
                        To 9 months.

           Rick takes a sip, while Mac’s is more of a chug.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Damn. Tastes the same.

                                 RICK
                        Always does. Be careful tonight and 
                        call me if you need me. I’m here 
                        for you.

                                 MAC
                        You’re the man, Rick. Thank you.
                                 RICK
                        Goodnight Mac.

           Rick hangs up and takes another sip of whiskey as he watches 
           the California sun disappear.

           EXT. STAGE AE - PRIVATE PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Mac puts his phone away and heads for the door. But he 
           pauses.

           He takes a long chug, finishing off what’s left of the 
           whiskey. 

           He tosses it in the dumpster just as Reggie walks outside.

                                 REGGIE
                        You drinking again?

                                 MAC
                        Boys are in town. Felt right.

           Mac puts his arm around Reggie.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        The prodigal son has returned. We 
                        missed you, bro.

                                 REGGIE
                        For fuck’s sake! I was only at 
                        college!

           Mac laughs as the two walk back inside.

           INT. TRAILER - NIGHT

           Ariana sits in her trailer in full makeup and costume. A live 
           audience cheers outside as an opening act performs. 

           She stares at her phone. But it doesn’t ring.

           The audience gets louder as tears well in her eyes.

                                 ANDERSON PAAK (PRE-LAP)
                        Can't keep losing you
                        Can't keep losing you

           EXT. STAGE AE - NIGHT

           All eyes are on Mac as he floats around the stage with 
           ANDERSON PAAK (30), finishing up their song, “Dang!”
           The band stops playing and Mac and Paak yell out in unison!

                        MAC MILLER
                                                      ANDERSON PAAK
           I can’t keep on losing you!
                                              I can’t keep on losing you!

           Paak gives Mac a hug, waves to the crowd, and exits the 
           stage.

                                 MAC
                        Anderson motherfucking Paak, ladies 
                        and gentleman!

           Mac waits for the crowd to die down as he sways across the 
           stage. He slightly slurs as he raises the mic to his mouth. 

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Aight. This next one is extra, 
                        extra special for me. It’s one of 
                        my favorite songs I ever wrote 
                        because it reminds me of being a 
                        kid. You know what? I’m still a 
                        fucking kid!

           The crowd cheers!

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Damn right! We’re all fucking kids! 
                        I wrote this back even before I 
                        released K.I.D.S! Shit, back when 
                        we were rummaging purses for studio 
                        time.  

           Off to the side, Jimmy, TreeJay and Reggie all start laughing 
           and playfully shoving each other. Q shakes his head.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        I wrote it right here in the 
                        ‘Burgh. At Blue Slide Park.

           The crowd cheers again. Visuals of Frick Park appear behind 
           Mac, setting the scene for his hometown fans.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Being back here reminds me of that 
                        time. You know? Kinda feels like, 
                        the best day ever!

           Mac grabs a guitar and begins playing a new rendition of his 
           song, “Best Day Ever.” 

           Visuals of Mac and his friends as kids in the park fill the 
           screen.
                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        I never take a day off
                        Work around the clock, my engineer 
                        gettin' paid off
                        Rock like Aesop, light the weed and 
                        take off
                        So high I cannot see, 

           Mac turns his mic to the crowd as they scream the next lyric.

                                 CROWD
                        Adolf!

                                 MAC
                        Now I got these rappers all 
                        breakin' up a sweat
                        'Cause every time I get up on the 
                        mic, it come correct
                        And I learned it from the best, 
                        always dressed in somethin' fresh
                        Lookin' for a little dime, big butt 
                        and nice chest. Yes... 

           Mac waves for Jimmy, TreeJay, Reggie, and Q to join him.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Woah, I ain't just an Average Joe, 
                        way above the average flow
                        Boy, my life is Most Dope, uh

           The guys huddle around Mac, singing the chorus together. The 
           entire crowd belts out the lyrics with them.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        No matter where life takes me, find 
                        me with a smile
                        Pursuit to be happy, only laughing 
                        like a child
                        I never thought life would be this 
                        sweet
                        It got me cheesing from cheek to 
                        cheek, aye, aye

           Mac points his mic to the crowd one more time.

                                 CROWD
                        And I ain't gonna wait for nothing
                        'Cause that just ain't my style

                                 MAC
                        Life couldn't get better
                        This 'gon be the best day ever!
           EXT. MAC’S NEW LA HOME - DAY

           The sun shines upon a well manicured, modest Studio City 
           suburban home nestled at the end of a cul-de-sac.

           INT. MAC’S NEW LA HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           The inside is a mess. The coffee table in the living room is 
           covered with cups, bongs, panties, and blow.

           Jimmy lays passed out on the couch. Two beautiful topless 
           MODELS (21) sleep on each side of him.

           DOORBELL RINGS! Nobody wakes up. It rings again. And again.

           One of the models wakes up and peeps through the blinds.

                                 MODEL #1
                        There’s a girl at the door.

           Jimmy groggily stirs awake as Model #2 stays asleep. Model #1 
           looks out the window again.

                                 MODEL #1 (CONT’D)
                        She kinda looks like Ariana Grande.

           Jimmy snaps out of his haze and shoots up from the couch. He 
           checks the time on his phone.

                                 JIMMY
                        Fuck, fuck, fuck...

           He runs out of the room.

           EXT. MAC'S NEW LA HOME - DAY

           Ariana impatiently waits at the door, making a call.

           INT. MAC'S NEW LA HOME - BEDROOM - DAY

           Jimmy bursts into the bedroom to find Mac asleep.

           TATTOO COUNTER: 79

           Mac’s phone VIBRATES on his bed side table. Jimmy jumps on 
           him and shakes him awake.

                                 MAC
                        The fuck, bro?
                                 JIMMY
                        Ariana’s out front.

                                 MAC
                        Already? It’s like 7.

                                 JIMMY
                        It’s 11:30.

           Mac jumps out of bed and throws on a pair of shorts and a 
           hoodie.

           As Mac heads out of the room, he sees leftover cocaine and 
           pills on his iPad on his desk. He quickly wipes the drugs 
           away, throws out the empty coke bag, and exits.

           EXT. MAC’S NEW LA HOME - DAY

           Mac, wearing a huge smile, opens the door. 

                                 MAC
                        My dangerous woman!

           Mac gives Ariana a big hug and kiss. She stays still. 

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Welcome back.

                                 ARIANA
                        Seriously? I’ve been out here for 
                        like, 10 minutes. You’re not even 
                        dressed. 

                                 MAC
                        I’m sorry. I was--

                                 ARIANA
                        Have you even slept?

                                 MAC
                        Yeah. I overslept! I was in the 
                        studio all night.

           Ariana takes a whiff of Mac’s Jameson flavored breath.

                                 ARIANA
                        Smells like it.

                                 MAC
                        Baby, relax.
                                 ARIANA
                        Don’t fucking tell me to relax. 
                        What the fuck’s wrong with you? 
                        What else were you doing?

                                 MAC
                        Nothing! I was just making music 
                        and yeah, I had a few drinks. No 
                        big deal.

           Ariana heads inside, blowing past Mac. She ignores Jimmy and 
           the models, now clothed, and heads right for Mac’s room. He 
           follows closely behind.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

           INT. MAC'S NEW LA HOME - BEDROOM - DAY

           Ariana scans the room and begins going through Mac’s drawers. 

                                 MAC
                        Ariana, come on. This is crazy.

           After not finding anything, she collapses into the chair at 
           Mac’s desk.

           Mac sits across from her at the edge of his bed. He peeps in 
           the trash can to make sure the bag isn’t visible. 

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Baby. Hey. I told you. I’m good.

           As Ariana looks up at Mac, she spots a ROLLED UP ONE HUNDRED 
           DOLLAR BILL under the desk. She gets out of her chair and 
           picks it up.

                                 ARIANA
                        You’re good? You’re lying to me.

                                 MAC
                        I’m not.

                                 ARIANA
                        You’re right. You’re lying to 
                        yourself.

           Mac stands to get closer to her.

                                 MAC
                        It’s balance, baby.
                                 ARIANA
                        Don’t baby me right now. There’s no 
                        balance in this bullshit. Most 
                        people can drink and do drugs every 
                        now and then. You’re not most 
                        people! You didn’t even tell me 
                        when you started drinking again. 
                        That’s something you should maybe 
                        communicate to your fucking 
                        girlfriend.

                                 MAC
                        It wasn’t like I made a choice when 
                        to start again! It just happened.

                                 ARIANA
                        You’re never true to your word. You 
                        say you’re gonna call, you don’t. 
                        You say you’re gonna be there, 
                        you’re not. It’s fucking 
                        exhausting.

                                 MAC
                        I’m sorry, okay?

                                 ARIANA
                        You’re always sorry. How many times 
                        can I forgive you until I can’t 
                        look myself in the mirror?

                                 MAC
                        I’m... Look, I fucked up. I need 
                        you, baby.

                                 ARIANA
                        I’m starting to not care about what 
                        you need. 

           Mac doesn’t know what to say.

                                 ARIANA (CONT’D)
                        I was so excited to get home and 
                        see you... I’m so fucking stupid.

                                 MAC
                        No, you’re not.

                                 ARIANA
                        Yeah. I am. Because I love you.

                                 MAC
                        I love you.
                                 ARIANA
                        I can’t watch you kill yourself.

                                 MAC
                        I promise you, I’m fine. Look!

           Mac does a playful dance, but Ariana is too tired to smile. 
           He slowly approaches her.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        The only thing I’m addicted to is 
                        you.

           Mac gives her a kiss. She doesn’t reciprocate, but she 
           doesn’t stop him either.

                                 ARIANA
                        I wish that were true.

           Ariana walks out, breezing past Jimmy, who has been 
           eavesdropping outside the door.

           EXT. MAC'S NEW LA HOME - DAY

           Ariana heads down the driveway towards her car. Mac calls out 
           after her. 

                                 MAC
                        Where you going?

           Ariana wipes away some tears and collects herself before 
           turning around to face him.

                                 ARIANA
                        You have to take care of yourself 
                        before you can take care of me.

                                 MAC
                        Maybe this is how I take care of 
                        myself. Have you thought about 
                        that? Ariana, I’m not doing drugs 
                        and wasting my life. I made like 6 
                        fucking tracks last night. 

                                 ARIANA
                             (sarcastic)
                        That’s amazing. I’m proud of you

                                 MAC
                        You’re being a dick.
                                 ARIANA
                        I’m being a dick? You’re killing 
                        yourself because you define your 
                        life by how much success you have 
                        in music.

                                 MAC
                        I’m not killing myself. I’m pushing 
                        myself. I’m inspiring myself. Name 
                        one motherfucker who out works me. 
                        Huh? You can’t.

                                 ARIANA
                        You’re right, Malcolm. I can’t. And 
                        guess what? I don’t care! I care 
                        about you. I’d love you the same if 
                        you never made another song.

                                 MAC
                        Yeah, I’m sure you would! You’d 
                        love for me to be the kid who 
                        peaked in high school because then 
                        I could be there to respond to 
                        every single one of your texts. 
                        Fuck, maybe I should just put this 
                        next album aside and go on tour 
                        with you. I could read you a bed 
                        time story every night.

                                 ARIANA
                        I don’t need you on tour with me. I 
                        just need you. You talk about 
                        balance? You’ve practically slept 
                        in your studio the past 2 months. 
                        Who the fuck does that?

                                 MAC
                        The best do!

                                 ARIANA
                        Oh, my god. The best? I know a lot 
                        of great artists who don’t have to 
                        sleep in the studio, Malcolm. 

                                 MAC
                             (sotto)
                        Well, I do.

                                 ARIANA
                        What? 

           Mac doesn’t respond.
                                 ARIANA (CONT’D)
                        What’d you say?

                                 MAC
                        Well, I do. Is that what you wanna 
                        hear? That I’m so afraid of failure 
                        that I’ll do anything to avoid it? 
                        That sometimes I think I’m fucking 
                        worthless unless I make music? You 
                        like that?

                                 ARIANA
                        No, Malcolm. I hate that. But 
                        that’s the first real shit you’ve 
                        said to me in the last 6 months. I 
                        might be absent when I’m on the 
                        road, but you’re absent even when 
                        you’re here.

           Mac, visibly shaken, just stares at her, taking her in.

                                 ARIANA (CONT’D)
                        I miss you.

                                 MAC
                        You’re right. I’m sorry. For 
                        everything. I love you.

           Ariana let’s out a faint smile. The two move closer together.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        But you deserve more. And I don’t 
                        think I can give that to you right 
                        now.

           Ariana, broken, can barely stomach his words.

                                 ARIANA
                        If I leave, I’m not coming back 
                        this time.

                                 MAC
                        I know.

           Ariana waits, but Mac doesn’t say anything else. 

           She turns to get in her car, but stops one last time to stare 
           at him.

           Mac just stands there, head hung low. She gets in and he 
           watches her drive off.
           INT. ROCCO’S TAVERN - NIGHT

           Mac and Jimmy are at their neighborhood bar slamming shots 
           and beers, watching the Pirates vs. White Sox game on TV.

           A White Sox pitcher strikes out a Pirate in the bottom of the 
           8th, keeping the Sox in the lead with a score of 3-0. Several 
           BAR PATRONS in Pirates gear moan and groan. 

           Two drunk and obnoxious WHITE SOX FANS (40) at the end of the 
           bar cheer, catching Mac and Jimmy’s attention.

                                 JIMMY
                        Fucking Chicago asshole’s acting 
                        like it’s the World Series. 

                                 MAC
                        Another?

                                 JIMMY
                        Most definitely.

           Mac motions to the BARTENDER for another round.

           The Pirates’ Josh Bell is up to bat. He swings and misses.

           The bartender puts down a GUINNESS and a SHOT of whiskey.

           Mac and Jimmy cheers the shots and down them just as Josh 
           Bell swings and misses again, striking out.

                                 MAC
                        Are you fucking kidding me, man? 
                        Why do we even root for this team? 
                        They never win anything.

           Jimmy stares at Mac in disbelief.

                                 JIMMY
                        Keep your fucking voice down. This 
                        is our team.

                                 MAC
                        So? They fucking suck. They’re the 
                        definition of losers.

                                 JIMMY
                        Because they haven’t won a World 
                        Series in like, 40 years? Do you 
                        know how fucking hard it is to win 
                        a World Series?

                                 MAC
                        Doesn’t matter. Just get it done.
                                 JIMMY
                        Well, what do you think about Allen 
                        Iverson?

                                 MAC
                        That’s different.

                                 JIMMY
                        How?

                                 MAC
                        Because he never--

                                 JIMMY
                        Won anything, but still took a 
                        shitty team to the finals?

                                 MAC
                        Yeah, and because now we’re not 
                        talking teams. We’re talking 
                        players. Teams are different--
                        winning’s on everyone. But when 
                        you’re talking single players--
                        winning’s on them.

                                 JIMMY
                        Name one fucking player who hasn’t 
                        been part of a team. And don’t come 
                        at me with some pussy tennis shit 
                        or boxing, because those fuckers 
                        are as good as their trainers, 
                        their mentors, their girlfriends 
                        who suck ‘em off every night, and 
                        anyone who’s ever influenced them.

           Mac realizes Jimmy’s got a point.

                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        What about you?

                                 MAC
                        What about me?

                                 JIMMY
                        You don’t have a team?

                                 MAC
                        Course I have a team.

                                 JIMMY
                        You’re not acting like you have a 
                        team. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JIMMY (CONT'D)
                        Because when you have a team, it 
                        doesn’t matter if you win or lose. 
                        What matters is you keep on 
                        playing.

           Jimmy points to the TV where it’s now the bottom of the 9th 
           and another Pirate is up to bat.

                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        And swinging.

           Here comes the pitch. STRIKEOUT! The White Sox fans cheer.

                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        Fuck! You wanna smoke a blunt?

           EXT. ROCCO'S TAVERN - NIGHT

           Mac and Jimmy are in the middle of smoking a BLUNT. Mac 
           checks his phone.

                                 MAC
                        Where the fuck’s Q been?

           Mac says “Q been” so fast that Jimmy’s high ass thinks he 
           says Cuban.

                                 JIMMY
                        Mark Cuban?

           Mac shakes his head at his awful joke.

                                 MAC
                        Gimme that.

           Jimmy passes Mac the blunt. He takes a long rip.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Feel like he’s always with his 
                        girl.

           Jimmy knows this isn’t about Q.

                                 JIMMY
                        You’re gonna be alright, dude.

                                 MAC
                        I know.

                                 JIMMY
                        I know you know. But still.

           LOUD CHEERING erupts from inside the bar.
           The White Sox Fans walk outside with their heads hung low.

           Mac and Jimmy look at each other and run inside.

           INT. ROCCO'S TAVERN - NIGHT

           The guys enter to find the few Pirates fans in the bar high-
           fiving each other.

                                 MAC
                        What happened?

                                 FAN #1
                        Pirates rallied and Bell hit a walk 
                        off grand slam!

           Jimmy runs outside of the bar, while Mac stares at the TV.

                                 JIMMY (O.S.)
                        That’s right you fucking pussies! 
                        You suck!

           Mac laughs to himself and heads outside.

           EXT. ROCCO'S TAVERN - NIGHT

           Mac walks out to find Jimmy yelling at a car exiting the lot.

                                 JIMMY
                        And deep dish pizza is basically 
                        lasagna!

           Mac swings his arm around Jimmy as the two stumble towards 
           Mac’s G-Wagon parked in the lot.

                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        What’d I tell you, bro? That’s some 
                        movie shit right there.

           Jimmy breaks free from Mac and starts screaming to the sky.

                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        Never stop swinging!!!

           Mac is laughing his ass off.

                                 MAC
                        You stupid, bro! Let’s go.

                                 JIMMY
                        You good to drive? 
                                 MAC
                        Do I look good?

                                 JIMMY
                        No.

           The two bust out laughing in unison as they get in the car.

           INT. MAC’S G-WAGON - NIGHT

           Mac speeds through windy streets in the Studio City hills as 
           he and Jimmy rap Afroman’s, “Because I Got High.”

                                 MAC/JIMMY
                        I was gonna clean my room until I 
                        got high
                        I was gonna get up and find the 
                        broom but then I got high
                        My room is still messed up and I 
                        know why (why, man?)
                        Yeah, hey
                        'Cause I got high
                        Because I got high
                        Because I got high

           They both turn to one another to sing the next part.

                                 MAC/JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        I was gonna go to class before I 
                        got high 
                        I coulda cheated and I coulda 
                        passed but I got high
                        I am taking it next semester and I 
                        know why (why, man?)
                        Yeah, hey
                        'Cause I got high

                            MAC
                                                          JIMMY
                                              Yo, you missed the turn! 
           Because I got high
           Because I got high

           As the car continues roaring down the street, Mac turns 
           around to make sure he missed the turn.

                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        Look out!

           Mac turns back around to see a PARKED CAR. 
           EXT. MAC’S G-WAGON - NIGHT

           He swerves left to avoid hitting the car, sending the G-WAGON 
           over the curb.

           THE CAR VIOLENTLY HITS A TELEPHONE POLE, which topples on top 
           of the car as the AIR BAGS DEPLOY.

           INT. MAC’S G-WAGON - NIGHT

           Mac, in a daze, slowly comes to as the smoke from the engine 
           encapsulates the car. 

           He looks over to see Jimmy passed out on the airbag.

                                 MAC
                        Jimmy. Yo, Jim.

           Mac pushes his airbag to the side and shakes Jimmy.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Jimmy!

           Jimmy finally stirs awake. 

                                 JIMMY
                             (singing)
                        You weren’t gonna crash your car. 
                        But then you got high.

           Mac lets out a sigh of relief.

                                 MAC
                        Fuck, dude. What do we do?

                                 JIMMY
                        Run?

                                 MAC
                        Run?

                                 JIMMY
                        Run.

           EXT. FRYMAN ROAD - NIGHT

           Mac and Jimmy sprint down a dimly lit street.
           INT. MAC'S NEW LA HOME - NIGHT

           Mac and Jimmy enter the house and immediately slam the door. 
           They’re huffing and puffing, absolutely gassed.

                                 JIMMY
                        And I thought I was the worse 
                        driver.

           Mac and Jimmy begin deliriously laughing until they realize 
           there’s nothing left to laugh about.

                                 MAC
                        I’m fucked.

                                 JIMMY
                        Naw, dude, you didn’t do anything.

           Mac looks over to Jimmy.

                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        I was driving.

                                 MAC
                        No, fuck that--

                                 JIMMY
                        What do you mean, fuck that? Nobody 
                        saw a thing. It’s an easy fall.

                                 MAC
                        Bro, I almost just killed you. I’m 
                        not gonna let you take a DUI charge 
                        for me.

                                 JIMMY
                        Why? It’d only be my second.

                                 MAC
                        No, dude. Absolutely not. This is 
                        my fuck up. 

                                 JIMMY
                        But you’re Iverson.

                                 MAC
                        And your dumbass is the team.

           Jimmy and Mac exchange a smile.

                                 JIMMY
                        Ah, fuck.

           Jimmy heads out the door.
                                 MAC
                        Where you going?

                                 JIMMY
                        Left my wallet in the backseat.

                                 MAC
                        Don’t be stupid, dude!

                                 JIMMY
                        I got like a gram of coke in there.

           Jimmy runs off, leaving Mac alone. Again.

           INT. MAC’S NEW LA HOME - BEDROOM - LATER

           Mac, consumed by darkness, sits on the floor of his room, 
           strumming a melancholy tune on the guitar.

           FLASHING RED AND BLUE LIGHTS begin to creep through his 
           window. Mac disregards them and keeps on playing.

           INT. FRICK PARK MARKET - DAY

           Two TEENAGE BOYS work the market. One sweeps an aisle floor, 
           while the other wipes down the deli counter

           We recognize them as older versions of the shady kids Mac 
           caught stealing at the market years earlier.

           In the background, a REPORTER appears on the TV in the corner 
           of the store. The text on screen reads, “Breaking News.”

                                 REPORTER (O.S.)

                        Miller, on charges of driving under 
                        the influence of alcohol.

           The announcement of Mac’s name catches the teens’ attention. 
           They both stop working and stare at the TV.

                        the 26-year old to escape the scene 
                        on foot.

           Mac’s high school sweetheart, Nomi sits in front of an 
           uneaten meal, watching the same news report.  

           We hear a POLICE OFFICER (40s) speaking about the incident.

                                 OFFICER (O.S.)
                        There wasn’t anybody at the scene 
                        when we arrived, so we ran the 
                        plates, which lead us to Mr. 
                        McCormick’s home.

                        confessed to driving drunk and 
                        fleeing the scene. He was actually 
                        the nicest and most polite 
                        intoxicated person we’ve ever seen.

                        bail.

           TMZ footage shows Q escorting Mac, with a hoodie covering his 
           face, out of the jailhouse.

           Off screen, the TMZ REPORTER, wielding a shaky camera, 
           obtrusively questions Mac.

                        Can you tell us how much you had to

           Mac continues to be bombarded with questions.

                                 TMZ REPORTER (CONT’D)
                        Some people might say that this is 
                        because of your recent breakup...

           Mac and Q finally get to their car. As Mac gets in the 
           passenger seat, the reporter gets out one last question.

                                 TMZ REPORTER (CONT’D)
                        Is there any truth to that? Any 
                        chance for reconciliation?

           Mac and Q drive off.

           INT. MAC'S NEW LA HOME - DUSK

           Mac, wearing the same clothes he left the jailhouse in, 
           enters his living room to find his TV playing the news.

           Mac shuts off the TV and catches the reflection of his piano 
           in the darkness of the screen. 

           He trudges over, takes a seat, and stares at the keys. He 
           begins playing the familiar chords of his song, “2009.”
           The music fills the empty room as Mac pours himself into the 
           song. For the first time, he finds the words...

                                 MAC
                        I don't need to lie no more
                        Nowadays all I do is shine, take a 
                        breath and ease my mind, and
                        She don't cry no more
                        She tell me that I get her high 
                        cause a angel's s'posed to fly, and
                        I ain't askin', "Why?" no more
                        Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I 
                        don't stay inside the lines
                        It ain't 2009 no more
                        Yeah, I know what's behind that 
                        door--

           INT. NPR TINY DESK CONCERT - DAY

           TATTOO COUNTER: 84

           We’re back where we began; the Tiny Desk concert. Mac 
           continues to perform “2009.” 

                                 MAC
                        Okay you gotta jump in to swim
                        Well, the light was dim in this 
                        life of sin
                        Now every day I wake up and breathe
                        I don't have it all but that's 
                        alright with me...

           Mac and his band perform the rest of the song until the 
           entire office is up on their feet clapping.

           He praises his band and bows down to the violinists before 
           turning back to his audience.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Thank you, guys. Thank you, thank 
                        you, thank you. Appreciate you all. 
                        Appreciate you guys for listening. 
                        Listen to the record if you feel so 
                        inclined and, uh, have a great day.

           EXT. NPR TINY DESK CONCERT - ALLEY - DAY

           Mac chiefs a cig. NPR STAGEHANDS load instruments into a van.

           Several employees exit passed Mac. One NPR EMPLOYEE praises 
           him before walking off.
                                 NPR EMPLOYEE
                        Amazing performance, Mac. I love 
                        all your stuff, but this album--
                        this one’s the best yet.

                                 MAC
                        Thanks, bro. Means a lot.

                                 NPR EMPLOYEE
                        What’s in store for the next one?

           Mac takes a beat. Then, with a smile...

                                 MAC
                        No idea.

           The employee happily nods before walking off.

           Thundercat approaches.

                                 THUNDERCAT
                        Best one yet, huh?

                                 MAC
                        He said it, not me.

           Thundercat let’s out a huge smile and bear hugs Mac, lifting 
           him off his feet.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Dad, you’re embarrassing me!

                                 THUNDERCAT
                        When you back in LA? 

                                 MAC
                        Sanaa’s birthday.

                                 THUNDERCAT
                        You don’t need to come back for 
                        that--take your time out here. 

                                 MAC
                        What kind of uncle misses his 
                        niece’s birthday?

                                 THUNDERCAT
                        Um, most uncles?

           Mac lets out a laugh.

                                 MAC
                        Yeah, well this uncle’s throwing 
                        the party.
                                 THUNDERCAT
                        I’m telling you--

                                 MAC
                        And I’m telling you--I want to do 
                        this.
                             (beat)
                        Let me do it.

           Thundercat stares at Mac until he daps him up.

                                 THUNDERCAT
                        See you Sunday.

           Mac finishes his cig as Thundercats walks off. 

           EXT. BLUE SLIDE PARK - DAY

           The park is full of FAMILIES enjoying the sunny day. Mac and 
           his mom, Karen stroll past the blue slide as people take 
           notice. But instead of bombarding him, they acknowledge him 
           with a nod.

                                 MAC
                        It feels so good to be home.

           Karen smiles as the two continue walking.

                                 KAREN
                        I’m proud of you baby. And they are 
                        too.

           Karen points across the park to Q, Jimmy, Treejay, and 
           Reggie, who is now significantly heavier.

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        Surprise. Your album release party.

           Off Mac’s huge smile.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BLUE SLIDE PARK - DAY

           Mac and his mom, Karen sit with his friends at a picnic 
           table, eating and drinking LA CROIX. The table is covered in 
           the same elaborate spread Karen prepared when Mac first 
           signed with Rostrum Records.

           Reggie reaches for another bagel.
                                 JIMMY
                        You sure about that?

                                 REGGIE
                        You’re such a dick.

                                 JIMMY
                        I’m a dick? You’re eating all the 
                        bagels. Ms. M hasn’t even gotten 
                        one.

                                 KAREN
                        I’m fine.

           Mac shakes his head as the guys laugh together.

                                 MAC
                        Nothing’s changed.

                                 TREEJAY
                        Damn right.

                                 MAC
                        I think the last time we were all 
                        here together was when--

                                 Q
                        We dropped “Nikes.”

                                 MAC
                        Wow. Looking back on everything, I 
                        was so right.

                                 Q
                        About what?

                                 MAC
                        No matter where we go or how big 
                        we, or Reggie get, that slide--that 
                        slide is always gonna be blue. 

                                 KAREN
                        What does that even mean?

           All the guys, including Mac, laugh at his ridiculous quote.

                                 MAC
                        It means I love you all.

           Mac raises his La Croix to make a toast.
                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Thanks for giving me the best album 
                        release party a kid could ask for. 
                        Here’s to the most dope family.

           The rest of the group cheers and drinks.

                                 ALL
                        Most dope!

           Mac sets his drink down and gets out of his seat.

                                 MAC
                        First one down the slide gets a 
                        feature on the next album!

           Mac takes off running. Jimmy is the first one up and on his 
           way to the slide, prompting everyone to scream.

                                 Q/REGGIE/TREEJAY
                        No!!!!!

           The bottom of the slide is littered with PIECES OF CARDBOARD, 
           which each of them grab to use as a sled.

           Karen watches her son and his friends race down the slide. 

           They’re in their most pure state. 

           They’re K.I.D.S.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. THUNDERCAT'S CAR - DAY

           Sanaa, Thundercat’s daughter, sits in the back seat wearing a 
           colorful dress and birthday hat. She can barely contain her 
           excitement as Thundercat drives through a neighborhood in 
           Studio City, Los Angeles.  

                                 SANAA
                        How many presents do you think 
                        Uncle Mac got me?

                                 THUNDERCAT
                        It’s not the quantity that matters, 
                        Sanaa. It’s the thought.

                                 SANAA
                        Do you think he got me the Gucci 
                        flip flops?

           Thundercat rolls his eyes.
                                 THUNDERCAT
                        I’m sure he did.
                             (sotto)
                        Cuz I sure as hell didn’t.

           Sanaa stares out the window, mind racing.

                                 SANAA
                        We passed it! We passed it!

                                 THUNDERCAT
                        No, we didn’t. It’s up here on the 
                        right.

                                 SANAA
                        Are you sure?

           Thundercat smiles.

                                 THUNDERCAT
                        Why don’t you drive next time?

                                 SANAA
                        Really?

           Thundercat turns into a cul-de-sac, immediately at a loss for 
           words.

           Several POLICE CARS and an AMBULANCE are parked in front of 
           Mac’s house. CAUTION TAPE lines the front yard.

           Thundercat slows down as his eyes go wide.

           He comes to a complete stop as red and blue lights flash 
           across his devastated face.

           Thundercat reaches for his door handle.

                                 THUNDERCAT
                        Stay in the car, baby.

                                 SANAA
                        But Uncle Mac--

                                 THUNDERCAT
                        I said stay in the car!

           His scream scares Sanaa. She finally sits still.

           He settles himself, takes a deep breath, and exits.
           EXT. MAC'S NEW LA HOME - CONTINUOUS

           He walks up to the base of the driveway to find Jimmy and Q 
           sitting on the curb, their faces in their palms.

           Thundercat stops, registering the moment.

           Jimmy and Q look up at him, tears fill their eyes.

           As Thundercat breaks down, Sanaa gets out of the car and 
           sprints behind him towards the house.

                                 SANAA
                        Uncle Mac! Uncle Mac!

           But he swoops her up in his arms just as she’s about to pass.

           Thundercat embraces his daughter, gently quieting her down.

           He holds her as close as he can.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           CHYRON:

           Malcolm James McCormick died from an accidental overdose on 
           September 7, 2018 at the age of 26.

           His final album, SWIMMING, posthumously earned him his first 
           Grammy nomination.

           The park has been renamed “Mac Miller’s Blue Slide Park.” 

           And the slide’s still blue.
