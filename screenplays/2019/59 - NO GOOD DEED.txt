          Good Fear

          (323) 433-9201
           EXT. WOODS - DAY - 1917

           Wild game birds fly overhead, skimming the treetops of a 
           quiet forest.

           A hunting rifle silently tracks the birds.  The rifle belongs 
           to a YOUNG MAN, 18, crouching in a cluster of shrubs.  He’s 
           dressed in clean but well-worn early 20th century style 
           clothing -- the year is 1917.

           As the birds fly past, the Young Man shoots.  But his aim is 
           shaky, and he misses.  He seems distracted, on edge.  He 
           checks the time on his watch.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY - 1917

           The sun starts to set as the Young Man returns home.  He 
           emerges from the woods and walks toward a large FARMHOUSE.  

           A TOWERING TREE marks the property line of the farm.  

           The tree is huge, but brittle-looking, dry, and sparsely 
           covered in withered leaves.  It bears some kind of dark 
           prunish-looking fruit -- deep red flecked with black.

           The Young Man avoids looking at the tree as he passes.

           When he reaches the Farmhouse porch, he realizes the front 
           door is ajar.

           INT. FARMHOUSE, ENTRYWAY - DAY - 1917

           The Young Man takes a hesitant step inside.  His foot slides 
           a little, because the floor is slick with blood.  The Young 
           Man stops.  He’s trembling now.  He doesn’t want to go any 
           further.

           From the doorway, the Young Man peers past the staircase, 
           down the front hall.  At the end of the hall, he can see into 
           the entrance to the kitchen, at the back end of the house.

           There’s more blood there.  Much more.

           And partially visible, sprawled all over the kitchen floor, 
           he sees glimpses of bodies, here and there.  A stocking-clad 
           leg, a crooked elbow.  All blood-streaked.    

           A small HAND, child-sized, grips the kitchen door frame.  The 
           hand has been ripped away from the owner’s body, not cleanly.  
           The wrist ends in a ragged stump.
           EXT. TREE - NIGHT - 1917

           Later, the Young Man sits at the base of the tree, staring at 
           the blood on his shoes.  His eyes are glazed; he’s in shock.

           A fresh drop of blood dots his forehead.  Then another.  The 
           Young Man flinches and looks up.  The blood seems to be 
           raining down from the tree itself.  It runs down the tree 
           trunk like sap.

                                                           CUT TO BLACK

           EXT. SUTTON HOUSE - NIGHT 

           Present day.  

           A hot, airless, summer night in the suburbs.  

           A shirtless NEIGHBOR wearing baggy athletic shorts walks his 
           dog along the curb.  The neighbor mumbles to the dog, urging 
           it to hurry up and squat so they can go home.  But the dog is 
           distracted by--

           a drawn out SCREAM 

           --coming from the SUTTON HOUSE in the middle of the street. 
           The scream turns into hysterical wailing.

           The neighbor looks uncomfortable, but pretends he doesn’t 
           hear the cries.  He pulls the dog along. 

           INT. SUTTON HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 

           A hospital bed has been set up in the living room.  

           A NURSE stands by, tending to the patient in the bed: AMY 
           SUTTON.  

           Amy is about 40, but her age would be impossible to guess. 
           Her hair is gone, her features sunken, and her skin waxy.  
           Despite her frailty, she has a determined expression that 
           suggests she’s still fighting. 

           Amy’s husband JASON slumps in a chair across the room.  He 
           stares wearily at the source of the screaming, his daughter --  

           ZOEY SUTTON, 11.  

           Zoey radiates the usual pre-adolescent awkwardness and angst.  
           But her typical self-consciousness is masked now, by fury. 
           Zoey paces the room.  Tears stream down her face and 
           inarticulate howls escape her throat.

           Zoey pauses to pound her fists against the cushion of a 
           reclining chair.  Then she wheels around to face her father.

                                 ZOEY
                        I’m not going anywhere!  I live 
                        here.  You don’t get to just send 
                        me away!  And I don’t even know 
                        her!

           Zoey gestures to a woman in the doorway.  This is JULIA 
           MITCHELL, 40. 

           Julia looks meek, beaten-down, ill-equipped to deal with a 
           raging pre-teen.  She tries her best to blend into the 
           background. 

                                 JASON
                        She’s your family.  She’s your Aunt 
                        Julia.

                                 ZOEY
                        I don’t know her!

           Jason seems to sink further into his chair. 

                                 JASON
                        Zoey.  It’s just for the summer...

           He trails off, apparently too tired to argue.

                                 ZOEY
                        You can’t make me go.  You can’t!  
                        I’m not leaving--

           From the hospital bed, Amy reaches her arms out. 

                                 AMY
                        Zoey.  Baby, come here.

           Zoey suddenly loses her fire.  

           The impassive Nurse moves aside and disappears into another 
           room.

           Zoey runs into Amy’s arms.  

           Amy holds Zoey tight and whispers something to her -- we 
           can’t hear what it is.  Whatever Amy’s words are, they have 
           an immediate affect.  Tears still stream down Zoey’s face, 
           but the anger is gone.  
           From the doorway, Julia watches the agonizing scene of a 
           dying mother comforting her distraught daughter.  She feels 
           like an intruder, clumsily encroaching on something sacred.  
           She backs out of the living room. 

           INT. SUTTON HOUSE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 

           Julia takes a seat at the bare kitchen table and lays her 
           head down on her folded arms. 

           The Sutton’s dog, CHITO, follows Julia into the kitchen and 
           lies down at Julia’s feet.

           INT. SUTTON HOUSE, STAIRCASE - DAY 

           Early morning.  

           Zoey glumly drags her suitcase down the stairs. 

           INT. SUTTON HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY 

           Julia stands by Amy’s bed. She scans the row of framed family 
           photographs adorning a nearby bookshelf: Jason, Zoey, and a 
           healthy-looking Amy on various adventures. They look happy.

           Julia looks down at the hospital bed. Amy looks deathly 
           still. But then she lets out a shallow breath.

           Just outside the living room, Zoey’s suitcase THUMPS as it 
           reaches the bottom of the stairs. 

           The girl stops in the doorway of the living room for a 
           moment, just long enough to glare at Julia. Then she moves 
           on, pulling her suitcase towards the front door. 

           Julia watches Zoey leave. When she looks back down at Amy, 
           she sees that Amy is awake and staring back at her.

                                 AMY
                        Thank you for doing this. She needs 
                        this. She needs to be away. From 
                        all this. 

           Julia nods and leans down to give Amy a hug. She tries to 
           hold it together, but soon breaks down.

                                 JULIA
                        Amy, I’m so sorry.  This sucks.   
                        You beat this already.
                                 AMY
                        There’s always a risk. I went 
                        through so much radiation as a kid.  
                        There was always a chance it was 
                        going to come back to bite me in 
                        the ass.

                                 JULIA
                        They should have figured out a less 
                        risky way to treat you back then. 
                        They should have warned you, like 
                        “oh by the way, this cancer 
                        treatment might eventually give you 
                        even more cancer.”

                                 AMY
                        It’s not like I would have done 
                        anything different.
                             (then)
                        Maybe I would’ve picked up smoking. 
                        I could have been smoking six packs 
                        a day all this time. 

                                 JULIA
                        Yeah. You could have been just like 
                        Uncle Gus.

                                 AMY
                             (rasping)
                        “Girl!  Grab me a Schlitz!”

           Julia cracks up but the laughter quickly fades. She embraces 
           Amy again. Then steps away from the bed. But Amy reaches out 
           and latches onto Julia’s arm.

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Take care of my girl.

                                 JULIA
                        Bye, Amy.

           Julia steps out. 

           Amy stares at the empty doorway. Her smile disappears. She 
           looks eerily vacant. 

           EXT. SUTTON HOUSE - DAY 

           Julia slides into the driver’s seat of her car, parked in the 
           driveway.  

           Zoey leads her dog Chito to the car, and they  climb into the 
           back seat.
           Jason places Zoey’s suitcase in the trunk. Zoey stares at her 
           father through the back seat window.  He waves to her.  She 
           doesn’t wave back.

           INT. JULIA’S CAR - DAY 

           Julia backs the car out of the driveway and hits the road.  
           She sneaks a look at Zoey through the rear view mirror and 
           finds Zoey staring back at her.

                                 ZOEY
                        My mom only has brothers.

                                 JULIA
                        Yeah.

                                 ZOEY
                        So you’re not my real aunt?

                                 JULIA
                        Your mom and I are cousins.  But we 
                        were practically like sisters 
                        growing up.

                                 ZOEY
                        If you were like sisters, how come 
                        I’ve never met you?

           A look passes over Julia’s face -- she looks slightly hurt, 
           confused.

                                 JULIA
                        Your mom’s always been so busy. At 
                        least we’re finally getting to know 
                        each other.  That’ll make her 
                        happy.

           Zoey scoffs.

                                 ZOEY
                        She doesn’t care if we’re friends.  
                        She just can’t handle me being 
                        around.  And now, I might never see 
                        her again. 

                                 JULIA
                        We don’t know that.  Nobody knows 
                        what’s going to happen.  And she’s 
                        doing this because she loves you.  
                        She knows that this isn’t easy for 
                        you.  It’s not easy to watch 
                        someone you love--
                                 ZOEY
                        Die? 

           Julia can’t bring herself to confirm that.  Not out loud.

                                 JULIA
                        She’s just trying to help.  

           Zoey bitterly turns her attention back to the window.

           EXT. ROAD - DAY 

           The sun starts to set after a long day of driving.  The car 
           passes through some deep rural county, where miles stretch 
           between neighboring houses.

           Julia turns her car into a long dirt drive leading toward the 
           farmhouse.  

           This is the same farmhouse to which the Young Man came home 
           more than a century ago, only to find bodies and blood.  

           INT. JULIA’S CAR - DAY 

           Zoey gawks at the size of the house as they approach.

                                 ZOEY
                        You live here all by yourself??

                                 JULIA
                        Too big for one person, right?  
                        Yeah.  I’m still getting used to 
                        it. 

                                 ZOEY
                        I thought you grew up here.

                                 JULIA
                        I did.  My Grandma and Grandpa-- 
                        your great-grandparents-- raised me 
                        in this house.  But I never lived 
                        here alone before, until now.  It’s 
                        a little weird.

                                 ZOEY
                        Then why’d you move back?

                                 JULIA
                        Grandpa left me this house when he 
                        died.  It wasn’t helping anybody, 
                        sitting here empty and boarded up.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                        I figured I’d either better sell it 
                        or move in.  So last month, I 
                        finally moved in.  

           Julia stops the car in front of the house.  She stares up at 
           the place with a mix of fondness and apprehension. 

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        It was never empty when I as a kid, 
                        there were always people in and 
                        out.  Your mom and her family spent 
                        every summer here, and she loved 
                        it. We all loved this house.

                                 ZOEY
                        She never told me that. She never 
                        even mentioned this house. Or you.

           Julia reacts -- that stings.

           Zoey exits the car, and Julia follows.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY 

           Zoey surveys the property. 

                                 JULIA
                        The nearest neighbor is about two 
                        miles that way.  There’s a cool 
                        hiking path that starts right at 
                        the edge of the woods east of the 
                        house.  And-

                                 ZOEY
                        What’s that?

           Zoey points down a gravel road leading to a little cemetery 
           on the edge of the property. 

                                 JULIA
                        Family cemetery.  Lucky us, we get 
                        all this history and six 
                        generations of dead relatives 
                        conveniently located just a few 
                        steps away.

                                 ZOEY
                        Creepy.  So, are we going inside?

           Julia fumbles to find her keys.

                                 JULIA
                        Of course.
                                 ZOEY
                        Chito.  Come.

           The dog sniffs around the yard, but he bounds over when Zoey 
           calls. He stops though, when he reaches the porch. He cocks 
           his head and stares uncertainly at the front door.

           Julia unlocks the door and pulls it open.

                                 JULIA
                        Give him time.  It might take a 
                        minute for him to--

           As the front door swings open, Chito charges toward the house 
           and races inside.  

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        --get comfortable.

           Julia and Zoey step into the doorway to watch as Chito 
           streaks around the entryway, sniffing EVERYTHING. 

           INT. FARMHOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY 

           The daylight is starting to fade, although nobody has 
           bothered to turn on any lights inside.  

           Upstairs, Zoey drifts down the dim hallway.  Somewhere 
           downstairs, Chito barks ceaselessly.

           Zoey reaches a bedroom at the end of the hall.  The door 
           stands half ajar.  Zoey pushes it all the way open.

           INT. FARMHOUSE, SMALL BEDROOM - DAY 

           Zoey steps into the room.  The first thing she notices is a 
           giant window centered in the wall opposite the door.  It has 
           a view for miles.  

           Zoey moves to the window and takes in lush surroundings.  
           Everything outside is so green, the landscape seems to 
           pulsate with life--

           --except for the immense tree that still stands on the 
           property line.  

           The tree appears unchanged since it last rained blood down on 
           a Young Man.  It still looks almost dead, on the verge of 
           drying up and turning to dust.  

           One change has occurred in the last century: a decrepit 
           TREEHOUSE now sits nestled in the tree’s branches.  
           Zoey’s gaze zeroes in on the treehouse -- it’s clearly 
           vacant, abandoned.  But Zoey stares intently at it, as if 
           expecting to see something.

                                 JULIA (O.S.)
                        You found my old room.

           Zoey spins around to find Julia behind her.

                                 ZOEY
                        When my mom was visiting, she 
                        stayed in this room too.  Right?

                                 JULIA
                        Yeah.  We shared a bed every summer 
                        for about ten years in a row.  

           Zoey turns to look at the musty looking twin bed in the 
           corner.  

                                 ZOEY
                        So you really were close.

                                 JULIA
                        Yeah, we even had these...

           Julia crosses to the bedside table and opens the drawer.  She 
           pulls out a cheap gold plated chain necklace with a half 
           heart “best friends” pendant. 

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        This one was mine.  I bet your mom 
                        still has the other.  You want it?

           Zoey accepts the necklace and turns back to the window.

           Julia starts to close the drawer but spots an old notebook 
           shoved in the back. She pulls it out. 

                                 ZOEY
                        What’s that?

                                 JULIA
                        It’s your mom’s old journal.

                                 ZOEY
                        My mom kept a journal?

                                 JULIA
                        It was our grandmother’s idea. 
                        She’d give us a notebook at the 
                        beginning of the summer and tell us 
                        to write something every day, even 
                        if it was just a sentence. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                        She said we’d want the memories. I 
                        could never get into the habit. 
                        Your mother was better at it. 

           Julia opens the book to a random page. She smiles, seeing 
           little doodles and notes.

           She flips the page and her smile fades. She looks down at the 
           words: 

           “today I met a demon.”

           Zoey sees Julia’s expression change.

                                 ZOEY
                        What’s wrong?

           Julia closes the book.

                                 JULIA
                        Nothing. I shouldn’t read this. 
                        Your mom would be pissed. 

           Julia shoves the diary back into the drawer. 

           Downstairs, Chito’s barking seems to intensify.  Julia is 
           suddenly hit with the need to get out of this room.  

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        Hungry?  I’ll start dinner.

           Julia doesn’t wait for Zoey to respond.  She quickly hurries 
           downstairs to the kitchen. 

           INT. FARMHOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY 

           Julia scours her near empty fridge, looking for something 
           that might seem appetizing.  She finds a can of chili in the 
           pantry.  Good enough.  

           She grabs the can and lights a burner on the stove.

           INT. FARMHOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT 

           Julia tries to make conversation as Zoey eats in silence.

                                 JULIA
                        There’s plenty to do around here.  
                        When it’s hot like this, the pond 
                        is good for swimming.  Do you like 
                        to swim?
                                 ZOEY
                        Not in bodies of water that fish 
                        crap in.

                                 JULIA
                        If you don’t like swimming, there’s 
                        a lot of work to be done around the 
                        house.  Little repairs, gardening, 
                        repainting.  You could help me.

                                 ZOEY
                        Am I being punished?

                                 JULIA
                        No.  Work isn’t punishment.
                             (then)
                        I’m becoming my grandfather.

                                 ZOEY
                        What happened to your parents?

                                 JULIA
                             (stalling)
                        What?

                                 ZOEY
                        How come you lived with your 
                        grandparents instead of your 
                        parents when you were growing up?

                                 JULIA
                        I didn’t know my father. And my mom 
                        was going through a rough time and 
                        couldn’t take care of me.  So I 
                        know a little bit about what you’re 
                        going through.

                                 ZOEY
                        What kind of “rough time”?

                                 JULIA
                        She just... She was young.  And 
                        scared all the time.  I don’t know 
                        what she was scared of, I don’t 
                        think she even knew.  But she 
                        wasn’t ready, and she didn’t trust 
                        herself to take care of a kid.

                                 ZOEY
                        So it wasn’t that your mom was too 
                        sick to take care of you.  She just 
                        didn’t want to.

           Julia, taken aback, doesn’t respond.
                                 ZOEY (CONT’D)
                        So it’s not really like my 
                        situation. 

           Julia, stung by Zoey’s childish cruelty, lets her own 
           petulance creep in. 

                                 JULIA
                        You must be really angry.  I get 
                        that.  I mean, my grandparents 
                        offered to take care of me right 
                        away.  They welcomed me in as soon 
                        as I needed them.  I wonder how 
                        many relatives your parents went 
                        through before they finally got me 
                        to take you in.

           Julia seems to regret her words as soon as they’re out.  But 
           Zoey seems unfazed.  

                                 ZOEY
                        It sounds like you’re angry, too.  

           Zoey sets her bowl of chili on the floor to let Chito finish 
           it.

           INT. FARMHOUSE, JULIA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           Julia sits on her bed, reading.  She looks up to see Chito 
           restlessly pacing the hall outside her bedroom.

                                 JULIA
                        Go to sleep.

           Chito agreeably moves further down the hall, out of Julia’s 
           sight. 

           Julia turns off the light. 

           INT. FARMHOUSE, SMALL BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           In the little bedroom, Zoey sleeps.  Her suitcase rests by 
           the bed -- she hasn’t unpacked yet.

           For no obvious reason, Zoey suddenly wakes up with a gasp.  
           She’s sweating, looks wild-eyed, blinking away a nightmare.  

                                 ZOEY
                        Mama!

           Zoey bursts into tears, muffling her sobs by clasping her 
           hands over her mouth.
           Her sobs are interrupted, though, by a small sound, just 
           outside her door.

           Zoey eyes the slightly open door, wide eyed, searching in the 
           dark.

                                 ZOEY (CONT’D)
                        Who’s there?

           She sees nothing, but hears of a strange muffled sound 
           downstairs.

           INT. FARMHOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT 

           Zoey creeps down the hall.  She reaches the stairway’s 
           landing and peers down.

           The sounds come from Chito, who appears to be intently 
           investigating something around the front door.

           INT. FARMHOUSE, ENTRYWAY - NIGHT 

           Zoey joins Chito downstairs.  He sniffs urgently around crack 
           under the front door.  

           Zoey fumbles in the dark for the handle, then pulls the door 
           open.  Chito flies outside like a bullet.  Zoey follows him. 

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT 

           Chito heads for the brittle tree on the edge of the property.  

           Zoey follows him, blank faced, almost zombie-like.  

           The closer Zoey gets to the treehouse, the more precarious 
           the construction appears.  The tree looks so dry, frail and 
           sickly.  The treehouse seems like an impossible burden for it 
           to hold.  But somehow, everything stands.  

           Chito starts to growl, low, serious.

           Zoey’s toe touches the roots of the dead tree, and suddenly 
           all the night sounds of leaves rustling and crickets chirping 
           fall silent.  

           Zoey places a hand on the treehouse ladder.  Then starts to 
           climb.
           INT. FARMHOUSE, JULIA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           At this moment, Julia sleeps soundly in her bed.  Then--  

           BANG

           Julia jolts awake to the earsplitting sound.  She races out 
           of bed.

           INT. FARMHOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT 

           Julia tears down the hall and peeks into the small bedroom.

                                 JULIA
                        Zoey?

           Of course, the room is empty.

           Julia looks down the stairs and realizes what the slam must 
           have been -- the front door is open and banging with every 
           sudden gust of wind.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT 

           Julia hurries outside and scans the property.

                                 JULIA
                        Zoey?

           Julia starts to move around the perimeter of the house.

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        Zoey??

           Julia breaks a sweat in the night’s heat, and she stops to 
           fan herself with the neckline of her shirt.  

           After a brief pause, Julia hears a faint noise. 

           A GNAWING sound, rodent-like.  It seems to come from under 
           the house, in the crawl space.

           Julia steps closer, head cocked, listening, when--

           A SNARL startles her.  Julia yelps involuntarily as Chito 
           appears out of nowhere, streaking past her.  He sniffs 
           frantically around the base of the house.  

           Julia stares at Chito.  Her back is to the distant dead tree.  
           If she turned around, she would see Zoey up in the tree, 
           standing in the treehouse.  But Julia is focused on Chito.
           In the distance, Zoey descends the treehouse ladder.  When 
           she reaches the ground, she moves, ghostlike, towards Julia 
           and the farmhouse.  When she’s a few feet away, Julia finally 
           senses Zoey’s presence, and she wheels around to face the 
           girl.

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        Jesus!

                                 ZOEY
                        I was sleepwalking, I think.

                                 JULIA
                        Back to bed.

           Julia leads Zoey back to the house. 

           INT. FARMHOUSE, SMALL BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           Julia settles Zoey back into the little bed.

                                 JULIA
                        You can’t do that.  You scared me 
                        to death.

                                 ZOEY
                        I told you.  I was sleepwalking.  I 
                        think.  It felt like I was 
                        dreaming. 

                                 JULIA
                        We’ll talk about it in the morning.

           Julia closes Zoey’s door as she leaves the room.

           INT. FARMHOUSE, JULIA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           Julia climbs into bed.  But as soon as she’s pulled up the 
           covers, she hears something.  She sits up to listen. 

           The GNAWING sound again.

           But it’s not outside anymore.  It sounds like it’s coming 
           from the attic, right above Julia’s head.

           INT. FARMHOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY 

           Early morning.

           Julia strides into the kitchen to find Zoey already awake, 
           eating toast. 
                                 JULIA
                             (lightly, peacemaking)
                        Good morning.  You’re an early 
                        riser, huh?  I’m jealous.  I always 
                        have to drag myself out of bed. 

                                 ZOEY
                        You can go back to sleep.  We don’t 
                        have to make conversation.

                                 JULIA
                             (forced, pointed 
                              cheerfulness)
                        Nope, I’m up now.

           Julia looks in the pantry.

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        Sorry about the limited breakfast 
                        options.  We can head to the market 
                        later.

                                 ZOEY
                        Whatever.

           Zoey stares out the window.

                                 JULIA
                        Until then, you can go out and 
                        explore if you want.  Weather’s 
                        nice.  Hell, when I was a kid, I 
                        don’t think I spent more than ten 
                        waking minutes indoors if I could 
                        help it.

                                 ZOEY
                        Okay, Tom Sawyer.

           Julia sags.  Feels like possibly the squarest, most unhip 40-
           year-old woman on earth.

           Zoey has nothing better to do, however, so she follows 
           Julia’s advice and heads outside.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY 

           Zoey wanders across the property.  

           Some of the weeds, prickly with barbs, grow waist high -- 
           they whip and drag across her legs.  Zoey winces and rubs her 
           shins where the weeds have left scratches.  She finds herself 
           drawn to the tree once more.
           EXT. TREE - DAY 

           The tree looks no less imposing during the day time.  Zoey 
           stares up at it, but makes no move to ascend the ladder this 
           time.

           A piece of fruit falls from the tree and hits the ground 
           nearby.  A curious squirrel crawls over to investigate.  It 
           takes a bite from the fruit.  The fruit’s juices stain the 
           squirrel’s mouth blood red.

           Zoey kneels down.  Gives the squirrel her best Disney-
           princess-who-talks-to-animals smile.

                                 ZOEY
                        Hello, there.  Can I help you?

           But the squirrel just runs off.

           Zoey turns and spots the cemetery over a small hill.  She 
           heads there.

           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY 

           Zoey looks over the graves.  Her face softens.  The quiet 
           solemnity of the place affects her.  There’s no sign of 
           snarkiness or attitude in her expression. 

           Zoey moves to the back of the cemetery.  She reads the names 
           on this last row of headstones--

                                 ZOEY
                        Jonathan Mitchell... Cassandra 
                        Mitchell... Gregory Mitchell... 
                        Alice Mitchell...

           There are seven headstones in this row.  And on each 
           headstone--

           --the same date of death.

                                 JULIA (O.S.)
                        I thought you said the cemetery was 
                        creepy.

           Zoey turns to see Julia coming to join her.

                                 ZOEY
                        I didn’t say creepy was bad.  

           Zoey points to the row of headstones in the back of the 
           cemetery.
                                 ZOEY (CONT’D)
                        Look at this row.  These people 
                        here all died on the same day.

           Julia joins Zoey in the back of the cemetery.  She points 
           down the row of headstones.

                                 JULIA
                        That’s your great-great-great 
                        grandfather... there’s his wife, 
                        your great-great-great 
                        grandmother... and their kids.  Has 
                        anybody ever told you about them?  
                        This is like... the big mystery of 
                        the Mitchell family.  They were all 
                        found dead one night.  

           Zoey grabs a stick and starts tracing lines in the dirt. 

                                 ZOEY
                        What happened?

                                 JULIA
                        I don’t know.  Maybe the dad went 
                        crazy and did a murder-suicide?  
                        That’s my guess.  Although people 
                        around town say it must have been 
                        an animal attack because of the way 
                        the bodies-

           Julia shakes her head, not wanting to go into the gory 
           details.

           Zoey points to the last headstone.  The date of death is 
           different on this one -- the occupant of the grave did not 
           have his life cut short like the others.  He lived another 
           seventy years past the deaths of the rest.

                                 ZOEY
                        This one didn’t die that day.

                                 JULIA
                        Oh yeah.  That’s your great-great-
                        grandfather.  He was the oldest kid 
                        in the family.  The only survivor.  

                                 ZOEY
                        Why didn’t he die with the rest of 
                        them?

                                 JULIA
                        I think he was out hunting when it 
                        happened.   He was the one who came 
                        home and found them all dead.  
           Zoey’s eyes return to the graves, but Julia’s expression goes 
           vacant as she thinks.

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        I knew him.  He was old when I met 
                        him.  Really old.  But still alive 
                        when I was little.  He slept in the 
                        room across from mine.  Across from 
                        the room you’re staying in now. 

           Zoey absentmindedly breaks a twig in half and uses the twig 
           to poke at the Old Man’s grave.

                                 ZOEY
                        So what was he like?

                                 JULIA
                        When I knew him?  

           QUICK FLASH

           5-YEAR-OLD JULIA stands in a dark room, next to a bed. An OLD 
           MAN lies in the bed.  His face is twisted in an expression of 
           horror.

           END QUICK FLASH

           Julia looks disturbed by the memory.

                                 ZOEY
                        What?

                                 JULIA
                        Nothing.  He was a vegetable.

           She shudders.

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        Want to head back to the house?

           Julia hops over the cemetery fence, taking the quickest route 
           out instead of traveling down the short winding path toward 
           the gate.  Zoey takes the normal route, closing the gate 
           firmly behind her. 

           On the way to the farmhouse, they pass--

           THE TREE

           -- and then a little further away, Zoey notices the squirrel 
           lying dead on the ground, its mouth still stained red.  A 
           crow is already pecking at the corpse.  The half eaten fruit 
           lies abandoned a few paces away. 
           Zoey stops and stares at the grisly scene until Julia turns 
           back.

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        You okay?

           Before Zoey can answer, Chito erupts in frantic barking from 
           behind the farmhouse.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY 

           Julia and Zoey move towards the house, following the sound of 
           Chito’s barking.  

                                 JULIA
                        Christ.  Does he ever stop?

                                 ZOEY
                        He’s overstimulated.  There’s too 
                        many smells.  He’s not used to the 
                        country.  

           Zoey peeks around the corner of the house, looking for Chito 
           in the backyard.  She sees something that alarms her, and she 
           gasps. 

                                 JULIA
                        What?  What happened?

           Zoey doesn’t answer.  She races around the house toward 
           Chito.

           EXT. BACK YARD - DAY 

           Hurrying after Zoey, Julia finds the girl crouched on the 
           ground.  Chito dances around her, growling.

           Julia realizes that Zoey is kneeling in front of an injured 
           OPOSSUM.  Its leg is mangled.  It has stained the grass with 
           its blood.

                                 JULIA
                        Ugh.  It doesn’t look so good.

                                 ZOEY
                        Get me a towel.

                                 JULIA
                        What??

                                 ZOEY
                        Can you hold Chito back?
           Julia takes hold of the dog.

           Zoey bounces to her feet and starts running toward the house.  
           She disappears through the back door and comes back a moment 
           later carrying a kitchen towel and some rubber dish gloves.

                                 JULIA
                        What are you doing?

                                 ZOEY
                             (pulling on the gloves)
                        I can help it.

                                 JULIA
                        Don’t.  It might have rabies or 
                        something.

           Zoey wraps the towel around the inured animal.

                                 ZOEY
                        Opossums hardly ever get rabies.  
                        And I can help it.  I helped my dad 
                        fix up a cat once, after Chito 
                        almost ripped her to shreds.  I can 
                        at least clean it up.

           Zoey wraps the opossum in the towel and lifts it up.  She 
           starts for the house.

                                 JULIA
                        You’re not bringing it in the 
                        house!

                                 ZOEY
                        Just to the back porch then.  I’ll 
                        try to stop the bleeding.  If you 
                        leave it here it’s gonna attract a 
                        coyote or something way worse.

           Julia doesn’t look happy but she gives in.

                                 JULIA
                        Be careful.  Don’t touch it with 
                        your bare hands.  Don’t touch 
                        anywhere near its mouth.  

           Zoey carries the opossum to the screened in back porch.  

           Julia remains in the yard, looking around, as if noticing for 
           the first time how shabby and overgrown it’s become.  
           INT. FARMHOUSE, ATTIC - DAY 

           Julia searches through a box of stuff in the corner of the 
           attic.  

           She quickly finds what she’s looking for -- her grandmother’s 
           old address book.  She grabs it, but before turning away she 
           notices something behind the box.

           The edges of the hardwood floorboards look ragged, nibbled 
           on.  More than that, they look blackened, as if scorched by a 
           fire.  

           Julia stares at the scorch marks for a moment, puzzled, 
           before shrugging it off and turning to the address book.  She 
           flips through it, searching for a name.

           INT. FARMHOUSE, BACK PORCH - DAY 

           Zoey has pressed a few bandages to the opossum's bloody 
           haunch. 

           Outside, we hear the sound of a TRUCK, puttering toward the 
           house.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY 

           Julia stands in front of the house and waves to HENRY DANJOU, 
           late 40s, as he hops out of his truck.

                                 HENRY
                        Hey there, shorty!  It’s been a 
                        minute, hasn’t it!

           Julia crosses the driveway to pull Henry into a hug.  They’re 
           old friends, comfortable with each other. 

                                 JULIA
                        I should have called you sooner.

                                 HENRY
                        I’m just relieved you don’t hold a 
                        grudge.  Your grandparents never 
                        forgave me for leaving them high 
                        and dry.

                                 JULIA
                        That’s not how it went down.  Was 
                        it?

           Henry shrugs looking guilty.  
                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        Well, I sure could use your help 
                        now.  

           Julia leads him inside.

           INT. FARMHOUSE, BACK PORCH - DAY 

           Julia and Henry step onto the back porch, where Zoey is still 
           tending to the opossum.

                                 JULIA
                        Hey, Zoey.  This is my friend 
                        Henry.  He used to work for our 
                        family.  Helping around the farm.

                                 ZOEY
                             (uninterested)
                        Oh.

           Julia gives Henry an apologetic look -- ‘kids.’  They walk 
           through the porch to the backyard.

           EXT. BACK YARD - DAY 

           Julia and Henry stride to the edge of the yard.

                                 HENRY
                        What’s with the opossum?

                                 JULIA
                        She thinks she can nurse it. 
                             (beat)
                        Amy was like that.  I remember once 
                        a sparrow flew into the house.  Amy 
                        tried to help it. She was always 
                        looking out for lost causes. She 
                        was so upset when it died.

                                 HENRY
                        There’s not much you can do when 
                        that happens.  It’s either okay, 
                        ready to fly off in a minute or 
                        two, or... 

           He shrugs. They scan the overgrown yard.

                                 JULIA
                        I figured I’d start here.  Clear 
                        out the weeds.  At least give the 
                        kid a nice yard to play in.
                                 HENRY
                        At her age?  She’s probably more 
                        concerned about getting good cell 
                        service so her texts go through.

           Julia looks embarrassed.  He’s right, of course.

                                 JULIA
                        I guess I don’t know much about 
                        kids.

           Henry sees she feels bad, tries to remedy it.

                                 HENRY
                        It’s good of you.  To want to make 
                        things nice for her.

           Henry wipes the sweat off his brow with a handkerchief. 

                                 JULIA
                             (noticing how hot it is)
                        Sorry!  Let me get you a cold 
                        drink.

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah, and while you’re doing that, 
                        I’ll see what I got in the back of 
                        my truck.  I could take care of 
                        this pretty quick, I think.

           Henry bounds off around the house.

           INT. FARMHOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY 

           Julia stirs sugar into some cold tea.  She searches the 
           freezer for a half filled ice cube tray.  

           After retrieving the tray, she glances outside to see Henry 
           in the backyard.  He’s wielding some kind of FLAMETHROWER 
           hooked up to a small propane tank.  He’s passing the flame 
           over the weedy parts of the yard.

           EXT. BACK YARD - DAY 

           Julia exits the house.

                                 JULIA
                        Well shit, Henry.  This seems a 
                        little extreme.

           Henry grins and points at the flame thrower.
                                 HENRY
                        Eco-conscious.  Best chemical-free 
                        way to get your weed problem under 
                        control.  Zap ‘em with heat, and 
                        they wither away.  Shouldn’t take 
                        more than an hour to do the whole 
                        yard.

                                 JULIA
                        Great!  So we can finish up here 
                        today, and then maybe tomorrow do a 
                        few repairs inside.  I can’t afford 
                        you for more than a week, but-

           Henry turns off the propane and shuffles a bit, awkwardly.

                                 HENRY
                        Julia-  The thing is, I’m happy to 
                        help for today.  No charge.  But 
                        you know, my wife really doesn’t 
                        want me coming out here.

                                 JULIA
                        What?  Why?  
                             (teasing)
                        She jealous?  She can’t blame 
                        fifteen year old me for crushing on 
                        you, Henry.  I was young and you 
                        spent most of your time shirtless 
                        back then. 

                                 HENRY
                             (embarrassed)
                        No!  It’s not that.
                             (beat)
                        She just doesn’t want me here.  
                        This place.  You know.

           Julia doesn’t know.  Henry searches for words to explain, but 
           they’re interrupted by a-- 

           PIERCING SCREAM.

           Zoey, on the porch, is screaming.

           Henry DROPS the flamethrower on the ground, and he and Julia 
           race to the porch.

           INT. FARMHOUSE, BACK PORCH - DAY 

           Julia jerks open the porch door.  As she does, the opossum 
           waddles out the door and disappears into a bush outside.  
           Zoey sits rigid on the porch floor.  She grips her left hand 
           with her right one.  She’s  still wearing the rubber dish 
           gloves.  She squeezes her index finger, and blood starts to 
           drip through a small tear in the glove. 

                                 ZOEY
                        It bit me!!

           Julia swallows an ‘I told you so’ response.

                                 JULIA
                        To the car.  Now.  Come on.

           Julia hurries Zoey through the house.

           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           Julia and Zoey sit in the office of a country DOCTOR, 50s, 
           friendly but with an irksomely patronizing smile.

           He applies disinfectant to Zoey’s finger.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Opossum bite?  They’re not pets.  
                        You do know that right?  Wild 
                        animals tend to act like wild 
                        animals. 

                                 ZOEY
                        It needed help. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        Maybe from now on, leave the animal 
                        tending to the veterinarian, and 
                        save your good deeds for the church 
                        youth group.  You might even get a 
                        thank you for your trouble instead 
                        of a bloody stump.

           The Doctor bends his knuckle in a way that makes it look like 
           his index finger has been bitten off, and he waves his hand 
           in Zoey’s face.

                                 ZOEY
                        It didn’t bite my finger off.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Maybe not this time.  The next one 
                        might not be so gentle. 

                                 JULIA
                        She doesn’t need stitches?
                                 DOCTOR
                        No, I’d say you just need to watch 
                        for signs of infection.  And keep 
                        her away from the critters, Julia, 
                        I’m surprised you didn’t know 
                        better.

           This mild reproach seems to hit Julia hard, despite the 
           Doctor’s light tone.

                                 JULIA
                        Besides infection what else should 
                        I be worried about? Rabies? Lyme 
                        disease?

                                 ZOEY
                        That’s from ticks.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Probably nothing. If you see the 
                        opossum again, call animal control.  
                        They’ll catch it, kill it, and test 
                        it for anything nasty. But chances 
                        are, you have nothing to worry 
                        about.

           The Doctor pats Julia on the back and leaves.

           INT. JULIA’S CAR - DAY 

           Both Julia and Zoey seem tense and Julia pulls into the long 
           drive of the farmhouse.

                                 JULIA
                        If this is going to work, you’ve 
                        got to respect me.  I know I’m not 
                        your mom or dad.  But I’m the adult 
                        here.  And you have to trust that 
                        I’m making decisions to keep you 
                        safe.  Okay?

                                 ZOEY
                        Fine.

                                 JULIA
                        So next time I tell you that 
                        something’s a bad idea, you’ll 
                        listen?

                                 ZOEY
                        I can do that.

           Julia looks relieved. 
           INT. FARMHOUSE, ENTRYWAY - DAY 

           The pair return home, and Zoey starts up the stairs.  

                                 JULIA
                        I noticed you hadn’t unpacked.  

           Zoey pauses.

                                 ZOEY
                        Not yet.

                                 JULIA
                        Maybe you should.

           Zoey nods and continues up the stairs.  

           Julia starts to follow Zoey upstairs when--

           CRASH

           Julia and Zoey freeze, hearing a crash from the kitchen.  
           They exchange a look, then hurry down the steps to see what’s 
           going on.

           INT. FARMHOUSE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 

           Julia and Zoey race into the kitchen.

           They find the kitchen floor littered with broken dishes from 
           breakfast.  The dishes appear to have slid right off the 
           table because--

           The table now stands at a slant.

           Julia peers under the table and sees that the floor beneath 
           is warped.  Several of the floorboards push up in a strange 
           bulge.  The boards also look eaten away at the edges.  Some 
           of the boards are blackened as if they’ve been scorched.

                                 JULIA
                        What the hell?

           Julia pushes the table off of the warped part of the floor.

           She circles the bulging floor boards, trying to figure out 
           what would cause this damage.  As she paces, her foot comes 
           down on something sharp.

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        OW!!
           Julia leaps back and grabs her foot.  She inspects the bottom 
           of her shoe and finds a puncture mark through the sole.

           She quickly drops onto one of the kitchen chairs and removes 
           her socks and shoes.  

           The puncture mark has pierced through her shoe, all the way 
           to the bottom of her foot.  A dot of blood beads at the 
           puncture mark.

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        Fuck!!

           Julia stares at the floor, searching for the loose nail or 
           screw that must have pierced her foot.

           She finds the sharp object, but it’s not an old nail.

           Julia kneels on the floor, inspecting the thing.

           It looks like a tiny plant growing up through the crack 
           between two floorboards.  Not like a green shoot or blade of 
           grass, but something tougher, like a root from some tuberous 
           plant, about the size of Julia’s pinkie finger.

           Julia pokes at the root and finds it stiff, inflexible. She 
           pulls at it, but can’t grasp it well enough to loosen it.

           Julia, upset, stalks out of the room.

                                 ZOEY
                        Where are you going?

           Zoey stares uncertainly after Julia, who returns moments 
           later carrying a crowbar.  She starts pulling up floorboards 
           one by one, casting them aside.

           Soon, a gap in the floor reveals what is causing the bulging 
           underneath.

           A system of tentacle like tree roots, pale, ash-colored, rise 
           out of the dirt in the crawl space below.  They’ve grown tall 
           enough to push at the kitchen floorboards from underneath, 
           causing the bulge.

                                 JULIA
                        What the hell is going on here?

                                 ZOEY
                        Are they... part of a tree?

           Julia grabs hold of a root, then recoils, grimacing.
                                 ZOEY (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 JULIA
                        It feels warm.

           Julia looks incredibly unsettled as she stares down into the 
           crawl space.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY 

           Julia watches as a foundation inspector, MIKE backs out from 
           under the crawl space.

                                 MIKE
                        You’re right that it’s a problem.  
                        With tree roots under the house you 
                        get cracks in the foundation, they 
                        draw water, you get mold, decay... 
                        We gotta figure this out.

                                 JULIA
                        But how did this happen?  
                        Everything was fine a week ago, 
                        today there’s suddenly roots in my 
                        kitchen.

                                 MIKE
                        Could be a sudden shift in soil 
                        upended everything.  Maybe the 
                        rains last week.  Maybe even a 
                        little earthquake, we get them from 
                        time to time.  Look, I’ll give you 
                        a quote, but it’s not going to be 
                        cheap.  

           Julia looks grim. 

           INT. FARMHOUSE, ENTRYWAY - DAY 

           Julia sits on the bottom of the stairs, phone pressed to her 
           ear.  Her credit card dangles from her fingers.  She listens 
           to the hold music until-- 

                                 CUSTOMER SERVICE REP (V.O.)
                        Hi, how can I help you?

                                 JULIA
                        Hi.  I wanted to talk to someone 
                        about increasing my line of credit.

           She listens for a moment, doesn’t seem particularly hopeful. 
           INT. FARMHOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY 

           Julia kneels over the hole she made in her kitchen floor.  
           She uses a thick roll of masking tape to tape a piece of tarp 
           over the hole.  

           She stands back to admire the job.

           Zoey appears in the doorway to watch her.  

                                 JULIA
                        I think we’re just going to have to 
                        live with this.  For a little 
                        while.  At least until my credit 
                        score goes up.  

           Julia slides the kitchen table over so that it covers the 
           hole.   

           INT. FARMHOUSE, SMALL BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           Julia and Zoey unpack Zoey’s things.

           Julia hangs the last of Zoey’s shirts in the closet.  Zoey 
           arranges a few personal items on her nightstand to make the 
           room feel more like hers -- a family photograph, a few 
           collectible figurines, a jewelry box, etc.

           Among these items, Zoey spots the “best friends” locket Julia 
           gave her.  She pauses over it, then takes it and fastens it 
           around her neck.  

                                 JULIA
                        Ready for bed?

                                 ZOEY
                        I’m going to read for a bit first.

           Zoey climbs in bed with a book but doesn’t open it.  Instead, 
           she stares at the ceiling.

                                 JULIA
                        Good night.

           Zoey’s face crumples, on the verge of tears.  There’s a flash 
           of something else, too: panic. Julia hesitates at the door.

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        Zoey?

           Zoey quickly wipes the tears from her face and sits up with a 
           sudden urgency. 
                                 ZOEY
                        What was my mom like when she was 
                        my age?

           Julia sits on the edge of the bed.

                                 JULIA
                        Um.  Pretty much the opposite of 
                        me.  But that was a good thing.  
                        She was willing to try anything.  
                        She was always convincing me to do 
                        stuff I never would have done 
                        otherwise.  

           Zoey raises an eyebrow.

                                 ZOEY
                        School says peer pressure leads to 
                        things like smoking and risky sex.

                                 JULIA
                        Ha ha.  I’m talking about fun, kid 
                        stuff.  Like we’d sneak out in the 
                        middle of the night, ride our bikes 
                        twenty miles, and hop the fence at 
                        the county fairgrounds after hours.  
                        Or ride out to the bluffs over the 
                        lake.   

                                 ZOEY
                        That sounds more creepy than fun.

                                 JULIA
                        It would have been, if I were 
                        alone.  But your mom always had 
                        this attitude like she knew 
                        everything would be okay, so I 
                        believed her.

                                 ZOEY
                        I wish I could have seen her like 
                        that. 

                                 JULIA
                        She grew up to become such a strong 
                        person.  You should be proud of who 
                        she is.

                                 ZOEY
                        I know.  But I was so little when 
                        she got sick.  I don’t remember her 
                        being anything but sick.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 ZOEY (CONT'D)
                        Maybe that’s why she picked you for 
                        me to stay with.  You knew her the 
                        best, when she was healthy and... 
                        (alive) 

                                 JULIA
                        Yeah.

                                 ZOEY
                        You loved her right?

                                 JULIA
                        Of course!  I still love her.

           Zoey looks relieved.

                                 ZOEY
                        Okay.

           Julia looks overwhelmed.  She seems like she wants to hug 
           Zoey, but stops herself; they’re not quite there yet.

                                 JULIA
                        Good night.

           Julia pats Zoey’s leg and slips off the bed.  

           INT. FARMHOUSE, UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - NIGHT 

           Julia looks like she’s fighting back tears as she brushes her 
           teeth.  She tosses her toothbrush on the counter and stares 
           at herself in the mirror.  

           When she turns off the faucet, she becomes aware of 
           something.  A sound--

           tap tap tap

           Julia glances over to the window.  Outside there is only 
           black.  Again, Julia hears-- 

           tap tap tap

           --and realizes it’s not coming from the window, but the 
           mirror.

           Something is tapping from behind the mirror -- from the other 
           side.

           Julia drifts toward the sound, moves her ear close.

           The tapping sound slows down.
           tap

           tap

           Julia stares at the mirror, perplexed when,

           THUMP

           Julia jerks back at the sound of something slamming full 
           force into the wall behind the mirror. 

           The rattling wall causes the medicine cabinet to swing open.

           Julia races out of the bathroom and into--

           INT. FARMHOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 

           --the hall, where Julia turns directly into her bedroom. 

           INT. FARMHOUSE, JULIA’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 

           Julia stares at the shared wall between the bathroom and her 
           bedroom.  She sees nothing out of the ordinary on this side. 
           But before long she hears something--

           GNAWING

           --Over her head.

           Julia looks distressed, but it’s late, and she’s tired.  This 
           is going to have to be a problem for another day.  She crawls 
           into bed.

           INT. FARMHOUSE, SMALL BEDROOM - NIGHT - [DREAM]

           5-year-old JULIA is fast asleep, in the small bedroom. Until--

           A low MOAN

           --wakes 5-year-old Julia up. 

           5-year-old Julia looks at the bedroom door.  The door is 
           open, just a crack.  The moaning sound continues.  It’s 
           coming from across the hall. 

           She gets out of bed, creeps to the door, crosses the hall, 
           and walks into--
           INT. FARMHOUSE, SICK ROOM - NIGHT - [DREAM]

           5-year-old Julia stares wide eyed at the Old Man lying in the 
           sick room bed.  

           The Old Man is moaning.

           5-year-old Julia is more concerned than scared.  Maybe the 
           Old Man needs help.  

                                 5-YEAR-OLD JULIA
                        What is it?

           The Old Man keens.  Julia creeps forward, toward the bed.

           Between the moans, the Old Man’s breath comes out in rattling 
           gasps.  Tears leak from his eyes.  They soak the Old Man’s 
           pillow and wet the tufts of hair around the base of his 
           skull.

           Julia is beginning to feel scared now.

                                 5-YEAR-OLD JULIA (CONT’D)
                        I’ll get help.

           But the Old Man’s arm shoots out and grips 5-Year-Old Julia’s 
           wrist.  She freezes, paralyzed in terror.

                                 OLD MAN
                        How?

           Guttural noises escape the Old Man’s throat as he tries to 
           articulate some urgent message.

                                 OLD MAN (CONT’D)
                        How will it eat me?

           5-year-old Julia can’t scream, but she whimpers, quietly.

                                 OLD MAN (CONT’D)
                        How much of me will it feast on?  
                        How much of me will become its 
                        shit?

           The Old Man’s face moves very close to 5-year-old Julia’s, 
           and now, she can finally let out a scream.  She screams as 
           loud as she can, but the Old Man doesn’t let go.

           5-year old Julia keeps screaming.  She wrenches her arm away.

           And then--
           INT. FARMHOUSE, JULIA’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Julia wakes up with a gasp.  She bolts out of bed and runs 
           out of the room.

           INT. FARMHOUSE, SICK ROOM - DAY 

           Julia peers into the sick room, where the Old Man once slept, 
           long ago.  It is empty.  Julia catches her breath, trying to 
           shake her dream/memory free.  Then she backs out of the room.

           INT. FARMHOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY 

           Julia enters the kitchen to find Zoey.  The girl sits on the 
           kitchen counter, messing with an old radio somebody installed 
           in the kitchen wall decades ago.

                                 ZOEY
                        Why does anyone still listen to the 
                        radio when you can just stream 
                        music?

           Julia listens to an annoying RADIO ANNOUNCER rambling a 
           stream of catchphrases and sound effects.

                                 JULIA
                        But then you don’t get the 
                        commentary.

           A song plays -- some hit pop song from some late 80s/early 
           90s band, like NKOB.

           Julia gasps in delight. 

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        Oh my God.  Your mom and I called 
                        the local radio station 47 times 
                        one summer trying to get them to 
                        play this song.  The stupid DJ was 
                        on some kind of power trip.  He 
                        always said no.  

           Julia grins at the memory.

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        That’s one thing radio has.  You 
                        don’t get to call in song requests 
                        to an app. 
                                 ZOEY
                        Yeah, you get to listen to the 
                        songs you pick yourself whenever 
                        you want.

                                 JULIA
                        But then it doesn’t feel like you 
                        earned it.

           Julia starts dancing around the kitchen, singing along.

                                 ZOEY
                        Oh.  No.

                                 JULIA
                        Come on.  I’m rusty, but I-

           Julia stops mid twirl and shrieks as a rat pokes its head out 
           from behind a cannister of flour on the counter.

           Julia jumps back and runs into Zoey, who yelps.  

           They watch as the rat scurries across the counter and 
           disappears behind the refrigerator.

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        Jesus.  I knew I heard those 
                        fuckers in the walls.

                                 ZOEY
                             (piously)
                        Language.

           Julia looks at her -- is she for real?  But then Zoey breaks 
           and starts giggling.  

           INT. COUNTRY STORE AND SERVICE STATION - DAY

           Julia and Zoey enter the country store.

                                 JULIA
                        Just pick out whatever you like.  
                        Do you know how to cook?

                                 ZOEY
                        No.

                                 JULIA
                        Pick stuff you can microwave.

           Zoey wanders off.  
           Julia moves a few aisles over and finds rat traps.  She 
           starts grabbing an armload.

           Julia and Zoey meet at the checkout counter.  The CLERK eyes 
           the rat traps.

                                 CLERK
                        What you need is a cat. 

                                 ZOEY
                        I can’t have a cat.  My dog 
                        annihilates cats.

                                 CLERK
                        Then maybe he could take care of 
                        your rat problem, too.

                                 JULIA
                        I’m thinking the rats might be 
                        operating with a bit more brain 
                        power than this particular dog.

           Zoey looks thoughtful. 

                                 ZOEY
                        Nah, he’s not dumb.  I think he’d 
                        just rather be an agent of chaos 
                        than a problem solver.

           Julia grins at Zoey, thinking that maybe they’re starting get 
           along.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Julia and Zoey unload the bags from the car. 

           As Julia carries them to the porch, she pauses for a moment 
           to stare up at the house. 

           She notices clumps of an ugly clinging plant, something like 
           a grayish Spanish moss, climbing the exterior walls. Some of 
           it even worms up through the porch floorboards and encircles 
           the frame of the front door. 

           Julia shifts the bag to one arm and reaches out to scrape the 
           moss away before entering the house.

           INT. FARMHOUSE, ENTRYWAY - DAY

           As Julia and Zoey bring their bags inside, they hear a RING 
           from Julia’s phone.
           Julia checks the screen.  

                                 JULIA
                        It’s your dad.

           Zoey drops the bags and tenses up.  Zoey and Julia stare at 
           each other for a moment, wondering: bad news?

           Julia answers the phone, apprehensive.

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        Hello?  Yes?
                             (relieved)
                        Yes.  We’re adjusting.

           The change in Julia’s voice signals that everything is okay.  
           Zoey relaxes.

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        She’s right here.

           Julia hands the phone to Zoey.

                                 ZOEY
                        Hi, dad.  Yeah.  Okay, I guess.  
                        How’s mom?

           Julia grabs the bags and leaves to give them privacy.

           INT. FARMHOUSE, ATTIC - DAY 

           Julia starts laying rat traps down everywhere, all around the 
           attic.  

           As she kneels, she hears again --

           tap tap tap

           --but when she whips around she sees that this time it’s just 
           the scratch of a tree branch against the attic window.

           She turns back to the rat traps and sets the last one down.

           She places it next to a dusty box in the corner. The box is 
           filled with old papers and photographs. One of the 
           photographs on top of the pile catches Julia’s eye.

           It’s a pale snapshot of Julia’s grandparents standing with 
           Julia at age 5 in front of the farmhouse. 

           Julia lifts the box flaps to see what else is inside.
           INT. FARMHOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

           Julia carries the box into the kitchen, where Zoey waits for 
           her.

           Zoey hands back Julia’s phone.

                                 JULIA
                        How’s your dad?  Did you guys have 
                        a good talk?

                                 ZOEY
                        It was short.  He was preoccupied.  
                        He usually is.

                                 JULIA
                        Did you talk to your mom?

                                 ZOEY
                        She was kind of out of it. 

           Zoey stares at the box.

                                 ZOEY (CONT’D)
                        What’s that?

                                 JULIA
                        Just old family stuff. I thought it 
                        might be cool to look through. Less 
                        creepy than the cemetery.  Want to 
                        check it out?

                                 ZOEY
                        Maybe later.

           Zoey shuffles out.

           INT. FARMHOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

           Zoey makes her way to her room, but as she passes the 
           bathroom she stops.

           A MIDDLE AGED MAN stands in the bathroom flanked by two PRE-
           TEEN BOYS. All three are dressed in black suits; but the 
           style dates back at least a hundred and fifty years. 

           They face the door, staring straight ahead. They look right 
           through Zoey without seeming to see her.

           Zoey gasps, reaches out to grab the bathroom door knob and 
           pulls the door closed. 

           She blinks in disbelief, then opens the door again.
           The bathroom is empty.

           Zoey slowly backs away from the bathroom. She steps into her 
           room and firmly shuts the door. 

           INT. FARMHOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

           Julia sits at the kitchen table, spreading the contents of 
           the box in front of her. 

           She smiles at a picture of herself and Amy as teenagers, arms 
           wrapped around each other, mugging for the camera.

           Other pictures show Amy as a child. In some of these 
           pictures, Amy looks frail and thin. 

           In one picture, Amy lies in a hospital bed, celebrating her 
           birthday, surrounded by family -- but also tubes and I.V. 
           bags.

           Julia stares at the photo. She looks heartbroken.

                                 JULIA
                        Oh, Amy.

           She glances up at the ceiling, thinking of Zoey. Then she 
           tucks the photo of sick Amy at the bottom of the box. 

           As she does so, her hand grazes a stack of photographs bound 
           together with an elastic band. 

           The top photo is a blurry snapshot of the Old Man from 
           Julia’s dream. He sits in a rocker on the front porch of the 
           farmhouse, staring vacantly forward. 

           Underneath that is another photo of him, younger. And then 
           several more photographs of the man, progressively younger. 
           He looks tense and haunted in each of these photos. 

           At the bottom of the pile Julia finds a black and white photo 
           of him: the Young Man from the woods. This is the only photo 
           in which he looks completely at ease. He leans back in his 
           chair, his lip curled in a confident smile. 

           Julia compares this carefree photo with the anguished looking 
           man in others.

           After the last photograph, Julia spots several folded pieces 
           of paper. The first are a pair of newspaper clippings. Julia 
           unwraps them and holds one up.

           The headline reads: “Hero Rescues Fawn”
                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        “A young local staged a daring 
                        rescue yesterday, pulling a 
                        drowning fawn from Brinkman Creek.” 

           Julia grins. She looks at the picture under the headline, the 
           same Young Man, smiling next to a baby deer.

           Julia looks at the next newspaper clipping and her grin fades 
           away. 

           The picture accompanying the article shows the Young Man 
           sitting on the ground next to the tree. He looks shell-
           shocked.

           The headline reads: “Son Survives Brutal Family Slaying”

           Julia puts the news clippings down. She looks pityingly back 
           at the photograph of the Old Man.

           After the news clippings, Julia finds a small packet of 
           official-looking documents.

           At the top of the pile, she sees a notice from the draft 
           board dated November 10th, 1918.

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                             (reading)
                        “Notice to appear for physical 
                        examination.”

           Julia lifts the next paper it reads: “Notice of 
           Classification”

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                             (reading)
                        “...has been classified 1A, 
                        eligible for military service...”

           Julia picks up the final piece of paper. It reads 
           “Certificate of Exemption.” 

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                             (reading)
                        “...is exempted from the provisions 
                        of the Military Service Act...”

           Julia sets down the papers. She gazes out the window as she 
           ruminates on the past. While staring, she spots movement in 
           the corner of the yard.

           It’s the opossum. 

           Julia jumps from her chair. 
           She grabs a broom and a large canvas grocery bag and rushes 
           out the back door.

           EXT. BACK YARD - DAY

           Julia hurdles across the yard. She’s almost there.

                                 JULIA
                        I got you, you little rat.

           But the opossum scampers away, towards the woods.

           Julia follows it.

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Julia jogs through the brush, following the animal. Branches 
           scrape against her, but she ignores them.

           The opossum isn’t very fast, and she’s gaining on it.

           Finally, she corners it against a cluster of rocks and fallen 
           trees. 

           The opossum freezes, then rolls over -- playing dead.

           Julia raises the handle of the broom, as if to jab it, when--

           A NAKED MAN

           --steps out from behind a tree. 

           He stands at least ten feet tall.  His skin, white as a 
           sheet, is dry, ashy, mottled and rough, like an unpeeled 
           turnip.  

           Julia breaks out into a sweat, immediately.  She stares at 
           the naked man with dread.

           The naked man bends over, his spine cracking as it curves 
           into a bow.  At first it seems almost like he’s paying them a 
           polite curtesy.  And then something happens with his throat.  
           Horrible churning sounds escape his gaping mouth.  His jaw 
           seems to stretch, his lips bulge out.  

           Moments later, something comes up, out of his mouth.  He 
           regurgitates a set of bones, clean, white, and stripped of 
           all flesh.  
           The bones come from a human arm, hand, and fingers.  But with 
           skin and cartilage gone, nothing holds the bones together 
           anymore.  As they’re vomited from the man’s mouth, they 
           clatter to the ground in an untidy pile.  

           A piece of jewelry -- a gold WEDDING RING -- comes loose from 
           one of the smallest bones and rolls across the dirt, stopping 
           at Julia’s feet.

           The Boneeater straightens and grins at Julia.

           This seems to break Julia’s paralysis.

           She screams, wordlessly, turns, and runs.

           She flees through the woods.

           As the trees thin and the farmhouse comes into view, Julia 
           steals a look backwards, to see if the Boneeater is following 
           her. Her foot snags on a root and she pitches forward, 
           landing on the ground, hard. 

           Julia is stunned by the fall. She rolls onto her back, dizzy.

           QUICK FLASHES

           -- The brittle treehouse creaking as a sudden gust of wind 
           blows through the rotting old boards.

           -- A convulsing bird lying on the front porch

           -- A hissing opossum

           Then BLACK.

                                 ZOEY (V.O.)
                        Julia??

           Julia’s eyes flutter open.  She’s still lying on the ground.

                                 ZOEY (V.O.)
                        Are you okay??

           Julia seems disoriented.  She looks past Zoey to stare into 
           the woods, expecting to see the Boneeater closing in.

           But there’s nothing there.

                                 JULIA
                        Where did he go?

           Zoey looks worried. She helps Julia to her feet, and they 
           walk back to the Farmhouse.
           EXT. BACK YARD - DAY

           When they reach the back porch, Julia stops. Takes another 
           worried look at the woods.

                                 ZOEY
                        What are you looking for??

                                 JULIA
                        I don’t know. I’m seeing things. 

           Julia looks up at the porch. She notes more of that clinging 
           grayish moss edging up the walls. She shudders.

           They step onto the porch.

           INT. FARMHOUSE, JULIA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           Julia tries to sleep, but she’s restless.  She tosses and 
           turns.  

           She tries to take deep, relaxing breaths.  It seems to work, 
           but then she hears--

           --an explosion of BARKING downstairs.  

           Julia jumps, then grimaces.

                                 JULIA
                        That Goddamned dog. 

           Julia hops off the bed.

           INT. FARMHOUSE, SMALL BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           Zoey is also awake.  But she ignores Chito’s barking.  She 
           sits on her bed reading a book.  

           INT. FARMHOUSE, ENTRYWAY - NIGHT 

           Julia jumps down the last step to the entryway.  

           Chito’s barking stops, but he’s still growling, low and 
           menacing.

           Underneath the growling, Julia hears a second noise from the 
           kitchen.

           It’s low, but there--

           tap 
           tap

           tap

           -- against plastic tarp.

           Julia slows her pace, suddenly afraid.

           INT. FARMHOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT 

           Julia stands in the kitchen doorway, head cocked.  Chito 
           whines.  

           The slight tapping against plastic continues.

           Julia slowly grabs the edge of the kitchen table and pushes 
           it aside.

           She stares down at the tarp taped over the large hole in the 
           floor.

           For a second, there’s nothing.  Then--

           tap

           tap 

           PUNCH

           With a loud smack, the tarp is lifted up, as if a fist is 
           punching it from the other side.

           Julia screams and clutches the door frame. 

           She grabs a knife from a block on the counter, then strides 
           over to the tarp.  She rips the tape away and pulls the tarp 
           aside.

           Chito, suddenly, uncharacteristically, timid, shrinks back.

           Julia, brandishing the knife in front of her, peers into the 
           darkness of the whole.

           She sneaks a glance at Chito.

                                 JULIA
                             (angry)
                        If it’s that God damned opossum 
                        again, you better rip its throat 
                        out.
           But there is no sign of what could have made the noise.  Down 
           in the hole, she sees nothing but the tangle of pale tree 
           roots.

           Finally, she stands, ready to forget the tapping noise.  She 
           turns away, then--

           PLINK

           The sound of something small and metal, coin-sized, hitting 
           the kitchen floor -- something has been tossed from the hole 
           and is now rolling across the floorboards.

           Julia looks down to see the shiny object rolling towards her.  
           It comes to a stop at her feet -- A gold wedding ring.

           Julia staggers backwards, turns, and flees--

           INT. FARMHOUSE, ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS

           -across the entryway.  She flies up the stairs as if the 
           devil is chasing her.

           INT. FARMHOUSE, JULIA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           Julia runs sobbing into her room and slams the door behind 
           her.

           INT. FARMHOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Zoey comes out of her room and stands in the doorway.  She 
           peers down the hall.  She looks worried as she hears Julia’s 
           sobs.  She steps out of the room onto the stair’s landing and 
           glances down the stairs. 

           It’s dark.  There’s nothing to see.

           Just the THWAP sound of the tarp, being lifted by an 
           invisible draft, then settling back down to the floor.

           Zoey looks across the hall, into the darkness of ‘the sick 
           room.’  And from the darkness, she hears:

                                 OLD MAN (O.S.)
                        What have you done, little girl?

           Zoey gasps and runs back to her room, slamming the door shut. 
           INT. FARMHOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY 

           The next day.

           Julia stares straight ahead, focused on a photograph hanging 
           on the wall in front of her.

           INSERT - PHOTO

           Of Julia’s grandparents, GEORGE and HELEN.  The photo was 
           taken when they were in their sixties.  George holds Helen 
           close.  He looks like he’s about to kiss her, and has his 
           hand on her cheek.  His wedding ring, catching the sunlight, 
           reflects a sparkling glare. 

           Julia backs away from the photograph.

           Behind her, in the kitchen, we hear the sound of a pounding 
           hammer.

           Julia looks down the hall and sees Henry at work, replacing 
           the boards on the kitchen floor. 

           EXT. FARMHOUSE, FRONT PORCH - DAY 

           Later, the floor repaired, Julia and Henry sit side by side 
           on the porch.  

                                 JULIA
                        Thank you for fixing the floor.  

                                 HENRY
                        Don’t worry about it.  

           Henry sighs and glances back at the kitchen. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        But you’re kind of paving over the 
                        problem there, Julia.  You want to 
                        do something about those roots 
                        under the house eventually.

           Julia waves the issue away -- roots under the house seems the 
           least of her worries.

                                 JULIA
                        But I appreciate you coming.  

                                 HENRY
                        No problem.
                                 JULIA
                             (abruptly)
                        Why did you quit?  You worked for 
                        my grandparents for years.  They 
                        were old.  You left when they 
                        needed you the most. 

                                 HENRY
                        I’m sorry. I worked here as long as 
                        I could stand it.  But my wife 
                        didn’t want me to keep coming here.

                                 JULIA
                        Why?

                                 HENRY
                        Come on, Julia.  You get that 
                        there’s something wrong, right?  
                        Like I’m not the kind of guy who... 
                        I mean ghosts and spirits aren’t my 
                        thing, but you feel something off, 
                        right??

                                 JULIA
                        My whole life has been off. I had 
                        nothing. No dad. Crazy mom. Nothing 
                        felt normal until I got here!  The 
                        only moments I ever felt safe were 
                        when I was living in this house.  
                        And then, finally, everything was 
                        perfect.

           Henry shakes his head.

                                 HENRY
                        Well maybe that’s why you don’t 
                        feel it then. You don’t want to see 
                        it. 

           He stands to leave, but Julia presses him.

                                 JULIA
                        Have you seen things?  Heard 
                        things?  That you can’t explain?

                                 HENRY
                        No. I just feel it.  There’s 
                        something here.  Your grandparents 
                        were like you. They were happy 
                        here. And maybe that kept them 
                        safe.  Because I think that 
                        acknowledging it makes you 
                        vulnerable. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HENRY (CONT'D)
                        When it knows you’ve seen it, and 
                        when it has its sights on you, it’s 
                        dangerous.  And that’s why I’d like 
                        to get the hell out of here, if you 
                        don’t mind.  

           Henry strides down the porch, down the drive to his truck.  

           Julia watches him go, frustrated.

           She hears music coming from inside the house; Zoey in there, 
           playing some teen pop song.

           INT. FARMHOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

           Julia enters the kitchen, where Zoey stands by the counter, 
           fiddling with the radio again.  

           Julia scans the room.  With the floor repaired, the kitchen 
           table has been pushed back into its normal spot.  

           Julia takes a seat at the table.

                                 JULIA
                        I’m not crazy.

           Zoey moves away from the radio and sits across from Julia. 
           She keeps an even expression as if there’s nothing unusual 
           about Julia’s pronouncement.

                                 ZOEY
                        That’s good to know.

                                 JULIA
                        Something is happening here. It’s 
                        crazy.  But I’m not.

                                 ZOEY
                        Okay?

                                 JULIA
                        Have you seen anything? Anything 
                        weird?  

                                 ZOEY
                        No.

           But Zoey looks scared.  And almost guilty.

                                 JULIA
                        You can tell me. 
           Zoey considers this. Then she turns to the box on the kitchen 
           table. She pulls out an old album. 

                                 ZOEY
                        I was looking through this before. 
                        While you were in the woods.

           She opens to the first page.

           She points to a sepia toned photograph and shows Julia a 
           family portrait.

                                 ZOEY (CONT’D)
                        I saw them. 

           Julia moves close to take a look. 

           The portrait shows the Middle-Aged-Man and two Pre-teen Boys 
           that Zoey saw in the bathroom. Next to them sits a MIDDLE-
           AGED-WOMAN holding a TODDLER.

                                 JULIA
                        This picture is from at least a 
                        hundred and fifty years ago. 

           Julia spots a date written in the corner.

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        1867. I think those are my great-
                        great-great-grandparents. You saw 
                        them?

                                 ZOEY
                        I didn’t see all of them. Just 
                        these three. 

           Zoey points to the man and boys. 

                                 ZOEY (CONT’D)
                        And they look different here.  They 
                        look... starving here.

           Julia studies the picture of the family. Zoey is right. In 
           this picture, the whole family looks gaunt, even the 
           children. Their cheeks are hollow. Their clothes hang off of 
           them. 

           Julia flips forward in the album. 

                                 JULIA
                        I guess they had a few rough years. 
                        The boys look better in this one.
           She stares down at a photograph of the two pre-teen boys, a 
           little older and now more full faced, playing with a rabbit.

           There is a scrawl of writing beneath the picture:

           “The boys, playing with a jackrabbit they rescued from a 
           snare”

           Julia turns the page again and finds a news clipping. 

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        Oh my God. Look. 

           Zoey scans the article, reading it out loud.

                                 ZOEY
                        “We are sad to learn of the tragedy 
                        that has befallen Andrew Mitchell. 
                        Mr. Mitchell and his two sons left 
                        the county last Thursday, to 
                        purchase an assortment of fruit 
                        trees from a seller in Rochester. 
                        The three took lodgings there that 
                        evening. When they returned to the 
                        house yesterday afternoon, Mr. 
                        Mitchell discovered that his wife 
                        and youngest child, a girl aged 2, 
                        were the victims of an inhuman act 
                        of cruelty. We do not know the 
                        identity of the cold-blooded 
                        murderer who has struck down our 
                        dear ones, but we pray that his 
                        savage barbarity will soon be met 
                        with justice.”

           Julia turns the page back to the family portrait.

                                 JULIA
                        So a man goes on a trip with his 
                        sons, and when they come home, his 
                        wife and daughter have been killed. 

           Julia reaches into the box and pulls out the news clipping 
           with the headline: “Son Survives Barbaric Family Slaying.”

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        Fifty years later, his grand-son, 
                        goes hunting in the woods, and when 
                        he comes home his whole family is 
                        slaughtered. So much death, all in 
                        this house. What does that mean? Is 
                        our family cursed?
                                 ZOEY
                        Everyone dies. That doesn’t make us 
                        cursed.

           They stare down at the family pictures.

                                 JULIA
                        Maybe we should leave.  

                                 ZOEY
                        You love this house.

                                 JULIA
                        I do. I did. But something is 
                        really wrong here. Don’t you feel 
                        it?

                                 ZOEY
                        I don’t think we should leave.

                                 JULIA
                        But I’m supposed to keep you safe.

                                 ZOEY
                        Nothing really bad has happened 
                        yet.  And if the house is 
                        possessed, there has to be 
                        something we can do about it.  Like 
                        the people on that show, Ghost 
                        Hunters.

           Julia looks thoughtful. 

           INT. FARMHOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Julia sits on the couch tying a bunch of sage leaves into a 
           bundle.

                                 JULIA
                        Burning sage is supposed to help 
                        with bad energy.   

           Zoey looks skeptical.

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        Can’t hurt, right?

           Julia places the sage bundle into a bowl.  She grabs a book 
           of matches from an end table.  She hands the matches to Zoey.  

                                 ZOEY
                             (lighting the sage)
                        Are we supposed to say something?
                                 JULIA
                        I don’t know.  Something like “hey 
                        ghosts, stay the fuck out of here?”

           Zoey looks amused.

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        Cleanse this space.  Negativity 
                        begone forever.

           Zoey stares into the bowl of smoking sage.  

                                 ZOEY
                        What else?

                                 JULIA
                        We could sprinkle some holy water.  
                        I think my grandmother kept some 
                        around.

           Zoey shrugs.  Repeats Julia’s words:

                                 ZOEY
                        Can’t hurt, right?

           Julia hurries upstairs to find the holy water.

           INT. FARMHOUSE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

           Julia heads for the bathroom, but stops. The Middle-Aged-Man 
           stands at the end of the hall. He’s cradling a small TODDLER 
           to his chest. His suit is covered in blood. Two Pre-Teen boys 
           stand by his side, their heads bowed in grief.

           Julia looks eyes with the Middle-Aged-Man.

                                 JULIA
                        We live here now. You don’t. You 
                        can leave, now. 

           Julia blinks and the hall is empty. The figures are gone.

           She lets out a breath. Could it be that simple? Maybe it 
           worked? She quickly turns into the bathroom. 

           INT. FARMHOUSE, UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - DAY

           Julia searches a cabinet in the upstairs bathroom.  She 
           reaches for a drawer in the vanity.  As she does, she 
           suddenly hears--

           tap
           tap

           tap

           Julia pauses.  Listens. 

           tap

           tap

           CRASH

           With a shower of glass, the mirror explodes, revealing a 
           gaping hole in the bathroom wall behind the glass.

           Julia screams and shields her face.

           From the hole in the wall, a network of rootlike branches 
           unfold.  But the branches don’t resemble wood; they seem to 
           have a spongy texture, almost like the tentacles of a squid.  

           The roots reach for Julia.  Some of them are fringed with 
           tiny teeth-like ridges that cut at walls around them, making 
           a grinding sound, like the GNAWING that Julia has been 
           hearing.   

           Julia screams again, and scrambles backwards into the 
           bathtub.

           The branches claw outwards and wrap themselves around Julia’s 
           forearms.  Julia tries to rip herself away, and manages to 
           break one of the smaller branches off the root.  A spray of 
           viscous red liquid gushes from the stump.  The branches’ grip 
           on Julia’s arms loosen.  

           Julia wrenches herself free and pulls herself out of the tub.  
           She starts for the bathroom door, but the door--

           SWINGS OPEN 

           --right before Julia can reach it.  

           Zoey stands in the doorway.  

           The girl gapes at the scene for a moment, then she flees down 
           the hall without a word.

           Julia tries to follow Zoey, but the roots grab hold of her 
           and pull her back.  They wrap around her neck.

           Julia struggles but can’t disengage them. She starts to 
           sputter and choke.  Her eyes flutter.  Her breathing slows 
           down.  Her face starts to turn purple.  She’s about to pass 
           out.
           But then, Zoey returns.  

           The girl holds a cleaver in her hand.  She wields it 
           maniacally; starts hacking at the roots.

           More red liquid spills from the roots’ wounds as the branches 
           withdraw and whither.  

           A branch tangles itself into Zoey’s hair.

                                 ZOEY
                        No!

           Zoey drives the cleaver into the center of the thickest trunk 
           of the root system.  A final spurt of the dark liquid floods 
           out of the roots, which begin to retreat, back into the 
           walls.

           Zoey and Julia stumble out of the bathroom, covered in slick 
           red goo.

           INT. FARMHOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS - NOW

           Julia slams the bathroom door behind her before collapsing on 
           the floor.

                                 ZOEY
                        I don’t think the sage worked.

           Julia lets out a raspy, almost hysterical laugh.  She gets up 
           and stumbles toward the stairs.

           INT. FARMHOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY 

           Julia and Zoey race into the kitchen. 

           Julia pulls her purse from a hook on the wall.  She spots her 
           phone on the table and snatches it.  She grabs a dish towel 
           from the kitchen counter and tosses it at Zoey.

                                 JULIA
                        Get cleaned up.  Then I’m calling 
                        your parents.  I have to tell them 
                        you can’t stay.

                                 ZOEY
                        You can’t.  They have enough to 
                        worry about.

                                 JULIA
                        They’ll be more than worried if I 
                        get you killed.
           With a sudden flash of anger, Zoey moves away from Julia.

                                 ZOEY
                        I’m fine.  It wasn’t coming after 
                        me.  It-

           Zoey suddenly gasps and clutches her hand.  The hand is still 
           bandaged, from the opossum bite.

                                 JULIA
                        What is it?

           Zoey shakes her head, but she looks unwell.  She rapidly 
           turns a grayish, sallow color.  Her eyes look feverish.

           She clutches her hand tighter, draws it in to her chest.

                                 ZOEY
                        Ow!

                                 JULIA
                        Let me see!

           Julia pries Zoey’s hand out of her own tight grip.  She pulls 
           at the bandages, ripping them away.

           Beneath the bandages, the bite mark on Zoey’s finger has 
           reopened. It oozes fresh blood.  The rest of Zoey’s finger is 
           rapidly darkening, turning purple.  Blue and red veiny lines 
           emanate from the bite mark.  They travel up Zoey’s arm -- 
           Julia can actually see them creeping, further and further up. 

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        Oh my God.  Jesus.  Come... 

           Julia grabs Zoey by the shoulders and pushes her out of the 
           kitchen.

           INT. FARMHOUSE, ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS 

           Zoey stumbles to her knees as they head for the front door, 
           but Julia helps her up and practically drags her out the 
           front door.

           INT. JULIA’S CAR - DAY 

           Julia drives like a bat out of hell.  She glances at the 
           rearview mirror to check on Zoey, sitting in the back seat.

           Zoey groans of pain grow louder.  Soon they become screams of 
           agony.
           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 

           The Doctor, less congenial now, examines Zoey’s hand.  A 
           NURSE hovers over the bed, taking vitals.

                                 DOCTOR
                             (angry, sarcastic)
                        Typically we’d want you to bring 
                        her in before she reaches the point 
                        of sepsis.

                                 JULIA
                        I didn’t know.  I had no idea it 
                        had gotten this bad.

                                 ZOEY
                             (through the pain)
                        It wasn’t like this before.  

                                 JULIA
                        It’s true.  She seemed fine until 
                        twenty minutes ago.  

                                 DOCTOR
                             (to the Nurse)
                        Tell the lab to hurry on those 
                        blood cultures.  I want to start 
                        her on  50 mgs of Flucloxacillin 
                        right away.  

           The Nurse nods. Julia watches them work, her face frozen in 
           fear and guilt.

           INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - DAY 

           Julia sits in a small hospital waiting room.

           She takes out her phone with a grim expression, then dials. 

                                 JULIA
                        Hey, Jason.  Something happened.  
                        You need to come get Zoey.  She 
                        can’t stay with me anymore.  I’m 
                        sorry.  

           She looks defeated as she listens to Jason’s response.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 

           Julia watches Zoey sleep in the hospital bed from the 
           doorway.  In a-- 
           BRIEF FLASH

           --Julia sees a vision of Zoey’s mother Amy, dying in a 
           hospital bed in a living room miles away.

           She puts the vision out of her head and returns her thoughts 
           to--  

           THE HOSPITAL ROOM

           --where Zoey wakes up. 

                                 JULIA
                        I called your dad.  Your parents 
                        are coming to take you home. 
                        They’ll be here tomorrow.

                                 ZOEY
                        My mom can’t travel.

                                 JULIA
                        She wanted to come see you.  Your 
                        dad said she was pretty insistent. 
                        There was no point in arguing with 
                        her.  Cheer up.  This is what you 
                        wanted.  To be with her. 

                                 ZOEY
                        I didn’t want it to be like this.  
                        I can’t leave yet!

                                 JULIA
                        Come on.  I know you don’t like me 
                        that much.

                                 ZOEY
                        But what are you going to do?  Are 
                        you going back home?

                                 JULIA
                        No.  I’ll find a hotel somewhere.

           Zoey starts trembling, shaking her head.

                                 ZOEY
                        She’ll die.  She’ll die and I’ll 
                        die.

                                 JULIA
                        What?

           Zoey becomes hysterical.  
                                 ZOEY
                        She’ll die!  And I’ll die!  

                                 JULIA
                        Slow down.  Talk to me.

                                 ZOEY
                        I agreed!  

                                 JULIA
                        Agreed to what?

                                 ZOEY
                        I’m sorry.  I did it. I didn’t 
                        believe it was true, until I saw 
                        him in the tree house.  And even 
                        then, I thought it was a dream.  
                        Until the opossum-

                                 JULIA
                        Zoey, what did you agree to??

                                 ZOEY
                        I didn’t want her to die! He said 
                        she would live, if I agreed--

           The Doctor strides in. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        Whoa, settle down.  This isn’t what 
                        we want.  What did you say to her, 
                        Julia?

                                 JULIA
                        Nothing, I just told her that her 
                        parents were coming!

                                 DOCTOR
                        Nurse-

           The nurse strides in with a sedative.  She administers it to 
           Zoey, who sobs uncontrollably.  

                                 JULIA
                        Zoey!

                                 DOCTOR
                        Why don’t we let her calm down.

                                 JULIA
                        Zoey!  Agreed to what??

                                 DOCTOR
                        Julia!
           Julia stops.  Steadies herself. 

           The sedative starts to take affect, and Zoey’s sobs quiet 
           down.  She goes limp in the hospital bed.  

                                 JULIA
                        I’ll let you rest.  I’ll be back 
                        later.

           Julia backs out of the room.

           INT. JULIA’S CAR - NIGHT 

           Julia pulls up to the farmhouse.  

           She pauses before exiting the car, staring at the house, 
           taking everything in.

           The clinging moss has spread. It grows in thick clusters 
           around the first floor doors and windows, wraps around the 
           posts of the porch, and creeps its way up to the second 
           floor.

           It’s not just the moss enveloping the house that unnerves 
           Julia. Everything around the house -- the grass, the trees, 
           the shrubs -- seems to lean toward it. It’s as if nature is 
           closing in.

           Julia gets out of the car.

           INT. FARMHOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT 

           Julia searches the kitchen. The old box of family photos and 
           documents remains on the kitchen table.  

           Julia paws at the pictures.  Her eyes fall on a trio of 
           unfolded documents: notices from the War Department. Her 
           great-grandfather’s certificate of exemption. 

           Julia thinks aloud to herself.

                                 JULIA
                        Agreed to what?

           Julia trods across the freshly repaired floorboards, leaving 
           the kitchen.

           INT. FARMHOUSE, STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Julia heads up the stairs.
           She sees streaks of congealed red gunk on the steps.  She 
           ignores this and ascends to the second floor. 

           She pushes into her old bedroom, where Zoey is staying.  

           INT. FARMHOUSE, SMALL BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Julia searches the room, frantically, muttering to herself.  
           She looks for clues, desperate to learn what Zoey has done. 

           Julia looks through the closet.  She opens Zoey’s empty 
           suitcase.  There’s nothing here.

           Then, she remembers something.

           Julia opens the drawers of the nightstand and pulls out a 
           notebook: Amy’s journal.

           Behind Julia, the wall suddenly ripples and dimples, like the 
           house itself is warping.  Splinters of wood and plaster rain 
           down from the ceiling.

           Julia shrieks, clutches the journal to her chest, and runs 
           from the room.

           INT. FARMHOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Julia hurries down the hall, through the gunk seeping out 
           from under the bathroom door, and to the stairs.  

           When Julia is halfway down the steps, there’s a--

           KNOCK

           --at the front door.  

           INT. FARMHOUSE, ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS 

           Julia makes her way down the stairs and crosses the entryway.  
           She opens the front door.  She finds an empty porch -- a 
           breezy summer night.  Nothing more.  

           Julia closes the door and slowly backs away from it.

           The front door’s latch clicks.  The door slowly reopens with 
           a creak.  Julia backs away further.  She is so fucking 
           terrified.  

           A dark FIGURE stands in the door.  It steps forward.  

           As the Figure steps into the light, Julia sees it clearly.  
           It’s the Old Man, her great-grandfather, from the sick room.

           The Old Man is crying.  Wailing.  A horrible sound.  He 
           shuffles into the house, walking toward Julia.  Julia 
           freezes, pressing her back against the wall.  But the Old Man 
           just shuffles past her, like he doesn’t even see her.

           He makes his way down the hall until he reaches the kitchen.

           Julia listens to the Old Man in there, his cries getting 
           louder, more anguished.  She follows him into--

           INT. FARMHOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT 

           --the kitchen.  Here, she finds the Old Man standing in the 
           middle of the room.  

           All around the Old Man are bodies.  Six bodies in all.  Two 
           adults, a MAN and a WOMAN.  And four CHILDREN.  They’re 
           covered in blood, and worse, they’ve been mauled.  Eaten at.   

           The Old Man tears out his hair as he stands over the grisly 
           scene.  He screams louder and louder.

                                 OLD MAN
                        I’m sorry I did it.  I’m sorry I 
                        did it!  I’m sorry!  I’m sorry.

           Julia makes a croaking sound.  She can’t make a scream come 
           out.  She stumbles backwards, slips on the blood, and falls 
           to her knees.  The Old Man turns to her.

                                 OLD MAN (CONT’D)
                        It hasn’t finished eating.

           Julia crawls away, out of the kitchen, back to--

           INT. FARMHOUSE, ENTRYWAY - NIGHT 

           --the front hall.  The front door is still open.  She crawls 
           to it.  Before she gets there, she hears a scratching sound 
           behind her, nails sliding on hardwood floor.  She casts a 
           fearful look back and sees--

           Chito, moving toward her.  And behind him--

           The Old Man and the bodies are gone.  There’s no trace of the 
           bloody scene anywhere.  

           Julia releases a sob and hugs the dog to her.
           EXT. FARMHOUSE, FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

           Julia sits on the wooden boards of the porch, next to Chito. 
           She holds Amy’s journal to her chest. 

           Then, she opens the journal and stares down at a sentence:

           “today I met a demon.”

           Julia looks down at the dog.  Chito wags his tail -- a high 
           jumpy sort of wag.  He’s tense.

           Julia turns the page and sees that Amy has drawn a sketch of 
           a tall, lithe, grinning figure: the Boneeater from the woods. 

           Julia turns to the next page and sees that Amy filled the 
           entire page with writing. 

           Julia begins to read:

                                 JULIA
                        “Today I met a demon.”

           INT. TREE - DAY - 25 YEARS AGO

           TEENAGED AMY, about 14, sits at the base of the tree, reading 
           a book.

           TEENAGED JULIA, 14 stands a few paces away, tossing a 
           softball into the air.

                                 TEENAGE JULIA
                        You’re so moody.

                                 TEENAGE AMY
                        I’m just not ready for summer to be 
                        over.

                                 TEENAGE JULIA
                        Why? You actually like school. 

                                 TEENAGE AMY
                        It’s not just school. I have to go 
                        to the doctor’s. As soon as I get 
                        home. 

           Teenage Julia pauses throwing the ball.

                                 TEENAGE AMY (CONT’D)
                        I have to go in every four months. 
                        To see if the cancer came back.
                                 TEENAGE JULIA
                        It won’t. You beat it. 

                                 TEENAGE AMY
                        It might.

           Teenage Julia hurls the softball upwards. It lands with a 
           thud inside the treehouse.

                                 TEENAGE JULIA
                             (determined)
                        Stop.  It won’t.  Want a soda?

                                 TEENAGE AMY
                        No thanks.

           Teenage Julia saunters back to the house.

           But Teenage Amy stays. She turns back to her book. But a 
           moment later something from the tree falls and hits her face -
           - a half decayed piece of fruit. It leaves a red streak on 
           her cheek.

           Teenage Amy wipes off the streak, disgusted.

           She looks up. Another piece of fruit falls and lands with a 
           splat on her open book.

           Teenage Amy hears a whisper of a groan above her, coming from 
           the tree house.

                                 TEENAGE AMY (CONT’D)
                        Hello??

           No response.  

           Teenage Amy looks annoyed. She decides to investigate. She 
           begins to climb the tree.  

           INT. TREEHOUSE - DAY - 25 YEARS AGO

           Teenage Amy reaches the treehouse, looking ready to confront 
           someone. But nobody is there.

           Teenage Amy runs her hand along the old wooden boards.  She 
           examines the dust she’s collected on her fingers.

           She leans down, and grabs the softball, which had rolled into 
           the corner.

           Then, she makes a lap around the treehouse, exploring, until--

           --she run into--
           --the Boneeater.  The pale man from the roadside is climbing 
           out of the gash in the tree trunk, emerging from the 
           heartwood.  

           The Boneeater grins at her, revealing rows of gleaming white 
           shark-like teeth.

           Teenage Amy scream and backs away.  The Boneeater stands 
           between her and the door, the only escape route.

           The Boneeater inches towards her: pallid, grotesque, and 
           twice the size of a normal man.  He blinks his alien black 
           eyes at them, and inhales her scent.

           Teenage Amy hears its voice speaking to her, apparently 
           telepathically.

                                 BONEEATER
                        Do you treasure your flesh, 
                        daughter?  Shall I gorge now?

                                 TEENAGE AMY
                        Leave me alone!

                                 BONEEATER
                        There is more flesh in the house.  
                        I smell it.  I would like to gorge 
                        there.  Would you prefer that?  

           The Boneeater brings his face an inch from Teenage Amy’s.  
           She’s reached an almost catatonic level of terrified.

                                 TEENAGE AMY
                        Please...  Don’t hurt me. 

           The Boneeater flicks a skinny finger to Teenage Amy’s 
           forehead.  

                                 BONEEATER
                        There is so much pain ahead of you 
                        daughter.

           Teenage Amy sees--

           QUICK FLASHES

           --of herself, as an adult, sitting in a doctor’s office. 
           Breaking down into tears.

           --Pricked with needles. Facing Concerned-looking DOCTORS.

           --Dying in a hospital bed, set up in her living room.

           --and then she’s back in--
           THE TREEHOUSE

           Teenage Amy backs away from the Boneeater, even more 
           petrified now, by what she has seen.

                                 BONEEATER (CONT’D)
                        I could eat you now, that would 
                        spare you all that pain ahead.  
                        Or... I could take that pain away.  
                        It could be gone.  Instead, you 
                        could have--

           Teenage Amy sees a BRIEF FLASH--

           --of Adult Amy, with Zoey and Jason. Laughing at the dinner 
           table. Healthy. Happy. 

           Amy older, watching Zoey get married.

           Amy older, holding her first grandchild.

           And then she’s back in the--

           TREEHOUSE

           She’s started to cry.

                                 BONEEATER (CONT’D)
                        If you let me into the house, I’ll 
                        spare you.  I’ll save you.  I’ll 
                        grant you better things-- I’ll gift 
                        you a better life, if you let me in 
                        to feed on them inside the house.  

           Teenage Amy, looks down at the softball she’s clutching in 
           her hands, suddenly launches it, full force, at the 
           Boneeater.  It misses him and strikes the heartwood in the 
           trunk behind him, chipping the bark.  The Boneeater flinches.

           While he’s distracted, Teenage Amy rips away from him. She 
           races toward the treehouse ladder. But the Boneeater grabs 
           her shoulder before she can make it down.

           Teenage Amy shudders as the Boneeater inches its face to her 
           ear.

                                 BONEEATER (CONT’D)
                        Let me into the home.  I’ll come to 
                        you in some other form.  Something 
                        harmless--

           Teenage Amy sees--

           QUICK FLASHES 
           --of 

           --a nibbling field mice

           --a chattering squirrel

           --a hopping sparrow

           Teenage Amy blinks these visions of animals away.

                                 BONEEATER (CONT’D)
                        --When I come to you, you will 
                        grant me a favor.  A good deed.  
                        You will forge our covenant and 
                        concede entry to me.  You will 
                        welcome me in.  Then they will be 
                        eaten.  You will be safe.

           This last word reverberates in Teenage Amy’s head.  

           She claps her hands to her ears, uselessly, and falls 
           backwards--

           EXT. TREE - DAY - 25 YEARS AGO

           --to the ground.

           Teenage Amy gets up and starts to race toward the farmhouse.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE, FRONT PORCH - DAY - 25 YEARS AGO

           Teenage Amy hurries onto the porch. She passes a CAT, 
           grooming itself on the porch steps. She reaches the front 
           door.

           Just as she clasps the doorknob, a SPARROW flies past her and 
           hits the wall next to her with a thunk.

           Teenage Amy’s hand freezes.

           The bird falls to the porch floor, fluttering.

           Teenage Amy reflexively moves away from it. 

           But the cat stops grooming and shimmies over to the sparrow.

           Teenage Amy intervenes, picking up the sparrow before the Cat 
           grabs it.

           She holds it in her hands. It turns one black shining eye to 
           stare at her, when--
                                 TEENAGE JULIA (O.S.)
                        Hey!  Either come in or don’t!

           Teenage Julia swings the front door open, startling Teenage 
           Amy.

           Teenage Amy drops the bird. It hits the floorboards with a 
           soft plop. A tiny spray of its blood spatters the floor. The 
           cat sees its opportunity, pounces, and carries the bird away.

           Teenage Amy looks devastated. She wheels around to face 
           Teenage Julia, then--

           EXT. FARMHOUSE, FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

           Julia slams the notebook closed.

           She looks horrified. She throws the diary across the the 
           porch and launches herself off the steps.

           She runs across the yard, and heads for the tree.

           EXT. TREE - NIGHT - NOW

           Julia starts to climb the tree.

           About a third of the way up towards the treehouse, Julia 
           finds a hollow in the trunk; a nesting place for small 
           animals.  

           There are indeed many little creatures packed inside this 
           hole, apparently not bothered by the tight accommodations:  
           squirrels and other rodents curled in a pile, silent sparrows 
           perched along the inner crags of the hole, a raccoon nestled 
           in the dry leaves, etc.

           The animals stare at Julia, their glowing eyes piercing the 
           darkness.  

           Julia glances at the hollow then keeps climbing.

           INT. TREEHOUSE - NIGHT 

           Julia has entered the treehouse, where it’s dry and stifling.  

           The floor of the treehouse is built around the thick trunk.  
           The bark of the tree trunk appears slashed open, and the wide 
           gash reveals the pale heartwood underneath.
           Thick branches crisscross through the structure, entering and 
           exiting in the gaps between the wooden boards that make up 
           the treehouse walls.  These branches are covered in scars and 
           grooves. 

           Julia touches the exposed heartwood in the tree trunk.

                                 JULIA
                        Are you here? 

           She looks frightened, expecting something to answer. But 
           nothing does. 

           She turns around.

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        Where are you?  Where-

           But then, through the treehouse doorway, she catches a 
           glimpse of the farmhouse.

           The door is wide open, waiting for her.

           Julia takes a step forward. Suddenly, the floorboards beneath 
           her can’t take her weight. They crack, splinter, and give 
           way. Julia falls through the shattered wood, down-

           EXT. TREE - NIGHT - NIGHT

           --to the ground.  She hits the grass and lies there with the 
           wind knocked out of her.  She weeps.  

           She hears footsteps in the grass. She looks up and sees the 
           Old Man standing over her.  He’s not looking at her; he’s 
           staring up at the tree house.

           Julia scrambles to her feet.  When she stands up, the Old Man 
           isn’t old anymore.  He’s young -- the Young Man from the 
           woods, wearing early 20th century clothes.  He’s still 
           staring at the tree house.

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        He showed me something horrible.  A 
                        vision.  I saw myself dying in the 
                        mud, far away from home.  My body 
                        was rotted from the inside.  There 
                        were bullet holes in me.

                                 JULIA
                        You didn’t die that way, though.  
                        You changed it. 
                                 YOUNG MAN
                        When I saw him again, he wasn’t a 
                        monster anymore.  He was just a 
                        scared fawn, drowning in the creek.  
                        I dragged him out of there.  It 
                        seemed right to help him.  How 
                        could that be wrong, to help a 
                        frightened, helpless thing?  

                                 JULIA
                        But it wasn’t just a good deed. You 
                        knew what it meant, didn’t you? You 
                        knew what you agreed to. You did it 
                        to save yourself.

           The Young Man looks guilty.

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        I didn’t want to die that way.

                                 JULIA
                        Why do you keep coming back here? 
                        Why do they?

           Julia turns to the porch, where the Middle-Aged-Man stands 
           silently with his two Pre-teen Boys.

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        Because we let him in. And he won’t 
                        ever let us forget it.

           The Youmg Man stares past Julia, into the cemetery, at all 
           the family graves.

                                 YOUNG MAN (CONT’D)
                        Neither will they.

           The Young Man turns and walks away.  He disappears into the 
           woods behind the house. 

           Julia forces herself to move.  She stumbles across the yard, 
           towards the cemetery.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT 

           In the dark hospital room, Zoey wakes up.  She touches the 
           necklace around her neck, the ‘best friends’ half heart 
           pendant Julia gave her.  

           Zoey hears some commotion outside in the hall, some unseen 
           patient in another room is coding.  NURSES run down the hall 
           to attend to him
           Zoey slides out of bed.

           INT. HOSPITAL, HALLWAY - NIGHT 

           Zoey slips down the hall.  Nurses are busy with the other 
           patient.  They don’t notice Zoey.  She exits into a 
           stairwell. 

           EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT 

           Zoey runs out into the night.

           EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT - NOW

           Julia sits on a flat grave marker in the cemetery.  She 
           scrubs the tears away and tries to calm herself.  

           The headlights of a truck shine through the trees surrounding 
           the nearby road, and soon, the truck has parked in front of 
           the house.

           Julia can’t see him, but she hears Henry emerge from the 
           truck.

                                 HENRY (O.S.)
                        Julia?

                                 JULIA
                        I’m here.

           Henry makes his way down the cemetery path.

                                 HENRY
                        I heard Zoey got hurt.  She’s in 
                        the hospital? 

                                 JULIA
                        Infection.  From the opossum bite.

                                 HENRY
                        Is she okay?

                                 JULIA
                        Zoey’s in a little trouble, I 
                        think.

                                 HENRY
                        What’s going on, Julia?
                                 JULIA
                        You were right.  There’s something 
                        horribly wrong here.  I’ve met it.  
                        Me and Amy did. 

           Henry sits by Julia’s side. He doesn’t look like he wants to 
           hear more, but--

                                 HENRY
                        Tell me.

           Julia stares bleakly at Henry. 

                                 JULIA
                        It’s evil.  You felt it.  It’s 
                        everywhere outside, in the dirt.  
                        In the animals.  The house is safe, 
                        until you let it in.  It tempts 
                        you. A long time ago, this farm was 
                        failing. The family was starving. 
                        My great-great-great-grandfather 
                        made a bargain with it. He made a 
                        sacrifice. And the farm recovered. 

           Julia stares at the grave of her great-grandfather.  

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        After that, there was my great-
                        grandfather. He would have died in 
                        World War I. But he bargained with 
                        it. He made a sacrifice, and got a 
                        draft exemption. And then there was 
                        my cousin Amy. She knew the cancer 
                        would come back, eventually. She 
                        tried to save herself. She tried to 
                        bargain with it. I stopped it. I 
                        didn’t even know what I was doing, 
                        but I stopped it.

           Julia crumples. Ready to break down.

                                 HENRY
                        Don’t. This doesn’t have to be your 
                        burden.  Just go.  Forget the 
                        house.  Your grandparents didn’t 
                        want this for you.

                                 JULIA
                        It’s too late to forget it.  Zoey 
                        made a deal with it.  

                                 HENRY
                        Jesus.
                                 JULIA
                        She must have offered me.  Maybe 
                        she regrets it.  When it attacked 
                        me, she tried to help.  She fought 
                        it off.  Which is why she’s being 
                        punished now, I think.  

           Julia clutches her own finger, gripping the same place that 
           Zoey was bitten.

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        She made a promise, and it made 
                        sure to get collateral. 

           Julia looks tired.  Comes to a decision.  

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        It wants me, and she let it inside 
                        so it could have me.  If she 
                        reneges, I think she dies. 

                                 HENRY
                        Julia--

           Henry looks horrified at himself, but he continues.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        You can still leave. 

                                 JULIA
                        I think you should go home, Henry.

           Julia leaves the cemetery.  Henry looks torn, unsure.  
           Finally, he exits the cemetery and makes his way back to his 
           truck.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT 

           Julia stands in the front yard and listens to Henry’s truck 
           drive away.  She stares at the front porch.  She forces 
           herself to walk up to the farmhouse.  The front door swings 
           opens by itself.

           EXT. ROAD - NIGHT 

           As Henry drives off, another car slows in front of the 
           Farmhouse drive.

           Zoey gets out of the car -- a STRANGER has given her a ride.  
           She runs towards the farmhouse.
           EXT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS 

           Zoey spots Julia about to enter the house.

                                 ZOEY
                        Wait!!

           Julia stops.

                                 ZOEY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t!  It’s in there.  It’ll be 
                        waiting.  I’m sorry.  It’ll kill 
                        you.  I let it--

                                 JULIA
                        I know.

                                 ZOEY
                        It told me I could have a different 
                        future.  It said--

                                 JULIA
                        I know.

                                 ZOEY
                        --it said my mom could live.

                                 JULIA
                        Zoey.  I know.

           Zoey bursts into tears.  Sobs.  

           Julia wraps her arms around Zoey.  She squeezes tight. 

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        Run.  To the neighbor’s house.  Cut 
                        through the woods.  Your parents 
                        are on their way to come get you.  
                        You can wait for them there.

           Julia releases Zoey and strides into the farmhouse.  Zoey 
           reaches out, but the door slams shut behind Julia.

           INT. FARMHOUSE, ENTRYWAY - NIGHT 

           Julia takes a seat at the foot of the stairs and waits.  From 
           upstairs, far overhead, she hears the faint sound of gnawing.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT 

           Outside, Zoey stands frozen in front of the house.  Then, she 
           starts to run.  
           But she doesn’t cut through the woods.  She races around the 
           farmhouse.

           Toward the dead tree.

           INT. FARMHOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Julia sits on the steps and tries to keep her terror under 
           control as tapping and knocking sounds intensify around her, 
           above her, and under her.  Then--

           CRACK

           The stair below Julia explodes.  Wood flies everywhere.  
           Tentacle like roots push out of the floor and wrap around 
           Julia’s ankles.  

           CRASH

           The stair above Julia bursts open moments later.  More roots 
           appear.  They wrap around Julia’s arms.  

           Julia’s trapped.  She hears footsteps from the hallway above 
           her.

           She begins to scream.

           EXT. TREE - NIGHT 

           Zoey begins to climb slowly, breathing through the pain in 
           her throbbing hand--

           --up

           --up

           --up

           Until she reaches the hollow Julia discovered earlier.  A 
           hole filled with creatures and vermin.

           INT. FARMHOUSE, ENTRYWAY - NIGHT 

           Julia remains pinned to the stairs by a system of roots.  She 
           tries to crane her neck, to look above her.

           The Boneeater appears at the top of the stairs and slowly 
           descends closer.  He leaves blackened singed footprints in 
           the floorboards as he walks.
                                 BONEEATER
                        Don’t be afraid. This is how it 
                        goes. This was always your fate. I 
                        eat all of them in the end. If I 
                        can’t eat them alive, I wait until 
                        they’re buried. Your grandfather; 
                        your grandmother. They were in the 
                        ground when I took them, less 
                        fresh, drained of blood, full of 
                        poison.  But I gorged. But I would 
                        have liked to eat them alive.

           As the Boneeater gets closer, Julia writhes and tries to pull 
           away.  Its mouth begins to yawn open.

           Julia falls limp and begins to cry.

           EXT. TREE - NIGHT 

           Zoey peers inside the hollow.  The animals become active, 
           sensing a danger.  A rat bares its sharp teeth at her.  

           In the back of the hollow, Zoey spots an opossum.  It has 
           scars on its haunch -- it’s the same one she saved.

           Zoey reaches with trembling hands and grabs the opossum.  She 
           yanks it by the tail out of the hollow.

           This awakens the animals from their daze, and they launch 
           themselves at her, attacking.  

           Before she’s swarmed by rats and pecking birds, Zoey leaps 
           off the ladder, dragging the opossum with her.

           She lands in a crouch by the base of the tree.  The opossum 
           wheels around.  It tries to escape, tries to bite and 
           scratch.  Zoey dodges the teeth and claws, and grabs the 
           thing by the neck.

                                 ZOEY
                        I take it back.  

           Zoey hears Julia’s screams from inside the farmhouse, and 
           acts quickly.  She fumbles to grab a rock as the opossum 
           flails around.

                                 ZOEY (CONT’D)
                        I take it back!  There’s no favor!  
                        No good deed!  You’re not allowed 
                        to have her!

           Zoey smashes the opossum’s skull with the rock, killing it.
           INT. FARMHOUSE, ENTRYWAY - NIGHT 

           The Boneeater pauses and cocks its head, looking perplexed.  
           Then it seems almost to MELT--

           Into the tree roots exposed by the holes in the floor.  

           The boneeater’s shape changes as it fuses with the roots. 
           It’s body and head elongate and harden.  It slips down into 
           the floor, under the floorboards, into the dirt.  And then it 
           disappears.  

           We hear the roots moving under the floorboards, traveling 
           through the dirt back to their source -- the tree at the edge 
           of the property.

           Julia, frozen on the stairs, comes back to her senses.  She 
           leaps up, loses her footing, and tumbles down the steps.  She 
           lands hard on the floor below.

           She rises again and starts running.

           EXT. TREE - NIGHT 

           Zoey throws the bloody rock away.  The opossum twitches as it 
           dies, and then goes still.

           Zoey leans against the tree to catch her breath.  Her hand 
           suddenly explodes in pain, and she winces and grabs it.

           Before she has time to even think about this new pain, the 
           Boneeater emerges from the treehouse overhead.

           Zoey screams.  The Boneeater’s arm stretches out, down the 
           entire length of the tree trunk.  The Boneeater grab Zoey and 
           lifts her up to meet its eye.

           EXT. BACK YARD - NIGHT 

           Julia staggers to the back porch of the farmhouse.  She hears 
           Zoey screaming from across the grounds.  She starts running 
           towards the tree, but only makes it a quarter of the way 
           before she--

           TRIPS

           --over Henry’s flamethrower, which he dropped and left 
           forgotten in their yard the day Zoey was bitten by the 
           opossum.  

           Julia grabs it.  Gets up.  Starts running.
           EXT. TREE - NIGHT 

           Zoey grips a tree limb with both hands.  The Boneeater has an 
           arm wrapped around her waist and tries to pull her inside the 
           treehouse.  Zoey screams and kicks at the Boneeater.

           Julia runs toward the tree.  

                                 JULIA
                        Let go of her!!

           The Boneeater eyes her approach.

           Tree roots rise out of the ground underneath Julia’s feet.  
           She loses her balance and falls backwards, hard.

           While Julia is lying on her back, a branch from above comes 
           hurtling down.  It stabs Julia, impales her through the meat 
           of her shoulder, piercing her through like a stake.  Julia’s 
           trapped.

           ABOVE 

           --Zoey watches Julia’s struggle in horror from the tree.  
           While she’s distracted, the Boneeater pries her grip loose 
           from the limb.  He pulls back into the treehouse.  His jaws 
           widen.

           BELOW

           --Julia cries out in pain, but manages to keep hold of the 
           flamethrower.  She lights it and shoots a flame over the 
           branch impaling her. 

           The fire ignites the branch that pins her to the ground.  The 
           branch recoils away from Julia.  Julia groans in pain as the 
           branch dislodges from her body.  

           But she’s free.  

           The fire spreads quickly into the tree.  Julia helps the fire 
           grow by shooting more flames at the tree’s trunk.  

           The tree is such a dry husk, it burns like kindling.  

           ABOVE

           --The Boneeater lets out a hoarse scream.  It loses its grip 
           on Zoey.  

           Zoey scurries away from the Boneeater, trying to climb 
           further up in the tree, anything she can do to get away from 
           it.  She grabs hold of a branch, but when she puts her weight 
           on it, it bends, and then--
           CRACK  

           The limb starts to break.  

           Zoey loses her balance and slips, but manages to hang on to 
           the branch with one hand. 

           She dangles helplessly from the broken branch.

           BELOW

           --Standing on the grass, Julia is calm.  She peers up at 
           Zoey, and they lock eyes.

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        Just let go, baby.

           Zoey lets go, and Julia is there to break her fall.  They 
           both fall to the ground.

           Above them, the whole tree is alight.  Julia can’t see the 
           Boneeater through the flames -- it appears to be gone.

           Julia helps Zoey to her feet and they move away.  They hurry 
           to Julia’s car.  Chito gallops towards them.  The three of 
           them pile into the car.  

           They don’t look back. 

           INT. JULIA’S CAR - NIGHT 

           Julia drives away from the farm.  

           She glances in the rearview mirror at Zoey, who sleeps in the 
           back seat.  Julia returns her eyes to the road.  She sees the 
           sun starting to rise over the treeline.  

           INT. MOTEL - DAY 

           A shabby room with two queen sized beds.

           Julia sleeps soundly in one of the beds.  Chito sleeps at her 
           feet.  

           Zoey sits awake on the other bed.  She seems agitated.  She 
           stares at Julia’s cell phone charging on the nightstand.  She 
           grabs it.  
           EXT. MOTEL - DAY 

           Zoey exits the motel.  She dials a number on Julia’s cell 
           phone and presses it to her ear. 

           INT. SUTTON FAMILY CAR - DAY 

           Julia’s parents, Amy and Jason, drive in silence.  

           Amy looks even weaker and more drawn in then the last time we 
           saw her, but somehow she’s making this journey.  

           Amy’s phone rings.  She answers--

                                 AMY
                        Hello?

                                 ZOEY (V.O.)
                        Mom?

           Amy turns her face away from her husband.

           EXT. MOTEL - DAY 

           Zoey’s face crumples.  She starts to cry.

                                 ZOEY
                        I couldn’t do it.  I tried.  I 
                        found it, where you said it would 
                        be.  In the treehouse.  I talked to 
                        it.  It said it would help.  But 
                        then-- I couldn’t.  I’m sorry.  

                                 AMY (V.O.)
                        It’s okay.  I understand.  Don’t 
                        think about it anymore.  It’s 
                        nothing you have to worry about.  

                                 ZOEY
                        But what are you going to do?

           Zoey looks more scared now than we’ve ever seen her.  Scared 
           for her mother’s life. 

           INT. SUTTON FAMILY CAR - DAY 

           Jason looks over at Amy.  She smiles at him reassuringly.

                                 AMY
                        We’re fine.  We’re on our way.  
                        We’ll be there soon.  I love you.
           Amy hangs up and puts her phone away. 

                                 JASON
                        Everything okay?

                                 AMY
                        Everything will be fine.

           Jason reaches out to clasp Amy’s hand.  Amy stares straight 
           ahead, no expression at all.

           EXT. MOTEL - DAY - NOW

           Zoey finally hangs up the phone.  

           The door to the motel room behind her opens. Julia pokes her 
           head out.

                                 JULIA
                        What are you doing out here?

                                 ZOEY
                        Nothing.  

                                 JULIA
                        You’re exhausted.  You should get 
                        some more sleep.

           Julia guides Zoey back into the motel room. 

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY 

           Jason stands on the front porch, knocking on the front door.  
           Amy sits in a wheelchair on the path in front of the house.

                                 JASON
                        Where the hell are they?

                                 AMY
                        I’m sure they’ll be back soon.  We 
                        can wait.

           Jason’s phone rings.  He grabs it from his pocket.

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Is that Zoey?

                                 JASON
                        No.  My mom.  Uh... hold on.

           Jason moves to the other side of the porch.  Amy wheels her 
           chair further away, giving him privacy.  
                                 JASON (INTO THE PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Hello?  Yeah.  We’re here.
                             (lower)
                        I told her that.  Well... She 
                        wanted to come.  

           Jason has his back to Amy, so he doesn’t see when she 
           struggles to stand and walk, leaving the wheelchair behind. 

           She starts to move across the yard.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        I know, but she needed to see her 
                        daughter.  And... I think it’s not 
                        just about Zoey.  

           Jason looks up at the farmhouse.

                                 JASON (CONT’D)
                        This house means a lot to her.  She 
                        spent a lot of time here growing 
                        up.  And I think... she wanted to 
                        see it one last time.
                             (anguished)
                        Because we’re out of options, mom.

           Jason turns around and realizes he can’t see Amy anymore.

           The empty wheelchair sits alone in the grass.

           EXT. TREE - DAY - NOW

           The tree is a burnt out husk.  Amy stares at it.  She can 
           peer down into the trunk through a charred hole.

           Inside this hole, the Boneeater’s pale face, almost totally 
           submerged in the dirt, looks back at her.

           Pain and fear cause Amy to sink to her knees.  The 
           Boneeater’s hand rises out of the ground and touches her 
           face, gently.  Almost sympathetically. 

                                 BONEEATER
                        The pain I showed you.  It has 
                        come?

                                 AMY
                        Yes.

                                 BONEEATER
                        I could swallow you whole.  The 
                        pain would end.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 BONEEATER (CONT'D)
                        Or I could save you.  Your future 
                        can still be undone.  You know how. 

           Amy nods.

                                 BONEEATER (CONT’D)
                        What do you want?

                                 AMY
                             (in a whisper)
                        I want to live.

                                 BONEEATER
                        Who do you have to offer me, 
                        daughter?

           Amy turns her head to look. 

           In the distance, by the farmhouse, Jason is searching for 
           her.  He doesn’t see her yet.

           Amy turns back to the Boneeater.

           THE END
