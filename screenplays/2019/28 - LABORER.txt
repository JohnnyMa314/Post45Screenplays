           INT. U.S. IMMIGRATION BUILDING - WAITING ROOM - DAY

           MARTÍN and ARACELI, an HISPANIC COUPLE in their 20’s, feed 
           off one another’s strength as they sit waiting in a too small 
           room tightly packed with dozens of other hopeful LATINO 
           IMMIGRANTS, all awaiting their turn.  

           Araceli holds tight their BABY BOY who is taking comfort in 
           Mother’s arms, feeding off his bottle. 

                                 WOMAN (V.O.)
                        Martín Moreno?

           Looking past his flesh and into his soul, Araceli evaluates 
           her husband to gauge his readiness. Satisfied, she leans in 
           and bestows a kiss, then gives a nod of confidence. 

           Martín rises, ready to face the woman calling his name.

           INT. U.S. IMMIGRATION BUILDING - OFFICE - DAY

           An IMMIGRATION OFFICER (white male in his 50’s) sits behind a 
           desk. Piles of applications sit before him. He picks up 
           Martín’s file and studies it. 

                                 IMMIGRATION OFFICER
                        If granted citizenship into the 
                        great United States, will you 
                        honorably volunteer as an organ 
                        donor?

           Martín struggles with his English, but thinks he understands. 

                                 MARTÍN
                        Yes. 

                                 IMMIGRATION OFFICER 
                        And limb donor? 

           Martín, more confused, but goes along. 

                                 MARTÍN
                        Yes. 

           The immigration officer checks off a box on Martín’s 
           application when a phone on his desk rings.

                                 IMMIGRATION OFFICER
                        Yes?
                               (pause)
                        I understand. 

           He hangs up the phone and looks to Martín. 
                                 IMMIGRATION OFFICER (CONT'D)
                        We need your hand. 

           Martín is confused. 

                                 IMMIGRATION OFFICER (CONT'D)
                        Hold out your hand. 

           The immigration officer holds out his own right hand to show 
           as an example. He extends his arm with his palm facing up.

           Martín now sees a dried puddle of blood on the edge of the 
           desk, and down onto the carpet directly in front of him, at 
           the same spot where he is being asked to place his hand. 

           The immigration officer exaggerates the motion of holding out 
           his own arm repeating the motion several times. 

                                 IMMIGRATION OFFICER (CONT'D)
                        Hold out your right hand, Martín. 

           Martín extends his right arm and turns his palm up, hovering 
           above the dried blood of the poor soul who sat in Martín’s 
           position prior.

           Inexplicably, the immigration officer suddenly wields a large 
           knife in his hand which he holds high in the air, he plunges 
           it down into Martín’s palm, nailing his hand to the desk. 

           Martín cries out in pain. 

           The immigration officer, now standing over Martín, holds out 
           a saw for Martín to take.

                                 IMMIGRATION OFFICER (CONT'D)
                        We have an urgent emergency, we 
                        need your hand. The hospital is 
                        standing by. 

           Martín holds the saw, looking at it.

                                 IMMIGRATION OFFICER (CONT'D)
                        Are you now relinquishing your 
                        agreed upon duties as a donor, 
                        Martín? 

           Martín complies, beginning to saw off his own hand, which is 
           still being anchored to the table.

           The pain is unbearable, he screams out as he finds 
           determination from within to saw faster and faster.  
           He makes it all the way through the bone and his arm rips 
           away from the severed hand, now fully detached and sitting on 
           the desk.

           A team of MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS rush into the office with a 
           small red and white cooler, they package the hand, Martín 
           still screaming. 

           The immigration officer stamps approved on his application.

                                 IMMIGRATION OFFICER (CONT'D)
                        Congratulations, Mr. Moreno. 

           He holds out his hand for a shake, Martín raises his severed 
           arm, grasping the new reality of his body, the image too much 
           for him to take.

           The sound of a baby now crying, in addition to Martín’s 
           screams take us to-

           INT. ABUELITA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Martín screams himself awake. 

           He looks around the room. He’s already woken Araceli up, who 
           stands at the crib of their screaming baby. 

           As Araceli feeds him to stop his crying, we notice a gauze 
           pad taped to the babies head, covering some kind of wound.

           With the fog of Martín’s dream lifting, he returns to his 
           more usual contemplative state, weary of this world in which 
           he lives, and the dangers it contains for his family.

           He sees the look on Araceli’s face, which tells him he’s 
           right to take this moment seriously. 

           Normally when Araceli looks at you she has the unique ability 
           to make you feel confident about yourself - reassuring you 
           from your insecurities, giving you the power to accomplish 
           your dreams. 

           But not right now.

           Right now her gaze is filled with FEAR.

           We hear talking and commotion coming from a nearby room. 

           Martín watches as Araceli pushes her way through the curtain 
           divider, still holding their child.
           INT. ABUELA’S HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

           Araceli walks into the connected room -- a large family room 
           that has been divided by hanging curtains into smaller 
           sections. 

           EIGHT FAMILY MEMBERS are awake and staring at Araceli, all 
           very concerned.

           NOTE: All dialogue typed in italics is spoken in Spanish.

                                 ARACELI
                        I’m so sorry for the noise. 
                        Everything is alright, I hope you 
                        all are able to go back to sleep.

           Araceli’s mother, ABUELA, 50’s, speaks for the group.

                                 ABUELA
                        This is the seventh night in a row, 
                        Araceli. We’re concerned.

                                 ARACELI
                        I’m really sorry, but everything is 
                        fine, I promise. 

                                 ABUELA
                        Screams so loud they wake our 
                        neighbors, is fine?

           Araceli kisses Abuela on the forehead, then forces a smile.

                                 ARACELI
                        Thank you. We are fine. 

           INT. ABUELA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Araceli returns to her tiny bedroom and lays her now quieted 
           baby back into his crib.

           She turns off the light and returns to bed, not paying Martín 
           any attention, trying to hide from him the tears in her eyes. 

           Martín puts his arm around her.

                                 MARTÍN
                        I’m sorry.

           She remains frozen.

                                 MARTÍN (CONT'D)
                        I’m sorry, Araceli. Please. I’m 
                        sorry.
           She turns towards him.

                                 ARACELI
                        Will you please talk to me? It 
                        might help you. Please open up.

                                 MARTÍN
                        There’s no secret, Araceli.
                               (beat)
                        I’m worried about finding work. I’m 
                        worried that we made the wrong 
                        decision coming here. I don’t know 
                        what else to say.

           Araceli, excited that she has him talking.

                                 ARACELI
                        It will all be okay though. You 
                        have to tell yourself that, and you 
                        have to believe that. Reframe your 
                        fears and anxiety. I truly believe 
                        that what we set our intentions and 
                        focus on, our energy will make 
                        reality. 

                                 MARTÍN
                        It’s hard for me to just tell my 
                        anxiety to go away. 

                                 ARACELI
                        I know, but will you just try it -- 
                        out loud?

                                 MARTÍN
                        And say what?

                                 ARACELI
                        Set your intention. Say what you 
                        want to happen in your life. What 
                        will happen.

                                 MARTÍN
                        I will find a job tomorrow. 

           Araceli waits for him to try harder, to say more. 

                                 MARTÍN (CONT'D)
                        I will find a job tomorrow and I 
                        will make money and I will be able 
                        to support our family.

                                 ARACELI
                        Good! Good! Now say it and really 
                        mean it.
                                 MARTÍN
                               (Committed)
                        I will find a job tomorrow and I 
                        will make money and I will be able 
                        to support our family.

                                 ARACELI
                        Again! 

                                 MARTÍN
                               (louder)
                        I will find a job tomorrow! I will 
                        make money! I will be able to 
                        support our family!

                                 ARACELI
                        Shh you’ll wake the baby.

           Araceli cracks a smile. Despite his exhaustion, Martín 
           manages one as well. 

                                 ARACELI (CONT'D)
                        And you’ll buy us a new SUV for our 
                        family and a big beautiful house in 
                        Beverly Hills with a back yard for 
                        our daughter to play in, right?

           Martín gives her a look -- you’re testing me. Araceli returns 
           with a gentle kiss. 

                                 ARACELI (CONT'D)
                        Thank you, Martín. I know you’re 
                        trying hard. This is America! We 
                        can make it if we just work hard 
                        and believe. 

                                 MARTÍN
                        I believe, honey.

           Martín gives her a kiss. She cuddles close in his arms and 
           falls back asleep, gently snoring. Martín’s sleepless night 
           continues.

           There’s some kind of motion near the window and into the 
           room. Martín tries to look, but the room is too dark.

           Something is in the room. ... Or is he just hearing things?

           It sounds like talons scraping plastic. Little claws digging 
           in. We hear feathers jostle - then a peck... peck... peck...

           It’s eating something? 
           Silence in the room is shattered by SCREAMING. A death cry 
           coming from the little human, begging for a savior.

           While Martín turns on a lamp, Araceli rescues their child 
           from his screams once again.

           There’s no sign of a bird, or whatever was making the noise.

           The gauze pad on the babies head is now soaked through with 
           BLOOD. Martín carefully removes the gauze.

           It’s an infected-looking open wound, about the size of a half-
           dollar coin. There was an attempt at suturing the wound once 
           before - the homemade looking stitches are not holding.

           The dried, clotted lesion has cracked open and blood is 
           dripping down the baby’s forehead. 

                                 MARTÍN (CONT'D)
                        We need to take him back to the 
                        doctor. It’s not healing.

           They look at each other, knowing what the other is thinking.

                                 ARACELI
                        I’ll take him after you’re able to 
                        earn some money today.

           Understood. He nods. 

                                 ARACELI (CONT'D)
                        I love you.

                                 MARTÍN
                        I love YOU! My everything.

           They share a kiss. 

           The moment is broken by a young giggle.

           Araceli looks over to see her daughter, MARÍA ISABEL, 5, 
           looking at them through the curtain dividers, smiling.

                                 ARACELI
                        María Isabel, what are you doing 
                        awake! 

           Araceli speaks to her in English.

                                 MARÍA ISABEL
                        I saw you kissing Daddy.

                                 MARTÍN
                        You were spying on us! 
           Martín lifts María, swinging her around, and carries her 
           through the divider and into another section of the room. 

                                 MARTÍN  (CONT'D)
                        Araceli! We have a spy in the 
                        house! 

           María laughs again, adorned with the attention of her father.

           INT. ABUELA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Abuela is in the kitchen with several other FAMILY MEMBERS. 

                                 MARTÍN
                        Go help your Grandmother make 
                        breakfast. 

                                 MARÍA ISABEL
                        Ok! 

                                 ABUELA
                        Good morning sweet angel. 

           Martín recedes to the bedroom, not wanting to face the others 
           just yet. 

           INT. ABUELA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

           Their baby boy has quieted, Araceli lays him back down. 

           Martín walks up behind Araceli and wraps his arms around her, 
           then gently kisses her on the neck. The kisses slow, he 
           continues moving his hands across her, moving to her chest. 
           She closes her eyes and lets her head fall back into him. 

                                 ARACELI
                        Go to work. Leave me in peace.

           His hand slides down the front of her, over her waist, then 
           lower. 

           They whisper to each other.

                                 MARTÍN
                        Don’t tell me what to do.

           Araceli slips her hand inside his pants, rubbing. 

                                 MARTÍN (CONT'D)
                        Your mother is in the next room.

           Martín’s hand goes further.
                                 ARACELI
                        If you don’t stop, I’ll scream, 
                        I’ll have you arrested.

                                 MARTÍN
                        Fine. Go ahead.

           Just then, the bathroom door opens, a COUSIN of Araceli’s 
           walks out. 

           Araceli and Martín separate quickly, good at this game. 

                                 COUSIN
                        Good morning. 

                            ARACELI
                                                              MARTÍN
           Good morning.
                                                  Good morning.

           The cousin walks out of the room. Araceli looks at Martín, 
           she sees that he’s worked up.

           Without another word, they both go for the bathroom. 

           INT. ABUELA’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

           Martín shuts the door. Araceli removes his pants.

           He sits on the toilet, she climbs up on him. She uses her 
           hand behind her to grab hold of him, guiding it in.

           Martín tightly closes his eyes. He looks as if he’s in pain.

           She slowly lets herself down on him, they both enjoy the 
           first moments of penetration. She cautiously and quietly 
           moves up and down on him. 

           Martín lets his eyes open. He looks at her, enjoying him. He 
           is enjoying it too, then a different look overtakes his face. 
           She sees the look, and now she has this look, too.

           She starts to move up and down faster, trying to stop what is 
           now inevitable. She slows to a stop. Using her hand she tries 
           to re-stimulate Martín. 

           They both know it’s not going to work. 

           He tries to stand up, she doesn’t let him. She looks straight 
           him straight in the eye and then kisses him. 

                                 ARACELI
                        I love you. 

           Embarrassed, Martín looks away.
                                 MARTÍN
                        I love you too.

                                 ARACELI
                        At least we know we won’t get 
                        pregnant again. 

           Araceli laughs, trying to lighten the mood. Martín lets out a 
           laugh too. Martín starts the shower while Araceli quietly 
           sneaks out of the bathroom.

           INT. ABUELA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Araceli enters a kitchen full of even more FAMILY MEMBERS.

                                 ARACELI
                        Good morning Mama. 

           Araceli kisses her mother on the cheek.

                                 ABUELA
                        Good morning.

           Araceli looks to ENZO, early 20’s, seated at the table. 

                                 ARACELI
                        Good morning, Enzo.

                                 ENZO
                        Good morning, Araceli. 

                                 ARACELI
                        Are you excited for work today?

                                 ENZO
                        Quite. The view from my corner 
                        office is unmatched. You have to 
                        come see it sometime. 

                                 ARACELI
                        I will call your secretary to set 
                        an appointment.

           Abuela does not appear to find this conversation amusing.

                                 ABUELA
                        It is possible, you know.

           Enzo stops laughing to show respect for Abuela. 

                                 ARACELI
                        What is, Mama? 
                                 ABUELA
                        These young men can have their 
                        corner office and executive role. 
                        They’re certainly intelligent and 
                        capable enough. It’s a matter of 
                        how hard they want to work.

                                 ENZO
                        Thank you, Mrs. Silva. And yes, 
                        anything is possible. And thank you 
                        again for letting us stay with you.

                                 ABUELA
                        Your brother is family now.

           Martín walks into the room, dressed for work. 

                                 MARTÍN
                        You’re too kind, Mrs. Silva. 

           Martín kisses her on the cheek, then kisses Araceli.

                                 MARTÍN (CONT'D)
                        Everybody’s up. Good morning.

           Araceli hands Martín and Enzo paper bag lunches. Martín grabs 
           a breakfast burrito from Abuela and walks towards the door.

                                 ARACELI
                        Good luck today.

                                 ABUELA
                        May God bless your journey.

           She does the sign of the cross over her chest.

                                 MARTÍN
                        Thank you. And thank you for the 
                        breakfast. 

           EXT. ABUELA’S HOUSE - DAY

           As they walk out, we see the small, rundown California 
           bungalow from the 50’s with bars on the windows and doors. 
           The grass dead for years.

           INT./EXT. MARTÍN’S TRUCK - DAY

           Martín holds the keys to the beat up 1980’s TOYOTA TRUCK.

           Martín reaches across and manually unlocks the passenger side 
           for Enzo, who climbs in, then Martín begins to drive. 
           They make their way through the streets of the San Fernando 
           Valley, first passing houses, then run down strip malls.

           EXT. HOME DEPOT PARKING LOT - DAY

           We watch as Martín’s truck pulls into the parking lot, headed 
           not for the front of the store, but the back of the parking 
           lot. He finds a secluded space to park his truck and get out.

           Martín and Enzo look around the parking lot surveying. 

           There are two different groups of LATINO WORKERS who have 
           formed. They walk towards the group closer.

           They casually approach, with a submissive, polite, we come in 
           peace attitude. 

           Martín smiles at the first LABORER they come to.

                                 MARTÍN
                        Hello, how are you?

                                 LABORER
                        You’re wasting your time.

                                 MARTÍN
                        Excuse me?

                                 LABORER
                        There’s no work here for you.

                                 MARTÍN
                        Thank you.

           Martín nods at the man, and he Enzo keep walking. Martín 
           tries again with another man, LABORER #2.

                                 MARTÍN (CONT'D)
                        Hello.

                                 LABORER #2
                        Hello.

                                 MARTÍN
                        Have you all had much luck today?

                                 LABORER #2
                        None.

           The conversation goes quiet for a moment.

                                 LABORER #2 (CONT'D)
                        There’s a line you know. An order.
           Martín looks at the group, trying to understand the order.

                                 MARTÍN
                        Of course. 

           Just as they’re talking, a large TRUCK pulls towards the men.

           A few of the men jump to their feet with excitement. Enzo and 
           Martín stay back, letting the others have priority.

           The truck doesn’t slow as it gets closer to the men. The 
           windows of the truck roll down, and we see the occupants are 
           four white HIGH SCHOOL BOYS. 

           One of the boys uses a bull horn out of the window to yell--

                                 HIGH SCHOOL BOY
                        THIS IS AN ICE RAID! NOBODY MOVE! 

           Another boy launches water balloons at the laborers. The 
           laborers scatter, many of them hit by the balloons.

           One of the laborers throws a rock at the truck, it lands 
           square in the windshield and cracks it. 

           The truck screeches to a halt. The high school boys go from 
           laughing to upset. They put the truck in reverse and speed 
           up, nearly hitting some of the laborers as they speed off. 

           Another laborer lands a rock on the truck.

                                 HIGH SCHOOL BOY #2
                        Fuck you! Go back to Mexico! 

           A frustrated laborer looks to his friend.

                                 LABORER #3
                        Fuck this. Lets go. 

           Several of the laborers leave for the day. Between the heat 
           and the harassment, it’s not worth it.

           Martín and Enzo stay.

           EXT. HOME DEPOT PARKING LOT - LATER

           It’s the middle of summer in the valley and it’s hot. Too hot 
           for conversation. Martín and Enzo have wrapped bandanas 
           soaked in water around their necks. 

           Enzo watches as a WOMAN pushes a shopping cart out of the 
           Home Depot. She walks to her white TESLA MODEL X.
           She leaves her cart next to her car, unattended, as she 
           proceeds to walk towards the group of men -- towards Enzo. 

           Enzo elbows Martín to look.

           As the woman gets closer, we get our first close look at 
           ROBIN, 40’s. Her confidence outshining the perfectly polished 
           car behind her. She wears a pair of jeans expertly tailored 
           to her build. The top few buttons of her starched white shirt 
           lead to her glowing, moisturized skin. Her hair and make-up 
           too perfect to be natural, but still we question if this is 
           how she always looks. Her eyes hidden behind a pair of 
           designer sun-glasses. 

           More of the men have noticed her imminent arrival and stand 
           up, eager to get the job.

           Robin smiles as she walks towards the men. 

           Seeing Robin’s face, Enzo turns to his brother excited.

                                 ENZO
                        That’s -- That’s -- Do you know who 
                        that is??

           They whisper quietly to each other.

                                 MARTÍN
                        Who?

           Robin takes off her sun glasses.

                                 ENZO
                        I know her! 

                                 MARTÍN
                        How?

                                 ENZO
                        She’s in MIDNIGHT ON TEN...one of 
                        the greatest films of all time. At 
                        least of this decade.

                                 MARTÍN
                        I didn’t see it.

                                 ENZO
                        Robin Ozanne.

                                 MARTÍN
                        Okay I got it.

           Enzo and Martín are crowded by the other workers and losing 
           position.
                                 ROBIN
                        Hello! 

                                 GROUP
                        Work? Work? 

           Robin stands before the group, looking each of the men over. 

                                 ROBIN
                        I’m looking to hire some help for 
                        the day. I hope you’re all doing 
                        okay in this heat?

           Her bleached white teeth are framed with a bright, welcoming 
           smile. Her eyes radiate warmth and welcome.

                                 LABORER #4
                        Work?

           Robin evaluates the men one by one as she speaks.

                                 ROBIN
                        I need somebody who is a bit 
                        versatile in their skill set. I 
                        have curtains that need to be hung. 
                        I have some new window covers to be 
                        installed. I’m building a new 
                        garden and the soil still needs to 
                        be placed. Also, I’m having an 
                        event at my house soon, and there 
                        are just some small odds and ends I 
                        need completed in order to help me 
                        be ready to host. 

           The English is too much for most of the men to understand, 
           but they understand enough. 

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Is there anybody here who thinks 
                        they have the required skills to 
                        accomplish all of this?

           All of the men raise their hands, especially Enzo, who is 
           dying to get the job.

           For just one moment, Enzo thinks Robin is looking at him, but 
           her eyes settle on the man in front of him.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Are you alright with heavy lifting? 

           Robin motions with her arms and body to make sure he 
           understands.
                                 LABORER #5
                        Yes.

                                 ROBIN
                        How about pulley systems, do you 
                        have any experience with those?

           The man hesitates, but cannot risk losing the job.

                                 LABORER #5
                        Yes.

           Robin smiles. 

                                 ROBIN
                        Really? Wow, wonderful. What blood 
                        type are you, do you know?

           The man is confused. In his moment of pause, LABORER #6 sees 
           an opening, he raises his hand and steps forward.

                                 LABORER #6
                        I know pulleys, and can lift 
                        anything heavy.

           Enzo watches desperately, knowing he’s about to lose the job. 

           Robin smiles.

                                 ROBIN
                        Great! Are you available now?

           The man nods yes. He grabs his lunch and jacket. 

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        My car is this way.

           Robin walks towards her car. She presses a button on her 
           keyless entry and the Tesla’s falcon wing doors raise up 
           towards the sky.

           Martín and Enzo watch as Worker #4 helps her load the 
           supplies into her Tesla, then he sits in the back seat.

                                 MARTÍN
                        Don’t worry brother, we’re going to 
                        get one.

           Enzo, still watching Robin, hasn’t given up yet.

                                 ENZO
                        We’re going to get this one.

           Robin pushes the shopping cart towards a cart return corral. 
           Enzo approaches.

                                 ENZO (CONT'D)
                        Hello.

           Robin greets him warmly.

                                 ROBIN
                        Hola.

           She holds her hand out to shake his.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Me llamo Robin.

           Enzo, thrilled to be shaking her hand.

                                 ENZO
                        I’m Enzo. You are so talented. 

           She takes the compliment well.

                                 ROBIN
                        Thank you. Very kind. 

           Robin gives him a look, anything else?

           Enzo’s English is rough, but he is able to make it through.

                                 ENZO
                        I would love to work for you, if 
                        you need someone else. 

           Robin looks back to her car, where Laborer #6 sits.

                                 ROBIN
                        Thank you, but I already hired 
                        someone. I’m sure I’ll be back 
                        another day.

                                 ENZO
                        He is not good. I promise. I can 
                        work much better and harder than 
                        him. 

           This gives Robin pause -- she’s intrigued. 

                                 ROBIN
                        He isn’t good? He said he was good.

           She smiles. 

           Enzo shakes his head no.
                                 ENZO
                        I will work much harder. I promise. 

                                 ROBIN
                        You really want this job?

           Enzo nods his head yes and points to his brother.

                                 ENZO
                        My brother and I will both work for 
                        you, for the same fee. Two for one.

           Robin looks at Martín, who is patiently waiting.

                                 ROBIN
                        Well, that certainly is a generous 
                        offer. 

           She evaluates the two brothers, and comes to a decision.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        You can have the job, but, you’ll 
                        have to fire that one.

           Robin points to the man in the car. Enzo looks at her, and 
           then Laborer #6.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        You have to be the one to tell him.

           Robin smiles and waits. 

           Enzo realizing what he has to do, builds up his confidence. 
           He marches over to the car to speak with the worker.

           The other laborers see what’s going on. They protest.

                                 GROUP
                        Hey!

           We don’t hear what Enzo says exactly, but we see the man’s 
           reaction to the news, he’s pissed. 

           Enzo looks to Martín. 

                                 ENZO
                        Let’s go.

           Martín walks towards the Tesla, passing Laborer #6 on the 
           way, who spits in his direction.

           Robin seems to be enjoying the show. She holds out her hand 
           and greets Martín.
                                 ROBIN
                        Hola, yo soy Robin.

           Martín suddenly bashful.

                                 MARTÍN
                        Hello. I’m Martín. 

                                 ROBIN
                        I’m excited to meet you, Martín.

           The two share an extended moment, interrupted by LABORER #3 
           tapping Martín on the shoulder. We he turns to look, the 
           man’s fist lands square in Martín’s face. 

           INT. ROBIN’S TESLA - DAY

           Martín and Enzo sit in the back seat of Robin’s Tesla.

           Enzo gives a can you believe this look to Martín, who is 
           pinching his Kleenex-clogged nose, looking towards the 
           ceiling -- clearly not experiencing the same euphoria.

                                 ROBIN
                        I’m so siento about what happened, 
                        I feel resonsiblè. Are you feeling 
                        mal bueno?

                                 MARTÍN
                        It’s no problem. I’m good.

                                 ROBIN
                        You don’t mind if I smoke do you?

           Enzo and Martín look at each other -- smoke?

                                 ENZO
                        We don’t mind.

           Robin smiles at them in the mirror, then turns on nineties 
           soft rock as she rolls down her window and picks up a 
           lighter. It looks like she’s lighting a cigarette, but Enzo 
           watches closely, and sees that she is smoking a blunt.

           Robin looks in the rear view mirror every few minutes 
           smiling. She looks at them with the pride of an owner who 
           just purchased a prize-winning-horse.

           EXT. ROBIN’S TESLA - DAY

           The white Tesla drives through a winding Hollywood Hills 
           road, passing more than a few mansions. 
           It turns onto a small road not lined with any homes, which 
           leads to a secluded lot -- as secluded Los Angeles gets. 

           INT. ROBIN’S TESLA - DAY

           The trio arrive in front of a gate. Robin looks through the 
           interior of the car for the clicker. It takes her a moment of 
           searching but she emerges victorious.  

           Except when she clicks it, nothing happens. 

           Clicks again. 

           Nothing. 

           Click.

           Nothing.

           A frustrated Robin exits the Tesla. 

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - GATE - DAY

           Robin, still holding the clicker, continues to click it as 
           she walks towards the gate. With her arm extended, she looks 
           as though she’s threatening the gate with an act of violence. 

           She looks for some kind of sensor or key pad to open the gate 
           manually. She doesn’t find it. 

           Is this even her gate?

           As if by accident, she realizes that the gate can be opened 
           manually, with no resistance at all. 

           With the gate fully open, she’s back in the car. 

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - DRIVEWAY - DAY

           The car winds up the driveway and we finally get a full view 
           of the house. 

           It’s nice, but the house doesn’t know what it is. It’s caught 
           in between - it looks as if it’s been renovated to be modern, 
           but the large foundation, basement, and adjoining structure 
           reveal a much older, traditional home.

           As they pull up to the front of the house, Enzo and Martín 
           notice a large shipping container full of soil, which has 
           overtaken the driveway.
           Enzo and Martín get out of the car and hang close by, waiting 
           for direction.

                                 ROBIN
                        Would you like to come inside?

           She waves them to follow her. They do.

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - FRONT ENTRY - DAY

           Robin holds up a finger to the brothers.

                                 ROBIN
                        Lo Siento, uno momento. 

           They pause, waiting to hear what she’s ‘siento’ about. She 
           carefully and neatly takes off her shoes.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        You won’t mind taking your shoes 
                        off, will you? 

           After a moment of confusion over what she is asking, they 
           come to understand and then remove their shoes. 

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Please, come inside.

           They follow her in.

           A NOTE ON COMMUNICATION: Robin will often speak to Enzo & 
           Martín in more English then they can understand. What they 
           are and are not able to digest will be reflected in their 
           performances as they come to form their opinions and 
           understanding about Robin and her world.

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - MAIN ROOM - DAY

           The main room is an open floor plan connected to the kitchen. 
           The space is surrounded by large windows. The house is newly 
           renovated, modern, and bright. The aesthetic is farm house 
           chic. The space is refreshing and well decorated. 

           As Enzo takes the house in, it’s clear that he’s excited to 
           be in Robin’s home. Martín is a bit excited also.

           Robin approaches Martín. 

                                 ROBIN
                        How is your nose doing?
           She points her nose so he understands, then rests her hand on 
           his shoulder while he answers. He is nervous at her touch.

                                 MARTÍN
                        Much better. Thank you.

           Robin smiles. Martín once again, blushing.

                                 ROBIN
                        Can I offer you some tea or coffee?

           Martín looks to Enzo to take the lead, since he speaks better 
           English.

                                 ENZO
                        No, thank you.

                                 ROBIN
                        I insist! How many shots of 
                        espresso do you like?

                                 ENZO
                        Coffee is good, thank you.

           Robin smiles, and turns her gaze towards Martín.

                                 ROBIN
                        Are you sure you don’t want 
                        anything to drink?

           Martín puts on an insecure smile.

                                 ROBIN  (CONT'D)
                        I’ll bring you both coffee.

           She smiles and waits to see if they will respond. They do 
           not.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        And what do you take in your 
                        coffee? Cow’s milk? Or would you 
                        rather oat milk, or maybe coconut 
                        or almond milk?

                                 ENZO
                        Oat milk?

           Robin is pleased at the response. 

                                 ROBIN
                        How great! 

           Robin turns to walk away, but then turns back.
                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Neither of you take your coffee 
                        with sugar, do you? I’m not sure I 
                        I own any sugar.

           Enzo and Martín both smile at Robin.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Wonderful.

           She retreats to the kitchen to fill the order.

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - MAIN ROOM - DAY

           Enzo and Martín have a moment to take the house in. The pool 
           in the back yard catches Enzo’s attention.

           Martín observes her coffee table books. There are several 
           GOOP books by GWYNETH PALTROW.

                                 ENZO
                        Gwyneth is a God. 

                                 MARTÍN
                        Who is she?

                                 ENZO
                        Actress. Entrepreneur. Clean-eater. 
                        CEO. Podcaster. Please do not try 
                        and put her in one box. Every girl 
                        in Hollywood would kill to be her.

                                 MARTÍN
                        Including you?

                                 ENZO
                        Including me.

           Robin’s back. That was weirdly quick. She smiles, holding out 
           their coffees. 

                                 MARTÍN
                        Thank you.

                                 ENZO
                        Thank you.

                                 ROBIN
                        What were you talking about?

           Her giant smile still on her face. 
                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        You were talking about something. 
                        Is everything alright?

                                 ENZO
                        The house is beautiful.

                                 ROBIN
                        Oh. Well, thank you, that’s so 
                        sweet of you guys. Please have a 
                        seat with me.

           Robin walks back into the kitchen to grab her drink. It’s a 
           clear glass mug, containing something green.

           Enzo and Martín take a seat on the couch.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Actually -- sorry, I know this 
                        might be kind of strange, but would 
                        you both mind joining me on the 
                        floor? I promise it’s clean. 

           They look confused but follow her lead. 

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        If it’s alright with both of you, 
                        before beginning any new journey I 
                        like to seek counsel from the 
                        ancestors. And I’d like for you 
                        both to help me. Is that alright?

           Robin looking genuinely worried that it might not be. 

                                 ENZO 
                        Yes, alright. 

           A wave of relief across Robin’s face. She cups her hands 
           together with giddy excitement. 

                                 ROBIN
                        Thank you! Okay, great. 

           The men move onto the floor following Robin’s direction. 

           Robin places crystals on the floor in the middle of the men. 
           She turns off the house lights and lights candles around the 
           room and on the floor, in the middle of the crystals.

           Next, she cleanses the room by lighting a bundle of sage as 
           well as lighting a palo santo wood stick. 
           Smoke is steadily streaming from the sage and palo santo, she 
           gracefully waves her arms up and down as she walks in a 
           circle around the room. At one point, she does a graceful 
           pirouette with the smoke rising out of her palms. 

           Finally, she’s ready. She joins the men and sits on the 
           floor, the three of them forming a circle.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        I just find that being on the floor 
                        is better for re-calibrating our 
                        energies as we prepare to come 
                        together in purpose as one. Don’t 
                        you?

           Martín offers a polite smile. Enzo is clearly mesmerized by 
           Robin’s world.  She stares at them, smiling. Taking in their 
           energy. When she feels the time is right, she sets down her 
           drink and begins. 

           She holds out her hands to the men for them to take and link 
           up. Following cue, Enzo and Martín hold hands as well, 
           closing the chain.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Thank you. 

           She closes her eyes. 

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Spirit guides, We ask that you 
                        acknowledge our presence and our 
                        intentions, and we ask for your 
                        help and guidance in our work, our 
                        efforts, our mission for the day. 

           Robin opens her eyes again.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Lo siento, cuál es su nombres?

                                 ENZO
                        Enzo and Martín.

           Robin smiles in gratitude and closes her eyes once more. 

                                 ROBIN
                        Spirit guides, As Martín, Enzo, and

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        A mission to restore this beautiful 
                        place of shelter. To sweep away the 
                        dust and let this home reach her 
                        fullest potential, that this home 
                        may offer those weary from the 
                        troubles and heartache of the 
                        outside world and provide to them a 
                        place of refuge from the storm. 

           Martín and Enzo understand enough to look at each other and 
           question this woman’s sanity. 

           Enzo cracks a what the hell is going on smile. Martín smiles 
           back - just as he notices something moving on the far side of 
           the room.

           Perched on the banister is some kind of black bird -- inside 
           the house.

           Enzo sees it too.

           A second bird flies across the room and lands on the banister 
           next to the first. It’s a different species of bird, but also 
           dark in color.

           The two birds watch the scene in the family room. Their 
           timing is certainly suspect. 

           With the smiles wiped from their faces, the brothers tune 
           back into what Robin is saying.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Spirit guides, please help us to 
                        have a safe and productive day of 
                        work and bring us closer to 
                        accomplishing and obtaining what is 
                        rightfully ours. With your help, we 
                        will achieve glory in all things, 
                        and in all things we are nothing 
                        without you. 

           Robin opens her eyes. 

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Thank you for partnering with me on 
                        this project. 

           She hops up, blows out the candles, and turns on the lights. 

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Alright, friends! We have much to 
                        accomplish! 
           She begins walking around the house, reminding herself of all 
           the little projects needed to be done.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        So in two days time we are hosting 
                        a political fundraiser here, so as 
                        I’m sure you can guess, we need to 
                        get this house looking beautiful!

           Enzo and Martín assume they should follow her. 

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Right now all of the windows are 
                        exposed right, so one of our first 
                        priorities is to get them covered. 
                        I feel quite vulnerable in a house 
                        where just anyone can see in. 

           Underneath each of the windows are boxes and bags: 
           RESTORATION HARDWARE, TARGET, AMAZON PRIME. 

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        I’ve purchased curtains and blinds 
                        that I would like to use. They’re 
                        all ready to be hung. 

                                 ENZO
                        No problem.

                                 ROBIN
                        Let me show you what else needs to 
                        be done so you can get a big 
                        picture sense of the whole work 
                        load. Is that alright with you?

                                 ENZO
                        Yes.

           Robin turns to Martín. 

                                 ROBIN
                        Is that alright with you as well?

           Martín looks to Enzo, who is nodding his prompt of ‘yes’. 

                                 MARTÍN 
                        Yes. 

           Robin’s face lights up, like she just got to open an early 
           present on Christmas Eve.

                                 ROBIN
                        Great! 
           Robin walks out the front door, Enzo and Martín follow. 

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - DAY

           Robin walks towards the shipping container full of soil. 

                                 ROBIN
                        So this -- this is a real headache.

           She examines the container as if she hasn’t really looked at 
           it closely before.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        I might have gotten a tad bit ahead 
                        of myself on this one. 

           She makes a squinting face as if she made a boo-boo. 

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Now with marijuana being legal, I 
                        had a friend who was able to talk 
                        me into getting in on the business. 
                        So I guess I’m a pot dealer if you 
                        would believe it!

           She clasps her fingers together and holds her hands in front 
           of her chest as she opens her mouth - I’m so bad! 

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        I’m turning my basement into a 
                        greenhouse with controlled LED grow 
                        lights. It’s really amazing how 
                        easy it is now. 
                               (beat)
                        I don’t think there’s any way I can 
                        just leave this here during the 
                        fundraiser. It’s just too much an 
                        eye sore. I think we just have to 
                        get all of this soil moved down to 
                        the basement and get the container 
                        removed. Don’t you?

                                 ENZO
                        Yes. Total eye sore. We must move 
                        it.

           Robin hangs on every word of Enzo’s, nodding in agreement.

                                 ROBIN
                        You’re absolutely right. God, I’m 
                        so happy I have you here. 

           Robin looks back towards the house. 
                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Now I’m not really sure how we’re 
                        going to get the dirt down there. I 
                        don’t have a wheelbarrow or 
                        anything. Plus there are stairs. 
                        Maybe we can use some kind of 
                        plastic storage tub? We’ll figure 
                        something out.

           She starts to walk back into the house.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Alright let me show you the 
                        basement. 

                                 MARTÍN
                               (to Enzo)
                        We’re moving all of this dirt into 
                        the basement?

                                 ENZO
                        Weed farming. That’s so cool. Maybe 
                        she can hire us permanently to take 
                        care of the plants. 

                                 MARTÍN
                        If she doesn’t smoke it all first. 

           Robin stops and turns around towards the brothers.

                                 ROBIN
                        What was that?

                                 ENZO
                        Thinking how to get the dirt moved.

           Robin likes that they are taking the initiative. 

                                 ROBIN
                        Smart.

           They continue into the house.

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - BASEMENT HALLWAY - DAY

           Headed down the stair case and into the basement, the house 
           really starts to show its age. The foundation and stairs are 
           much older than the rest of the house. The foundation walls 
           are made of hand laid stones. 

           Robin leads them down to the landing at the bottom of the 
           stairs. A few tools are already lined up in the basement 
           foyer. 
           There are two hallways, one goes left, and the other right. 

           Robin leads them right, she opens the old wooden door and we 
           enter the greenhouse.

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - BASEMENT GREENHOUSE - DAY

           The cavernous room has small symmetrical windows running 
           along the top, down both sides of the walls.

           The entire room is draped in thick construction plastic. It’s 
           almost beautiful. Like white fabric flowing from a chandelier 
           of a wedding reception hall. 

           The floor of the room is all dirt. No concrete visible.

           The room is very dark, and the only light making it in 
           through the small windows is being filtered by the plastic. 

                                 ROBIN
                        So this...this is going to be the 
                        heart of the operation. 

           Martín and Enzo are both looking around, taking it in. They 
           observe six wooden planter boxes that have been assembled. 
           They’re around 7 feet long and 4 feet wide. 

           As they walk, they try and examine the dirt floor, to see 
           what they’re stepping on, or in..

           There also seems to be some kind of elaborate watering system 
           - or something - hanging from pulley’s connected to the 
           ceiling.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Sorry it’s so dark down here. We 
                        haven’t had time to get the new 
                        lighting system installed yet.

           Robin walks through the room making a mental list of all of 
           the things they still need to accomplish down here.

           She points to one of the wooden boxes. 

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        These are the planters that we need 
                        to fill with the potting soil from 
                        the shipping container. 

                                 ENZO
                        When do you plan to start growing?
                                 ROBIN
                        We still need to get the climate 
                        control and humidifier systems 
                        running before we can even think 
                        about planting. 

           Robin is ready to go back upstairs.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Alright! Any preguntas about any of 
                        this? I think that should be enough 
                        to get us started. Enzo?

                                 ENZO
                        No. 

                                 ROBIN
                        And Martín? Preguntas?

                                 MARTÍN
                        No. 

                                 ROBIN
                        Bueno!

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - FOYER - DAY 

           Enzo and Martín work together to hang the curtain rods and 
           curtains to cover the windows near the front door. 

           Robin is nowhere to be seen.

                                 MARTÍN
                        These rich people live in little 
                        bubbles and grow delusional. It’s 
                        not healthy.

                                 ENZO
                        I thought she seemed very nice.

                                 MARTÍN
                        She was nice. But she’s also a 
                        lunatic. 

                                 ENZO
                        I saw the way you looked at her. 
                        Don’t try and hide it from me. 
                        Besides, she’s an artist. A 
                        performer. Artists don’t feel the 
                        need to conform. They express 
                        themselves differently.
                                 MARTÍN
                        Right. The artists also needs to be 
                        handled with kids gloves and 
                        protected from any outside 
                        negativity which might affect their 
                        art. 

           Enzo laughs.

                                 ENZO
                        Yes! Exactly.

                                 MARTÍN
                        Quite a life of privilege. 

                                 ENZO
                        Well of course only the most rare 
                        and gifted artist with exceptional 
                        talent ever achieve this status. 

                                 MARTÍN
                        The others just shrivel and die. 
                        Unable to exist in the real world 
                        with the rest of us.

                                 ENZO
                        Why do you think the overdose rate 
                        of celebrities is so high?

                                 MARTÍN
                        Because they have too much money 
                        with which to buy cocaine and 
                        opioids and are unaware it is laced 
                        with fentanyl.

                                 ENZO
                        An effort to numb the pains their 
                        empathetic souls cannot endure. 

           Their arms are raised high in the air holding a curtain rod 
           as they screw it in.

           Robin passes behind them. She has changed into name-brand 
           athletic-ware and is carrying a yoga mat.

           She walks towards the kitchen and out of sight.

                                 ROBIN (O.S.)
                        You guys don’t mind if I play some 
                        music do you?

           They look her direction but don’t see her.
                                 ENZO
                        Music?

                                 ROBIN (O.S.)
                        Yes! You don’t mind?

                                 ENZO
                        No.

           A song comes on through the Sonos sound system with speakers 
           located in the ceiling all throughout the main floor. A 
           speaker right behind Enzo and Scott catch them off guard.

           The song is Tina Turner’s 1989 smash hit cover of The Best. 

           Enzo and Martín don’t mind a little music while they work. 

           Robin comes back into eye-sight. 

           At first it’s just a few dance moves to the beat, then she 
           stops. This is just the warm up. Wanted or not, the brothers 
           have front row seats to Robin’s interpretive dance 
           performance. 

           It starts out simple, but soon progresses into an elaborate 
           choreographed dance routine - the kind of scene not portrayed 
           in true cinema since the 80’s. Robin is throwing down Kevin-
           Bacon-Footloose-Warehouse-Dance-Angst-Realness.

           The brothers watch. In awe. 

           When she gets close to them, they turn back to their work. 
           But it doesn’t matter, because she’s paying them no mind.

           They continue to work as she dances through the house. It’s 
           beautiful. Magical even. 

           Unsurprisingly, Enzo is loving it. A bit more surprising, 
           though, Martín is loving it as well. 

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - DRIVEWAY - DAY

           Martín and Enzo are standing by the shipping container in the 
           drive way. 

           The sun is getting low.

           They have found plastic bins to use to transport the soil. 
           They’re about as big as a laundry basket.
           They have a system down. They help each other load and fill 
           six of the bins with dirt, and then they both begin the 
           tedious process of hauling the containers down to the 
           basement. 

           After filling another round of containers, they start the 
           journey.

           The house is quiet now - no sign of Robin.

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - FOYER - DAY

           Martín and Enzo enter the house, bins in hand. 

           Martín is looking around, looking down the hallway, snooping. 

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - BASEMENT GREENHOUSE - DAY

           Enzo and Martín arrive at the wooden planters. They pour the 
           soil in. 

           The soil falls into the box,  hardly filling it at all.

           They walk back towards the stairs. 

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - BASEMENT HALLWAY - DAY

           Martín walks towards the other end of the basement hallway.

           Enzo doesn’t follow, waiting by the base of the stairs. 

                                 MARTÍN
                        What else is down here?

                                 ENZO
                        Come on. We have too much to do.

           Enzo starts up the stairs. Martín follows. 

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - DRIVEWAY - DAY

           We’re close to losing daylight now.

           The brothers fill another round of bins with dirt, then 
           another trip to the basement. 

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - FOYER - DAY

           Martín and Enzo pass through the very empty and quiet house. 
           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - BASEMENT HALLWAY - DAY

           The brothers again pass down the stairs and into the-

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - BASEMENT GREENHOUSE - DAY

           Again they pour the soil into the wooden planter. 

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - BASEMENT HALLWAY - DAY

           Martín, still curious about the rest of the basement, he 
           walks down the hallway and approaches the other door. 

                                 MARTÍN
                        Come here.

                                 ENZO
                        No.

           Martín tries the handle on the old wooden door. 

           It’s unlocked. Martín pushes on the door. 

           Enzo curious to see as well, lingers behind.

           The room is dark. It’s a large bedroom. But it’s styled quite 
           differently than the rest of the house. Like 19th century 
           different. 

           Is this a time capsule or a re-creation? From what we can 
           see, it looks like it’s not only of another time, but of 
           another world. A European world. 

           Martín sets one foot into the bedroom when the DOORBELL from 
           upstairs rings. 

           This scares Martín and Enzo into retreat, closing the door 
           and hiding at the base of the stairs, afraid they’ve somehow 
           been caught. 

           They hear Robin coming for the door. 

           They wait in place.

           The sound of the front door being opened. 

                                 ROBIN (O.S.)
                        Hello?

           A few moments pass.

           Why can’t we hear anything?
           Then movement. Fast foot steps. A scuffle. 

           A struggle?

                                 ROBIN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        GET OFF OF ME!!!

           The pain in her voice truly terrifying. The desperation of a 
           woman fighting for her life. 

                                 ROBIN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        HELP ME!!!

           Martín and Enzo jump into action, racing up the stairs. 

                                 ROBIN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        HELP!!!

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - FOYER - NIGHT

           The sun almost completely gone now, the upstairs is much 
           darker. 

           At the top of the stairs Martín and Enzo see the open front 
           door, but do not see Robin.

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

           Turning the corner into the main room Martín sees Robin who 
           is holding a gun -- pointing the gun at somebody we cannot 
           see, somebody further around the corner. 

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        No! 

           Robin pulls the trigger and the small explosion inside of the 
           chamber sends a bullet on a destructive path towards... 
           someone. 

           We hear the person hit the ground.

           Enzo follows Martín into the room, towards Robin, and we get 
           our first look at the intruder -- and he looks a lot like 
           Enzo and Martín. 

           The similarities are hard to ignore, he appears to also be a 
           day laborer from South America. A little older than the 
           brothers. 

           Martín and Enzo are frozen.
                                 ROBIN
                        He was trying to kill me! He just 
                        came to the door and then pushed 
                        past me and ran into the house! 
                        What was he doing? He must have 
                        been trying to rob me!

           Martín and Enzo see that she is visibly shaken and upset. 
           They are temporarily frozen, unsure what to do.

           The man lays on the ground, a pool of blood forming around 
           him. 

           Is he still alive? 

           Probably?

           Right?

           He’s not moving. 

           Enzo and Martín now operating at an 11. Enzo looks to his 
           brother.

                                 ENZO
                        What should we do? Do we help him?

                                 MARTÍN
                        I don’t know.

           They look back at Robin still holding the gun. Realizing how 
           threatening she looks, she sets the gun on the table. 

                                 ROBIN
                        He was trying to kill me! 

           Breathing as if she just finished a marathon, her panic 
           starts to wear off and she begins to catch her breath.

           Martín walks towards the man on the floor. He takes a closer 
           look. He looks at Enzo and shakes his head no. 

                                 ENZO
                        What happened? Do you know this 
                        man?

                                 ROBIN
                        I’ve never seen this man in my 
                        life. He just came to the door and 
                        then started attacking me. He was 
                        going to kill me! I had no choice! 
                        Where’s my husband? My husband will 
                        know what to do.
           Enzo and Martín look at each other. Husband?

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Honey! I need you! 

           She calls off to some far place in the house, to a man we 
           have seen no sign of.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        I’m going to call the police. 

           She dials 911 into her phone.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Honey! I need your help!

           Her phone is on speaker, we hear the call ringing.

                                 DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                        911, what’s your emergency? 

           Robin hangs up the call.

                                 ROBIN
                        Wait.

           Suddenly more composed, she looks each of them in the eye. 

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Are you in this country legally?

           Neither respond. Robin takes her time speaking, going slowly 
           with each word.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        If either of you are not here 
                        legally, and you are witnesses to 
                        this, the police are going to need 
                        to question you, which means 
                        identifying you. 

           She takes a pause for them to digest this information.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        They could find out you’re here 
                        illegally and have you deported. 
                        That is not fair to you, and I 
                        would never want that to happen 
                        because of me.

           The brothers are quiet. 

           She’s right. They know she’s right. 
                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        I wish my husband were here, he’s 
                        so good with this kind of thing.

           Robin is pacing the room. Searching for guidance. 

           Then the man with a bullet in his chest groans. And his arm 
           flinches. 

           Robin covers her mouth with her hand, aghast. 

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        You two need to go. You need to 
                        leave. I will call the police and 
                        get this man help. 

           She ushers Martín and Enzo towards the door. She breaks down 
           into tears.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        I have no idea who this man is. He 
                        just came to my door and attacked 
                        me. I was scared for my life. 

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - FOYER - NIGHT

           Robin is practically pushing Enzo and Martín out. 

                                 ROBIN
                        I’m so sorry. I don’t want either 
                        of you to get in trouble. I’m so, 
                        so sorry.

           She opens up an app on her phone.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Here, let me call you an Uber. I’ll 
                        have it take you back to the Home 
                        Depot parking lot, alright?

           Enzo and Martín are trying to process what’s happening. 

                                 ENZO
                        Alright.

           Robin orders the car and then walks out of the room for a 
           moment. 

                                 MARTÍN
                        What the fuck. This is fucked. 

           Enzo looks like a deer in the headlights.
                                 ENZO
                        So fucked. 

           Robin walks back into the foyer with her wallet. She hands 
           each of the men $500 cash. 

                                 ROBIN
                        I’m so sorry this happened. You 
                        need to go. The car will pick you 
                        up at the bottom of the drive way, 
                        outside the gate. Are you okay to 
                        walk down there and meet them?

           Robin touches Martín’s arm, holding it above the elbow. 

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        And thank you, for your hard work 
                        today. I wish this were ending on 
                        different circumstances. 

           Martín refuses her eye contact. He walks outside. Robin 
           embraces Enzo with a hug. Her tears are still flowing. 

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Thank you, Enzo. 

           For a moment she lays her head in the nape of Enzo’s neck. 

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Lo Siento. 

           Enzo puts his arm around her back, consoling her. 

                                 ENZO
                        I’m sorry, too. 

           They release from the embrace, Enzo follows his brother out 
           of the house. 

           Robin closes the front door and locks the dead bolt. 

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

           Robin hops up onto a couch, kneeling on it with her arms 
           leaning on the back, like a child.

           She watches out the window as the two brothers make their way 
           down the drive. Her tears have stopped. Her demeanor has 
           quickly changed, almost anxious seeming. 

           She looks down at her phone and sees that the Uber has 
           arrived. She watches as the car moves away from her house. 
           Robin hops off the couch and walks over to the bleeding man 
           laying on her floor. 

           At some point he flipped himself over, and made an attempt at 
           crawling.

           There doesn’t appear to be much left of his spirit.

           His blood spilling onto the floor. 

           She kneels next to him and manages to flip him over, keeping 
           the blood inside of him.

           She checks his pulse and watches him a moment. 

           Satisfied, she walks into the kitchen and pulls out a glass 
           Tupperware and rubber spatula, and returns to the man. 

           She begins sweeping the blood on the ground into the 
           Tupperware. A messy task. 

           She saves as much of the blood as she can before setting the 
           blood-filled Tupperware on the counter. 

           Robin then removes the mans shirt. It’s no easy thing - 
           removing a dead mans shirt. 

           Her well manicured look starts to crack a bit as she performs 
           the task. She looks a bit more pedestrian, a bit more undone. 
           Her hair repeatedly falling in front of her eyes. 

           She wraps medical tape around his bare torso, covering up the 
           bullet-hole and keeping his blood inside of him.

           He’s now ready to be moved. 

           Robin does a few stretches -- this will be tough. 

           She grabs him underneath the armpits and lifts with her 
           knees, pulling him across the main room floor towards the 
           stair case. She has to stop and start several times. 

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

           She takes the stairs fast, letting gravity and the weight of 
           his body do the work. She moves quickly to guide him down the 
           steps and to stay ahead of the momentum.

           Made it.

           Robin grabs him under the arm pits again, dragging him into 
           the greenhouse room.
           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - BASEMENT GREENHOUSE - NIGHT

           It’s even more difficult to drag him now on the dirt floor.

           She pulls him past the wooden planters, then lets him go. His 
           torso flops to the ground, his head bouncing a bit. 

           Robin takes a moment of recovery and reflection. 

           She stretches her arms and back again.

           From the rafters in the ceiling hang several cables and tubes 
           - it looks like some kind of water and misting system. 

           There’s also a few chains, and several pulley systems. 

           She pulls down one of the chains through the pulley.

           Next, she secures a pair of metal shackles around the dead 
           mans ankles.

           Robin then connects the shackles to the end of the chain. It 
           attaches like one of those rope pull down attachments at the 
           gym when you’re working your triceps on arm day. 

           We hear some movement. Robin looks to one of the windows, 
           sitting on the ledge are the two birds from earlier. 

           They seem anxious.

                                 ROBIN
                        Just chill a moment, k?

           Before she begins the next step she takes a moment to catch 
           her breath and fix her hair -- here comes the hardest part.

           Robin has to use her own brute strength to pull the cable 
           system, hoisting the man into the air. 

           It’s fucking hard, and takes everything she has - but she’s 
           successful.

           The dead man hangs upside down, dangling from the rafter. 

           Robin locks the system into place, holding him up there.

           She’s not above taking a small moment of celebration and self 
           appreciation.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Alright!
           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

           Robin sprays cleaner on the blood that got on her floor, then 
           uses a Swiffer Wet Jet to mop it up.

           She grabs the Tupperware full of blood and returns to the 
           basement. 

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - BASEMENT GREENHOUSE - NIGHT

           Robin places a single wooden chair next to the dangling body. 

           She enjoys finally being able to sit down.

           The Tupperware sits on her lap, in her hand is a turkey 
           baster. 

                                 ROBIN
                        Come here babies. 

           The two black birds on the window ledge fly over to her and 
           land at her feet. 

           Then another bird flies into the room through the open 
           window.

           And another. 

           There are five birds total, all different looking. Some land 
           on Robin. Some of them land on the dirt floor below the 
           hanging man.

           The look up at her, and at the man. The birds begin to caw in 
           anticipation.

           Robin smiles at them.

           The cawing becomes louder as she uses the turkey baster to 
           suck up the blood from the Tupperware. 

           One by one she begins to feed the birds blood, a few drops at 
           a time. 

           She drops the blood into their mouths, trying to get them all 
           fed. She quickly runs out of blood in the Tupperware. 

           The birds start cawing again. They are not yet full.

           Robin sets the Tupperware and turkey baster aside. 

           Out of her pocket she pulls little claws that look like bird 
           talons. She caps them over her fingers until all of the 
           fingers on her right hand are covered. 
           She admires the talons on her fingers the way people look at 
           their freshly painted nails - holding her hand out at a 
           distance to get a good look.

           Robin stands next to the dangling man. She uses the talon to 
           split the man’s torso open, starting near his belly button 
           and opening him up all the way down to his lower lip.  

           The blood starts running down him, covering his head in blood 
           and dripping on to the floor. 

           The birds are ready, drinking every last drop. 

           Robin looks at the tip of the claw on her pointer finger, 
           which has blood dripping down it. 

           She cautiously puts her tongue out and touches the end of it 
           to the blood, seeing how it tastes.

           The taste makes her squint, but she smiles. Like she just ate 
           a sour patch kid. 

           Robin licks more of the blood off of her finger. She cocks 
           her head to the side, not bad. 

           She sits back down on the wooden chair and watches the birds 
           happy and grazing. 

           One of the birds stops eating and looks at her.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Awe, do you miss your Daddy?

           Once the birds have finished feeding, she takes them one by 
           one and places them in their own wooden box, pushing the soil 
           around making a little bed for them. She half buries the 
           birds.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        There we are.

           Each of the six birds now have their own respective wooden 
           box, which are much larger in size compared to the birds.

           INT. MARTÍN’S TRUCK - NIGHT

           Martín drives as he and Enzo sit in stunned silence. 

           The endless runway of the dimly lit valley streets lead 
           Martín and Enzo to places unseen, baked in fear and anxiety.

           Martín uses a MAPS APP on his phone to guide them. Glancing 
           from the screen to the road. 
           He double checks the screen again. And again. Are they going 
           the right way?

           INT. ABUELA’S HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

           Enzo and Martín quietly enter, unsure if the house will be 
           asleep.

           The house is not asleep.

           María Isabel comes running for her Father.

                                 MARÍA ISABEL
                        Daddy! 

           Araceli is not far behind her.

           Martín lifts little María Isabel up and kisses her.

                                 MARTÍN
                        Hello my love. 

           He sets her down. Araceli smiles at him, hoping for good 
           news. 

                                 MARTÍN (CONT'D)
                        Hello my love.

           Martín smiles and kisses her.

                                 ARACELI
                        You’re home late! 

                                 MARTÍN
                        Don’t sound too excited about that! 

                                 ARACELI
                        You found work?!

           Araceli’s eyes so hopeful. Genuine excitement.

           Martín glances to Enzo to gauge how he’s doing. Not well. 
           Enzo has no smiles, no joy. 

           He catches Martín evaluating him and snaps out of it a bit. 

                                 MARTÍN
                        We did find work. 

           Martín and Enzo know they have a decision to make. 

           Enzo steps in to help Martín. He leans down to María Isabel 
           and holds her hand in his.
                                 ENZO
                        You would not believe where your 
                        father and I worked today! 

                                 MARÍA ISABEL
                        Where?! 

                                 ENZO
                        At the home of a MOVIE STAR! 

                                 MARÍA ISABEL
                        A movie star??

                                 ENZO
                        Yes! A very famous American 
                        actress.

           Araceli is overwhelmed with joy for her husband and his 
           successful day. She’s about to cry.

           Martín looks at her, their arms wrap around each other. 

                                 ARACELI
                        An actress hired you for work?

                                 MARTÍN
                        Yes. It’s true.

           A kiss. 

           Maybe, just maybe, everything will be alright.

           INT. ABUELA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Three generations of Abuela’s FAMILY MEMBERS in the kitchen, 
           the adults sitting around a kitchen table, passing a phone 
           with Robin’s IMDB photo on the screen.

                                 HERMANA
                        I love her! She’s always so good in 
                        everything. 

           The phone is passed. The young KIDS try to crowd in around 
           the adults to get a look. 

           The room abuzz with excitement.

                                 TÍA
                        I want to look as good as her when 
                        I’m her age.

           Abuela smiles and looks at the brothers. 
                                 ABUELA
                        How did she treat you, was she 
                        nice?

                                 MARTÍN
                        She was. She treated us very well.

                                 TÍA
                        What was her house like?

                                 ENZO
                        It was very modern and beautiful. 
                        Up in the Hills of Hollywood. Very 
                        clean and bright.

                                 TÍA
                        Did you take any pictures?

                                 ENZO
                        No, I didn’t.

                                 ABUELA
                        Will you go back to work for her 
                        tomorrow?

           Enzo and Martín look at each other. 

                                 MARTÍN
                        It was probably just a one time 
                        thing.

                                 ABUELA
                        How come?

           Martín falters over his words.

                                 MARTÍN
                        Well, I’m not sure she has anymore 
                        work for us.

                                 ABUELA
                        She’s rich. Rich people always have 
                        more work to do.

           Martín nods and smiles. Next topic please.

                                 HERMANA
                        Maybe it could turn into something 
                        permanent! 

                                 MARTÍN
                        Yeah, maybe.
           Crying coming from the back bedroom. Martín quickly jumps up.

                                 MARTÍN (CONT'D)
                        I’ll go check on him.

           INT. ABUELA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Martín at his baby boy’s crib, lifting him into his arms. He 
           is still crying.

                                 MARTÍN
                        Shh. Daddy’s got you baby boy.

           Araceli walks into the room.

                                 MARTÍN (CONT'D)
                        How has he been doing today?

                                 ARACELI
                        I put on fresh bandages but it 
                        still doesn’t look like it’s 
                        healing.

           Martín reaches into his pocket and hands Araceli the $500 
           cash. Seeing the multiple stacked $100 bills is enough to 
           make her start welling up with tears. She throws her arms 
           around Martín. 

                                 ARACELI (CONT'D)
                        Thank you, God. Thank you.

           She looks Martín in the eyes. He’s emotional as well.

                                 ARACELI (CONT'D)
                        And thank you for working so hard 
                        for us. I know it isn’t easy.

           Both faces leaking tears.

                                 ARACELI (CONT'D)
                        Did you tell him thank you?

                                 MARTÍN
                        Who?

           Araceli points to the sky.

           Martín shakes his head no.

           Araceli kneels on the floor, she pulls Martín down with her.
                                 MARTÍN (CONT'D)
                        Our Lord and Savior, thank you for 
                        providing for our small family on 
                        this day. We know that through you 
                        all things are possible, and by you 
                        all things are given. Amen.

                                 ARACELI
                        Amen.

           They share another kiss, which is interrupted by Enzo walking 
           into the room.

                                 ENZO
                               (quietly)
                        Sorry to interrupt. I was wondering 
                        if I could use your car tonight?

           Martín curious to know more.

                                 ENZO (CONT'D)
                        I need to go decompress somewhere 
                        and have a drink. It’s too loud 
                        here.

                                 MARTÍN
                        Of course.

           Martín finds his keys and hands them to him.

                                 MARTÍN (CONT'D)
                        You’re okay?

                                 ENZO
                        I’m good. You good?

                                 MARTÍN
                        I’m good.

           Enzo smiles and leaves.

                                 ARACELI
                        Where is he going?

                                 MARTÍN
                        I think out with friends.

                                 ARACELI
                        What friends?

                                 MARTÍN
                        I don’t know.
           INT. MARTÍN'S TRUCK - NIGHT

           Enzo gets into the drivers seat, he’s not very comfortable 
           handling the car, he puts it into drive. 

           Again cruising empty late-night valley streets.

           INT. MARTÍN'S TRUCK - NIGHT

           Enzo parks across the street from an unmarked building, the 
           entrance to which is a black door. 

           A single light above the entrance the only thing illuminating 
           the sidewalk.

           He sits in the car waiting, watching. 

           INT. ABUELA'S HOUSE - KIDS ROOM - NIGHT

           Martín and Araceli are tucking María Isabel into bed. She 
           sleeps in a room with some of the other CHILDREN.

                                 ARACELI
                        Goodnight sweet angel.

                                 MARÍA ISABEL
                        Goodnight Mama. Goodnight Papa.

                                 MARTÍN
                        Goodnight sweet heart.

           A kiss from each before they turn off the lights and pass 
           through the house returning to their sleeping quarters.

           INT. ABUELA'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Martín walks into the bathroom leaving Araceli alone in the 
           dimly lit room. The house has finally quieted.

           Araceli pulls the money from her pocket and counts it. She 
           gives it a kiss and then hides it in a safe space.

           Martín finishes in the bathroom and returns, he’s greeted 
           with a smile and another kiss.

                                 ARACELI
                        So how was she? How was she really?

                                 MARTÍN
                        Total psycho.
                                 ARACELI
                        I knew it! Was she mean?

                                 MARTÍN
                        No, she wasn’t mean. Just insane.

                                 ARACELI
                        Did she speak Spanish?

                                 MARTÍN
                        Very little.

           Araceli switches to speaking English.

                                 ARACELI
                        Well we are going to need to start 
                        those English lessons again if 
                        you’re going to be working for big 
                        movie stars.

           Martín not much interested. Araceli tries to change his mood 
           with a kiss.

           And another. And another. The quiet, slow kisses don’t stop 
           as her hands moves to unzip his pants.

           INT. MARTÍN'S TRUCK - NIGHT

           Enzo still sits in the truck, watching the unmarked door. We 
           don’t see any one going in or out. He pops a breath mint, 
           then gets out of his car. 

           EXT. DEEP SAN FERNANDO VALLEY - NIGHT

           He crosses the quiet street and approaches the entrance. He 
           opens the door and enters.

           INT. BATHHOUSE - LOBBY - NIGHT

           Enzo walks in to a small waiting area. 

           It’s a small square box of a room. There are no seats.

           There is a pane glass window with a man sitting behind it - 
           like a gas station late at night. To the left of the window 
           is a door.

           A camera up in the corner watches Enzo.

           Enzo takes his place in line, behind another male CUSTOMER 
           who is being helped at the window.
           Enzo waits, he looks around. The wood paneled walls are 
           covered in pictures of shirtless and naked men. 

           There are ads for upcoming events at the bathhouse. Special 
           discounts and fetish nights. 

           A TV mounted in the corner plays gay porn. 

           The clerk behind the counter slides a white towel through an 
           opening at the bottom to the customer, and then a key on a 
           rubber bracelet. 

                                 BATHHOUSE CLERK
                        You’re in room number 41. Have fun.

           We hear an unsettlingly loud buzzer and the sound of a dead 
           bolt being unlocked.

           The customer in front of Enzo disappears through the door, 
           which closes again. The buzzing finally stops and we hear the 
           door lock again.

                                 BATHHOUSE CLERK (CONT'D)
                        Hello. Room or locker?

                                 ENZO
                        What?

                                 BATHHOUSE CLERK
                        You can either rent a locker, to 
                        put your clothes in, or you can 
                        rent a room for the night.

                                 ENZO
                        How much?

                                 BATHHOUSE CLERK
                        $25 for a locker. $38 for a room. 
                        $48 if you want the deluxe room.

                                 ENZO
                        Room please. 

           The clerk slides two small pieces of paper under the window, 
           small contracts and waivers for Enzo to sign.

                                 ENZO (CONT'D)
                        Sign here and here. 

           Enzo signs and then hands the man $38 cash.

           The man takes the money, and then pushes a white towel 
           through the hole in the glass. Enzo grabs it, followed by a 
           room key on a rubber bracelet. 
                                 BATHHOUSE CLERK
                        You’re in room number 16. Have fun.

           The loud buzzing signaling the unlocking of the door. 

           Enzo gathers his things and opens the door, entering the 
           unknown, abandoning safety.

           INT. ABUELA'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Araceli is on top of Martín. He flips her over. They are 
           heated and ready to advance. 

           He kisses her passionately. Firmly rubbing the outline of her 
           body, his hand crossing her torso and between her legs. 

           She grabs his crotch, checking on his status. Once confirmed, 
           she leans her mouth up to his ear.

                                 ARACELI
                               (whispering)
                        Let’s go to the bathroom.

           He looks at her a moment, deciding.

           Okay. 

           He pulls himself off of her and then makes a run to the 
           bathroom. Araceli follows. 

           INT. ABUELA’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           He lays on the small bathroom floor, pulling off his clothes. 

           She’s on top, straddling him.

           Her arm reaches behind her, she grabs onto him, guiding him 
           inside of her.

           She moves up and down on top of him. 

           He’s relieved - penetration successful. 

           They both are. 

           Enjoying the moment. She continues, leaning down, touching 
           her chest with his. 

           Something catches his eye in the bathroom window behind her.

           It’s a bird. Inside the bathroom, perched on the window. 
           It looks similar to the bird he saw at Robin’s house. 

           It’s watching him. Watching them.

           He looks back to Araceli, the excitement and pleasure gone 
           from his face -- now only fear.

           INT. BATHHOUSE - FIRST FLOOR - NIGHT

           The space is dimly lit -- which helps the clientele look 
           better. Loud house music is playing. Really loud. 

           Enzo looking like a rat in a maze. 

           There’s workout equipment in the first room, which nobody 
           uses. It feels out of place.

           Further there are three showers, intentionally exposed to the 
           room, to be watched. A NUDE MAN is in the middle shower, 
           slowly lathering himself. Never breaking eye contact with 
           Enzo. The man watches Enzo with a blank expression. 

           Enzo, terrified, looks away. 

           He passes a row of lockers, and then a second row. 

           There are FOUR MEN in various stages of dress and undress, 
           all with white gym towels. 

           The men see Enzo and evaluate him. 

           Enzo looks away.

           Enzo sees a sign with an arrow pointing up the stairs 
           indicating where the rooms are. He hurries towards them.

           INT. BATHHOUSE - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT

           Enzo passes through rows of maze-like hallways. All identical 
           with repeating doors. 

           The rooms are small, barely enough to fit a twin bed. 

           There are televisions all throughout the halls and in each of 
           the rooms, all playing gay porn.

           As Enzo passes the rooms, he glances inside some of them. 

           One room has a NAKED MAN by himself, touching his genitals, 
           staring at passerby. He looks to be in his 70’s or 80’s. 
           TWO MEN in white towels pass him in the hallway, talking to 
           each other. The conversation stops as they pass Enzo, they 
           both evaluate his body.

           Enzo continues past. 

           Another room has an open door, TWO MEN are fucking, a third 
           man stands near the bed watching.

           Another room, a MAN in a towel calls to him.

                                 MAN IN TOWEL
                        Hey. 

           Enzo doesn’t respond. 

                                 MAN IN TOWEL (CONT'D)
                        Come in.

           Enzo does not.

           Finally he finds ROOM #16. He unlocks it and enters.

           INT. BATHHOUSE - ROOM #16 - NIGHT

           Enzo quickly shuts the door behind him, then locks it.

           Gay porn is playing on the television. Enzo hurries to find 
           the remote and turns it off. 

           From his pocket he pulls put a small bottle of fireball 
           whiskey. He drinks some, and then takes his clothes off and 
           wraps the white towel around his waist. 

           He lays down on the small bed and stares at the ceiling. 

           In between the spikes of loud house music he hears the sounds 
           of men fucking. 

           He closes his eyes and covers his ears. 

           While he lays with eyes closed, some kind of smoke or dense 
           fog enters the room below the door. 

           It fills the small room, so thick it’s hard for us to see 
           Enzo. We lose him to the blasting house music and fog. 

           INT. ABUELA'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           The bird watches Martín and Araceli as she rides him. Martín 
           tries not to look at it, but he can’t help it. 
           He looks down at himself, surprised he’s still hard. 

           She’s working overtime to get them to finish. Then they both 
           hear it - cries from their baby boy.

           Neither of them stop. But they do look at each other -- 
           questioning whether they should. They know they should.

           They continue anyway.

           INT. BATHHOUSE - ROOM #16 - NIGHT

           Enzo’s room has completely filled with fog, but he continues 
           to sleep. His breathing becomes short, struggling for oxygen.

           His breathing rattles, the way dying people scrape for their 
           last few breaths. Louder and louder, the screeching sound of 
           him sucking in air. 

           His eyes pop open, in them the look of drowning until 
           finally, he passes out.

           INT. ABUELA’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Martín flips Araceli over. More determined than ever to 
           finish.

           The crying baby is so damn loud. 

           He groans in her ear, the release he’s needed. Araceli tries 
           to hide the noises she’s making as well.

           The bird watches them both finish. Satisfied? They quickly 
           dress and run out to rescue their baby.

           INT. ABUELA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The freshly bred couple race to their screaming baby boy’s 
           crib side. 

           Araceli is there first.

           Martín turns on a lamp and sees a bird on top of his son, 
           pecking at the wound on his baby boy’s head, drinking the 
           blood.

                                 ARACELI
                        Get off!

           She tries to swat the bird with her hands. It continues to 
           feed on the babe. 
           Before Martín can make it to the crib, Araceli has the bird 
           with both hands, she snaps it’s neck backwards, instantly 
           killing it.

           Martín picks up their child, it’s shocking how much blood is 
           coming down his head.

           Araceli still holding the feathered creature in her hands -- 
           murderer of fowl. Martín not used to seeing her like this.

           Araceli throws the bird down, both of them deeply upset.

           She grabs a rag and holds it to the baby’s wound.

                                 ARACELI (CONT'D)
                        We need to go to the emergency 
                        room.

                                 MARTÍN
                        Yes.

           Their eyes locked on each other, frozen.

           INT. BATHHOUSE - ROOM #16 - NIGHT

           Enzo’s room is once again clear of any smoke or fog. 

           Still asleep on the bed, he is startled awake by the sound of 
           his door clicking closed. 

           An INTRUDER is standing at the foot of his bed, watching him. 
           A very attractive, virile man. 

           His veins flowing with blood. A white towel wrapped tightly 
           around his toned body.

                                 INTRUDER
                        Hey.

           Enzo’s eyes are wide. The way he holds himself up on the bed, 
           he looks sickly. 

                                 INTRUDER (CONT'D)
                        Wanna play?

           Enzo manages to nod his head yes. 

                                 INTRUDER (CONT'D)
                        Come here.

           He points to the foot of the bed, directly in front of him. 
           The man holds his finger and arm extended, demanding Enzo 
           obey. 
                                 INTRUDER (CONT'D)
                        Sit here.

           Enzo crawls across the bed, eyes locked on the intruding man, 
           scared to death. Scared of death, in this moment.

           Enzo reaches the end of the bed, he pulls his legs out from 
           under him and drops them over the edge, sitting straight up.

                                 INTRUDER (CONT'D)
                        Do you like the way I look?

           The wall behind the Intruder is a full length mirror. For one 
           moment, Enzo’s eyes glance to the mirror, where we can see no 
           reflection of the Intruder, only Enzo, sitting on the edge of 
           the bed, looking at himself.

                                 INTRUDER (CONT'D)
                        Do you like the way I look?

           Enzo’s eyes go back to the man, he nods his head yes.

           The intruding man holds his arms out, looking down at his 
           torso, allowing Enzo to have what he wants of him. Enzo pulls 
           on the mans towel, letting it drop to the ground. He observes 
           the man from head to toe. 

           The man holds Enzo by the chin.

                                 INTRUDER (CONT'D)
                        You need to listen to her.

           Something is happening to the intruders eyes. Enzo cannot 
           look away from them, he’s forced to stare into them.

                                 INTRUDER (CONT'D)
                        You need to do what she asks of 
                        you.

           Now the same thing is happening to Enzo’s eyes. He looks 
           hypnotized.

                                 INTRUDER (CONT'D)
                        You need to listen to her.

                                 ENZO
                        I need to listen to her.

                                 INTRUDER
                        You need to do what she asks of 
                        you.

                                 ENZO
                        I need to do what she asks of me. 
                                 INTRUDER
                        Anything she requires, you are 
                        hers. 

                                 ENZO
                        Anything she requires, I am hers.

           The intruder points to the other side of the bed.

                                 INTRUDER
                        Roll over to your stomach.

           Enzo crawls back the way he came collapsing onto his stomach.

           The intruder moves on top of him.

           Enzo preparing for what will come next. 

           The arm of the man reaches up and extends over Enzo’s 
           shoulder, grabbing him. Except it is no longer the arm of the 
           man who appeared to Enzo, it is the wing of a black bird.

           A giant wing, of a giant bird.

           Suffocating him. Wrapping over him. Consuming him.

           Enzo is flipped over onto his back, terrified. The face of a 
           giant black bird is mirroring his, staring back at him.

           The birds eyes glow red as embers.

           The large beak of the bird starts to open, wider and wider. 
           It looks big enough to consume him whole.

           Enzo cannot look away. His eyes are locked into the bird’s.

           Then, from the open beak, comes the loudest, most high pitch 
           caw sound ever heard. Evil.

           It grows so loud our only choice is to-

                                                                     CUT TO:

           INT. ABUELA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

           Martín wakes up in his bed -- alone. The windows are bright 
           with sun. It’s late in the day. Araceli is nowhere in sight. 

           He gets out of bed and throws on some clothes. 

           He passes through the curtain into the kids room -- empty. 
           Passing through another room we see a sleeping Enzo. Martín 
           wakes him.

                                 MARTÍN
                        Enzo. Wake up.

           He kicks him with his foot.

                                 MARTÍN (CONT'D)
                        Wake up.

           Enzo rolls over, trying to make sense of where he is. 

                                 ENZO
                        What? What time is it?

           Araceli enters the room holding their baby boy, rushing with 
           news.

                                 ARACELI
                               (Whisper yelling)
                        Martín, she’s here! 

           Martín looks at their baby boy, who has fresh bandages, which 
           look much more professional. The baby is smiling and happy.

                                 ARACELI (CONT'D)
                        Robin is here! 

                                 MARTÍN
                        What! No! What?

                                 ARACELI
                        She knocked on our door, I could 
                        not believe it was her! She said 
                        she was worried because you both 
                        did not show up for work today, and 
                        she hadn’t heard from you, and she 
                        was concerned. 

           Martín takes a seat on the edge of a bed. 

                                 MARTÍN
                        This is not good.

                                 ARACELI
                        No, it’s completely fine. I told 
                        her we had a medical emergency with 
                        our son last night and had to go to 
                        the emergency room. She completely 
                        understood and is just happy you’re 
                        okay. 

           Martín looks to Enzo, who is emotionless about the news. 
                                 MARTÍN
                        What time is it?

                                 ARACELI
                        Almost noon.

                                 MARTÍN
                        I can’t believe you let me sleep 
                        this long. 

                                 ARACELI
                        You needed the rest. She’s so 
                        lovely. She’s waiting. Get ready.

           INT. ABUELA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           There she is, Robin, seated at the kitchen table looking 
           completely put together and perfect once again - as if she 
           had not drug around a body all night.

           Abuela’s entire family has gathered around Robin, who is 
           entertaining the family with pictures. 

           Araceli beams with pride as Martín and Enzo enter the room. 
           Robin lights up with a smile.

                                 ROBIN
                        Martín! Enzo! I’m so happy to hear 
                        that you are both okay. I was so 
                        worried.

           She stands up from the table and gives them each a hug. The 
           family watches, amazed this celebrity cares so much for them.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        It’s getting late though, and we 
                        have a lot to get done!
                               (to the family)
                        I’m hosting a fundraiser at my 
                        house tomorrow. There’s much to do.

                                 ARACELI
                        I can only imagine.

           Araceli looks to her husband.

                                 ARACELI (CONT'D)
                        Are you hungry? Do you need 
                        anything to eat before you go?

                                 MARTÍN
                        No thank you.
           Robin turns to Enzo.

                                 ROBIN
                        Are you ready, Enzo?

                                 ENZO
                        Yes. I’m ready.

                                 ROBIN
                        Wonderful!

           Robin puts her sunglasses on and walks to the door. 

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        So lovely to have met you all. 
                        Truly. 

           EXT. ABUELA’S HOUSE - DAY

           Martín and Enzo follow Robin to her white Tesla Model X.

                                 MARTÍN
                        I’m driving us separately. We’ll 
                        follow you.

           Robin evaluates him. A challenge?

                                 ROBIN
                        Alright. I’ll go slow.

           She smiles and gets in the car. 

           INT. MARTÍN'S TRUCK - DAY

           Martín follows the white Tesla.

                                 MARTÍN
                        What is she doing?

                                 ENZO
                        I don’t know.

                                 MARTÍN
                        Is she blackmailing us?

                                 ENZO
                        What?

                                 MARTÍN
                        Does she think she owns us or 
                        something now? Trying to force us 
                        to do more work for her?
                                 ENZO
                        I don’t know.

                                 MARTÍN
                        I can’t believe she came to our 
                        house! Christ! This fucking woman! 

           Martín grows to an all out rage.

                                 ENZO
                        Yeah.

                                 MARTÍN
                        How does she even know where we 
                        live?! Did you give her our 
                        address?

                                 ENZO
                        No.

                                 MARTÍN
                        How did she know?

           Enzo doesn’t bother to reply.

                                 MARTÍN (CONT'D)
                        Should we call the police?

                                 ENZO
                        Sure.

           Martín is growing frustrated with his apathetic brother.

                                 MARTÍN
                        I can’t tell Araceli.

           Martín hits his hand on the steering wheel repeatedly.

                                 MARTÍN (CONT'D)
                        Fuck! Fuck this woman! 

           Martín SLAMS on the brakes, he swerves into the next lane and 
           pulls a U-turn. 

                                 ENZO
                        What are you doing?!

           Enzo suddenly alert.

                                 MARTÍN
                        We’re not going with her. 

                                 ENZO
                        Yes we are. 
                                 MARTÍN
                        No.

                                 ENZO
                        You don’t have to go, but I want 
                        the money. It’s easy work. 

           Martín keeps driving. 

                                 ENZO (CONT'D)
                        Let me out! 

                                 MARTÍN
                        Are you fucking serious?

                                 ENZO
                        Yes! I’m getting out! 

           Martín pulls to the side of the road. Enzo exits the truck 
           and stands on the side walk.

           Martín looks in his rear-view mirror, he sees that Robin has 
           flipped the U-turn as well, and is looming nearby.

           Enzo walks to her car and gets in.

                                 MARTÍN
                        Fuck! 

           Martín puts the car in drive and pulls away.

           Martín pulls into the home depot parking lot and parks. We 
           see a similar looking group of WORKERS gathered. 

           EXT. HOME DEPOT PARKING LOT - DAY

           Martín sits against a tree, near the group of men, deep in 
           thought -- then suddenly he jumps up.

                                 MARTÍN
                        Fuck! 

           He gets back into his truck. 

           INT. MARTÍN'S TRUCK - DAY

           Martín drives towards the hills, though not exactly sure 
           where he’s going. 
           He calls Enzo multiple times, who does not answer.

           INT./EXT. MARTÍN'S TRUCK - DAY

           Martín’s beat up old truck slows near certain houses that 
           look familiar, and speeds up passing others that don’t, 
           trying to find Robin’s house. 

           Martín pulls over in frustration. He texts Enzo. I CHANGED MY 
           MIND, I’M COMING TO WORK, WHAT IS HER ADDRESS?

           He waits a moment. No response. 

           He googles ROBIN OZANNE HOUSE on his phone, a VARIETY REAL-
           ESTALKER article pops up, which links to an MLS listing which 
           lists the general neighborhood. 

           He puts it in to GOOGLE MAPS and drives. 

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - DRIVEWAY - DAY

           Martín finds the gate to her driveway and parks his truck a 
           safe distance away from the house.

           He walks up the long drive way, approaching with caution. He 
           see’s a number of WORKERS, all LATINO. 

           Two WINDOW WASHERS are on ladders. Three GARDENERS work to 
           get the yard in shape. Four CLEARNERS work inside the house. 

           Strangely, most of them seem to be cleaning up and finishing 
           for the day. Some of the workers give weary looks to Martín.

           The front door is open. Plastic has been laid down on the 
           floors, protecting them. Two MOVERS are bringing in a 
           VICTORIAN ERA SOFA. 

           Martín approaches a DELIVERY MAN near a truck.

                                 MARTÍN
                        What is all this?

                                 DELIVERY MAN
                        No fucking clue.

                                 MARTÍN
                        This woman’s crazy, right?

                                 DELIVERY MAN
                        I guess so. All rich people are. 
                        All this stuff was shipped in from 
                        Romania. 
           The man nods to the container with the soil from yesterday.

                                 DELIVERY MAN (CONT'D)
                        That container, too. That dirt is 
                        from Romania. Who ships dirt from 
                        another country?

                                 MARTÍN
                        No clue, my friend. 

           The delivery men get into their truck and leave. 

           The other movers are back, this time bringing a large wooden 
           crate into the house. Martín follows them in.

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - FOYER - DAY

           Martín watches as the movers deliver the crate to the first 
           floor bedroom.

           As they set it down and turn back to leave, he moves deeper 
           into the house to avoid being detected. 

           From the basement, he hears talking. He hears Robin. He 
           carefully walks down the stair case close enough to hear.

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS BASEMENT - DAY

           Martín sees Robin holding Enzo’s head with both hands, she 
           talks with her lips an inch away from his ear. Enzo looks 
           like a child being coached by his mother. 

                                 ROBIN
                        He must return to the earth in 
                        which he was buried each and every 
                        morning, before dawn. 

                                 ENZO
                        I understand.

                                 ROBIN
                        You must help protect him while he 
                        sleeps. 

                                 ENZO
                        Yes.

                                 ROBIN
                               (Romanian)
                        Dacă patul său nu este pregătit 
                        până când se trezeųte, va crede că 
                        l-am eųuat.
                                 ENZO
                               (Romanian)
                        Nu-i vom da greų, vă promit.

           Martín squints, confused, as he witnesses his brother 
           speaking in Romanian.

           The movers, bringing another piece of VICTORIAN ERA FURNITURE 
           to the basement, come down the stairs -- towards Martín. 

           With no where to go, the movers force Martín to finish 
           walking down the stairs, where he is exposed to Robin.

           Robin smiles warmly at him.

                                 ROBIN
                        Martín. I’m so glad you’re here. 
                        Enzo just finished moving the last 
                        of the soil. Right, Enzo?

                                 ENZO
                        That’s right.

                                 ROBIN
                        He’s been such a help.

                                 MARTÍN
                        Why do you need us?

                                 ROBIN
                        Excuse me?

           Martín trips over his English.

                                 MARTÍN
                        You have many workers. Why do you 
                        need us? Why you came to our 
                        house?? Why us?

           Robin puts a hand on his shoulder and smiles, as if a big 
           miscommunication has suddenly been understood or solved. 

                                 ROBIN
                        Oh! I’m having a political 
                        fundraiser -- well hosting, a 
                        political fundraiser, here at the 
                        house, TOMORROW! Would you believe 
                        it? We have so much to get done.

           The conversation is interrupted by the movers, they approach 
           Robin with a form to sign. 

                                 MOVERS
                        We’re finished.
                                 ROBIN
                        Great, thank you so much. 

           Robin signs the form and the movers leave. 

           She points towards the greenhouse door, which is closed.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        So this -- this is a real headache. 
                        I might have gotten in over my head 
                        with this one. With Marijuana being 
                        legal, my friend convinced me to--

                                 MARTÍN
                        You’re growing marijuana in the 
                        basement. I know! 

           Martín, wanting to scream at this repeated scene.

                                 ROBIN
                        Anyhow, needless to say, the house 
                        is not ready! But we’ll get there. 
                        Somehow, we’ll get there.

           Martín looks to Enzo - are you seeing this? Enzo has no 
           reaction.

                                 MARTÍN
                        Did you call police?

                                 ROBIN
                        I can’t believe the fundraiser is 
                        already tomorrow. I feel so rushed.

                                 MARTÍN
                        We are leaving.

                                 ROBIN
                        What? Of course you can leave. I do 
                        appreciate all of the help. 

                                 MARTÍN
                               (to Enzo)
                        Let’s go.

           Martín walks upstairs, Enzo follows him.

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - DUSK 

           Enzo and Martín emerge from the house, it seems like Martín 
           might actually be successful in getting Enzo to leave.

           Then Martín hears it--
                                 ROBIN
                        Enzo?

           Enzo stops walking. 

                                 MARTÍN
                        No. We have to go.

                                 ENZO
                        Yes?

                                 ROBIN
                        Actually, there is one more 
                        thing...

           Martín turns around, towards Robin.

                                 MARTÍN
                        What do you want! 

                                 ROBIN
                        My husband, he’s ill. Quite ill. 
                        He’s afraid he’s going to be 
                        disturbed tomorrow, by the party. 
                        And quite frankly, I agree with 
                        him.

                                 MARTÍN
                        What husband! 

                                 ROBIN
                        Yes, my husband. He’s very, very 
                        ill. 

                                 MARTÍN
                        No. 

                                 ROBIN
                        Unfortunately yes, quite ill. He 
                        sleeps in the first floor bedroom 
                        because it’s easier for him -- no 
                        stairs. 

           Robin speaks slowly, precisely, delivering her perfectly 
           rehearsed monologue.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        I’ve spent the day preparing a room 
                        for him in the basement - that’s 
                        what I’ve been working on. It’s 
                        much quieter down there. 

           She speaks to both of them, yet she locks eyes with Martín.
                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        However, he’s far too weak to move 
                        himself. And I, I’m not strong 
                        enough to move him on my own.

           Martín looks at the setting sun, which is now gone. 

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Would it be too much to ask you to 
                        help me carefully move him to the 
                        basement bedroom?

                                 MARTÍN
                        Sorry, no.

                                 ENZO
                        Of course, we can help. 

                                 MARTÍN
                               (to Enzo)
                        It’s getting late. Our family needs 
                        us at home. 

                                 ENZO
                        Martín, she has only us. Of course 
                        we would help her move her sick 
                        husband. 

                                 MARTÍN
                        Please, Enzo. Please.

                                 ENZO
                        After we do this, we can leave.

           Martín studies his brothers face for a long moment.

                                 MARTÍN
                        Fine. 

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - FIRST FLOOR BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Robin leads them into the first floor bedroom.

           An open wooden crate is laying on the floor, pushed to the 
           corner. An OLD MAN lays on top of the bed. Robin’s face 
           lights up when she sees him. 

           We can see only the man’s face, the rest of his body is 
           wrapped very carefully, very tightly in a sheet. His arms are 
           securely crossed over his navel. 

                                 ROBIN
                        Hi baby.
           She places a hand on his chest and gives him a kiss on the 
           forehead.

           Martín sees the man’s face for the first time.

                                 MARTÍN
                        THIS MAN IS DEAD!!! 

           Martín cannot believe what he is seeing. He backs up, hitting 
           against the wall. 

                                 MARTÍN (CONT'D)
                        HE’S DEAD!

           Robin smiles.

                                 ROBIN
                        Martín, I assure you, my husband is 
                        not dead. 

                                 MARTÍN
                        That is not a living thing.

                                 ROBIN
                        He is very ill, but that is hurtful 
                        and insulting for you to say this. 

           Enzo approaches the bed, he places the back of his palm on 
           the mans forehead.

                                 ENZO
                        This man is very ill.

                                 ROBIN
                        That’s right, Enzo. He is.

                                 MARTÍN
                        Enzo! Please, can we leave! Now! 

                                 ENZO
                        They need our help, brother.

           Martín looks towards the front door.

                                 ROBIN
                        Martín, if you don’t want to help, 
                        you can leave. I understand.

           Martín looks at his brother. He refuses to leave him.

                                 MARTÍN
                        No. Let’s just hurry up.
                                 ROBIN
                        He’s not contagious. There’s 
                        nothing to be afraid of. You don’t 
                        have to touch him, just use the 
                        blanket underneath. Please though, 
                        I beg you, please be gentle.

           Enzo picks up one end of the blanket near the old man’s feet, 
           Martín the other, near the man’s head.

                                 ENZO
                        One, two, three. 

           Together they left him up. This is the first time we’ve had a 
           clear look at the man’s face. 

           He does, indeed, look dead. 

           His skin is shriveled and grey, deader than grey, pale white. 
           No blood to his face whatsoever. No moistness in his skin. 
           His hair mostly gone. He has many skin imperfections that 
           make him look very sick. 

           Almost looking more creature than man. 

           Martín notices that there are feathers coming out around the 
           opening near his body, but cannot see exactly where they are 
           coming from -- the man is wrapped too tightly. 

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - FOYER - NIGHT

           Robin leads them out of the room, helping them not to hit any 
           corners or walls.

           They make it to the stair case. 

           Martín cannot bring himself to look at the man. He holds his 
           nose in the air trying not to even breath.

           Martín takes the stairs first, going down backwards. 

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

           They are almost halfway down the stairs, without incident. 

           Martín catches another glimpse of the face, as he tries to 
           look away he trips, still walking down backwards, he uses his 
           arms to catch himself, letting go of the sheet. 

           The old man’s head hits the bottom stair hard. The thud is 
           loud.
                                 ROBIN
                        Oh my god! 

                                 ENZO
                        Martín! 

           Robin pushes past Enzo and races to the bottom. She lifts up 
           the man’s head, holding him. Kissing him. 

                                 ROBIN
                        Honey. Are you okay? Are you 
                        alright?

           The man’s eyes remain closed. From what we can tell, nothing 
           has changed. 

           Robin is sobbing. Martín, leans down to pick up the blanket. 

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Wait. 

           She looks at Martín. 

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        I know that was just an accident. 

           She takes a moment to catch her breath and dry her eyes. 

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Are you okay to continue? Can you 
                        be careful not to drop him again?

           Martín quietly nods yes. 

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Alright, then I forgive you.

           The brothers continue with the transfer.

           Robin walks to the basement bedroom door and unlocks it, 
           allowing Enzo and Martín inside. 

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - BASEMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Martín fully takes in the beauty of the old Victorian bedroom 
           for the first time. Candles and oil sconces burning bright. 

           There are no windows, so it’s quite dark. The room is 
           decorated in red, purple and gold. The wood craftsmanship of 
           the furniture is exquisite.

                                 ROBIN
                        Over here, please. 
           Robin stands next to the ornately decorated bed. Martín and 
           Enzo successfully lay the man down. 

           Robin checks to see that everything is right. She takes both 
           of the brothers by the hand and smiles at them.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Thank you. THANK YOU! 

           Martín backs away from the man, slowly moving towards the 
           door. Robin leans down and lights the fireplace. 

           The light of the fire on the beautiful Turkish rugs and 
           drapes surrounding the bed is stunning.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Enzo? One more thing. Would you 
                        mind also bringing-

                                 MARTÍN
                        No.

           Martín backs up to the door. 

           Robin finishes lighting the fire and stands to face him. 

                                 ROBIN
                        No?

                                 MARTÍN
                        No. We are leaving.

           His English is clear and strong.

                                 ROBIN
                        I understand.

           Robin looks to Enzo.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Enzo, do you need your brother to 
                        help you move a planter box in 
                        here, or can you do it on your own?

                                 ENZO
                        I can do it on my own.

                                 MARTÍN
                        No, we’re leaving. Enzo. Please! 

           Robin looks to Enzo with the stern tone of an angered mother.
                                 ROBIN
                        Enzo, don’t forget, you have to 
                        feed the birds.

           Enzo nods his head yes.

           Enzo pulls a knife on his brother. Before he has any idea 
           what is happening, Enzo thrusts it hard into his gut.

           Enzo lets Martín fall to the ground in pain.  

           Martín, holding his gut, looks at his brother, who is just a 
           shell of a man at this point. A robot carrying out orders. 

                                 MARTÍN
                        God help you.

           Robin walks out of the room and comes back with duct tape and 
           a zip tie, she hands them to Enzo.

           Martín is attempting to crawl away. 

           Enzo kneels on Martín’s back, his knee digging his brother’s 
           wounded stomach into the floor. 

           He zip ties Martín’s arms behind his back and throws a piece 
           of duct tape over his mouth.

           Enzo flips him back over.

           Robin is ready with medical tape and wraps it around Martín’s 
           stomach - keeping the blood inside of him.

                                 ROBIN
                        Hang him up.

           Enzo drags his still-alive brother by his feet, out of the 
           room.

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Enzo drags Martín through the hallway, following Robin. They 
           arrive at the door to the greenhouse, which is locked. 

           Robin digs for the key in her pocket, then stops. 

                                 ROBIN
                        Do you hear that?

           Enzo looks at her blankly. Robin holds up a finger.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Uno momento. 
           Robin walks back into the bedroom, and returns with an iron 
           fireplace poker. She unlocks the door.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Be careful.

           She opens the door. 

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - BASEMENT GREENHOUSE - NIGHT

           The large dark room is quiet. Robin flips on the lights, 
           which illuminates two strips of track lighting down the 
           middle of the room, leaving many dark edges and corners. 

           Robin holds the fireplace poker up like a baseball bat. 

           She bends her knees as she walks, keeping ready in a 
           defensive position.

           Enzo follows her in, dragging his brother across the dirt 
           floor to the middle of the room, below one of the pulleys. 

           We hear something moving. Robin points with the fireplace 
           poker.

                                 ROBIN
                        There! 

           We see a LATINO WORKER, whose hands are zip tied together, 
           and with duct tape on his mouth, making a run for freedom. 

           With only one exit, Robin feels confident she can guard it.

           She watches him run through the room, in and out of the 
           shadows, she follows him with the poker, as if aiming a gun. 

           Enzo continues hoisting his brother up the pulley system. 

           Robin walks around the room, trying to bait the prisoner out. 
           She smacks her lips together at him, like calling to a dog.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Come here...

           She smiles - she sees movement in the plastic lining. 

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        There!

           The prisoner, hidden in the shadows, decides it’s his best 
           chance to make a run for it. He sprints for the door - but 
           Robin is faster.
           With a huge smile on her face, she jumps on his back, like an 
           insane monkey. She holds the fireplace poker across his 
           throat, suffocating him as she squeezes tight. 

           He puts up a strong fight, but Robin takes the victory.  The 
           man drops to the ground.

           Robin, quite pleased with herself, looks at Enzo and points 
           to the man she just caught.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Great! Hang this one up next. 

           Robin turns on a flashlight.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        There’s more back here that need 
                        hung.

           She illuminates FIVE MEN in a back corner of the room, all 
           terrified, on the ground, laying flat on their stomachs. 
           Their hands zip tied to their legs like hogs, mouths duct 
           taped -- workers who were at the house earlier.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Enzo? 

           Enzo, now finished hanging Martín looks over to her.

                                 ENZO
                        Yes?

                                 ROBIN
                        Please acknowledge me when I’ve ask 
                        you to do something.

                                 ENZO
                        Yes.

           She points to the men.

                                 ROBIN
                        I need four of these men hung up. 
                        You can leave the fifth one here 
                        for now. Are you going to be okay 
                        handling that for me?

                                 ENZO
                        Yes.

           Robin points to the five wooden boxes.  
                                 ROBIN
                        I need you to hang each of them 
                        above a box. Okay? Make it look 
                        nice, please. 

           Enzo stares at her. 

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        We have to feed the birds.

           Enzo does not respond, but begins doing the requested work.

           Robin seems to be waiting for a verbal response, like an 
           irritated spouse. 

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Ugh.

           She walks out of the room with her poker, locking Enzo in the 
           room with the men.

           As Enzo hangs the men up, we get a look at what the wooden 
           boxes have now become. 

           The birds, which Robin planted in the dirt after feeding with 
           blood, have begun a process of transformation. 

           The dirt has become gooey, creating some kind of gestating 
           womb. A thin sack made of biological matter surrounds the 
           birds, veins and blood pulsating around the creatures. 

           Some of the birds have started to grow larger, mutating, 
           filling up more of the space in the wooden box.

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - BASEMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Robin walks into the bedroom to check on the old man. 

           Nothing has changed.

           She uses the fireplace poker to move some logs around in the 
           fire, and places the poker back on its stand. 

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           In the kitchen, Robin pours herself Casamigos over ice. 

           She opens her phone, many notifications, missed calls, texts, 
           emails. 

           She sees a text from somebody named JOE BORSTEIN, it says: 
           CHECK YOUR EMAIL.
           She opens her email, finds the one from Joe, the subject 
           reads: TIME SENSITIVE OFFER. She doesn’t bother reading the 
           rest of the email. 

           She call’s JOE’S OFFICE.

                                 ROBIN
                        It’s Robin for Joe.

                                 ASSISTANT (V.O.)
                        Hi Robin, I’m so sorry but he’s at 
                        dinner right now, can I have him 
                        call you back?

                                 ROBIN
                        Dinner with who?

           The assistant hesitates, not willing to reveal. 

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Just tell him it’s Robin, he’ll 
                        take it. I’ll wait. 

                                 ASSISTANT (V.O.)
                        Let me try him, one moment. 

           Robin sips on her tequila. She walks over to a glass jar and 
           opens it. She grabs some smoking paper and rolls a joint. 

           She finishes rolling it, lights it, and walks out onto her 
           balcony over looking the pool and takes a few hits. 

                                 JOE (V.O.)
                        Hey.

           As Joe talks, we hear a noisy restaurant in the background.

                                 ROBIN
                        So what’s this offer?

                                 JOE (V.O.)
                        Did you read the script? It was in 
                        the email. 

                                 ROBIN
                        Fuck off, Joe, just tell me what it 
                        is.

                                 JOE (V.O.)
                        Alright, well, it could be a great 
                        role for you. You’d be playing a 
                        Mormon polygamist. 

           Robin scoffs.
                                 ROBIN
                        Where does it shoot?

                                 JOE (V.O.)
                        Utah. 

                                 ROBIN
                        I’m not going to Utah. How long 
                        does it shoot?

                        Five weeks. 

                                 ROBIN
                        I won’t do more than two. How much?

                                 JOE (V.O.)
                        It’s an indy. But it could be a 
                        really great role for you.

                                 ROBIN
                        How much, Joe.

                                 JOE (V.O.)
                        $300,000. I can try and get more.

                                 ROBIN
                        Why are you calling me at eight 
                        o’clock at night for $300,000?

                                 JOE (V.O.)
                        I called you at four. 

                                 ROBIN
                        Can you get them up to five?

                                 JOE (V.O.)
                        You should check out the script. I 
                        think it’s something special.

                                 ROBIN
                        I’m at drinks, I have to go. Let me 
                        know what they say.

           Robin hangs up the phone. She takes another hit.

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Back downstairs Robin unlocks the door and looks in.

                                 ROBIN
                        Enzo? How are we doing in here, 
                        sweetie?
           Enzo walks towards her. We see five men now hanging above the 
           five wooden boxes, surrounded by the plastic walls. 

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        If you’re finished, can you please 
                        bring that one into the bedroom?

           Robin points to the sixth wooden box.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Thank you! 

           Enzo pushes the sixth wooden box out of the room, which 
           contains only soil.

           Robin locks the door behind him. 

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - BASEMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Enzo pushes the wooden box into the bedroom.

                                 ROBIN
                        Right here, right next to the bed. 

           Enzo lines the box up next to her husband. The box is only 
           slightly bigger than he is.

           Robin reaches in and pushes around the soil, creating a nice 
           place to lay her husband.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        On the count of three. One, two, 
                        three.

           They gently let him slide off the bed and into the box. 

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Perfect! 

           Robin pushes some of the soil around so he is better covered. 

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Go ahead and have a seat. 

           Enzo sits in a chair next to the old man. Robin sits to the 
           side of him, coaching him, speaking into his ear. 

           Enzo’s arm is fully extended.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        This is just like donating blood at 
                        the hospital.
           Robin starts to insert a large needle into a vein at the bend 
           of his arm. 

           Enzo pulls away.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Enzo. Stop.

           Robin tries again, Enzo resists.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Enzo, we didn’t get enough workers, 
                        so you have to do this. We simply 
                        need too much blood.

           Robin proceeds to insert the needle into Enzo’s arm.

           The blood begins to pour out, through the tube, and into a 
           large glass container on the floor.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Thank you, Enzo. You know this 
                        isn’t fun for me either. But we 
                        just have to do it.

           Robin puts her hand on Enzo’s back and rubs it, she leans his 
           head into her chest, holding him.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        You’ve really been there for me, 
                        and I’m never going to forget how 
                        you’ve helped me. This is a really 
                        important time for me, thank you.

           A lot of blood is pouring out from Enzo. Much more than any 
           one person should be losing at a given time.

           Enzo’s eyes are getting heavy. He starts to go in and out of 
           consciousness. 

           Robin puts her hand in Enzo’s hair, rubbing his head gently. 

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        You’re going to make the birds so 
                        happy.

           Enzo tries to look down to see how much blood he’s lost. This 
           makes him dizzy, and his eyes close again.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        What a beautiful thing this is, 
                        that you’re able to give somebody 
                        life. Isn’t that beautiful?
           The next time his eyes open, something has changed. Robin has 
           moved, she isn’t next to him anymore. 

           He looks down, and he sees the old man directly below him.

           The mans mouth is wide open, and instead of Enzo’s blood 
           going into the container, it’s going directly into the man’s 
           mouth.

           The image of this man feeding on his blood sends a jolt of 
           adrenaline through Enzo and he becomes slightly more awake. 

           He starts to panic and hyperventilate. 

           Robin, across the room, sees that he’s woken up.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Sit down, Enzo.

           As Enzo’s life drains out of him, somewhere inside of him he 
           finds one more push to live. 

           He rips the needle out of his arm. 

           He’s dizzy. 

           He can barely walk straight. 

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Sit down, Enzo.

           Robin pulls the poker from the fire place. 

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        I want to keep you. I like you.

           Enzo continues to stumble away from the man.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Sit down, Enzo. You’re not going to 
                        die, we just need more blood.

           Robin winds up and swings the fireplace poker. 

           Enzo is able to grab the poker mid-swing. 

           Suddenly a look of concern across Robin’s face. She can feel 
           that somehow Enzo still has strength. 

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Enzo. Stop.

           Enzo continues to fight her for control of the poker.
                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        We can be a family, forever! 

           She smiles, thinking about the future.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        I made a deal, Enzo. We’re going to 
                        become like them. You are, too! 

           We see in Enzo’s eyes that there is a spark of his old self.

           As the two battle, there is movement from the old man behind 
           Robin and Enzo. His hand moves just slightly, then his arm, 
           then he pulls himself up, out of the box.

           Robin’s attention is distracted as she looks at the old man 
           coming to life. She’s humbled in his presence. 

           Enzo rips the poker from Robin’s arms and shoves it through 
           her chest -- while she’s still holding onto it.

           Robin pushes Enzo off of her and he falls to the ground. He 
           flips over to his stomach, still weak, he starts to crawl 
           away.

           The flames from the fireplace cast a dancing shadow on the 
           wall. We see the outline of the feeble old man rising up.

           Despite having the poker in her chest, Robin can’t stop 
           watching the old man with awe. 

           Her mouth hangs open, we did it! 

           Robin kneels, blood starting to leak out of her mouth. 

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Welcome! Welcome to America!  

           She tries to bow her head.

           Enzo manages to stand back up. He finally gets a good look at 
           the old man.

           The old man’s arms are wings, covered in black feathers, as 
           if he’s part bird. They are tucked in, held close to his 
           body. He spreads them out, preparing to feast. 

           Enzo can barely stand, can barely keep his eyes open, and 
           barely understand what he is looking at. 

           The old man comes closer to him. He walks slow, decrepit.

           Robin is bleeding out on the floor, still watching with 
           enthusiasm as the old man approaches Enzo.
           Enzo is frozen, he cannot move. He trembles, his eyes in lock 
           with the old man.

           The old man opens his wings, they wrap entirely around Enzo, 
           like a spider wraps it’s prey in webbing, or a snake wrapped 
           around a rat. 

           The old man opens his mouth and we see his fangs, they pierce 
           Enzo’s neck, sucking all remaining blood from his body. 

           Once he is finished he drops Enzo to the ground, his lifeless 
           corpse flopping onto the floor. Enzo’s eyes still open, now 
           staring at Robin’s, who is also lifeless, her eyes also open, 
           returning his gaze.  

           The old man walks out of the room.

           The fire crackling, the two bodies lay still. 

           The house, otherwise, all quiet. 

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

           The hallway is empty, no one coming up or down the stairs, no 
           furniture being moved, no bodies being dragged. 

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - BASEMENT GREENHOUSE - NIGHT

           The five Latino men hang from the rafters above the five 
           wooden boxes.

           In the boxes we see that the birds are in various stages of 
           transforming into human form.

           We see pieces of torsos and heads forming inside of the 
           protective sack. We see the blood and veins covering them as 
           they move inside with life, growing bigger.

           Shape shifting.

           Two of the birds seem to be struggling to transform, lacking 
           enough blood to move to the next phase. 

           Martín is hanging above the box furthest to the left. 

           We observe each of the men, and each of the birds as they 
           struggle to change.

           Martín still unconscious.

           We see something light up in the pocket of his jeans. 
           His phone.

           Someone is calling.

           INT. ABUELA’S VAN - NIGHT

           Araceli, driving her mother’s van, sits at the closed gate of 
           the Hollywood Hills Estate.

           Her phone up to her ear, the call ringing. 

           Martín not answering.

           Araceli’s daughter and baby boy are keeping quiet in the back 
           of the van.

           Araceli ends the call and opens her messages app.

           She types a message to Martín. While she types, we see that 
           he texted her earlier saying: SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH ENZO.

           And another message saying: I LOVE YOU. 

           And another message saying: I’M TRYING TO LEAVE BUT I CAN’T.

           Araceli sends him a new message saying: I’M HERE WHERE ARE 
           YOU?

           She gets out of the van.

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - GATE - NIGHT

           Araceli walks in front of her van, the headlights beaming 
           behind her.

           She turns on the flashlight feature on her phone. She shines 
           it, looking for some kind of call box on the gate. 

           She doesn’t see one. 

           While she’s searching, she sees somebody coming towards her. 

           It’s Robin.

           Robin holds her hand over her eyes, squinting due to the 
           headlights and the phone light shining at her.

           Robin stands on the other side of the metal gate from 
           Araceli. The gap between the rods wide enough for them to see 
           one another.
                                 ROBIN
                        Hello?

           Araceli is startled at first, but then realizes who it is.

                                 ARACELI
                        Hello! Ms. Ozanne! Hello. I’m so 
                        sorry to bother you.

                                 ROBIN
                        Oh, hi again. How great to see you. 
                        It’s no bother at all. 

           Araceli stops shining her flashlight at her. Robin stands in 
           the shadows, to the side of the beams from the head lights.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        You’re Martín’s wife, right?

                                 ARACELI
                        Yes! Is he here?

                                 ROBIN
                        They already left, a while ago. 
                        Before sunset. 

                                 ARACELI
                        They did?

           Robin smiles at her.

                                 ROBIN
                        Do you want to come up? I can fix 
                        you a drink while we try and call 
                        him.

                                 ARACELI
                        You don’t mind?

                                 ROBIN
                        I don’t mind. 

           Robin walks away, towards the house, the gate still closed.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        You can just push the gate open and 
                        drive up.

           Robin disappears into the night. 

           Araceli looks at the gate - a bit strange to be moving it 
           herself, but she pushes it open.
           INT. ABUELA'S VAN - NIGHT

           Araceli drives up the long drive way and parks in front of 
           the house. 

           She checks her phone again. No new messages from Martín. 

           She cracks her windows to let air in and looks back at her 
           daughter and baby boy.

                                 ARACELI
                        Mama’s going to go inside for a 
                        minute to get Daddy. Will you be 
                        okay in here?

                                 MARÍA ISABEL
                        Yes Mama. 

                                 ARACELI
                        Thank you. Will you give your 
                        brother the bottle if he cries?

                                 MARÍA ISABEL
                        Yes! 

           Araceli hands María Isabel a bottle and gets out of the car.

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - NIGHT

           Robin is standing in the open doorway to the house. 

           Araceli walks towards her.

                                 ARACELI
                        Thank you again, I’m sorry to 
                        bother you with this. I’ve tried 
                        calling Martín but he’s not 
                        answering, and I thought he was 
                        here.

                                 ROBIN
                        It’s no problem at all. Come 
                        inside. 

           Robin moves deeper into the house, leaving the door clear for 
           Araceli.

           She watches intently as Araceli crosses the threshold on her 
           own free will, entering the house.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        Could you close the door for me?
           Araceli shuts the front door.

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - FOYER - NIGHT

           Robin disappears into the kitchen.

                                 ROBIN
                        Come in here, I’ll fix you a drink.

           Araceli walks towards the kitchen.

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

           Araceli approaches slowly, unsure of whether to stand or sit.

                                 ROBIN
                        You can have a seat on the couch.

                                 ARACELI
                        Your home is so beautiful.

                                 ROBIN
                        Thank you. I’ve worked hard to get 
                        it ready for my fundraiser 
                        tomorrow.

                                 ARACELI
                        Is that what Enzo and Martín have 
                        been working on?

           Robin is across the room, in the kitchen, her back to us. 

                                 ROBIN
                        Yes, exactly.

           With two drinks in hand, Robin walks to Araceli and sits down 
           face to face with her, she hands her a drink.

                                 ARACELI
                        Thank you.

                                 ROBIN
                        What was your name again? 

                                 ARACELI
                        Araceli.

                                 ROBIN
                        Araceli, listen. There’s something 
                        that’s been weighing on my mind 
                        quite heavily. 
           Araceli is quiet.

                                 ROBIN (CONT'D)
                        I was actually thinking about 
                        coming back to your house, to try 
                        and talk to you. Woman to woman.

                                 ARACELI
                        What about?

                                 ROBIN
                        I just feel -- awful -- really torn 
                        up inside.

                                 ARACELI
                        About what?

                                 ROBIN
                        Martín told me he was going to tell 
                        you. Did he not?

                                 ARACELI
                        No.

                                 ROBIN
                        Martín and I really bonded, and I 
                        just appreciated his help so much. 
                        I’m afraid I showed him my 
                        appreciation in the wrong way. In a 
                        physical way.

           Araceli sets her drink down.

                                 ARACELI
                        What are you saying?

                                 ROBIN
                        I want to ask for your forgiveness. 
                        Martín and I’s relationship became 
                        physical, and it was inappropriate 
                        for a married man. I promise you, 
                        it won’t happen again. I’d love to 
                        keep hiring them, they’re such 
                        great workers. But I know I’ve 
                        violated your trust, and that kills 
                        me. Will you please grant me your 
                        forgiveness? 

                                 ARACELI
                        Where is Martín now?

                                 ROBIN
                        I think the guilt was weighing on 
                        him, too. He left in tears. 
           Araceli puts her head down, then back up at Robin.

                                 ARACELI
                        His phone location shows he’s still 
                        here. 

           Robin smiles.

                                 ROBIN
                        Oops.

           She begins to laugh.

           The laughter grows, an evil look on her face as her body 
           begins to evaporate, dissipating into fog. 

           Araceli jumps up from her seat, looking around. 

           The house completely still. 

           She runs for the door -- back towards her car. 

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - FOYER - NIGHT

           Araceli checks her phone one more time. 

           No new messages.

           She opens the locations app on her phone. 

           As she waits for it to load, she paces through the foyer, 
           looking down at her screen.

           With her attention on her phone, she does not see what we do: 
           the creature-like old man standing deep in the hallway, 
           watching her from the shadows. 

           Waiting for her.

           The app finishes loading, Araceli sees that Martín’s location 
           still shows that he is here.

                                 ARACELI
                        Martín?

           She walks down the dark hallway and sees the first floor 
           bedroom. She turns on the flashlight on her phone.

           She proceeds cautiously.

           Once at the bedroom door, she shines the light inside.

           No sign of anyone. 
           She walks in deeper.

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - FIRST FLOOR BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Araceli shines her small flashlight around the room, 
           uncovering one small section at a time.

           She finds nothing. 

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - FOYER - NIGHT

           She continues back towards the front door and stops at the 
           basement stairs. 

           The corner in the hallway where we saw the old man is once 
           again empty - he has moved. 

           She shines the light into the dark stair case. 

           She takes the first step down.

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

           The terrified Araceli walks carefully down the staircase into 
           the quiet, dark basement. 

           She turns left towards the bedroom, the door is shut. 

           Araceli opens it.

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - BASEMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The fire that had been burning in the fireplace is now 
           completely out. The room pitch black.

           Araceli walks into the room, the small beam of light 
           illuminating very little each direction it is pointed.

           She makes it to the bed and sees the box of soil. 

           She starts to speed up her search, not wanting to be in this 
           evil place. 

           Back towards the door she passes the fireplace and trips over 
           Enzo. 

           She doesn’t actually see Enzo though, when she falls to the 
           ground, her light lands on Robin’s face, and the poker 
           sticking out of her chest. 
           Araceli manages to keep herself from screaming out loud, 
           trembling and in tears, she picks herself up and runs out.

           With only one door left to search in the basement, she pushes 
           it open.

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - BASEMENT GREENHOUSE - NIGHT

           Araceli shines her light into the huge basement room. Her 
           light reflects off the thick sheets of plastic.

                                 ARACELI
                        Martín! 

           She walks into the room, feeling that the ground surface has 
           changed, she shines her light on her feet which reveals the 
           dirt floor beneath her. 

           She hears movement. Squishing sounds.

                                 ARACELI (CONT'D)
                        Martín! 

           Araceli keeps walking forward, she shines her light in front 
           of her feet to see where she is walking.

           She sees the man hog-tied on the dirt floor, still alive.

                                 ARACELI (CONT'D)
                        Hello?! 

           Araceli sees that the man is not Martín, then she sees the 
           first wooden box.

           Shining the light in, we see that a fully gestating womb has 
           filled the space. The bird in full transformation into a man. 

           Araceli screams. 

           She shines her light uncovering the other four boxes, all in 
           various stages of the same bloody process.

           She shines the flash light up, revealing the Latino workers 
           hanging above the boxes. 

           Crying, screaming, she checks to see if one of them is 
           Martín. She looks into the first face, the man opens his 
           eyes, conscious, looking at her. 

           His eyes pleading for help.

                                 ARACELI (CONT'D)
                        Oh my god! 
           She checks all of the men, finding Martín last. His eyes not 
           open. She falls to her knees, holding onto him. 

                                 ARACELI (CONT'D)
                        Martín! 

           She kisses him while also searching to see how to get him 
           down.

           His eyes open, he looks into her eyes. 

                                 ARACELI (CONT'D)
                        Martín! I’m so sorry!

           She tries to pull on the pulley system. She pulls and pulls. 

           Araceli looks at him again. She holds onto him tightly.

                                 ARACELI (CONT'D)
                        I’m so sorry, we should have never 
                        moved here.

           Araceli pulls the tape off of his mouth, but he’s too weak to 
           speak. Barely able to keep his eyes open.

                                 ARACELI (CONT'D)
                        I’m going to get you down. Please 
                        hold on for me. Please! 

           A strong gust of wind pours through the room. Araceli is 
           frozen in place, unable to even close or move her eyes. 

           Her body is lifted up, she is levitating in front of Martín, 
           not moving of her own will, but under someone else’s control.

           She is now hovering three feet above the ground. 

           Her body is slowly rotated onto her back in the middle of the 
           air, her torso and limbs fully extended. 

           We see that the old man is standing in the doorway of the 
           room -- controlling all of this.

           He turns and walks into the hallway.

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

           The old man walks back towards his bedroom. Behind him is 
           Araceli, being floated through the air, following him.
           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - BASEMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The old man walks to the sitting area around the fireplace. 
           Without having to so much as lift a finger he is able to 
           light the fire. 

           He also lights the gas sconces and lamps, the beautifully 
           ancient room is again illuminated. 

           Araceli is still floating in the air, on her back. Her head 
           pulled backwards, as if she is hanging off of a bed upside 
           down.

           Her eyes are forced to look at the old man, who is now 
           seated. 

           The old man is looking better, younger. Some of his skin 
           imperfections have healed, some wrinkles gone. The color of 
           his hair darker, and more full. He now wears an elaborate 
           black silk robe, covering most of his wings and body. 
           Feathers still stick out.

           He speaks to Araceli in Spanish.

                                 OLD MAN
                        Hello, Araceli.

           His voice has an other worldly tone underneath it. It does 
           not sound like human vocal chords. He speaks with an accent.

           Her eyes are forced wide open. Her tears dried to her face. 

                                 OLD MAN (CONT'D)
                        If I let you down, will you stay?

           Though not able to move her lips, she mutters a sound.

                                 ARACELI
                        Yes.

           The man lets Araceli down, he places her in a seat across 
           from him.

           He looks deep into her eyes. We see her eyes changing --
           getting lost in his, the same way Enzo’s did. The old Araceli 
           gone.

           The man points to Robin.

                                 OLD MAN
                        My laborer appears to be alive, no 
                        longer.

           The old man thinks on this statement for a time.
                                 OLD MAN (CONT'D)
                        She was doing well, though the job 
                        remains unfinished. I am in need of 
                        some person new to fill this 
                        position. I would like for it to be 
                        you.

           Araceli is mute.

                                 OLD MAN (CONT'D)
                        What do you desire, Araceli? What 
                        do you want most from this life?

           She stays quiet.

                                 OLD MAN (CONT'D)
                        I can give you what you desire as 
                        payment. Do you secretly desire to 
                        be a famous singer? Or actress? Is 
                        it wealth that motivates you?

           Still no answer.

                                 OLD MAN (CONT'D)
                        Your raw beauty is a rare treasure. 
                        I have seen this world, so I know. 
                        Now tell me, Araceli, What do you 
                        want from this life?

           Certainly she faces death if she chooses not to comply.

                                 ARACELI
                        I want my family to be safe from 
                        you.

                                 OLD MAN
                        Fine.

           The old man waves off this request, which he finds small. 

                                 OLD MAN (CONT'D)
                        What else?

           Araceli is silent for some time. 

                                 ARACELI
                        I have dreamt of becoming a famous 
                        actress at times.

           The old man smiles.

                                 OLD MAN
                        Of course. This I can give to you.
                                 ARACELI
                        You are the demon bird who has been 
                        cursing my family.

           The old man says nothing.

                                 ARACELI (CONT'D)
                        You live off blood. You can change 
                        your shape. I know what you are.

                                 OLD MAN
                        Do not believe the movies.

                                 ARACELI
                        You are a cursed man. 

                                 OLD MAN
                        Yes.

           The old man smiles. 

                                 ARACELI
                        You are new to this city. Why did 
                        you come here?

                                 OLD MAN
                        Why did you?

                                 ARACELI
                        For a better life.

                                 OLD MAN
                        We are similar.

           The conversation pauses. 

                                 OLD MAN (CONT'D)
                        Do you agree to handle my affairs, 
                        in turn you will have whatever you 
                        desire, eternal life if you so 
                        wish?

                                 ARACELI
                        If you will spare my family.

                                 OLD MAN
                        Yes.

                                 ARACELI
                        I agree.

           The old man switches to English.
                                 OLD MAN
                        How is your English?

                                 ARACELI
                        Good. 

                                 OLD MAN
                        I am weak, I need to finish my 
                        transformation. Bring me a man.

           Araceli is confused.

                                 OLD MAN (CONT'D)
                        Bring a man to my feet. You must 
                        also finish feeding my children. 
                        They are weak. Blood will make them 
                        strong.

           He looks at her carefully to see if she is cooperative.

           She silently nods her head yes and leaves the room.

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - BASEMENT GREENHOUSE - NIGHT

           Araceli walks into the greenhouse with her flashlight, she 
           looks around.

           She sees the man still hog tied on the floor.

           She walks past the hanging men, including Martín, and cuts 
           the tie around the mans feet. 

           She pulls him up.

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - BASEMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Araceli walks into the bedroom and presents the trembling, 
           tied up man.

                                 ARACELI
                        Here you are.

                                 OLD MAN
                        Shut the door.

           Araceli does.

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - BASEMENT GREENHOUSE - NIGHT

           Araceli puts the same talon claws that Robin used over her 
           fingers.
           One by one she slices the hanging men open all the way down 
           their chest, letting the blood spill out over their bodies, 
           down their faces, into their hair, and into the wooden box 
           below them.

           We see the mouth of the cursed creature open below and 
           receive the blood. 

           She slits the four men open and then stands in front of 
           Martín. 

           She reaches her claw up towards him, and just before it digs 
           in we--

                                                                     CUT TO:

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - DRIVEWAY - EVENING

           It’s a new day at the house, and the long awaited political 
           fundraiser is here. Several VALETS stand ready at the top of 
           the driveway as the expensive cars arrive.

           POLTICIANS and SPOUSES exit from the cars. 

           The house looks perfect. 

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - MAIN ROOM - EVENING

           Araceli like we’ve never seen her before -- a form fitting 
           dress wraps around her. The make-up she wears and her styled 
           hair look like the work of a team of professionals.

           ATTENDEE’S of the fundraiser spill out of the house. 

                                 ARACELI
                        Welcome.

           She shakes the hands of guests as they walk through the room.

                                 ARACELI (CONT'D)
                        Welcome to my home.

           She works the room like a restrained, poised professional.

           SERVERS circulate with tray passed hors d’oeuvres and wine. 

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - FOYER - EVENING

           Guests continue to arrive, but Araceli is looking for someone 
           else.
           Up the stairs walks a man - the old man - but he now looks 
           much younger. It’s the same person, same eyes, same smile, 
           but his transformation to his ideal self is complete.

           He smiles at Araceli.

                                 ARACELI
                        Everything is ready. They’re all 
                        excited to meet you.

                                 OLD MAN 
                        Thank you.

           He places his hand on her shoulder and smiles, then continues 
           into the event. 

           We see him in the background shaking hands and making 
           introductions as Araceli walks the other direction, into the 
           first floor bedroom.

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS ESTATE - FIRST FLOOR BEDROOM - NIGHT

           At the sound of the door being opened Martín flinches. 

           He sits in the corner, hunched over on the floor on the far 
           side of the room, holding his baby boy. He has bandages 
           around his stomach.

           María Isabel plays with toys nearby.

                                 MARÍA ISABEL
                        Hi Mama! 

                                 ARACELI
                        Hello baby girl.

           Araceli walks towards Martín, she smiles and reaches for her 
           baby boy.

           Martín, reluctant to give him to her, holds onto him tightly. 

           Araceli tugs the baby from his arms. He winces in pain and 
           holds his stomach. 

                                 MARTÍN
                        We have to leave, Araceli. 

           Araceli shoots Martín a disapproving look. 

                                 ARACELI
                        To where? My Mother’s? To continue 
                        sharing a family room with eight 
                        other people?
                                 MARTÍN
                        We cannot stay here.

                                 ARACELI
                        Sure, Martín. We can leave when you 
                        have secured a job.

           Martín, unsure who he is even talking to.

           Araceli kisses her baby boy on his head as she reaches into a 
           diaper bag and pulls out a bottle.

                                 ARACELI (CONT'D)
                        I’m sorry, Martín. That wasn’t 
                        nice.

           She walks back over to him and sits on the edge of the bed.

           As she tilts the bottle towards the baby’s mouth we see that 
           instead of being filled with milk, the bottle is filled with 
           blood.

                                 ARACELI (CONT'D)
                               (whispering)
                        But Martín, don’t you understand? 

           A smile unfolds across Araceli’s face.

                                 ARACELI (CONT'D)
                        We made it.

           She continues to gently rock her baby boy, who is drinking 
           his blood bottle with enthusiasm.

           Araceli continues to smile at Martín, waiting for a look of 
           realization to come over his face - don’t you get it? 

           He does not.

           Araceli then smiles at their daughter, who is playing with 
           toys on the other side of the room.

           She smiles again at her baby in her arms, happily feeding, 
           then gently kisses him on his forehead. 

           Still with a smile, Araceli leans in and kisses Martín on the 
           lips. There is no response from him, no effort to kiss her 
           back. Just empty eyes, realizing what he has lost. 

           Araceli continues to feed her child, pleased with her 
           families success.

                                                                      EL FIN
