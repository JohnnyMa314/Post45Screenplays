           TITLE CARD: BROWARD COUNTY, FLORIDA, 1986

           FADE IN...

           EXT. POINSETTIA HEIGHTS, FLORIDA - DUSK

           All is calm on a palm tree lined street. Everything against 
           the golden sky is silhouetted. Seagull caws can be heard 
           beyond the sea breeze. It’s serene and peaceful until... 

           A beat up and rusty van speeds toward the horizon.

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        You wanna slow it down, Carmine? 

           The van makes a sharp turn onto a residential street full of 
           beautiful Spanish Colonial Revival style homes. 

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        Carmine, you deaf? Slow it down! 

           INT. BEAT UP VAN - CONTINUOUS

           The van is full of policemen with mullets and mustaches. 

           Captain RON CACCIATORE (40s) a handsome cowboy type, sits 
           shotgun. Behind him are Sergeants BOB DEAK (30s), wound very 
           tight and VICKI CUTCLIFFE (late 20s), a ‘you talkin’ to me’ 
           attitude with big blond hair. SCOTT and HENRY (cops) are 
           behind them. They hold shotguns. CARMINE drives.    

                                 CARMINE
                        We shoulda been there half an hour 
                        ago. I’m going 70.

                        passing big donors. 

                                 BOB
                        You can’t speed in a white 
                        neighborhood, Carmine.  

                                 HENRY
                        I don’t want anything fucking with 
                        the barbecue funds. 

                                 SCOTT 
                             (not looking well)
                        Captain, I gotta sit up front. Can 
                        we stop? 
                                 RON
                        Get a bag. 

           They hit a bump. The jolt causes Henry to cock his shotgun. A 
           shell casing flies out. 

                                 BOB
                        Careful with that thing! 

           The casing rolls to the back of the van. A foot stops it. 
           Looking out of place in civilian clothes is JOHN LANGLEY, mid 
           40’s. He has an intelligent face, a trim beard and fierce 
           eyes. He picks up the casing.  

           Next to him is a pimply CAMERAMAN. He’s assembling a camera.  

                                 CAMERAMAN

           John takes out his wallet and shows him a photo of his son.

                                 JOHN
                        No, not really. Just want to give 
                        him something when I get back.      

                                 CAMERAMAN

                        me away all this time.

                        My kids are mature too. Look, a 
                        child’s mind is like a sponge.

                        smoke crack. If anything, he’ll see 
                        this, and never touch it.

                                 CAMERAMAN
                        But once the idea is planted you 
                        can’t ever get it back out. It’s 
                        enough for an adult to process this 
                        dark material let alone a child.  

                                 JOHN
                        At a certain point, the world 
                        reveals itself. Better they learn 
                        through us.

                                 CAMERAMAN
                        I wouldn’t risk it. That’s the 
                        parent I am.

                        to raise my son again, I’ll rip 
                        your head from your fucking body. 

           John turns to the only person who’s heard the interchange, 
           STEPHEN KIGER, mid 30’s, the fastidious boom operator. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)

           Everyone turns to see two boys, stopped on their bicycles in 
           front of the house. The boys stare blankly at them.

           A loud THUD can be heard from inside the house.

                        We’re moving. Come back to us. 

           John turns on his camera light illuminating the whole area.

           INT. BRICK HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           An ADDICT, wearing only boxers, is pummeled to the floor. 
           Henry pins the addict down with his foot. 

                                 HENRY
                        DON’T MOVE. YOU HEAR ME! 

           John swoops in behind them getting this all in shot. The 
           black male, dumbfounded, stands in the kitchen. 

                                 SCOTT
                        DOWN! LIE DOWN RIGHT NOW! 

           He drops to his knees. Vicki cuffs him. A MOTHER holding her 
           BABY walks into John’s frame.

                        Miss, just get on the ground. 

           The mother gets down on the floor, her baby is oddly calm. 
           Bob moves to the stair landing. John and Kiger follow him.

                                 BOB
                        Anyone upstairs? 

           John swerves his camera to Scott and Henry on top of the men. 

                                 HENRY
                        WHO’S IN THE HOUSE? 

                                 ADDICT
                        I don’t know! I don’t live here, 
                        man. Ow, that hurts!  

           FOOTSTEPS can be heard from upstairs.  

                                 BOB
                        The light... 
           John turns off the light making Bob a silhouette... Bob lets 
           out a breath... calm and collected. He starts walking up. 

           Kiger is pale and shaking. John points to some slack boom 
           chord on the floor. Kiger coils it up. John gives a 
           reassuring nod. Both men follow Bob up.   

           The floors creak. Bob comes to the first door in a hallway. 
           He opens the door... it’s a sparse bedroom with a torn up 
           mattress, no frame. John pans the camera across a desk with 
           CRACK COCAINE on top, propped up next to it lies a SHOTGUN.

           The three move to the next room. Bob struggles to open the 
           door... he kicks it open... FLIES swarm... a horrible smell 
           hits them. The room is filthy and cluttered. Lying in a 
           corner is a ROTTING PUPPY. Bob shuts the door.   

           At the end of the hall is the last door. Light illuminates 
           out the bottom. As they creep forward, voices grow louder. 
           Bob holds up his gun, waits a moment, then bursts in. 

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        Hands up! 

           A dark skinned CARIBBEAN GUY watches TV with his back to Bob.

                                 CARIBBEAN GUY
                        I saw you enter on the TV.

                        Stand and turn towards me. Now get 
                        on the ground. Slowly. 

                                 CARIBBEAN GUY
                        There’s a gun. On the right.

                        This looks rusty as hell.

                        I’m police from the Bahama’s.

                        going home anytime soon.    

           Bob takes him out. On the TV: GERALDO RIVERA talks to a live 
           studio audience, “We’ll be back soon after this commercial 
           break.” John lowers his camera. 

                                 JOHN
                        That’s us... he was watching us. 
           EXT. FRONT YARD - NIGHT 

           Police cars with red and blue lights flare the area. A crowd 
           lines the street. John films Ron holding pistols and Bob 
           holding a duffel bag of coke.   

                                 RON
                        We’ve got two and a half kilos of 
                        cocaine. We’ve got firearms with 
                        silencers on them and the jack pot 
                        of all jack pots, we’ve apprehended 
                        a Nassau, Bahamas police officer.  
                             (presses into an earpiece)
                        It means there’s a bit of 
                        corruption over there and it causes 
                        us problems here, not our 
                        department, but most importantly 
                        how does the neighborhood feel? 

           The crowd cheers. John and Kiger lower their film equipment. 
           JERRY WURMS (30), the production assistant, approaches John. 

                                 JERRY 
                        Over here! It was fucking awesome 
                        when you busted in and took down 
                        those coons! I was on the edge of 
                        my seat.

                                 JOHN
                        Thanks Jerry... 

           They move to a satellite truck. The door opens, it’s MALCOLM 
           BARBOUR (50’s), John’s English business partner. If John is 
           the mind, Malcolm is the heart and soul. Jerry drives.  

                                 MALCOLM 
                        You could have been bloody shot! 

                                 JOHN
                        The guy you hired chickened out. 

                                 MALCOLM 
                        You’re not Rambo with a camera 
                        John. You put us in major jeopardy 
                        by going in there. The liability 
                        insurance doesn’t cover you.  

                                 JOHN
                        Were you not watching? That 
                        Caribbean guy was watching Rivera 
                        when we came in. 

                                 JERRY
                        What Caribbean guy?
                                 JOHN
                        The guy! The Caribbean guy!

                        life at risk after I retire, not 
                        before.   

                                 JOHN
                        Yes, captain.  

                                 MALCOLM
                        I accept your apology. Sincere as 
                        always. Now where’s that cameraman? 

                                 JOHN
                        Back at the scene. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Our insurance only covers the 
                        camera if he’s using it.  

                                 JOHN
                        I am holding it very firmly. 

           EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT 

           Officers hold semiautomatic rifles in front of an opened van 
           filled with mounds of cocaine. John positions one officer. 

                                 JOHN
                        Just like that. Stay right there. 
                        Can we have the coke over here to 
                        get it in shot?

           Sheriff NICK NAVARRO, late 50’s, approaches John. The Florida 
           sun has baked deep wrinkles in his Cuban face. He exudes an 
           easy, warm charisma. 

                                 NICK
                        So we won’t be able to throw the 
                        cocaine in the incinerator tonight.  
                        We couldn’t test all of it in time 
                        for the shoot. 

                                 JOHN
                        So this is all just for show?  

                                 NICK
                        I’m sure you’ve realized by now 
                        that is a lot of what law 
                        enforcement work is. 
                                 MALCOLM
                        We’re on in five gentlemen. 

                                 JOHN
                        It’s going to make your department 
                        look good. Just one bag Nick. 
                        Please. I need this shot.  

           CUT TO John filming Nick, with an ear piece, in front of the 
           van with the armed officers standing statuesque. 

                                 NICK
                        Right now we’re going to be burning 
                        300 kilos of cocaine which is 
                        around 50 million dollars.
                             (beat)
                        So far we have not been able to say 
                        that we’re really making a dent. 
                        What we are finding is that they 
                        are bringing in as much as they 
                        want to and we continue to seize as 
                        much as we can.  

           Rivera speaks into the earpiece: “Let’s see you toss that in 
           the fire, Nick!” He reluctantly throws it in the incinerator.

                                 JOHN
                        And we’re off. That’s a wrap! 

                                 NICK
                        How’d I look?

                        Old! 

                                 JOHN
                        You did great sir. It was real. 
                        This is what TV should be.  

           The cops cheer and whistle. The cheers grow louder...  

           INT. BROWARD COUNTY POLICE STATION - NIGHT

           The Broward County police force, including every cop from 
           earlier clap for John and Malcolm at the front of the room. 

                                 JOHN
                        I know that’s because of the free 
                        beer. Before we play the video, I 
                        just want to thank you guys for 
                        allowing us to film you. America 
                        has seen its next superstars. To

           CUT TO Jerry putting a VHS into a player. ON THE TV: Geraldo 
           Rivera, in a suit talks into the camera.

                        Two thousand times a day every day 
                        cops in America prepare to bust 
                        another suspected pusher. Just one 
                        strategy in the escalating war on 
                        drugs. During the course of this 
                        live program you’ll be a witness as 
                        a pusher goes down for the count. I 
                        am Geraldo Rivera and this is 
                        American Vice. 

                                 JOHN
                             (to Malcolm)
                        He didn’t say the one I wrote.  

           Heart-thumping music plays as a title sequence swoops in... 
           “American Vice: The Doping of a Nation”. MONTAGE of segments 
           from the show. 

           John gets visibly more frustrated with Rivera’s hokey 
           presentation. The program shows Rivera all over the country 
           as it CUTS back to him in New York with the studio audience.     

                                 GERALDO RIVERA (V.O.)
                        It’s the kids who suffer the most. 

           CLOSE UP of a small black child. Rivera is talking to an 
           ADDICT MOTHER holding the BABY.  

                                 ADDICT MOTHER 
                        Who are you?

                        I’m someone who's ashamed for you. 

                                 ADDICT MOTHER
                        But who are you?

                        I'm Geraldo Rivera.

           John palms his face. A cop blurts out: “Yeah bitch!” 

                                 JERRY
                        Fucking awesome man.  

           The drug bust starts to play: the cops wait at the door. 

                                 GERALDO RIVERA
                        This is reality. This is happening. 
                        This isn't a television program. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GERALDO RIVERA (CONT'D)
                        This isn't a made-for-TV movie. 
                        This is real life.

           Carmine busts the door open. The cops pile on the ADDICT. A 
           cop blurts out, “They’re always in their underwear.” CUT back 
           to Rivera, in front of the studio audience.  

                                 GERALDO RIVERA (CONT’D)
                        That’s live television. We have no 
                        control. There's nothing we can do. 

           The cops cheer. John’s face burns.  

           INT. BROWARD COUNTY POLICE STATION OFFICE AREA - NIGHT

           John snatches a phone off a desk. Malcolm enters behind him. 
           It’s just them in the room. 

                                 JOHN
                             (in the phone)
                        Get me Rivera. Well, get him out of 
                        there. I don’t care what you say 
                        just get him!  

                                 MALCOLM
                        Hang up the phone. 

                                 JOHN
                        What the fuck was that? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        It’s just TV—

                                 JOHN
                        That was the worst shit I’ve ever 
                        seen. That was my baby, Geraldo 
                        Rivera raped my baby.     

                                 MALCOLM
                        It was our baby. 

           Rivera through the phone: “Hello? Hello?” John hangs up.

                                 JOHN
                        You thought Rivera was a good idea! 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Don’t twist this. We knew this 
                        could happen when we sold it. 
                        Before this we had nothing. We have 
                        something we can show now. 
                                 JOHN
                        No one in their right mind will 
                        watch this and think we’re serious.  

                                 MALCOLM 
                        If it gets good numbers it won’t 
                        matter.  

                                 JOHN
                        It’s fucking junk food.

                                 MALCOLM
                        Then perhaps we need to take a 
                        visit to McDonald’s. I don’t know 
                        what the nuggets are made out of, 
                        but this country can’t get enough 
                        of them. 

                                 JOHN
                        I didn’t get into this to make shit 
                        nuggets. 
                             (barges out)

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 

           John is on the phone with his wife MAGGIE (40’s), she wears 
           nurse scrubs in their LA home. She maintains herself like a 
           Stepford wife and has tired eyes from overworking. 

                                 MAGGIE 
                        You know you have to apologize. 

                                 JOHN
                        I’ve said worse. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        It’s Malcolm...

                                 JOHN
                        I’ll talk to him.  

                                 MAGGIE
                        I think he’s right. I have a 
                        feeling this will lead to more work 
                        for you two. 

                                 JOHN
                        There’s no way. Rivera bastardized 
                        the issues. Cops good, suspects 
                        bad. No nuance, no complexity and 
                        nobody learned anything.
                                 MAGGIE
                        But do people really care about 
                        that? I know you do but Geraldo 
                        knows what people want, he knows 
                        how to put on a show.   

                                 JOHN
                        I’m not talking about making an 
                        after school special Maggie. You 
                        can make something entertaining and 
                        have depth. It’s not a trade off.   

                                 MAGGIE
                        You got your first show produced. 
                        Be happy for yourself.

                                 JOHN
                        I’m on the wrong side of 45. I 
                        should be in a different place. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        But we can afford the rent now. You 
                        ought to be grateful Geraldo 
                        believed in your concept. I’d hate 
                        for anything to get in the way of 
                        you working with him again.   

                                 JOHN
                        Is Morgan there? I want to talk to 
                        him.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I put him to bed already. 

                                 JOHN
                        What did he think?

                                 MAGGIE
                        I didn’t let him watch it. It’s not 
                        for his eyes yet. John? You there?

           John sighs, too exhausted to fight back.  

                                 JOHN
                        Yes. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        I liked it. A lot actually. I 
                        always knew you were going places. 
                        Why do you think I married you? I 
                        think this is the start of 
                        something great for you.

           TITLE CARD: Los Angeles, California, 2013

           INT. COPS HEADQUARTERS - DAY 

           DOUG WATERMAN (60’s), a supervising producer on COPS, walks 
           in holding the bubbling aspirin water and an iPad. The Santa 
           Monica office is full of hustle bustle energy. Coverage of 
           the Trial of George Zimmerman plays on the TV. 

                                 DOUG
                        Is he up?  

                                 JOHN’S ASSISTANT
                        He hasn’t come out yet. 

           Doug enters...

           INT. JOHN LANGLEY’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           John Langley, now in his 70s, is passed out on the couch. 
           He’s wrinkled, sun spotted and has a good sized gut. There’s 
           a empty whiskey bottle on the floor. Doug opens the blinds. 

                                 DOUG
                        Good morning sunshine! The color 
                        team needs your approval on this 
                        immediately to send out.  

           Doug hands John an iPad with a clip from the TV show COPS. 
           John’s assistant brings in breakfast.  

                                 JOHN
                        This looks awful. Terrible. Tell 
                        them to take out the stabilizer and 
                        dim it down. It’s a night scene for 
                        god sakes. 

                                 DOUG
                        What do you want to do about the 
                        Walk of Fame?

                                 JOHN
                        I’m not going next to Kirstie 
                        Alley. Fuck that.   

                                 DOUG
                        You don’t have control over where 
                        you go. The other open spot is next 
                        to the silent film star ZaSu Pitts.  
                                 JOHN
                        So do I chose cancer or a heart 
                        attack? Flip a coin and decide for 
                        me. They’re just going to step on 
                        my name where ever I go.  

           Doug picks up empty bags of Cheetos and Doritos on the floor.

                                 DOUG
                        If this is going to be a regular 
                        thing, then you should get a hotel 
                        room with room service. Your diet 
                        should include something beyond the 
                        office vending machine.

                                 JOHN
                        I pay to keep the damn lights on, I 
                        should be able to sleep here. 

                                 DOUG
                        Finish that up quick. You got a 
                        meeting with FOX in fifteen.

                                 JOHN
                        What meeting with FOX? 

                                 DOUG
                        It’s probably something to do with 
                        the 25th anniversary. 

                                 JOHN
                        You handle it and just you. Don’t 
                        bring Morgan with you. 

                                 DOUG
                        You don’t have to hog-tie him down.

                                 JOHN
                        There’s a ladder Doug, and he has 
                        to climb it. Rung by rung. 

                                 DOUG
                        He’s a good producer. I’m trusting 
                        him to close on Omaha.  

                                 JOHN
                        On Omaha? No, no. He can’t do that. 

                                 DOUG
                        Too late. He’s on the phone with 
                        them right now. 
           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           John’s son MORGAN LANGLEY (40’s), relaxed LA vibe, talks with 
           jovial ease with OFFICER SCHMADERER on the other line. 

                                 MORGAN
                        I can assure you that our crews are 
                        very professional and will not get 
                        in the way of your officers 
                        performing their duties. 

           John and Doug barge in. 

                                 OFFICER SCHMADERER (O.S.)
                        I get that but we’re having a bit 
                        of a PR crisis right now. The media 
                        is all over my officers destroying 
                        video footage of an arrest. This is 
                        alleged of course, but I don’t 
                        think having a camera crew filming 
                        everything helps. 

                          MORGAN
                                                          JOHN
           Officer—
                                              Officer...

                                    JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Officer Schmaderer, it’s John. I 
                        understand your concerns 
                        completely. Let me ask have you 
                        ever watched an episode of COPS? 

                                 OFFICER SCHMADERER (O.S.)
                        Of course. 

                                 JOHN
                        So you know what we do. We are not 
                        the news. We don’t expose 
                        departments or look for dirt. We 
                        just want to show what a difficult 
                        job a police officer has on a daily 
                        basis. That’s our agenda. And any 
                        department I film in I’m a guest. 
                        If you object to anything I’ll take 
                        it out.    

                                 OFFICER SCHMADERER (O.S.)
                        Oh, I didn’t know that. 

                                 JOHN
                        Departments discover that it’s a 
                        positive thing to have been on the 
                        show. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        The public becomes aware of the job 
                        and can appreciate it more because 
                        these days you don’t ever hear 
                        anything about a police department 
                        unless it’s negative.

                                 OFFICER SCHMADERER (O.S.)
                        You’re right on that. 

                                 JOHN
                        If I can be frank you encounter a 
                        lot of bad shit and a lot of bad 
                        shit happens to you guys, but the 
                        police officers themselves aren’t 
                        the perpetrators. No, after 
                        watching COPS people see they’re 
                        the solution to the negativity.

                                 OFFICER SCHMADERER  (O.S.)
                        Let me ask you, why Omaha?   

           John looks at a paper: “Omaha crime rate on the rise”.

                                 JOHN
                        I’ll be honest with you. Middle 
                        America loves COPS and I want the 
                        25th season our most highly watched 
                        season yet. If we can’t work this 
                        out we have Iowa City as a backup.   

                                 OFFICER SCHMADERER (O.S.)
                        Iowa City...

                                 JOHN
                        Yes sir. Not my first choice.  

                                 OFFICER SCHMADERER (O.S.)
                        No, no. You guys can film here. 

                                 JOHN
                        That’s good to hear. I’m excited 
                        already. I’ll have, Doug Waterman, 
                        my Supervising Producer reach out 
                        with the details. 

                                 OFFICER SCHMADERER (O.S.)
                        Awesome! Looking forward—
                             (John hangs up)

                                 MORGAN
                        Iowa City? 
                                 JOHN
                        To close you got to make them think 
                        they’re losing something.

                                 MORGAN
                        I would have had him just fine. 

                                 JOHN
                        I’m not so sure about that. 

                                 JOHN’S ASSISTANT
                        I’m sorry to bother. FOX is here.   

           INT. SCREENING ROOM - AFTERNOON

           An episode of COPS is playing: A WHITE POLICE OFFICER pulls 
           up to a HEAVY BLACK MALE on a curb off an intersection.   

                                 POLICE OFFICER 
                        Here we go. Let’s check out and see 
                        what’s going on with this guy. 

                                 HEAVY BLACK MAN
                        I ain’t got non to say to you. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Sit down on the curb. I’m not going 
                        to tell you again.   

           The officer grabs the man by his shirt. They tussle a bit.   

                                 HEAVY BLACK MAN
                        What are you doing? Don’t be 
                        crapping on me. I just gonna get  
                        J’s. 

           The officer points a taser and hits him in the chest. The man 
           is pummeled down and pinned on the street as he’s cuffed. 

           The black man is hoisted up, his face is all bloody and his 
           shirt is half ripped off. He is dragged away.

           A BLACK WOMAN, watched by another cop, sits on the curb 
           crying. The camera pushes in on her face. The video pauses. 

           The woman holding the remote is CLAIRE (30’s). She is dolled 
           up like a Fox News Barbie and has a smooth way about her. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        You see what I mean? 

                                 JOHN
                        No...
                                 CLAIRE
                        It may be a little tone deaf with 
                        the Trayvon Martin trial playing 
                        24/7. We’re in a racially heated 
                        climate right now. 

                                 JOHN
                        This is America, we’re always in a 
                        racially heated climate. 

                                 MORGAN
                        What if we pushed this back a bit?   

                                 JOHN
                        You don’t get it. Trayvon Martin is 
                        exactly why we need to show this. 
                        People need to see police 
                        escalation for what it is, 
                        otherwise, we’re just sanitizing 
                        reality.  

                                 CLAIRE
                        At FOX we think the white males who 
                        watch COPS won’t change their minds 
                        after watching this segment. This 
                        segment will probably bolster their 
                        biases. 

                                 JOHN
                        I don’t cater my show to any race 
                        or gender. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        But our audience is white men. With 
                        all due respect, Mr. Langley, those 
                        who watch COPS watch it passively. 
                        They watch it for the great 
                        entertainment piece it is. 

                                 JOHN
                        That’s so naive, passively 
                        watching. When you watch something 
                        you watch. Everything that’s in the 
                        frame, every action, every line of 
                        dialogue is scrutinized. People are 
                        actually thinking when they watch 
                        something. Maybe you don’t. This is 
                        no different than Rodney King. We 
                        thrived during the LA riots because 
                        we aired challenging segments. 
           INT. COPS HEADQUARTERS - DAY 

           John exits the meeting with Morgan. Doug walks Claire out.  

                                 MORGAN
                        Dad... dad! What was that about? 

                                 JOHN
                        You sided with her. 

                                 MORGAN
                        They still haven’t renewed us yet. 
                        I’m trying to play nice. 

                                 JOHN
                        If you don’t think we should be 
                        airing segments like that then you 
                        don’t get this show. 

                                 MORGAN
                        I agree with you. I just don’t want 
                        anything happening to us. 

                                 JOHN
                        We have ratings. We’ll be fine.  

                                 PRODUCER
                             (approaching)
                        John, we’re ready for you... 

                                 MORGAN
                        Hold on. I spoke with mom. 

                                 JOHN
                             (to the producer)
                        Give us a minute. 

                                 MORGAN
                        She’s going to file. It’s going to 
                        be public soon. I thought you 
                        should know so you can prepare.  

                                 JOHN
                             (deeply hurt)
                        Is that it? 

                                 MORGAN
                        We can handle sound mixes. You and 
                        mom, that’s bigger than this stuff. 
                        Take the day. Really. You need to 
                        take care of yourself. 

           Morgan walks into the mixing room. John’s gaze moves to the 
           Zimmerman Trial still playing on the office TV. 
           INT. JOHN’S HOUSE - NIGHT 

           Back to the 80’s: John opens the door to his modest home, 
           holding tons of luggage. There are moving boxes everywhere.    

           YOUNG MORGAN, still cute for 11, is passed out on the couch. 
           John kisses him on the head waking him up. He takes out the 
           shotgun shell. It’s been made into a key chain. 

                                 JOHN 
                        Hey kiddo. I got you a something. 
                        This could have been used to kill 
                        someone. Be very careful with it.  

                                 MORGAN
                        Mom’s at the hospital, can we watch 
                        your show now? 

                                 JOHN
                        You’re not going to tell mom right?

           CUT TO: On the TV: Rivera interviews a trashy woman on the 
           street. 

                                 RIVERA
                        So you whore yourself out for crack 
                        cocaine? 

                                 TRASHY WOMAN    
                        Yeah. 

                                 RIVERA
                        How much do you charge? 

                                 JOHN
                        We can skip through this part. 

                                 MORGAN
                        What does whore mean? 

                                 JOHN
                        It’s a derogatory word for a woman. 

                                 MORGAN
                        What does derogatory mean? 

                                 JOHN
                        Whore is a bad word used to 
                        describe a bad woman. Don’t ever 
                        say it... Here. 

           The cops are just about to break in... Morgan’s eyes are 
           glued to the TV. John watches how engaged Morgan is. 
                                 MORGAN
                        Whoa...

           INT. FANCY BEVERLY HILLS RESTAURANT - AFTERNOON

           This is a fine dining experience: mahogany paneled walls, 
           waiters in tuxes and the air is filled with cigarette smoke. 
           Only the rich, famous or attractive can eat here. 

           John strolls in, way under-dressed. He spots Malcolm, clean 
           and pressed, and sits next to him.  

                                 MALCOLM
                        I’m glad you dressed up for the 
                        occasion. 

                                 JOHN
                        You see Brando over there? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Don’t point and button that second 
                        button I don’t want to see your 
                        chest hair.  

                                 JOHN
                        You have to do all the talking. I 
                        can barely look at his face.  

                                 MALCOLM
                        Geraldo’s face is gold.    

                                 JOHN
                        Those ratings were because of the 
                        work we did, he had nothing to do 
                        with it. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Don’t fuck this up. He brought in 
                        those ratings. We need him.  

                                 JOHN
                        He’s the Lorax minus the cuteness, 
                        but at least he lived in self-
                        imposed exile. Besides I’ve been 
                        thinking we should pitch— 

                                 VOICE 
                        Gentlemen.   

           They look up... Geraldo Rivera! They stand, towering over 
           him, not knowing if he heard anything. 
                                 MALCOLM
                        Geraldo! So good to see you.

                        You see Marlon Brando? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        He’s had three martinis since we 
                        came in.

                                 RIVERA
                        Hey waiter! Three martinis. Just 
                        for me. 

           Malcolm gives a sympathy laugh. John can’t make eye contact. 

                                 WAITER 
                        Right away, Mr. Rivera. 

                                 RIVERA
                        Were you waiting long? Some fans 
                        stopped me. They’re stopping me all 
                        the time now. They’re finally off 
                        Capone’s Vault, thank god. I guess 
                        the saying is true, “you're only as 
                        good as your last performance,” but 
                        don’t tell John’s wife that! You 
                        tried to call me the night we 
                        aired. They said you were huffing 
                        and puffing.   

                                 JOHN
                        No, no. I wanted to compliment you. 
                        You could be nominated for that 
                        performance. 

                                 RIVERA
                        Awards. Hmm. So you liked the show?

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah. 

                                 RIVERA
                        So you loved it?

           The waiter presents the martinis.  

                                 MALCOLM
                        To 15 million viewers? 
                             (clink!)
                        Good stuff! So we were thinking 
                        given the success of American Vice 
                        we should do a follow up. 
                                 RIVERA
                        No! American Vice has updated my 
                        image, my persona, my brand, to 
                        something edgier, something darker 
                        like Satanism. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Excuse me? 

                                 RIVERA
                        I want to do Satanism: the 
                        documentary. It will explore human 
                        sacrifice, ritualistic killings, 
                        all that bizarro Christian shit. I 
                        mean have you listened to heavy 
                        metal? The kids are into that and 
                        self mutilation. I want Satanism to 
                        be in the consciousness of this 
                        country and I want to make this 
                        special before anyone else does. 
                        You need to put together a list of 
                        satanists and cult leaders I could 
                        interview. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Of course! This is a brilliant 
                        idea.  

                                 RIVERA
                        What about you John? Why don’t I 
                        see your eyes lighting up? 

                                 JOHN
                        Well, I don’t think there should be 
                        a host anymore.  

                                 RIVERA
                        What do you mean no host? 

                                 JOHN
                        It’s pretty self explanatory. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        I think what John is saying is—

                                 JOHN
                        Leave you out completely. 

                                 RIVERA
                        It’s called the Geraldo Rivera show 
                        for a reason.   
                                 JOHN
                        If we want to be serious we should 
                        and give the subject matter the 
                        spotlight and ask questions from 
                        behind the camera. People want to 
                        see something real. Not a 
                        personality, not a filtered, 
                        chopped up version. They want 
                        something pure.

                                 RIVERA
                        That’s fucking boring! The people 
                        want me. I’m the reason we were the 
                        highest rated special ever. 

                                 JOHN
                        Fifth highest.   

           EXT. VALET AREA - AFTERNOON

           John watches Malcolm placating an incensed Rivera. Rivera 
           drives off in a red Ferrari. Malcolm scoffs over to John. 

                                 JOHN
                        So I’ve been thinking— 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Shut up. Just don’t. You know how 
                        close we were to losing his 
                        business? If it weren’t for the 
                        fact that your family would go 
                        homeless if I divorced you, I’d 
                        divorce you.

                                 JOHN
                        I think we should pitch Law 
                        Enforcement again. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        That’s been dead for a while. 

                                 JOHN
                        That pitch is how we got Rivera.  

                                 MALCOLM
                        This is insane! Anything Rivera 
                        makes will get picked up. Law 
                        Enforcement was a pipe dream, it’s 
                        not going to happen. 
                                 JOHN
                        You want to produce this demon doc? 
                        It’s time we make our own show now 
                        the way it should be made.

                                 MALCOLM
                        For the first time in this bloody 
                        business we’ve found stability. We 
                        can’t turn away from that.

                                 JOHN
                        But we’ll be making shit. Is that 
                        what you want to leave behind? 
                        Don’t you see we have an 
                        opportunity now? Those drug busts 
                        were something they’ve never seen 
                        before: unscripted real-life, life 
                        threatening situations. We can get 
                        to the issues and actually be 
                        responsible about it. Have cops be 
                        the way in and show them as they 
                        are, warts and all. No host, no 
                        reenactments, no spin, just pure 
                        raw reality.    

                                 MALCOLM
                        What would Maggie say if she found 
                        out you quit? There’s no money in 
                        it without Rivera’s name. This is a 
                        good gig. Give it time, John. It 
                        will lead to better things.    

                                 JOHN
                        Cover for me. Just until I get the 
                        show bought. You can do that for me 

           INT. FANCY BEVERLY HILLS RESTAURANT - NIGHT 

           Flash forward to 2013: It’s a Hollywood party: the area is 
           filled with people all dressed up. Their attention is on 
           STEPHEN CHAO (50’s), sloshed, talking into a microphone. 

                                 STEPHEN 
                        ... He truly is the godfather of 
                        reality television. Since COPS 
                        premiered 2,250 reality shows have 
                        been launched. He’s the richest man 
                        in the room, has a star on the 
                        Hollywood Walk of Fame, gets to 
                        work with his son Morgan and he 
                        owes it all to me. Please give it 
                        up for the man who has 25 years on 
                        the air, my friend John Langley.   
           The crowd cheers. John takes the microphone. 

                                 JOHN
                        After that I’m almost speechless, 
                        but not entirely. 

           CUT TO: John and Stephen at the bar getting drunker. The band 
           is playing an instrumental version of ‘Bad Boys’. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        She’s not wearing her ring anymore.  

                                 STEPHEN
                        Make her jealous. Find a woman here 
                        who’d fuck you, once Maggie hears 
                        about it she’ll be back. 

                                 JOHN
                        Speaking from experience? 

                                 STEPHEN
                        Insecurity is the glue that keeps a 
                        marriage together. What about 
                        Morgan? You made him an EP. 

                                 JOHN
                        He works hard, that much I can say. 
                        Spends a lot of time away from his 
                        family.  

                                 STEPHEN
                        I guess the apple doesn’t fall far 
                        from the tree.
                             (Morgan approaches them)
                        Speak of the devil! 

                                 MORGAN 
                        Hello Chao. 
                             (to John)
                        Can I talk with you? 

                                 STEPHEN
                        I’ll leave you two be. I have my 
                        eyes on a little birdie and now 
                        I’ve just made eye contact.    
                             (walks off)

                                 MORGAN
                        Have you heard of Color of Change? 

                                 JOHN
                        I didn’t know it had a color. 
                                 MORGAN
                        They’re a civil rights group. They 
                        just released a petition urging FOX 
                        to cancel COPS. They say the 
                        images, “linger in the subconscious 
                        of viewers, creating unconscious 
                        attitudes and implicit biases about 
                        race.” 

                                 JOHN
                        I’ve never heard of these people. 

                                 MORGAN
                        They got Glenn Beck off Fox News, 
                        even when he was the highest rated 
                        cable news show in his time slot.

                                 JOHN
                        I know who Glenn Beck is.

                                 MORGAN
                        Here. I’ve drafted a press release 
                        we could use.

                                 JOHN
                        If we do that we give it air. All 
                        those outlets that wanted to 
                        interview me about the 25th 
                        anniversary, set them up. We can 
                        drown them out with that coverage.  

                                 MORGAN
                        I could do them with you. The 
                        family business look would be good. 

                                 JOHN
                        Nepotism isn’t a good look. 

                                 MORGAN
                        Why are you pushing me to the side? 
                        I work very hard for you. 

                                 JOHN
                        Since it’s birth I’ve been the face 
                        of this show and until I die that 
                        won’t change.    

           An instrumental rock intro pulses.

           INT. ABC CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 

           Back to the 80’s: John, nicely dressed, hands a packet titled 
           “LAW ENFORCEMENT” to ABC executives. The music continues. 
           INT. NBC CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 

           Same scenario, John is pitching to executives. We don’t hear 
           what he’s saying, but he looks prepared and focused.

           INT. CBS CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           The executives nod along as John continues pitching. John 
           picks up on their disinterest and leans in to grab attention.  

           INT. PBS CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 

           An executive checks her watch as John pitches.  

           INT. ABC CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 

           John’s passion grows as he’s speaking. An executive 
           interrupts him. John deflates. 

           INT. NBC CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 

           An assistant opens the door interrupting John’s pitch. They 
           turn to John, say a few words, and walk out.

           INT. CBS CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 

           John shakes hands with the executives. They leave the “LAW 
           ENFORCEMENT” packets on the table. John takes them.  

           INT. PBS CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 

           The executive pats him on the back and walks away. John 
           stands there like a statue. Defeated.  

           INT. JOHN’S BEDROOM - EVENING

           Maggie, in nurse scrubs, perfects her makeup. All the sudden 
           voices are heard. She walks over to see John watching TV.   

                                 MAGGIE
                        Oh, honey. You’re home early. 

                                 JOHN
                        Got out early. 

                                 MAGGIE 
                        Everything okay? 
                                 JOHN
                        Just watching Superman. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        You see my extensions? 

                                 JOHN
                             (not looking)
                        Nice.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Everything is okay, right?

                                 JOHN
                        I wasn’t fired. Satanism...    

                                 MAGGIE
                        It’s just this one for now and 
                        you’re contributing. I don’t have 
                        to work as many nights.  

                                 JOHN
                        I should have my own show Maggie. 
                        I’ve paid my dues. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        We can’t risk that again. 

                                 JOHN
                        I’d like to watch this.
                             (Maggie scoffs up)
                        Maggie, I didn’t mean to say that. 

                                 MAGGIE 
                        I have to pick up Morgan, he got 
                        detention. 

                                 JOHN
                        What’d he do? 

                                 MAGGIE
                        He called a girl in his class a 
                        whore. 

           INT. STUDIO ROOM - MORNING 

           CUT to 2013: A makeup artist powders John’s nose. 

                                 MAKEUP ARTIST 
                        It must be nice to run the show 
                        with your son....  

           John just glares at her. KAREN (30’s), dignified, approaches.
                                 KAREN 
                        Mr. Langley, it’s a pleasure. My 
                        father and I used to watch COPS 
                        when I was a girl.  

                                 JOHN
                        Are you not putting a diffuser on? 

                                 KAREN
                        I beg your pardon?

                                 JOHN
                        The key light. If you don’t put a 
                        soft box or a diffuser on it, it 
                        will be too harsh and there’s no 
                        bounce over here. I don’t want to 
                        look shadowy.   

                                 KAREN
                        I’ll make sure they handle that.   

                                 JOHN
                        Could I get a frame line?   

           CUT TO: The interview. Cameras roll on John and Karen seated. 
           John’s charming now.   

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        ... So we had these two PA’s pick 
                        up the dog droppings in front of 
                        the house in Venice Beach and after 
                        a while one of them comes up to me 
                        and asks, “John do you have any 
                        advice for me?” I said if you want 
                        to be a writer write, if you want 
                        to be a producer produce and he 
                        said, “That’s it? That’s your 
                        advice?” And I said, “That’s my 
                        advice!” So he walked off, picked 
                        up some more dog droppings and at 
                        the end of the day he came back to 
                        me and said, “John, I quit!” And I 
                        said, “Congratulations! So what are 
                        you going to do now?” He said I’m a 
                        writer and I’m a director and 
                        that’s what I’m doing. That kid was 
                        Quentin Tarantino and the other one 
                        was Roger Avery. Together they 
                        wrote Pulp Fiction.  

                                 KAREN
                        Wow.
                                 JOHN
                        The moral of the story is if you 
                        want to have success in this 
                        business don’t get stuck picking up 
                        dog droppings in Venice Beach. 

                                 KAREN 
                        Speaking of partnerships, you 
                        haven’t mentioned Malcolm Barbour. 

                                 JOHN 
                        Malcolm my ex partner, the cad! He 
                        retired a while ago so he hasn’t 
                        been around much and he wasn’t 
                        around much in the beginning to be 
                        honest with you.   

                                 KAREN 
                        What do you think he brought to the 
                        party when you were starting out? 

                                 JOHN 
                        Business stuff mainly. That’s why 
                        we hooked up; he was the business 
                        side, I was the creative, but he 
                        was a skeptic about COPS. He didn’t 
                        think it would ever work but he was 
                        a very amusing guy. In his day.     

                                 KAREN
                        So COPS just entered its 25th 
                        season, a television milestone. 
                        Your contract with FOX ends after 
                        this season, do you think they will 
                        renew the show beyond that?

                                 JOHN
                        I have had a great relationship 
                        with FOX, they stay out of the way. 
                        We’ll continue working together. 

                                 KAREN
                        I have to ask you about the steady 
                        decline in ratings over the years. 
                             (careful)
                        Do you think it’s correlated with 
                        the criticism of how demographics 
                        have been represented on COPS?

                                 JOHN
                        The study you’re referencing only 
                        evaluated 16 episodes. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        If Old Dominion University wanted 
                        an accurate reading they should 
                        have taken a larger pool.

                                 KAREN
                        There was also another study—

                                 JOHN
                        Look, we can debate every study 
                        done on COPS, but I don’t want to 
                        bore people. 

                                 KAREN
                        But they overwhelmingly show that 
                        your show has sharply skewed the 
                        numbers of black and Hispanic men, 
                        depicting them as a violent 
                        criminal class out of proportion to 
                        their actual percentage of crime 
                        while at the same time, Caucasian 
                        males were shown as a far less 
                        culpable group than they actually 
                        are, statistically.

           Morgan’s phone goes off. Bad timing. He walks away. 

                                 JOHN
                        It’s no secret that they’re 
                        arrested more than whites, but I 
                        don’t believe that has anything to 
                        do with race. I believe that’s 
                        institutional racism from the top.

                                 KAREN
                        I don’t want to stray from the 
                        point— 

                                 JOHN
                        Please, let’s get there.  

                                 KAREN
                        Do you think COPS, inadvertently, 
                        contributes in perpetuating the 
                        stereotype that brown people are 
                        criminals? 

                                 JOHN
                        Yes, my reality TV show is causing 
                        the racial divide in this country. 

                                 KAREN
                        If you could please answer my 
                        question. There is a petition out—
                                 JOHN
                        COPS is apolitical. We are 
                        documentarians capturing real 
                        events. What you see is what 
                        actually happened. Possession of 
                        drugs is the number one crime we 
                        show. Why? Because drug offenses 
                        are half of the total 
                        incarcerations in this country. 
                        Blacks and whites use drugs at the 
                        same rate and yet the imprisonment 
                        rate of blacks is 6 times more. I 
                        expose that and I don’t sway 
                        audiences one way or another. I 
                        just maintain sunlight is the best 
                        disinfectant. 

                                 KAREN
                        But you will concede that COPS is a 
                        pro-cop show? 

                                 JOHN
                        Yes... 

                                 KAREN
                        So by nature it is not apolitical. 

                                 JOHN
                        Fine, sure. It’s pro-cop, if that’s 
                        what makes something political.  

                                 KAREN
                        We’re introduced to the cops first, 
                        we come from their perspective so 
                        aren’t we conditioned to  
                        sympathize with them?

                                 JOHN
                        Karen, the show is called COPS. 

                                 KAREN
                        Yet we’re never shown misconduct. 
                        Wouldn’t it be more balanced if 
                        COPS showed cops who made mistakes? 

                                 JOHN
                        Made mistakes, sure, we’ve shown 
                        that but if you’re implying 
                        misconduct, never. I’ve never seen 
                        that.

                                 KAREN
                        The first season you filmed in

                        Sheriff Nick Navarro was exposed 
                        for some pretty egregious 
                        practices—

                                 JOHN
                        I’m going to stop you right there. 
                        You have to understand Broward, at 
                        that time, was in a drug war. Crack 
                        was smuggled in there every day. 
                        With that came prostitution, rape, 
                        murder. He had to clean up those 
                        streets. If you watch the pilot and 
                        go there now, it’s another world. 
                        He made Broward safer and he made 
                        mistakes but if you’re looking for 
                        me to hang my head in shame for 
                        ‘portraying’ cops like Nick as 
                        heroes I won’t. I will never. Nick 
                        was a hero and so are the thousands 
                        of cops I’ve worked with. It’s easy 
                        to say otherwise, I was on the 
                        other side once but I was ignorant, 
                        I was ignorant until I got to spend 
                        time with them. There are men and 
                        women out there protecting and 
                        serving, doing it the right way, 
                        they’re not talked about. And yes 
                        there are some bad apples. Some do 
                        it the wrong way and it's going to 
                        get out there. It's going to go 
                        viral now but you would be wrong to 
                        paint all cops with the same brush. 
                        The overwhelming majority of police 
                        officers are hardworking people who 
                        want to do the right thing. So 
                        instead of generalizing your 
                        frustrations on misconduct, maybe 
                        start recognizing the ones that are 
                        doing it the right way. 

           John sits back and gives Karen a “I won” grin. 

           CUT TO: Interview is over. John and Doug walk over to Morgan.  

                                 DOUG
                        You did great. You destroyed her.  

                                 JOHN
                        It doesn’t matter. She’ll just show 
                        what she wants with the footage.   
                             (interrupting Morgan)
                        What’s going? Morgan...
                                 MORGAN 
                        We have a problem.  

           INT. LA HOME - MORNING 

           Back to the 80’s: LAUREN STRATFORD, huge glasses and curly 
           hair sits across from Geraldo Rivera. Cameras roll on them.  

                                 LAUREN 
                        I was locked in a metal drum with 
                        four dead babies who had been 
                        sacrificed to Satan. I became a 
                        baby breeder. I had three children, 
                        all of them were sacrificed. 

                                 RIVERA
                        What did he do with the bodies? 

                                 LAUREN
                        He ate them. 

           John and Malcolm watch on the monitor. John storms out.  

           INT. GARAGE - MORNING 

           John pours himself coffee from crafty. Rivera approaches him. 

                                 RIVERA
                        Malcolm really stuck his neck out 
                        to bring you back. Fought me tooth 
                        and nail. Now that’s a friend, 
                        maybe more? Go out and get me a 
                        grande misto with soy milk. 

           EXT. LA STREET - EVENING

           John, in his car, slows down as he sees a group of people 
           huddled together holding signs, “WRITERS GUILD ON STRIKE”.  

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah, keep fighting.  

           INT. JOHN’S DINING ROOM - EVENING 

           The family is at the table eating. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        How was work today? 
                             (John mumbles)
                        What was that?
                                 JOHN
                        We’re not attracting advertisers. 
                        Apparently businesses don’t want 
                        promote their products along side 
                        the devil.    

           BBRRIINNGG! The phone wails. John drifts to the kitchen. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                             (picking up)
                        Hello? 

                                 VOICE
                        Is this John Langley? 

                                 JOHN
                        Who’s calling?  

           INT. STEPHEN CHAO’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           It’s Stephen Chao! He looks exactly the same decades younger 
           but with long hair. 

                                 STEPHEN
                        My name is Stephen Chao, I’m an 
                        executive at FOX. Maybe you heard 
                        of us, we’re a new studio looking 
                        to get into the TV market. I heard 
                        about your pitch for “Law 
                        Enforcement” and it sounds in line 
                        with what we’re looking to make. 
                        Would you mind coming in to talk 
                        about it with us? 

           John’s frozen. He can’t believe it.  

                                 JOHN
                        I can come in. 

                                 STEPHEN
                        Excellent! It would be me and Bruce 
                        Geller. 

                                 JOHN
                        Bruce Geller. As in the CEO Bruce 
                        Geller?

                                 STEPHEN
                        That’s him. It’s good you’re up to 
                        date on industry news. Mr. Geller 
                        will like that.   
           INT. JOHN’S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           John comes back in.

                                 JOHN
                        Hey kiddo, you want to throw the 
                        ball around? 

                                 MAGGIE
                        He’s grounded... 

                                 JOHN
                        Oh you’re sorry right?

                                 MORGAN
                        Yeah...

                                 MAGGIE
                        John, who called?

                                 JOHN
                        Wrong number. 

           John and Morgan leave. Maggie can tell John is lying. 

           INT. FOX WAITING AREA - MORNING 

           John walks to a RECEPTIONIST (early 20s). Her eyes are red 
           and watery from crying several times today.

                                 JOHN
                        John Langley to see Stephen Chao 
                        and Bruce Geller. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST 
                        I will let them know. 

           The receptionist doesn’t know how to use the intercom. She is 
           visibly overwhelmed. She deeply sighs and walks off screen. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Langley is here for you.

                                 BOOMING VOICE (O.S.)
                        Don’t you knock?!

                                 RECEPTIONIST (O.S.)
                        I’m sorry, I have Mr. Langley 
                        waiting for you. 

                                 BOOMING VOICE (O.S.)
                        Use the phone! For fucks sake 
                        honestly. Wait. Girl! GIRL! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BOOMING VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Come back here! What happened to 
                        that note from Eisner? Now is when 
                        you answer.

                                 RECEPTIONIST (O.S.)
                        I was going to send it to you.

                                 BOOMING VOICE (O.S.)
                        You were going to send it and then 
                        you thought better of it?

                                 RECEPTIONIST (O.S.)
                        I got distracted, my bad. 

                                 BOOMING VOICE (O.S.)
                        MY BAD, WHAT IS THIS HIGH SCHOOL?!
                        Get the fuck out. Out of this 
                        office. Out of this industry. GO! 

           The receptionist, mascara bleeding, leaves the building. A 
           beat later Stephen Chao, sunny face, pops out.  

                                 STEPHEN
                        John, Stephen Chao. So glad you 
                        could come in on short notice.  

                                 JOHN
                             (unsettled)
                        Yeah, yes. Thank you.  

           CUT TO John and Stephen walking down a hall, an earth shaking 
           laugh comes out of an office. All John can see are a pair of 
           legs propped up on a desk with a phone chord going up.    

                                 BOOMING VOICE (O.S.)
                        You couldn’t pay me to see Dustin 
                        Hoffman play a retard! HA HA HA!

           INT. FOX CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING

                                 STEPHEN
                        Some coffee? 

                                 JOHN
                        Oh, no thank you. 

                                 STEPHEN
                        That thread. He’ll find that thread 
                        off your lapel distracting. Cut it. 

           Stephen hands him baby scissor. He just has them in his 
           pocket. 
                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        Whatever you’ve heard about Bruce 
                        Geller, anything at all, you should 
                        know it’s all true. 

                                 JOHN
                        Um, is there anything you think I 
                        should know?  

                                 STEPHEN
                        Just make sure you take out the ums 
                        and ahs. He likes people to be 
                        articulate. Poised. Sit up a 
                        little. Take these. 

           Stephen hands him tic tacs. 

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        Don’t suck on them. He’ll notice an 
                        orange tongue. You have a firm 
                        handshake but your palms are 
                        sweaty. Wipe them off and make sure 
                        to close your mouth when you’re not 
                        talking. If you have to cross your 
                        legs don’t let it be away from him. 
                        And whatever you do, don’t stare. I 
                        mean look him in the eye, but every 
                        seven seconds or so look away.  

           The door swings opens... BRUCE GELLER makes his entrance. In 
           appearance he’s a Mr. Burns doppelgänger, at heart he’s the 
           bully boy's bully boy. However, now he’s the charm master. 

                                 BRUCE
                        Don’t tell me the party started. 

                                 STEPHEN
                        Not at all! 

                                 BRUCE
                        Mr. John Langley. Very good to meet 
                        you. Bruce Geller.

                                 JOHN
                        It’s a pleasure, sir. 

           The handshake went well. Stephen is happy. 

                                 BRUCE
                        Sit down, please. I know you’ve 
                        done the rounds. You don’t have to 
                        tell me about it; NBC, ABC, CBS, 
                        PBS. They’re all shit holes.

                        them but we did them. They got us 
                        started and we’re going big now. 
                        Tell him about The Simpsons. 

                                 STEPHEN
                        It’s a animated sitcom-- 

                                 BRUCE
                        It’s the Flintstones with yellow 
                        people. Not Asian like Stephen 
                        here, just yellow. You’ll get it 
                        when you see it. Everyone passed 
                        except for us. We also got a 
                        variety sketch show in the works, 
                        the black SNL I’m calling it and 
                        I’m making Joan Rivers the first 
                        woman on late night. That’ll happen 
                        when the strikes over.   

                                 STEPHEN
                        We have a growing slate we’re very 
                        proud of.  

                                 BRUCE
                        I was a big fan of your work on 
                        American Vice. I can’t stand that 
                        dingus with the mustache but those 
                        live drug busts were a hellova 
                        lotta fun. I respect a producer who 
                        knows how to shoot. 

                                 JOHN
                        You knew that was me? 

                                 BRUCE
                        Oh Mr. Langley, I may be a college 
                        dropout, but I do my homework. I 
                        like what you’re about, the whole 
                        real raw thing, I get it. I like 
                        reality TV, some people think it’s 
                        cheap, but I think it’s the future. 
                        No writers to deal with! You tell 
                        him we like the concept? 

                                 STEPHEN
                        We like the concept. 
                                 BRUCE
                        We love the concept. We’re all 
                        about it. I don’t want you to waste 
                        a breath trying to convince me 
                        because I’m convinced. We want FOX 
                        to be its home. 

                                 JOHN
                        Wow... I’m, I’m thrilled.  

                                 BRUCE 
                        We’re about quality here. When I 
                        first took over Paramount we had a 
                        film called Bug, the one about 
                        mutant cockroaches, you ever see 
                        Bug? 

                                 STEPHEN
                        I did!  

                                 BRUCE
                        Shut up you! No one saw it. I had 
                        them make the tag line: “the 
                        picture you see with your eyes 
                        closed”, cause that’s the only way 
                        you could watch it! There’s a 
                        reason the guy before me was fired. 
                        I blew up their slate and we made 
                        Airplane!, Grease, Indiana Jones! 
                        That’s what I want to do with FOX, 
                        your show is going to be a big part 
                        of this network. Now tell me about 
                        Mr. Barbour. Why isn’t he here?

                                 JOHN
                        We’re in production on the next 
                        Rivera special. He’s covering for 
                        me. 

                                 BRUCE
                        Easy to work with? 

                                 JOHN
                        Very, he’s my partner on 
                        everything.      

                                 BRUCE
                        Then let’s set a meeting with you 
                        two to get this deal done! We’re 
                        very excited about this. We 
                        definitely want your input as we 
                        move forward. 

           John winces, that last bit was off to him. 
                                 STEPHEN
                        Our office will be in touch with 
                        your people soon about a contract. 

                                 JOHN
                        I’m a little confused. You said you 
                        want my input?  

                                 BRUCE
                        Very much so. We want you involved.  

                                 JOHN
                        But not as the showrunner? 

                                 BRUCE
                        We have to go with someone more 
                        experienced. We know plenty of 
                        showrunners who are experts in this 
                        kind of pedigree. We definitely 
                        want you involved in that decision.

                                 JOHN
                        But I’m the only one to oversee 
                        this show. It’s my vision.  

                                 STEPHEN
                        We want to make you an EP, but 
                        overseeing a broadcast series is a 
                        horse of a different color. 

                                 BRUCE
                        Look Mr. Langley, I can make you a 
                        rich man. Every time an episode 
                        airs you will get a check. Every 
                        time it’s rerun you will get a 
                        check. And if the show is 
                        syndicated, well, you and your 
                        family won’t have to worry about 
                        the rent or house hopping anymore.  

                                 JOHN
                        I think we’re getting a little 
                        ahead of ourselves— 

                                 BRUCE
                        Let’s get serious here. Everyone 
                        you pitched to, they all passed. 
                        They fucking hated it. You got no 
                        other options and you’re old enough 
                        to know this town doesn’t hand out 
                        green lights for free. 

                                 JOHN
                        We’re the same age, Mr. Geller— 
                                 BRUCE
                        And yet before yesterday, I never 
                        heard your name and if you pass 
                        this up, you’ll be sure no one else 
                        ever will.  

                                 JOHN
                        When you were at Paramount, I was 
                        writing scripts that never went 
                        anywhere. My entire career I 
                        trusted men in suits who I thought 
                        believed in my ideas. Our jobs are 
                        our lives and yet you’ve made a 
                        name for yourself. No one knows who 
                        I am and there’s only one way that 
                        changes. 

                                 BRUCE
                        What’s that?

                                 JOHN
                        I do it my way.    

           INT. FOX WAITING AREA - MORNING

           John walks out. Another RECEPTIONIST is sitting at the desk. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST #2
                        Have a good day! 

           INT. SCHOOL FRONT OFFICE - AFTERNOON 

           Morgan enters, the shotgun shell dangles off his back pack. 
           He sees John.    

                                 MORGAN
                        What’s going on? 

                                 JOHN
                        You’re sick son. You’re not feeling 
                        well. Fever? Oh yes very high. I 
                        think we ought to take you out. 

           INT. SPORTS BAR - DAY 

           John and Morgan watch a Dodgers game. John’s had a few beers.  

                                 JOHN
                        You really want to be a baseball 
                        player when you grow up? 
                                 MORGAN
                        Yeah... 

                                 JOHN
                        Do you know the odds of becoming a 
                        professional in major league 
                        baseball? I mean it’s got to be 
                        next to no chance at all. You think 
                        you have what it takes?     

                                 MORGAN
                        I think so. I practice a whole lot.

                                 JOHN
                        But do you think you have what it 
                        takes to be the next Kirk Gibson?

                                 MORGAN
                        Uh maybe... 

                                 JOHN
                        You don’t sound confident.  

                                 MORGAN
                        Not everyone can be Kirk Gibson. 

                                 JOHN
                        Not everyone can be Morgan Langley. 
                        Whatever you decide to be you make 
                        sure you’re the best at it. I 
                        didn’t have a father who gave me 
                        guidance. I had to figure it out 
                        myself and I didn’t find my passion 
                        until late in life. Too late. 
                        You’re young, you should start 
                        thinking about these things now. I 
                        want you to make a name for 
                        yourself.     

                                 MORGAN
                        Like being famous?

                                 JOHN
                        Not that and it’s not about money 
                        either. Don’t think like mom. Think 
                        of it as making an impact. Every 
                        person has the opportunity to leave 
                        their handprints on this world, but 
                        the truth is most lives are 
                        irrelevant. People fade into total 
                        obscurity. I don’t have much to 
                        leave behind other than you. If 
                        it’s baseball you want devote 
                        yourself son. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        I will help you get there. Your 
                        life should mean something. 

           INT. JOHN’S KITCHEN - NIGHT 

           John plays the messages from the phone. 

                                 MALCOLM (O.S.)
                        You’re late. You should be here—
                             (John skips)
                        Where are you?! Geraldo is 
                        screaming. He wants you gone. 
                             (John skips)
                        You better be sick as a dog I 
                        swear. I put my—

           BBBRRRIIINNNG. John picks up.  

                                 JOHN
                        Malcolm, my kid got sick. I had to 
                        take him to the doctor. 

                                 STEPHEN
                        I’m sorry. Um, it’s Stephen Chao 
                        from FOX. 

                                 JOHN
                        Oh, yes! Hello!  

                                 STEPHEN
                        Your son’s okay? I don’t have to 
                        ask you about all of that do I? 

                                 JOHN
                        No. He’s fine. What’s going on? 

                                 STEPHEN
                        I had a chance to talk it over with 
                        Geller. We want to make your 
                        show... with you as the showrunner. 

           John takes his ear off the phone. A smile grows wide. 

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        Geller has one condition. He hates 
                        the name. It has to be called COPS.

                                 JOHN
                        I can live with that. 

                                 STEPHEN
                        There is one more thing. The strike 
                        opened the door for this. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 STEPHEN (CONT'D)
                        We can’t buy anything scripted now 
                        which is what Geller really wants. 
                        I’m afraid if the strike is 
                        resolved we’re in jeopardy.  

                                 JOHN
                        How long do we have? 

                                 STEPHEN
                        Negotiations just began with the 
                        WGA. I wouldn’t say very long.

           INT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT 

           DING DONG. Malcolm, with a robe on, opens the door...

                                 JOHN
                        I can explain. 

           INT. MALCOLM’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 

           John watches a smile grow on Malcolm. It’s silent for a beat. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        This is big. It’s not little big. 
                        It’s big big. 

                                 JOHN
                        It’s huge. 

                                 MALCOLM 
                        Wow. Bruce Geller. I have to say I 
                        picked a good one with you.  

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah you did. They want us to be 
                        executive producers and for me to 
                        be the showrunner. 

                                 MALCOLM 
                        They didn’t want us as co-
                        showrunners huh? 
                             (John shakes his head)
                        Too bad. 

                                 JOHN
                        I’m calling Sheriff Navarro in the 
                        morning to get Broward. I need you 
                        to help me put the crew together 
                        and get location permits. 
                                 MALCOLM
                        Let me finish up with Rivera first.  

                                 JOHN 
                        You’re joking.  

                                 MALCOLM 
                        They just ordered a pilot. We don’t 
                        have any security beyond that. I 
                        can’t rock the boat with Rivera. 

                                 JOHN
                        This is our dream. It’s here. I 
                        don’t want to wait around for the 
                        green light to turn red. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        I’ll give Rivera my two weeks, I 
                        just have to talk it over with 
                        Mary. Maggie’s on board with this?  

                                 JOHN
                        Of course. 

           Malcolm hands John a drink. They cheers...

                                 MALCOLM
                        To COPS...

                                 JOHN
                        To changing the world...

           INT. OMAHA POLICE STATION - DAY

           CUT to 2013: FLASH. FLASH. Camera’s flash on the grim faces 
           of John and Morgan at a press conference. Something’s off. 

                                 VOICE
                        It’s as if we lost one of our own. 
                        That is the grieving process we're 
                        going through right now.

           This is the incident...

           INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT 

           A COPS CAMERAMAN and BRYCE DION (38), the audio operator film 
           in the back seat as the car speeds to a WENDY’S. The Omaha 
           officers draw their guns and run out. The crew follows them. 
           A pedestrian car bolts out of the parking lot. 
           INT. WENDY’S RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

           Right as the crew enters... POW! POW! POW! The Cameraman 
           sprints behind a table. He points the camera towards the 
           counter: A black man in a hoodie and the cops exchange fire. 

           POW! POW! POW! One bullet goes right through the table, 
           inches away from the Cameraman’s chest. He ducks down and 
           films through the reflection of the window. 

           POW! The robber’s hit but keeps moving. POW! The window glass 
           shatters. POW! The cameraman lifts his camera up and around 
           to see the man fall facedown in the parking lot. 

                                 OMAHA OFFICER #1
                        He’s down!

           The cameraman moves up and see’s the boom lying on the floor.  

                                 COPS CAMERAMAN
                        God... 

           Bryce is writhing on the floor. His blood soaked hand is 
           pressing on his side, the Achilles heel of the vest. 

           INT. OMAHA POLICE STATION BRIEFING ROOM - DAY 

           Officer Schmaderer, the guy on the phone with John before, is 
           in the middle of a press conference. 

                                 REPORTER #1
                        Can you confirm he was killed from 
                        friendly fire by an officer? 

                                 OFFICER SCHMADERER
                        Based on our viewing of the footage 
                        the officers had no choice other 
                        than to respond the way they did. 

                                 REPORTER #2
                        Is it possible they could have been 
                        showing off for the COPS cameras?

           CUT TO: After the conference John, distraught, is with Doug. 

                                 JOHN
                        Send Lilies and a sympathy basket 
                        to the mother. Let her know we’re 
                        taking care of the funeral and 
                        medical expenses. 

                                 DOUG
                        You know they’re going to sue us. 
                                 JOHN
                        Wouldn’t you?  

                                 MORGAN
                             (approaching)
                        I just got off the phone with 
                        Claire, Fox is shortening us to 16. 

                                 DOUG
                        Episodes? Just because of Bryce?

                                 MORGAN
                        It’s the Color of Change petition. 
                        They have a 100,000 signatures. The 
                        director, Rashad Robinson, is 
                        making it his mission to get us 
                        canceled. There must be some dirt 
                        we can find on him. 

                                 DOUG
                        I hear he’s gay... 

                                 JOHN
                        We’re not in Iran or the 1950s. 
                        Jesus! And we’re not going after 
                        anyone. Bryce just died.   

                                 MORGAN
                        I think it’s time to explore other 
                        networks.  

                                 JOHN
                        No. Absolutely not. 

                                 MORGAN
                        The petition was getting more 
                        attention than all the press you 
                        did. FOX took that seriously. We 
                        have to look into other options.

                                 JOHN
                        You think anyone will take us now 
                        with Bryce on the news? 

                                 MORGAN
                        We have ratings... 

                                 JOHN
                        If FOX finds out we’re taking 
                        meetings with other networks that 
                        could compromise our relationship. 
                        COPS will survive, it always has. 
           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 

           John laying down with his stomach hanging out flips through 
           the Kardashians, Pawn Stars, The Bachelor, all reality TV. 

           He gets to FOX News where none other than Geraldo Rivera is 
           on. He’s salt and peppered now, but still has the mustache. 
           These were his actual words...  

                                 RIVERA
                        I think the hoodie is as much 
                        responsible for Trayvon Martin’s 
                        death as George Zimmerman was. When 
                        you see a kid walking down the 
                        street particularly a dark skinned 
                        kid with the pants around the 
                        ankles people look at you, what do 
                        you think? Those crime scenes, 
                        surveillance tapes, every time you 
                        see someone sticking up a 7/11 the 
                        kid’s wearing a hoodie. You have to 
                        recognize that this whole stylizing 
                        as a “gangsta”, people are going to 
                        perceive you as a menace. When you 
                        see a black or Latino youngster, 
                        particularly on the street, you 
                        walk to the other side of the 
                        street! Trayvon Martin, a wonderful 
                        innocent kid with a box of skittles 
                        in his hand, he didn’t deserve to 
                        die but I’ll bet you money if he 
                        didn’t have that hoodie on he 
                        wouldn’t have been killed.  

           The room phone rings. 

                                 JOHN
                        I wanted the alarm at 1 PM. 

                                 MAGGIE (O.S.)
                        It’s me. I saw the news. Are you 
                        okay?

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah, I’m fine. It’s good to hear 
                        your voice.  

                                 MAGGIE (O.S.)
                        When are you coming back to LA? We 
                        should talk. 
           INT. JOHN’S HOUSE - NIGHT 

           Back to the 80s: At the end of the hall there’s a door ajar 
           with light spilling out. Screams come from there.  

                                 MAGGIE (O.S.)
                        You lied to us! 

                                 JOHN (O.S.)
                        This is more money Maggie! 

                                 MAGGIE (O.S.)
                        What happens if it doesn’t get 
                        picked up?! Where will we be then?!
                        You had a stable job with Rivera!

           We creep into... Morgan’s bedroom. Under the covers is Morgan 
           crying. Something shatters. A glass or a plate. Morgan grabs 
           a Walkman from a drawer. As the music plays his eyes close.     

           INT. FOX CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Geller and Chao flip through a packet John and Malcolm 
           created. It has the faces of the characters in the opening.  

                                 JOHN
                        That’s Ron Cacciatore who heads the 
                        organized crime division, his 
                        number two is right below him, 
                        Sergeant Bob Deak. And on the next 
                        page is Vicki Cutcliffe in charge 
                        of the Airport Interdiction Unit. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        We have the permits to film in the 
                        Fort Lauderdale Airport. 

                                 BRUCE
                        This Vicki girl, she’s not very 
                        attractive is she? 

                                 JOHN
                        She looks better on camera. 

                                 BRUCE
                        She’s a 6. I need at least an 8 and 
                        all these pigs look like average 
                        joe’s. Where are the characters? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        What exactly are you looking for?
                                 BRUCE
                        Do you not watch TV? Every show has 
                        one wild supporting character. We 
                        can’t make one up, but you can find 
                        one. It’s Florida for godsakes.

                                 STEPHEN 
                        This cameraman, Bertram Van 
                        Munster. He’s good? 

           QUICK CUT TO: John and Malcolm sit with BERTRAM VAN MUNSTER 
           (30s), a lankly Dutch man at their production office.   

                                 JOHN
                        Under no circumstance do camera 
                        operators interfere. You may have 
                        the instinct to help the officers 
                        but they are our actors. We let 
                        them be. 

                                 BERTRAM
                        When I filmed for National 
                        Geographic I captured lions rip 
                        apart dozens of antelopes. I have 
                        taken a time lapse of a python 
                        swallow a Vervet Monkey alive. I 
                        filmed a crocodile tear off the 
                        trunk of a baby elephant in front 
                        of it’s mother. I have never 
                        obstructed mother nature before and 
                        I don’t intend to start now. 

           QUICK CUT BACK TO: The FOX office...

                                 JOHN
                        He’ll be fine. 

                                 BRUCE 
                        There’s nothing in the budget for 
                        reenactments or music.  

                                 JOHN
                        That’s not what this show is. It 
                        needs to reflect reality.   

                                 BRUCE
                        No, it’s the appearance of reality. 
                        Everything has an agenda. Ours is 
                        to entertain. Plain raw footage 
                        will bore the audience.     
                                 JOHN
                        The value of this show is in the 
                        real life drama of the situation 
                        the cops will be in. Nothing should 
                        cheapen the moment. 

                                 BRUCE
                        If you want to go out and make 
                        something the world’s never seen 
                        before I’ll support you, but if you 
                        come back with something I don’t 
                        love it will never see the light of 
                        day. Don’t disappoint me.         

           INT. JOHN’S CAR - MORNING 

           John drives Morgan to school. 

                                 JOHN
                        It’ll only be two weeks... 

                                 MORGAN
                        You’re going to miss me pitching in 
                        the finals. 

                                 JOHN
                        I can’t wait to hear about it. 
                        You’re going to do great.

                                 MORGAN
                        There will be more episodes after 
                        this. You’ll be gone for those too.    

                                 JOHN
                        Even if that happens I won’t be 
                        gone for long. I promise. Now are 
                        you going to hug me or what?

           Morgan hugs his dad and exits. John watches Morgan walk away.

           MONTAGE OF BROWARD COUNTY

           Deep dark blue fills the screen. We’re flying right above the 
           Atlantic Ocean as we crane up to the sandy coast and further 
           up to the skyline view of Fort Lauderdale. We move across a 
           waterway to see the harbor mansions of Fort Lauderdale with 
           yachts floating off the dock. 

           Driving on the road we pass the big buildings of Fort 
           Lauderdale, palm tree lined streets, marsh land and then to 
           the ghetto parts of Broward.  
           Parked at the end of the road of run down houses is the 
           Broward County Sheriff’s SUV. Nick Navarro eyes some black 
           kids playing basketball. He gets a call in and he drives off. 

           Nick enters the police station to see John and Malcolm 
           talking with Ron Cacciatore, Bob Deak and Vicki Cutcliffe. 

           INT. BROWARD COUNTY POLICE STATION - DAY

           John and Malcolm walk with Nick Navarro around the station. 

                                 NICK
                        All of this is yours. Full 
                        transparency. I’m trusting you boys 
                        to do my department right. The 
                        papers are only interested in 
                        stories of malfeasance. This should 
                        be good advertising for us.

                                 JOHN
                        It will be. We want our audience 
                        sympathizing with our characters. 

                                 NICK
                        Characters, that’s good.

                                 JOHN
                        I’d love to have Scott and Henry in 
                        this. They were all stars on the 
                        American Vice raid.  

                                 NICK
                        Can’t. Scott is on suspension and 
                        Henry’s no longer with the force. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        How about officers of color? We 
                        want the cast reflecting America’s 
                        diversity.     

                                 JOHN
                        What are you running for office?

                                 NICK
                        You have me - I’m Cuban. I’ll have 
                        some blacks go with you on bust, 
                        but if you want Eddie Murphy go 
                        back to Beverly Hills. 

                                 JOHN
                        You’re sure there will be drug 
                        busts? 
                                 NICK
                        Oh yes. That I can guarantee. 

                                 JOHN
                        What are we looking at on a day to 
                        day basis?

                                 NICK
                        You’re in Broward County, anything 
                        can happen. Now if you’ll excuse 
                        me, I have a campaign event.

                                 JOHN
                        Just one more thing. You wouldn’t 
                        happen to have an attractive female 
                        cop would you? We need some eye 
                        candy for the men watching.   

           Nick points to LINDA CANADA (25), a stunning blond with 
           Farrah Fawcett hair. 

                                 NICK
                        Good to have you boys back. I 
                        promise I’ll be make up ready for 
                        my close up.  

           INT. BROWARD COUNTY POLICE STATION - DAY

           John are Malcolm sitting by Linda’s desk.    

                                 LINDA
                        Me? Are you sure you want me?  
                             (John and Malcolm nod)
                        Really? 
                             (They nod again)
                        Oh wow. This is such an honor. I 
                        was such a fan of the last one. 

                                 VOICE
                        That was my work. 

           It’s Jerry Wurms, the PA from the opening! He has less hair.  

                                 MALCOLM
                        You’re a cop? 

                                 JERRY
                        Yessiree! American Vice inspired me 
                        to put the bad boys away. Pow! Pow! 
                        Haven’t fired my gun yet, but it 
                        should be soon, hopefully.  
                                 LINDA
                        It’ll happen, honey. 

                                 JOHN
                        You two are... 

                                 JERRY
                        Dating, she’s mine boys. 

           John and Malcolm look at each other. They hit the jackpot. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Jerry, how do you feel about being 
                        in front of the camera? 

           CUT TO BLACK then FADE UP on a TIMELAPSE of the warm sun 
           rising over the Broward County beaches. 

           EXT. HOTEL PARKING LOT - DAWN

           The COPS crew loads the film equipment in a van. 

                                 KIGER
                        Hey John, when will we get our 
                        vests?

                                 JOHN
                        No vests Kiger.  

                                 KIGER
                        What do you mean? 

                                 JOHN
                        We weren’t able to swing it in the 
                        budget. You scared or do you want 
                        to make some art? 

           Malcolm, listening to a walkie talkie, calls out to the crew. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        We have a call in! 

                                 JOHN
                        Everyone move out! Let’s go! 

           EXT. MARSHY AREA - MORNING 

           A van parks off the side of the road. The COPS crew jumps 
           out. John is greeted by Sergeant RICHARD SCHEFF (30s).   
                                 RICHARD
                        Sergeant Richard Scheff. Homicide. 
                        You’re right on time. Forensics 
                        just showed up.

           They come to a small bridge overlooking the water. A motor 
           boat with a FORENSICS TEAM steers to a DEAD BODY floating.   

                                 JOHN
                        Beautiful... Bertram! 

                                 BERTRAM
                        Right here boss. 

                                 JOHN
                        I need you to get a wide. Make sure 
                        you get everything: Richard, the 
                        boat, the body...
                             (to Richard)
                        You don’t mind being on camera? 

                                 RICHARD
                        I can be on camera. 

                                 JOHN
                        Perfect. Malcolm will get a release 
                        for you. Could you direct them down 
                        there a little? Just so you’re not 
                        looking static? 

                                 RICHARD
                        I can do that.  

                                 JOHN
                        You smoke? 

                                 RICHARD
                        Just quit last month.  

                                 JOHN
                        A cigarette would give you a good 
                        look on camera, but don’t worry 
                        about it. 

           John moves to Bertram. Richard turns to cop who’s smoking.   

                                 RICHARD
                        Give me one of those. 

           CUT TO John and Malcolm standing behind Bertram and Kiger 
           filming. A forensic specialist throws a milk gallon connected 
           to a rope near the body. 
                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go cowboy. We gotta lasso 
                        that body before the gators come. 

                                 FORENSIC SPECIALIST
                        We got it. 

           CUT TO Richard talks into Bertram’s camera near the water. 
           The forensic team is pulling the body out. 

                                 RICHARD 
                        When we get a body in the canal, 
                        any environment where there’s 
                        marine life, you find the lips, the 
                        eyelids, or ears eaten away.

                                 FORENSIC SPECIALIST
                        They won’t touch it until it’s 
                        rotten. 

                                 RICHARD
                        I guess they know what good is. 

           A FLASH goes off... it’s the forensic photographer. 

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        Damn it, Joey, not while I’m on 
                        camera. Let’s do another one. 

           CUT TO Bertram films Richard talking with the specialist. 

                                 FORENSIC SPECIALIST
                        No bullet wounds. Doesn’t look like 
                        there’s any trauma. Doesn’t look 
                        like suicide to me. 

                                 RICHARD 
                        Overdose? 

                                 FORENSIC SPECIALIST
                        Won’t know until the autopsy. 

           EXT. BROWARD COUNTY POLICE STATION PARKING LOT - DAY

           Linda holds a pocket mirror as she touches up her make up. 
           She got her hair and nails done before. Jerry’s with her.

                                 JERRY
                        It’ll look weird if you’re all 
                        dolled up. 

                                 LINDA 
                        Shut the fuck up.
           The production van pulls up. The crew comes out. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        So sorry we’re late. We got carried 
                        away with a dead body.  

                                 LINDA 
                        I played hard to get with Jerry, 
                        but for you boys, I’d wait all day.  

           INT. LINDA’S POLICE CAR - DAY 

           Linda pulls up in front of an OVERWEIGHT WOMEN (50s) talking 
           to a guy in a truck. The truck speeds off revealing the 
           woman’s whole front. John, Kiger and Bertram are in the car. 

                                 LINDA 
                        Here we go! 

                                 KIGER 
                        This is a highway. 

                                 JOHN
                        I’ll be right behind you. 

           EXT. HIGHWAY 95 - DAY

           Everyone gets out. Cars zoom by. The camera is rolling. 

                                 LINDA
                        You just going to see your friends 
                        with your high heels in the middle 
                        of 95?

                                 OVERWEIGHT WOMAN
                        I don’t have my driver’s license. 

                                 LINDA
                        Why don’t you put some clothes on? 

                                 OVERWEIGHT WOMAN
                        I don’t have ID. 

                                 LINDA
                        Let me see what you have baby. 

           Linda snatches her bag and goes through her items. John has 
           hands on both Kiger’s and Bertram’s backs.  
           INT. PRODUCTION VAN - CONTINUOUS

           Malcolm pulls off the highway with the filming team in sight.  

                                 MALCOLM
                        They’re going to get run over.

           EXT. HIGHWAY 95 - CONTINUOUS

           Linda takes John aside. Kiger is inches away from traffic.

                                 LINDA
                        So I can arrest her for disorderly 
                        conduct but I’d have to call it in 
                        cause we don’t have enough room in 
                        the car, so, I’m thinking I could 
                        just yell at her a bit and let her 
                        go to save time. Is that okay?

                                 JOHN
                        I love that. 

                                 LINDA
                        Awesome! Thank you.  
                             (getting into character)
                        Hey. Hey! If I ever see you 
                        stopping traffic again you’re going 
                        to jail. Button up your shirt! 

           INT. PRODUCTION VAN - CONTINUOUS

           Malcolm can hear John talking into a walkie talkie. 

                                 JOHN (O.S.)
                        We’re moving on. You can get her 
                        release now. Over. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        It’s in the middle of the highway! 

                                 JOHN (O.S.)
                        Get the release! We need her. 

                                 MALCOLM
                             (to the production crew)
                        God damn it. Get me a release. 

           Malcolm runs across the highway dodging speeding cars. Linda 
           and the crew move off to the next one.   
                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me Miss! Would you mind 
                        signing—

                                 OVERWEIGHT WOMAN
                        Get the fuck away from me! Don’t 
                        touch me! I’m no whore. That bitch 
                        don’t know my life! 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Hey! Hey. I’m not going to hurt 
                        you. My name is Malcolm. Malcolm 
                        Barbour. Here’s my card. 

                                 OVERWEIGHT WOMAN
                        You’re not a fuckin’ cop are you?  

                                 MALCOLM
                        No, mum, I’m a producer. I’m with a 
                        production crew, we’re filming a 
                        show and would love it if we had 
                        your permission—  

                                 OVERWEIGHT WOMAN
                        I ain’t doin’ no porno! I’ve got a 
                        son. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Oh no, no. This is a show that will 
                        be broadcast on television.  

                                 OVERWEIGHT WOMAN
                        You mean like real TV? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Real TV! We want you to star in it.  

                                 OVERWEIGHT WOMAN
                        How you pick me out? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Well, you’re in the middle of a 
                        highway. We couldn’t miss you!

                                 OVERWEIGHT WOMAN
                        How much you pay?

                                 MALCOLM
                        It’s pro bono, but trust me this 
                        will lead to more work. I’ve been 
                        in the business over thirty years, 
                        you’re going to be highly sought 
                        after this. You have something 
                        special about you.   
                                 OVERWEIGHT WOMAN
                             (signing the release)
                        So what kind of character do I 
                        play? I can play a mean bitch or a 
                        nice girl, whatever you want baby.  

                                 MALCOLM
                        We filmed you already...

                                 OVERWEIGHT WOMAN
                        Nuh uh. You still have to film me.    

           Malcolm’s confused: She didn’t see the camera?

           CUT TO: The crew films Linda talking to WOMAN WITH FOUR 
           TEETH.  

                                 LINDA
                        Let me tell you something, don’t 
                        hitch hike here no more. 

                                 WOMAN WITH FOUR TEETH
                        Well, I was thumbing to get a ride.  

                                 LINDA
                        Don’t. Go thumb somewhere else. 

                                 WOMAN WITH FOUR TEETH
                        I’m no whore cause I hate the 
                        bitches cause my brother’s wife and 
                        all them are doing that. I need a 
                        ride cause I gotta go get my 
                        clothes.   

                                 LINDA
                        Get off my streets!

           CUT TO: Moments later, Malcolm is talking to the same woman.  

                                 WOMAN WITH FOUR TEETH
                        I can’t read this.  

                                 MALCOLM
                        All you need to do is sign. Do you 
                        know how to sign?  

           CUT TO: Linda is talking to a TRAILER TRASH WOMAN.   

                                 LINDA
                        I need some ID baby. I can tell 
                        you’ve done this before. 

           CUT TO: Malcolm talking to the TRAILER TRASH WOMAN
                                 MALCOLM
                        You have such a positive charisma. 
                        People will see a woman, a real 
                        salt of the earth woman. 

           CUT TO MONTAGE (short) of Linda yelling at more prostitutes 
           off the highway then, CUT TO Malcolm getting their releases. 

           INT. LINDA’S POLICE CAR - NIGHT 

           Linda drives as the neon lights of the strip malls illuminate 
           her face. Pink. Blue. Red. Purple. John directs her from the 
           back. She changes her facial expressions as the ride goes on.  

           INT. PRODUCTION VAN - NIGHT

           The neon lights illuminate Malcolm’s exhausted face as he 
           sifts through the signed releases. 

           EXT. HOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT 

           The crew unloads the van as Malcolm and John talk nearby. 

                                 JOHN
                        We got everyone? 
                             (Malcolm nods)
                        That’s my Malky! 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Some had no idea they were just 
                        filmed. 

                                 JOHN
                        Huh, I guess when you’re in that 
                        situation all your focused on is 
                        the cop in front of you. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        I’m kind of worried we’re 
                        exploiting them. 

                                 JOHN
                        They’re prostitutes, they exploit 
                        themselves. We’re not making them 
                        do anything they wouldn’t normally 
                        do. It’s fine.   

                                 MALCOLM
                        You think they’ll come across okay?
                                 JOHN
                        How someone comes across on camera 
                        is an individual’s opinion. They 
                        were giving us their truth. That’s 
                        all we can ask for. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Before, with Rivera, I just did the 
                        job, no questions asked, but now, 
                        now that it’s just us I worry more.    

                                 JOHN
                        We’re making a show that’s going to 
                        air on television Malcolm. Our 
                        names will be front and center as 
                        creators! Just think about that.    

           INT. CORONERS OFFICE - MORNING 

           The body from the day before lays on a gurney. He’s rail thin 
           and his face is full of sores. The CORONER (60s) talks to 
           Richard Scheff as the crew films. Sheriff Navarro watches. 

                                 CORONER
                        Fresh puncture marks in both 
                        antecubital fossa. Hyperplasia of 
                        porta hepatic lymph nodes. Cocaine 
                        identified in the body fluids. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Overdose. 

                                 CORONER
                        Well it would be if the lungs 
                        didn’t show an abundant amount of 
                        water in them. He probably shot up 
                        near the marsh, overdosed then fell 
                        in the water.  

                                 JOHN
                        Can we get a shot of the big bag of 
                        coke he had on him? 

                                 CORONER
                        The coke’s been destroyed already.

                                 MALCOLM
                        Doesn’t a judge have to issue an 
                        order for that?

                                 CORONER 
                        Not in a case like this.  
                                 MALCOLM
                        What makes this case different? 
                             (beat)
                        Forgive me I’m just trying to 
                        understand but what happens to the 
                        coke after you test it? 

                                 RICHARD
                        That chemist would have had it for 
                        processing right?

           The Coroner glares at Richard. Are you kidding me? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Wait, what chemist? 

                                 CORONER
                        We should get back to the autopsy.

                                 MALCOLM
                        What is this chemist processing 
                        with that cocaine?  

           The Coroner looks to Navarro. The silence very awkward.  

                                 NAVARRO
                        John, Malcolm, you have a minute? 

                                 JOHN
                             (to the crew)
                        Go get B-roll of the station. 

           Navarro waves off Richard and the Coroner. The crew leaves. 
           It’s just Navarro, John, Malcolm and the body now.

                                 NICK
                        Gentlemen, I may have made a 
                        mistake letting this boy be filmed. 
                        It’s still an open investigation.   

                                 MALCOLM
                        But it was an overdose... 

                                 NICK
                        I heard you got some great footage 
                        with Linda yesterday. I can set up 
                        a time for you to film with her 
                        again to replace this.   

                                 JOHN
                        We have more than a days worth of 
                        shooting with this body. You’re 
                        saying we can’t use any of it? 
                                 NICK
                        I’ll allow his body in the water, 
                        but not the autopsy. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Why do you have a chemist 
                        “processing” cocaine? I’ve never 
                        heard of this in my life.   

                                 NICK
                        Careful Malcolm. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        You’re not making rocks are you?  

           Nick’s eyes flare. Bingo.  

                                 MALCOLM (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing? What is going 
                        on here?

                                 NICK
                        Nothing scares a junkie. We’ve 
                        tried everything: increasing 
                        sentences, enforcement, but they’ll 
                        steal, rape and murder just to 
                        shoot up so we need to catch them 
                        before they cause havoc and we can 
                        catch them buying. There's nothing 
                        illegal about that. It is already 
                        cocaine, we just convert it into 
                        crack. You ask the father or mother 
                        of any kid who's on crack if they 
                        have any reservations and see what 
                        they tell you. They have none. This 
                        is an undercover operation, if any 
                        of this in here is released or 
                        looked into, you’ll have bigger 
                        problems than this series. 

           INT. BROWARD COUNTY POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Malcolm looking sick, falls to a chair. John comes out. They 
           whisper as cops walk by them. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        We can’t let him get away with 
                        this. 

                                 JOHN
                        I don’t like it either, but you 
                        heard him. He threatened us. 
                                 MALCOLM 
                        This is bigger than us. We have to 
                        follow this. 

                                 JOHN
                        I think we need to take a breath 
                        here. Navarro did agree to let us 
                        use the body in the water. That’s 
                        great stuff—

                                 MALCOLM
                        This is about more than bloody 
                        entertainment! This is an actual 
                        story.

                                 JOHN
                        We’re not here to be the Woodward 
                        and Bernstein of the drug war. 
                        We’re here to make a goddamn TV 
                        show.   

                                 MALCOLM
                        The sheriff of the second largest 
                        county in Florida is facilitating 
                        the production of crack cocaine so 
                        he can lure in addicts. That’s a 
                        fucking TV show if you ask me. And 
                        you know they’re making crack to 
                        target blacks.  

                                 JOHN
                        If we uncover this, then no other 
                        police department will let us film 
                        with them. It will kill the show 
                        before we’ve even released it.    

                                 MALCOLM
                        If we ignore this, we’re aiding and 
                        abetting. 
                             (walks off)

                                 RON
                             (approaching)
                        John. We’ve got something for you.

           INT. VAN - DUSK 

           In the back of the van Bertram films officers. 

                                 BOB
                        Slow it down Carmine. Slow it down! 
                        All right this is the place. We’re 
                        here. Slow it down! Go! 
           The back door swings open and all the officers pile out of 
           the van with their guns drawn. Bertram and Kiger follow them.  

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Cops run to the front door of a small house. Their flash 
           lights wave all over. An officer with a sledge hammer slams 
           the knob and another officer kicks the door open. 

           INT. SMALL HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Bertram and Kiger are close behind Bob as he runs through the 
           kitchen and living room. Officers scream “Clear!” Bertram 
           films a guy sprawled out on the floor, putting his hands out. 

           Bertram swerves to see a massive black man coming at him. He 
           swipes the camera. Kiger grabs Bertram back. An AGGRESSIVE 
           COP swings his arm around the man’s neck in a choke hold just 
           like Eric Garner. “Get Down!”

           Ron swings a door open... WHAM! Bertram’s leg bends the wrong 
           way. Hurts like hell. Ron jumps the man. The man gasps for 
           air; he’s swung down. His face is kneed as they cuff him.    

           John, from another viewpoint, whispers into a walkie talkie 
           “Push in.” He looks away as the cops over power him. 

           CUT TO Bob is standing two feet away from another LARGE MAN 
           (20s) with his hands cuffed in a bedroom. Bertram is filming.   

                                 BOB
                        Let me make sure I understand this. 
                        We got two guns out of your room. 
                        One shotgun. Sawed off shotgun. 
                        Find a bottle of cocaine rocks. 
                        You’ve been arrested for cocaine 
                        and you’re going to tell me you 
                        don’t know nothing about this?   

                                 LARGE MAN
                        Sir, that was in the past. 

                                 BOB
                        No, no we found rocks a few minutes 
                        ago. We found guns a few minutes 
                        ago. You were here. Maybe it’s your 
                        mother’s, is that a possibility? 
                        Cause you know what we’re going to 
                        do? We’re going to arrest everybody 
                        in this house. 
                                 LARGE MAN
                        If you’re going to put it on me, 
                        put it on me. 

                                 BOB
                        Well, was it yours?

                                 LARGE MAN
                        No, it’s not mine. 

                                 BOB
                        Then why do you want to me to put 
                        it on you? This is a rock house. 
                        When you deal cocaine you should 
                        have thought about that your 
                        parents live here. There’s cocaine 
                        everywhere. Gun’s everywhere. 
                        People out in your yard running 
                        throwing rocks in every direction. 
                        You know nothing about that do you? 
                        Maybe you was watching the Dick Van 
                        Dyke show. Why you so nervous? 

                                 LARGE MAN
                        I’m not nervous. 

                                 BOB
                        You’re sweating a little bit.

                                 LARGE MAN
                        It’s hot. 

                                 BOB
                        Yeah, I’m hot, too. Nothing you 
                        want to do for me?

                                 LARGE MAN
                        Ain’t nothing I can do, sir. 

                                 BOB
                        You’re going down big time. You 
                        remember when that judge puts you 
                        in prison, that I tried to give you 
                        this opportunity. You remember that 
                        for me, okay? 

                                 LARGE MAN
                        Can you have them loosen these? 

                                 BOB
                        I’ll talk to them about that. 
                        You change your mind, you let me 
                        know before they put you in that 
                        wagon. 
           Bob moves into the hallway where John is. 

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        Good? 

                                 JOHN
                        What do you think about doing the 
                        scene with him not wearing cuffs? 

                                 BOB
                        Why? 

                                 JOHN
                        Well the image of a white police 
                        officer berating a chained up black 
                        man sort of invokes an image.

                                 BOB
                        What kind of image?

                                 JOHN
                        You know what, never mind. It’s 
                        good how it is. 

                                 BOB
                        Take him out boys!   

           The large man is escorted out. Kiger supports Bertram as they 
           leave. A PRODUCER, hands John blank releases.

                                 PRODUCER 
                        I wasn’t able to get anybody. I 
                        guess Malcolm has that special 
                        touch.

                                 JOHN
                        I’ll get them.  

           EXT. FRONT LAWN - NIGHT 

           John comes out, it’s a scene: Black men are taken away. Blue 
           and red lights illuminate the street. A mob of people watch. 

                                 MOTHER OF LARGE MAN 
                        My baby! My baby! 

           John, moved, chucks the releases in the trash. He sees on the 
           opposite yard a yard sign: Reelect Nick Navarro for Sheriff. 
           Keeping Broward safe!   
           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 

           John is on the phone with Maggie. 

                                 JOHN
                        Malcolm may walk. I don’t know 
                        where he is.

                                 MAGGIE 
                        Give him time. He’ll be back. He 
                        has a family to support.  

                                 JOHN
                        He’s right about Navarro. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        They’re addicts. It may be tough, 
                        but Navarro is doing what’s best 
                        for his community.  

                                 JOHN
                        You should have seen the way they 
                        strangled this guy tonight. He 
                        wasn’t doing anything—  

                                 MAGGIE
                        And you got that one on camera for 
                        people to see. 

                                 JOHN
                        But I don’t know if this is the way 
                        to talk about the issues. Some 
                        people may get the wrong idea about 
                        these cops.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Two people can watch the same thing 
                        and come away with completely 
                        different opinions. You can’t 
                        control how people will respond. 
                        All you can do is worry about 
                        making it the best pilot possible 
                        so you get a season order. 

                                 JOHN
                        Right. You’re right.  

                                 MAGGIE
                        You’re just over thinking these 
                        things with that brain of yours.  
           INT. LA RESTAURANT - DAY 

           CUT to 2013: John is sitting across from Maggie, now in her 
           70s. She’s barely recognizable from all the plastic surgery.   

                                 MAGGIE 
                        Have they reached out to you? 

                                 JOHN
                        No. 

                                 MAGGIE 
                        Can you reach out to them? 

                                 JOHN
                        No, honey, Bryce just passed. Why 
                        are we talking about this? 

                                 MAGGIE
                        The petition affects us both. It 
                        has to be dealt with. You should 
                        make peace with them. 

                                 JOHN
                        There is no peace Maggie. They 
                        think I wear the hood and go out at 
                        night burning crosses.

                                 MAGGIE
                        What they’re saying about the show, 
                        some of it’s true.  

                                 JOHN
                        I didn’t know this was going to be 
                        an ambush. I thought we were going 
                        to talk about us. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Anything written about COPS is as 
                        much a reflection on me as it is 
                        for you. Whatever happens with us I 
                        will always be known as your wife. 
                        I don’t have much to leave behind 
                        other than that. I’ve made my 
                        choices and I have to live with 
                        them. So do you. We always knew 
                        there were issues. Perhaps now 
                        there needs to be some adjustments 
                        made. Maybe that group has ideas. 
                        Maybe if you heard them out they 
                        would calm down. There shouldn’t be 
                        anymore negative things written. 
                        I’ve had it!
                                 JOHN
                        Honey—

                                 MAGGIE
                        Is this how you want us to be 
                        remembered? Do something. 

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        Mr. Robinson, it’s a pleasure. 

           INT. JOHN’S OFFICE - DAY

           John shakes hands with Rashad Robinson (35), well dressed 
           with warm eyes. The office has been cleaned for the occasion. 

                                 RASHAD 
                        Thank you for having me.

                                 JOHN
                        Any coffee or tea? 

                                 RASHAD
                        I’m good thank you.

                                 JOHN
                        I promise I haven’t poisoned it.

           Rashad smiles. He points to a framed insignia on the wall.

                                 RASHAD
                        Is that Army Intelligence and 
                        Security Command? 

                                 JOHN
                        Sure is, served from 61 to 63. 

                                 RASHAD
                        You were in Vietnam. 

                                 JOHN
                        I was. 

                                 RASHAD
                        My father was too. Served in the 
                        Marines and came back to North 
                        Carolina where he couldn’t find a 
                        bathroom open to "colored folk." I 
                        must say I was surprised when your 
                        office called to set this up.    

                                 JOHN
                        Well, it’s been some time. We ought 
                        to discuss these things.  
                                 RASHAD
                        What do you want to talk about?

                                 JOHN
                        I have great respect for the work 
                        Color of Change does. Back when I 
                        was a kid I marched for civil 
                        rights. I want to support you in 
                        anyway I can.           

                                 RASHAD
                        How would you do that?

                                 JOHN
                        With more resources you would be 
                        better equipped to fight against 
                        racial injustice. If you were to 
                        let go of that petition Langley 
                        Production would be willing to give 
                        you a sizeable contribution. 

                                 RASHAD
                        How far are you willing to go? 

                                 JOHN
                        I’ve been syndicated for over two 
                        decades. I think we’ll be able to 
                        find common ground. 

           John hands him a check. 

                                 RASHAD
                        This is a lot of money Mr. Langley. 

                                 JOHN 
                        It’s yours if you want it. 

                                 RASHAD
                        We’re going to need more than this. 

           John writes another check. Rashad shakes his head. 

                                 JOHN
                        What are you asking for?  

                                 RASHAD
                        All of it. 

                                 JOHN
                        I’m sorry? 
                                 RASHAD
                        All of it Mr. Langley. We’re not 
                        going to stop until your show is 
                        off the air. 

                                 JOHN
                        I’m not a betting man, but if I was 
                        I’d put my money down on the FOX 
                        Corporation over you guys.

                                 RASHAD
                        I didn’t get the sense they see 
                        your series valuable enough to 
                        attack a civil rights organization 
                        when I spoke with them. 

                                 JOHN
                        You spoke with them? 

                                 RASHAD
                        I did. 

                                 JOHN
                        Don’t you think you’re wasting time 
                        on my show when there’s ‘stand-your-
                        ground’ and ‘stop-and-frisk’?  

                                 RASHAD
                        We’re advocating for their repeal, 
                        but oppressive ideas are more 
                        harmful than oppressive laws. Ideas 
                        spread and COPS has spread 
                        poisonous images of African 
                        Americans for the past 25 years. 
                        Who’s to say George Zimmerman 
                        didn’t watch COPS. 

                                 JOHN
                        COPS didn’t kill Trayvon Martin.

                                 RASHAD
                        COPS didn’t pull the trigger, but 
                        it loaded the gun. If I were to ask 
                        someone who’s just watched your 
                        show to close their eyes and think 
                        of a black male, how do you think 
                        they would describe him?

                                 JOHN
                        I can’t help that they don’t all 
                        look like you in those ghetto’s. 
                                 RASHAD
                        A shirtless, neck tattooed, pants 
                        around the ass thug. They’re all 
                        painted the same way. They’re the 
                        ‘bad boys’. 

                                 JOHN
                        Blacks are arrested more. I expose 
                        that inequity for what it is. 

                                 RASHAD
                        Mr. Langley, if you really wanted 
                        to challenge the macro levels of 
                        crime do a show on Wall Street or 
                        Capitol Hill where the type of 
                        crime really does have an impact. 
                        Instead you chose to go into 
                        communities that are poor and black 
                        and show low level criminals 
                        because it’s easy and because you 
                        can profit from showing it.    

                                 JOHN
                        I didn’t do this for the money! I 
                        did it to make an impact. I’ve made 
                        them aware of these injustices!      

                                 RASHAD
                        You’ve entertained them, you 
                        haven’t informed them. 

                                 JOHN
                        I’M NOT A FUCKING RACIST! 

                                 RASHAD
                        No, you just don’t care. 

                                 JOHN
                        You have no idea who I am. 

                                 RASHAD
                        How many black people do you have 
                        working out there?! 

           That shuts John up. He doesn’t have any. 

                                 RASHAD (CONT’D)
                        If you had one in a position of 
                        power we probably wouldn’t be 
                        talking. I am going after your 
                        sponsors now. These brands trying 
                        to sell products to black folks are 
                        going to know they can’t have it 
                        both ways. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RASHAD (CONT’D)
                        I came here to tell you that. I 
                        will do everything I can to get 
                        your show scrubbed off television. 
                        This is a slow sinking ship. It’s 
                        only a matter of time until they 
                        abandon ship.  

           Rashad exits. John’s just been hit by a freight train. 

           EXT. GRIMY STREET - DAY

           Back in the 80’s: Sirens are blaring. Jerry Wurms pulls over 
           a convertible. Another day of filming for the COPS crew. 
           Bertram exits Jerry’s car filming, he has a band on his knee. 

           Two black guys without shirts on sit in the convertible. 
           One’s wearing yellow shorts, the other is wearing jeans.  

                                 JERRY
                        This your car? 

                                 YELLOW SHORTS
                        Yeah.

                        You got some papers for it?

           Yellow shorts pulls out his papers and hands them to Jerry.

                        What are you holding brother?

                        I smell marijuana, okay? I’m going 
                        to need to check the vehicle. Can 
                        you stand over here? That means get 
                        out of the car.

                        It’s a game out here. Cat and mouse 
                        game that’s all it is. Some days

                                 JERRY
                        What you can do sometimes is sit 
                        here and watch the white boys take 
                        a right turn to buy their dope.

                        I’m down the street. I see you 
                        making a drug deal in front of that 
                        house. You tell me I didn’t see 
                        what I saw? 

                                 WHITE ADULT MALE
                        I was just driving by, sir. 

                                 JERRY
                        So you’re telling me I ain’t goin’ 
                        to find any grass in your car?
                        What are you doing looking around? 
                        I’ll shoot you if you run.

                        I’m lost. 

                                 JERRY
                        No you’re not. 

                                 ANOTHER WHITE GUY
                        I’m from California. 

                                 JERRY
                        No, you’re not. Hey, John, you know 
                        this guy? Oh shit, I’m not suppose 
                        to look in the camera ha-ha. PUT 
                        YOUR HANDS WHERE I CAN SEE THEM!

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        You want to know what happens over 
                        here to white boys like you?

                        You get yanked out of the car, 
                        because they think you look easy, 
                        put a gun to your head, pistol whip 
                        you and take your car. Is that 
                        worth ten dollars of grass? 

           CUT TO Jerry hunched over talking to TWO WHITE GUYS in a car.

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        You came to buy drugs? 

                                 WHITE GUY 
                        Yeah. 

                                 JERRY 
                        I appreciate your honesty. Listen, 
                        I’m just going to give you a slap 
                        on the wrist. I never want to see 
                        you boys around here again.  

           CUT TO Jerry approaches a car with a BLACK MALE in it.

                        No, no I don’t need you. I’m just 
                        trying to get these white boys to 
                        stop from coming in here.  

           INT. PRODUCTION VAN - DAY 

           John, Malcolm and Stephen Chao watch Jerry from the monitor.

                                 STEPHEN 
                        He’s perfect. Geller will love him. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        How much longer are we filming with 
                        him? 

                                 JOHN
                        We need to get a lot of him. He’s 
                        going to be a prominent character. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        I don’t know if a guy like that 
                        should be represented on our show. 

                                 STEPHEN
                        What do you mean? He’s too much of 
                        a character to give up. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Think about it, we come into each 
                        scene from the cop’s point of view.

                                 MALCOLM (CONT'D)
                        They are our eyes in. We’re 
                        inclined to sympathize with them 
                        and because of that we’re not as 
                        discerning to their behavior. 

                                 JOHN
                        People have the capacity to make 
                        judgement calls. They’re constantly 
                        assessing every action these cops 
                        do and Jerry’s... Jerryness—

                          MALCOLM
                                                      JOHN (CONT'D)
           Racism.
                                              is obvious!  

                                 MALCOLM
                        People like simplicity. When 
                        someone comes home after a long day 
                        at work they don’t want to think, 
                        they want to be entertained. People 
                        are constantly looking to identify 
                        with someone on screen because they 
                        so desperately want to see 
                        themselves. People watch TV to 
                        watch themselves and when people 
                        watch this it has the potential to 
                        reinforce their worst instincts 
                        about race. 

                                 JOHN
                        The general public is not going to 
                        see Jerry and think boy, that’s me. 
                        They’ll judge him and, yes, they’ll 
                        be amused by him but he’s not 
                        likable enough to identify with.  

                                 MALCOLM
                        I don’t have a crystal ball, I 
                        don’t know how people will react to 
                        him, but when there’s someone with 
                        a gun, someone who has all the 
                        power and is using that upon people 
                        who seemingly deserve it people are 
                        going to be drawn to that.

                                 JOHN
                        That’s one cynical way of looking 
                        at things.

                                 MALCOLM
                        People analyze with their hearts 
                        not their heads. 

                                 JOHN
                        They use both.
                                 STEPHEN
                        Who the fuck cares. I want to watch 
                        more of him. He’s great TV!

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY 

           A white guy in BLUE PANTS (20s) has his hands on a car. Jerry 
           removes his wallet. Blue Pant’s GIRLFRIEND (20s) is close by. 

                                 JERRY
                        You see me - I’m the only white 
                        face in this area. You don’t belong 
                        here, okay? It has nothing to do 
                        with white or black. It has 
                        everything to do with crimes 
                        against persons. Lady, you need to 
                        step back.

           Blue Pants SHOVES Bertram into car and BOLTS off. Bertram’s 
           knee is slammed. Ouch! Jerry and other cops go after him.  

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        Shit. 2-10 1-31!

                                 GIRLFRIEND 
                        HENRY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING! NO!

           Bertram tries to jog, but can’t. Too painful. 

                                 BERTRAM
                        Ah, fuck me.  

           Coming in out of nowhere John grabs the camera. John and 
           Kiger start full on sprinting. The chase is on. 

                                 JERRY
                        Stop or I’ll shoot you in the back!
                             (in a walkie talkie)
                        I got a 99 on a white male with 
                        blue pants heading towards sunset. 
                        Sunset is a street!

           John and Kiger catch up to the cops. Suddenly a cop car 
           swerves in front of Blue Pants. WHAM! Blue Pants slams into 
           the car. An Overweight Cop gets out and draws his pistol.  

                                 OVERWEIGHT COP
                        Stop! Stay down!

           Jerry smashes a baton down on Blue Pants. He’s hit over and 
           over until Jerry’s grabbed by a fellow cop.  
                                 OVERWEIGHT COP (CONT’D)
                        Jerry that’s enough! 

           The girlfriend, driving full speed to the scene, hits the 
           brakes. John swings the camera to her.  

                                 GIRLFRIEND
                        DON’T HURT HIM!

           A cop grabs her. As she resists her shirt bunches up showing 
           her bra. This is a mess. 

                                 GIRLFRIEND (CONT’D)
                        LET GO OF ME! I DID NOTHING WRONG. 
                        I’M INNOCENT. YOU’LL BE SORRY. 

                                 BROWARD OFFICER
                        Shut up, lady!

           THWACK! She’s slammed on top of her car, cuffed and thrown in 
           a police car. The screaming continues. John moves to Jerry, 
           his foot is holding down Blue Pants.  

                                 OVERWEIGHT COP
                        You got a hit on a guy you cuff him 
                        and throw him in. You can’t leave 
                        him like that. Bad police work.

                                 BLUE PANTS
                        Officer can you get your foot—

                                 JERRY
                        Shut up! You got no reason to talk.

                        Cut! 

           Bertram rests the camera. There’s lighting equipment all 
           around shining on the Cacciatore’s. John enters.  

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        What do you think about going 
                        harder on Ron this take? 

                                 RON
                        She can go a lot harder.

                                 MRS. CACCIATORE
                        Won’t people think I’m just a 
                        nagging wife? 

                                 RON
                        Come on honey it’s for the TV. 

                                 JOHN
                        You’re doing great. Just a little 
                        harder this time.  

           Malcolm walks in next to the monitor. John comes next to him. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        We’re filming the Cacciatore’s? 
                                 JOHN
                        It was a command straight from 
                        Geller. I tried to fight it, but he 
                        wants domestic scenes. They’re 
                        nonnegotiable.   

                                 MALCOLM
                        This isn’t our show. 

                                 JOHN
                        People like these scenes. They’re 
                        relatable. We won’t have to film 
                        them once we’re established. Look, 
                        what we’re doing with this show is 
                        worth more then these nothing 
                        scenes.

                                 MALCOLM
                        Scenes? Like plural? Don’t tell me 
                        we’re filming with Jerry and Linda. 
                        John. Tell me that’s not happening.

           INT. SCREENING ROOM - DAY 

           CUT to 2013: An episode of COPS plays: A white obese officer 
           pats down a black teen (tank top and low denim shorts). The 
           teen bolts. The officer grabs and body slams him.  

           The COPS producing team watches. John looks away wincing.

                                 MORGAN
                        Great! We should open the episode 
                        with this. 

                                 JOHN
                        We’re not airing this.  
                             (storms out)

           INT. JOHN’S OFFICE - DAY 

           John pours himself a glass of scotch. Morgan enters.  

                                 JOHN
                        Don’t you knock?  

                                 MORGAN
                        People are noticing we’re mainly 
                        showing white crime now. They’re 
                        protesting about it on the 
                        internet.     
                             (Hands John papers)
                                 JOHN
                        “The real perpetrators of violence 
                        against our people are being 
                        airbrushed out of the picture 
                        because showing the truth might 
                        wake us up to the dangers posed by 
                        living in a multiracial society.” 
                        Boy, this is a real winner here.  

                                 MORGAN
                        Our ratings are sinking. We didn’t 
                        even get a bump after Bryce died.  

                                 JOHN
                        Stop talking like that! FOX moved 
                        us. Our ratings dropped because no 
                        one wants to watch a damn thing 
                        after four hours of baseball.   

                                 MORGAN
                        We have gripping segments being 
                        shelved. Is it just because they’re 
                        black?  

                                 JOHN
                        There needs to be more of a balance 
                        of white and black crime. 

                                 MORGAN
                        We shouldn’t be kept from showing 
                        the inequities in crime rates. 

                                 JOHN
                        You don’t believe that. 

                                 MORGAN
                        Look, FOX hasn’t made us an 
                        extension offer so I had to reach 
                        out to the other networks—  

                                 JOHN
                        You went behind me?

                                 MORGAN
                        Our show is going to die if we do 
                        nothing! I have Paramount 
                        interested. They want to talk with 
                        us. 

                                 JOHN
                        I’m not changing networks!  
                                 MORGAN
                        It’s like you want to sabotage our 
                        show! 

                                 JOHN
                        It’s not our show Morgan. 

                                 MORGAN
                        This is our fucking show! Ever 
                        since it started it was the only 
                        thing you cared about. You didn’t 
                        give a shit about me. The only way 
                        to get to you was through this so, 
                        I watched every episode, asked you 
                        about it and learned the ropes just 
                        so I could have a fucking father.      

           Morgan scoffs out of the office. 

           EXT. MOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT 

           CUT to the 80’s: Police cars with lights flaring block off 
           the lot. Crime scene tape everywhere. The same forensic 
           specialist from the river scene approaches John and the crew. 

                                 FORENSIC SPECIALIST
                        We’re ready. 

           They follow him up the stairs passing by officers escorting 
           seedy looking people out. Two cops stand guard around an open 
           door to a dark room. They walk in...

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           CRUNCH. Malcolm steps on some broken glass. The bedding has 
           been torn apart. On the wall there’s a bloody handprint. 
           Bertram starts filming the forensic team gathering evidence.

           Flashes come from the bathroom. John and Malcolm creep in: a 
           naked woman’s body lays in a puddle of her own blood. A 
           photographer snaps some shots. 

                                 JOHN
                        Well... that’s one release you 
                        don’t have to get. 

                                 FORENSIC SPECIALIST
                        Throat slit. Stabbed 24 times. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        This will never make the air.
                                 JOHN
                        Our show is graphic. Geller will 
                        inevitably want to cut some 
                        provocative stuff so let’s give him 
                        this, something obvious so 
                        everything else can be saved. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        This was a person, John. 

                                 JOHN
                        I know what I’m doing here. This is 
                        how the sausage gets made. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        We don’t have to exploit a dead 
                        girl to make the show we want. 

                                 JOHN
                        I don’t remember you bitching at 
                        Rivera this much. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        We weren’t creating that show.

                                 JOHN
                        If it wasn’t for me you’d still be 
                        making that trash.

                                 MALCOLM
                        You’d still be a Delta bagman if I 
                        didn’t make you my partner. 
                        Bertram, turn off the camera.    

                                 JOHN
                        Keep filming! If you hate this so 
                        much maybe you should leave.  

           Malcolm moves so Bertram can film the body. 

           INT. FORT LAUDERDALE– HOLLYWOOD INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY 

           The crew films Officer Vicki Cutcliffe digging through a 
           MUSCULAR GUY’S suitcase. Malcolm is close by with a release. 
           She spots a bag of coke. As his arms are swung down he pushes 
           her off him. Within seconds a mob of cops pummel the man. 

           John and Stephen watch this from a foot court close by.

                                 STEPHEN
                        We should overnight these dailies.  
                                 JOHN
                        Where is Geller at with the series?

                                 STEPHEN
                        He won’t discuss that with me. I 
                        brought this to him so he knows I’m 
                        biased. 

                                 JOHN
                        What if I talked with him?

                                 STEPHEN
                        I’ve learned his silence is high 
                        praise or the calm before the 
                        storm. 

                                 JOHN
                        That’s comforting. 

                                 STEPHEN
                        I’m going to fight like hell for 
                        this. We have the elements of 
                        something really special, but 
                        there’s something missing. 

                                 JOHN
                        What’s missing?

                                 STEPHEN
                        We need something on a large scale. 
                        A climax. Something to really wow 
                        them in the end.  

           INT. BROWARD COUNTY POLICE STATION OFFICE AREA - CONTINUOUS

           The area is mostly empty except for a few officers somberly 
           huddled around. Not a word is spoken. John moves to look into 
           the Sheriff’s office. Nick looks up revealing his teary eyes.  

           INT. SHERIFF’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           The office is shabby, only decorated with a Cuban flag and a 
           photo of Ronald Reagan. John is sitting across from Navarro.     

                                 NAVARRO
                        Shot him twice through the neck 
                        just for a little bit of crack. His 
                        wife couldn’t say a word. They just 
                        had a child. You have kids?

                                 JOHN
                        A son. 
                                 NAVARRO
                        I have two boys and a girl I hardly 
                        see. Missed her recital tonight. 
                        Missed my son’s game last week. 
                        Fuck I wonder if I’m doing the 
                        right thing running again.   

                                 JOHN
                        The last thing Broward needs is 
                        someone to undo all you’ve done. 

                                 NAVARRO
                        But what’s the point? The press 
                        only writes about my men getting 
                        shot or the drugs on the streets.  

                                 JOHN
                        That’s why I’m here. If people on 
                        the outside see the full power of 
                        your department they’ll be moved. 

                                 NAVARRO
                        If you film his funeral his death 
                        could mean something, but I don’t 
                        know how much more filming we can 
                        do beyond that. I think they’ve had 
                        enough. 

                                 JOHN
                        But people ought to be aware of the 
                        kind of power you can yield. Look, 
                        you arrest one, two at a time the 
                        Miami Herald tucks that in deep, 
                        but show them something on a 
                        massive scale and there will be 
                        headlines to match.     

                                 NAVARRO
                        What are you suggesting?

           INT. POLICE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 

           The crew films a group of serious looking cops conversing.

           picture of a cop cuffing a black teen on the ground. The 
           caption reads, “Let’s make the 25th season of COPS its last.”

           EXT. STREET CORNER - DAY  

           A BLACK WOMAN with the shakes leans into the window of a car. 

           Zooming back Jerry and Linda, the couple, watch her. Jerry 
           hands a piece of gum to Bertram, who’s filming in the back.

           Ron nods to the undercover officer next to him. The 
           undercover gets out and crosses the street to the gang. 

           In the back Kiger taps on a CAMERAMAN’S shoulder to follow.

           pulling his gun out. 

           EXT. STREET CORNER - DAY 

           The undercover car flashes the brights. The signal. Jerry 
           starts the car. Linda has trouble securing the police beacon 
           on the dashboard as the car speeds.  

           They get out of the car to point their guns at the women.

           for a bag of coke from gang members across the street.

           pistol right as a SWARM of cars rush in on all sides.

           The gang members sit cuffed in a prisoner transport vehicle. 
           Kiger and the camera man film Ron closing the door on them.

           EXT. FRONT LAWN - DAY 

           A WOMAN walks her dog in front of a shabby house on a lonely 
           street. After she passes, the SWAT team races to the house. 
           Windows are smashed. The door is battered.  

           INT. CRACK HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           John films them moving in. ADDICTS in sleeping bags put their 
           hands up. The one addict standing is pummeled to the floor.  

           The SWAT team starts flipping over the addicts and zip tieing 
           their arms full of track marks. 

           EXT. ANOTHER STREET CORNER - DAY 

           Jerry sees the undercover car shine the brights. This time 
           it’s a SHIRTLESS BLACK MALE. Jerry floors it. Linda has 
           trouble securing the beacon again. 

           As they get out of the car the man makes a run for it. Jerry 
           tackles him to the ground and punches him repeatedly.  

           EXT. GHETTO AREA - DAY 

           Ron sees an undercover remove his hat near a Camaro. 

           Ron drives forward, but the Camaro floors it. Kiger buckles 
           in. Now it’s a car chase. Several cars race after the Camaro. 

           They swerve and turn. Ron takes out his gun and aims for the 
           tires. BAM! BAM! BAM! A tire is blown and the Camaro swerves 
           off the road crashing into a palm tree. 

           A MAN gets out of the Camaro and is tackled by another cop. 

           INT. SECOND CRACK HOUSE - DAY 

           An emaciated man humps a woman on the floor. WHACK! The man 
           is hit on the head and ripped off. They’re zip tied. 

           Other addicts cower. John films Bob Deak shake an addict on 
           the floor. Unresponsive. Bob shakes him again. No movement. 
           EXT. ALLEY - DAY 

           Jerry drags a bloodied BLACK WOMAN on the pavement as she 
           screams. Linda giggles in Bertram’s frame.  

           INT. JERRY’S CAR - DAY 

           Linda fumbles with the beacon. Jerry chucks it out the 
           window.

           EXT. ANOTHER STREET CORNER - MOMENTS LATER

           Jerry smashes the body of a black male over the hood of a car 
           so hard we can feel the hurt. Jerry cuffs him.  

           Another black male is smashed on a car in a different area.  
           Another. Another. Bertram flinches as he films each time. 

           EXT. GHETTO AREA - DAY 

           Malcolm is shmoozing with local REPORTERS near the SWAT team 
           hauling addicts into buses. They funnel in one by one. 

           Malcolm notices the prostitute he got a release from earlier 
           entering the bus. They make eye contact. He grimaces.

           A helicopter lands close by. Sheriff Nick Navarro gets out 
           making a grand entrance. The reporters run to him. 

           INT. THIRD CRACK HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           John films Bob Deak and the SWAT team showing Navarro the 
           apprehended assault rifles and cocaine.  

           John notices the team put the cocaine gently in a container 
           in front of suspects pushed and shoved out the door.  

           EXT. BROWARD COUNTY - DAY 

           We fly overhead a ghetto area as SWAT vans and teams fade in 
           and out near different houses as they infiltrate them.     

           EXT. WAREHOUSE LOT - EVENING 

           Reporters interview Navarro. Behind them suspects are brought 
           into a warehouse for booking. John watches the cacophony.    
                                 KIGER
                        Do you want to say it?  
                             (John shakes his head)
                        That’s a wrap! 

           The crew whistles and claps. 

                                 BERTRAM
                        I need a new fucking body. 

           A reporter and a cameraman walk by. The cameraman recognizes 
           John; he’s was the one threatened in the opening. He smirks 
           and walks off. Malcolm approaches with a folder of releases. 

                                 JOHN
                        These are blank...

           INT. FOX CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Flash forward to 2013: John is sitting across from Claire. 
           There’s an HR person in the room.   

                                 CLAIRE

                        puts us in a bad position. Our

                        airs. It will be a clean break, you 
                        will have complete control to move 
                        to another distributor.

                                 JOHN
                        Do you need me to sign anything?   

                                 CLAIRE
                        Uh, not right now, no.  

           They shake hands. John gets up and walks out calmly. Claire 
           looks over to the HR person... that was surprisingly easy. 

           INT. BEACHFRONT RESTAURANT - NIGHT 

           Morgan walks in to see John, intoxicated, drinking at the bar 
           and watching coverage of the George Zimmerman trial. 

                                 MORGAN

                        I’ve called every network. It’s not

                        Mel Gibson. Great actor. Got fucked 
                        when his girlfriend recorded him 
                        saying it’d be her fault if she got 
                        "raped by a pack of niggers". 
                        Remember that? She recorded him at 
                        his worst moment and released it. 
                        That’s what COPS does. I’ve made a 
                        series out of filming a person’s 
                        worst moment. That moment shattered 
                        him. He hasn’t been in a film in 
                        years. 

                                 MORGAN
                        Why are we talking about Mel

                        Because if COPS continues to be on 
                        the air, I will have that moment. 
                        Color of Change is right. We do all 
                        the shit they say we do so, I’m 
                        pulling the plug. 

                                 MORGAN
                        What about us dad? 

                                 JOHN
                        You make your own show. You do have 
                        some of me in you. Put your mind to 
                        it, make something better. 

                                 MORGAN
                        I’ve been working on COPS with you 
                        since I was a boy. Remember that? 

                                 JOHN
                        This is not the path I wanted for 
                        you son. You need to be your own 
                        man now.  

                                 MORGAN
                        If you let COPS die this way, Color 
                        of Change will forever be an 
                        asterisk on your legacy. 

                                 JOHN
                        If I asked our audience to think of 
                        a black man, what do you think 
                        they’d say? They’d say a thug. 

                                 MORGAN
                        People know enough not to ascribe 
                        thugs to every black guy.  
                                 JOHN
                        What about George Zimmerman? 

                                 MORGAN
                        What about him? 

                                 JOHN
                        He saw that boy as a threat. 

                                 MORGAN
                        Everyone has bias but not everyone 
                        kills someone over it. 

                                 JOHN
                        COPS advances that. We play a part.  

                                 MORGAN
                        Where did you find out he watches 
                        COPS? 

                                 JOHN
                        We’re the media! We’re everywhere 
                        and if it’s not us, it’s someone 
                        else cause god knows you can’t make 
                        something about this country 
                        without some unintended message 
                        about race. Every fucking piece of 
                        entertainment needs to be 
                        scrutinized inside out just so it’s 
                        not ‘problematic’. So I’m doing it, 
                        I’m cutting it off before everyone 
                        can see that the worst thing about 
                        me is the show I devoted my life 
                        to.    

                                 MORGAN
                        You’re drunk. 
                             (exits)

           EXT. BEACHFRONT RESTAURANT ENTRYWAY - NIGHT   

           John shuffles to his car. Is he going to drive? Yes he is! 

           He backs into a the parked car. SMASH! John’s back light 
           shatters. It goes unnoticed. John speeds into the street.    

           INT. JOHN’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           John swerves in and out of the right lane. An approaching car 
           blares its horn. John moves back within the boundaries. 
           EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET - CONTINUOUS

           John turns on a residential street. Blue and red lights 
           flare. John notices the police car. John whispers, “Shit.”

           He pulls to the side of the road. The silhouette of a LA 
           OFFICER (30s) approaches. John rolls down his window.  

                                 LA OFFICER
                        Something happen to your tail 
                        light?

                                 JOHN
                        Some kids must’ve got to it.

                                 LA OFFICER
                        You been drinking tonight? 

                                 JOHN
                        No... 

           A flashlight beams on John, illuminating his glazed eyes.  

                                 LA OFFICER
                        Could you step out of the car for 
                        me, sir? 

                                 JOHN
                        Everything okay officer? 

                                 LA OFFICER
                        Step out of the car. 

           EXT. LA STREET - CONTINUOUS

           John stumbles out, he sees a dog walker eyeing the situation. 

                                 LA OFFICER
                        I am going to check your eyes. Keep 
                        your head still and follow my 
                        finger with your eyes only.

                                 JOHN
                        I won’t do that. 

                                 LA OFFICER
                        You won’t or you can’t? 

                                 JOHN
                        I’m under no legal obligation. 
                                 LA OFFICER
                        Turn around. Hands on the car. I’m 
                        not playing games. 

           John complies. The cop pads him down. He places John’s wallet 
           on the car then swings his arms down. Cuffs are tightened.  

                                 JOHN
                        What? What is going on? 

                                 LA OFFICER
                        I’m taking you in for a blood test 
                        since you refused a field test. 
                        You’ll lose your license and face 
                        jail time if convicted of a DUI. 
                        You don’t have the right to speak 
                        to an attorney prior to taking the 
                        test and your test refusals can be 
                        used against you in court. 

           INT. LA POLICE CAR - CONTINUOUS

           John is shut in. Stillness. He waits and then... breaks. 
           Breathing heavy. Tears rain down. 

           There’s a muffled dialogue with the LA Officer and someone 
           else that isn’t audible. The passenger door opens. 

                                 LA OFFICER
                        Step out of the car for me.

           John wipes his eyes on his shoulder and gets out. 

           EXT. LA STREET - NIGHT 

           Standing right beside the officer is Morgan, dumbfounded.  

                                 LA OFFICER
                        You’re John Langley? 

                                 JOHN
                        Yes.

                                 LA OFFICER
                        You created COPS? 

                                 JOHN
                        Yes. 

           The officer takes the cuffs off. 
                                 LA OFFICER
                        I’m letting you off with a warning 
                        Mr. Langley. Your show got me into 
                        police work. If your son didn’t 
                        spot your car, the night would have 
                        turned out differently for you. 
                        You’re okay to drive him home? 

                                 MORGAN
                        Yes. 

                                 LA OFFICER
                        Let me help you in. 

           The LA Officer puts John in Morgan’s car and closes the door. 
           He walks back to give Morgan John’s wallet and keys.  

                                 MORGAN
                        Thanks Jimmy. You didn’t go too 
                        hard on him, did you? 

                                 LA OFFICER
                        No, no. Just scared him a little. 
                        It’s a good thing you called it in. 
                        He could have done some damage. 

                                 MORGAN
                        We’ll be filming in LA in a couple 
                        seasons. You’ll hear from me then.  

                                 LA OFFICER
                        I’ll rewatch The Shield to prepare.  

           INT. MORGAN’S CAR - NIGHT   

           John sees this interaction. The smile. The pat on the back. 
           John knows they know each other. He knows. Morgan enters the 
           car and drives off. It’s dead quiet.  

           CUT TO: Morgan drives through the gates of a mansion. 

                                 MORGAN
                        I’ll set up the Paramount meeting 
                        for next week. You need help 
                        getting in? 

                                 JOHN
                        No.

           Morgan watches John shuffle in. 
           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           John creeps into bed next to Maggie, still awake. They kiss.   

                                 JOHN
                        I should have called. I’m going to 
                        be better. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Do whatever you want just as long 
                        as they know I’m Mrs. Langley. 

           INT. LA EDITING SUITE - DAY 

           CUT to the 80’s: John looms over the shoulder of an editor. 
           There are a dozen screens at the station, all have frames 
           from the pilot of COPS. The scene with the Coroner comes on. 

                                 JOHN
                        Take out the autopsy. 

           The editor turns to look at John, it’s a young Doug Waterman! 

                                 DOUG
                        All of it? 

           John nods then sits next to Malcolm. 

                                 JOHN
                        You good? 

                                 MALCOLM
                        Yeah... 

           INT. FOX CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           FOX EXECUTIVES watch the show with captivated eyes. John 
           tries to get a read on Geller’s inscrutable expression. The 
           credits roll and the lights come up. A long tense pause. In 
           the corner of the room a nameless RUPERT MURDOCH says... 

                                 MURDOCH
                        Order a season.

                                 GELLER 
                        Ah, you hush, I'm talking now. Move 
                        “Beyond Tomorrow” back a half hour. 
                        Let’s put this in at 9.  

                                 FOX EXECUTIVE #1
                        I thought we were putting “Beans 
                        Baxter” in that spot? 
                                 GELLER
                        Call Holland tell him it’s 
                        cancelled. 

                                 FOX EXECUTIVE #2
                        That’s going to be right after “The 
                        Reporters”. Shouldn’t we go with 
                        something news related?  

                                 GELLER
                        Were you not watching? This is the 
                        news. This is going prime time, no 
                        discussion. When’s the soonest you 
                        can get back into Broward? 

                                 JOHN
                        A month maybe? 

                                 GELLER 
                        You have relationships with 
                        departments in other states?  

                                 JOHN
                        Yes. 

                                 GELLER 
                        No you don’t. That’s okay we’ll 
                        help. Tom, Andrew, Kyle you’re on 
                        this now. You report to Chao. I 
                        want Vegas, LA, New York, Phoenix, 
                        Houston. I want variety. Start 
                        making calls. Now. 
                             (executives exit)
                        That was cute what you did with the 
                        dead girl. I’ll leave it to you to 
                        put something else in. 

                                 GELLER’S ASSISTANT
                        Mr. Geller, I have—

                                 GELLER
                        Yeah I know. Good job gentlemen, 
                        you got yourselves a show.
                             (exits; to his assistant)
                        Don’t interrupt me ever! Now make 
                        yourself useful and get me lunch.   

                                 CHAO
                        We fucking did it! 

           Chao squeezes John and Malcolm. Malcolm watches them exit; 
           then looks to the TV. The freeze frame is a title card... 
           Created by John Langley and Malcolm Barbour. His smile fades.    
           INT. FANCY BEVERLY HILLS RESTAURANT - NIGHT 

           The Langley family is sitting at a table all dressed up.

                        How long will you be gone for? 

                                 JOHN
                        It’s just a few of months. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        This is a good thing, Morgan. Dad 
                        is getting to do what he loves and 
                        I can be home with you.  

                                 JOHN
                        Everything I do, I do for you son.

                             (approaching)
                        Excuse me, Mr. Langley I just 
                        wanted to introduce myself. Seth 
                        Allen, I’m with CAA. I loved the 
                        pilot you just wrapped on. 

                                 JOHN
                        You watched it? 

                                 HOLLYWOOD AGENT
                        The whole town has! We’d love to 
                        talk about how we can help you. 
                        This is a very exciting time and 
                        it’s best to have someone 
                        protecting your interests. Sorry to 
                        disturb.   

           John and Maggie grab each other’s hand. Morgan fakes a smile. 

           EXT. BROWARD COUNTY FIELD - DAY 

           Police cars are parked with blue and red lights flaring. A 
           crowd of people watch something from behind caution tape. 

           A van stops right nearby. It’s the COPS crew! Nick Navarro 
           lifts the tape so they can go through. 

           EXT. BOW OF BOAT - NIGHT 

           Bertram films Jerry Wurms getting on one knee in front of 
           Linda Canada. She puts her hands on her chest and nods. They 
           kiss. Malcolm rolls his eyes. 
           INT. ED SULLIVAN THEATER - NIGHT 

           Linda walks on the set of the Late Show with DAVID LETTERMAN. 
           The audience cheers for her. We CUT into the program a bit. 

                                 LETTERMAN
                        Let me understand this, the guys 
                        ride around with you taping things. 
                        That’s a TV show?

           EXT. URBAN STREET - DAY 

           A police car chases after a speeding car. Bertram films in 
           the front. Kiger holds the boom in the back. Title Card: 
           Portland, Multnomah County

           EXT. BACK YARD - NIGHT 

           BLACK MEN, cuffed, lay on the grass. An officer holds back a 
           GERMAN SHEPARD. John gestures for Bertram to get low to get 
           their faces. Title Card: Tucson, Arizona

           EXT. BEACH FRONT HOUSE - DAY 

           John, Maggie and Morgan watch Movers moving boxes into their 
           new home. They look like a happy American family. 

           In a series of cuts, John is picked up in different cabs at 
           different times. Maggie and Morgan hug him before he leaves. 

           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY 

           A PLASTIC SURGEON draws lines under Maggie’s eyes. As Maggie 
           turns to look into a mirror, flash forward to the bags 
           removed. She’s giddy. The doctor draws more lines on her 
           eyebrows... they’re lifted. Her lips... they’re fuller. 

           EXT. ALLEY - DAY 

           Two Minnesota cops are in a foot race with a suspect. The 
           suspect is pummeled to the pavement. His face is smashed.

           EXT. EDIT SUITE - DAY 

           Morgan peers in with baseball in hand to see John watching 
           the same footage. John shakes his head but offers Morgan a 
           seat. Morgan takes it. 
           INT. EMPTY BUILDING - DAY 

           John and Malcolm are led in by a realtor. In a CUT the place 
           is the headquarters of COPS with office workers all around.  

           EXT. BEACH FRONT HOUSE - DAY

           Maggie and Morgan wave John off as he gets in a cab. The next 
           time John gets in a cab his family isn’t there. 

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY 

           In a series of cuts John wakes up and gets up in different 
           hotel beds. He seems more tired every time. 

           INT. AIRPORT - DAY 

           John passes by people engrossed in an episode of COPS on TV.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 

           A FATHER (dentist) talks in front of the class. It’s “Career 
           Day” and parents sit with their kids. 

           Morgan leaves Maggie and sits down in another chair. Flash! 
           It’s picture day. Morgan leaves frame. In another outfit a 
           teenage Morgan sits down. Not that sweet boy anymore. Flash!  

           INT. BEACHFRONT HOUSE - DAY 

           Maggie turns on a lamp in the bed. She looks worried as she 
           retrieves a pill bottle from a drawer. She swallows a couple. 
           The camera slides into the living room: John is going through 
           COPS footage with Morgan. As John speaks Morgan takes notes. 

           ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE: the Berlin Wall comes down. The Hubble 
           Space Telescope launches. A clip of Seinfeld.  

           A clip of the officers beating Rodney King intercuts with 
           Cops from COPS arresting black men. The acquittal of the Los 
           Angeles officers then to the 1992 riots: crowds held back by 
           the National Guard, buildings on fire, people in body bags. 

           INT. MALCOLM’S OFFICE - DAY 

           Malcolm watches coverage of the riots. He turns off the TV, 
           contemplates for a moment then looks out to see John flirting 
           with some pretty 20 something employee.  
           INT. JOHN’S OFFICE - DAY 

           John and Malcolm are seated across each other. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        ...and with the riots I can’t be on 
                        anymore.    

                                 JOHN
                        Your signature is still drying on 
                        the syndication deal. 

                                 MALCOLM
                        It’s time for me to go.   

                                 JOHN
                        You’re contracted until ‘94. FOX 
                        will sue you.

                                 MALCOLM
                        Cover for me. 

                                 JOHN
                        You want to leave now that you made 
                        your millions. Fine. I don’t need 
                        you, but you’re wrong about this 
                        show.    

                                 MALCOLM
                        You know what this show is John. 
                        You always knew.  
                             (beat)

                                 JOHN
                        If you really believe what we made 
                        is... how do you make sense of what 
                        you’re leaving behind?  

                                 MALCOLM
                        I don’t know. There’s not a day 
                        that goes by where I don’t think 
                        about Broward. All the things we’ve 
                        seen and chose to ignore. I don’t 
                        think these feelings go away, but I 
                        still have my children and my 
                        children are more precious to me 
                        than anything I’ve made. If I do 
                        okay there, that will be enough.

           John waits there for long beat. Silence. An Office PA enters. 

                                 OFFICE PA 
                        Mr. Langley, are you ready to go 
                        over these dailies?
                                 JOHN
                        Yeah, come on in. 

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT 

           Flash forward to 2013: A couple PARAMOUNT EXECUTIVES shake 
           hands with John, Morgan, and Doug. We CUT into the meeting. 

                                 PARAMOUNT EXECUTIVE #1
                        We’re so excited to have this apart 
                        of our line up.   

                                 MORGAN
                        It’s very exciting for us too. 

                                 JOHN
                        Are you going to address Color of 
                        Change at all?  

                                 PARAMOUNT EXECUTIVE #2
                        Robinson thinks they’ve won since 
                        it’s off broadcast now and the 
                        general public really had no idea 
                        about the petition. Thank god.  

                                 PARAMOUNT EXECUTIVE #1
                        People only need to know COPS is 
                        moving to Paramount and that the 
                        show’s integrity will be safe with 
                        you two as the showrunners.  

           INT. JOHN’S OFFICE - NIGHT 

           John, drink in hand, watches Doug chatting with the 
           executives in the parking lot. Morgan enters the office. 

                                 MORGAN
                        Hey. I got us a box for the Dodgers 
                        game tonight. The whole family is 
                        coming. Mom will be there. Thought 
                        we could celebrate before I head to 
                        Amarillo tomorrow.    

                                 JOHN
                        Filming doesn’t start for a couple 
                        weeks.   

                                 MORGAN
                        I have to be there for the location 
                        scouts and then the filming. 
                                 JOHN
                        We have crews for that.   

                                 MORGAN
                        It’s only a few months. It’s not 
                        like I’m going away for good.  

                                 JOHN
                        You know it’s not going to end with 
                        Color of Change. This generation, 
                        people are awakening to what they 
                        watch. There will be more of them, 
                        more of these groups, and they’re 
                        going to come after us.   

                                 MORGAN
                        We’ll survive. COPS always does. I 
                        think we’re going to be on for a 
                        long time.  

                                 JOHN
                        Something will kill this and when 
                        it does people will write about us, 
                        we’ll be condemned, hated...    

                                 MORGAN
                        No one is coming after us now. If 
                        people really cared about how the 
                        sausage was made, they wouldn’t eat 
                        it. So what we need to focus on now 
                        is making COPS the best, most 
                        balanced, show it can be.    

                                 JOHN
                        Think I’m going to pass on that 
                        game tonight. 

                                 MORGAN
                        All we do is make TV dad. That’s 
                        all we do.   

           Morgan leaves John’s ticket on his desk and exits. John waits 
           for Morgan to leave... He makes his way into the open office 
           area... Everyone has gone home, the office TV is still on. 

           INT. MORGAN’S CAR - NIGHT  

           Morgan notices the shotgun shell John gave him is still on 
           his key chain. It’s all rusted and dinged up. He tries wiping 
           some smudge off but it won’t come out. It’s ruined. He keeps 
           at it as we CUT TO...
           INT. OPEN OFFICE AREA - NIGHT 

           John raises the volume.  

                                 ABC ANCHOR 
                        It was a dramatic moment in America 
                        when the jury of the George 
                        Zimmerman trial finally delivered a 
                        verdict: not guilty. Adding fuel to 
                        a fire of racial tensions flaring 
                        across the country.  

                                 JUROR 
                        George Zimmerman got away with it, 
                        but you can’t get away from God. 
                        And at the end of the day, he’s 
                        going to have a lot of questions 
                        and answers he has to deal with, 
                        but the law couldn’t prove it. 

           John slouches down in a chair continuing to watch. 

           TITLE CARD: 

           The Florida Supreme Court ruled the Broward County Police 
           Department’s practise of manufacturing crack cocaine 
           unconstitutional in 1992.  

           John takes a big swig from his drink. 

           Malcolm Barbour received 40% of the net revenue of COPS. He 
           died in 2014. 

           Morgan Langley continues to work on COPS as an Executive 
           Producer and Co-Showrunner.

           John adjusts his seat to recline. He’s staying for a while.  

           COPS has produced over 1,000 episodes. It has been on the air 
           for 30 years.  

           John Langley is the oldest Showrunner in Hollywood.
