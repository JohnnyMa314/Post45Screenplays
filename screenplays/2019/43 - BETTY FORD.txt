                      “I was an ordinary woman who was called 
                        on stage at an extraordinary time.”

           INT. HOTEL SUITE, CLEVELAND, OHIO - DAY

           October 1975.

           BETTY FORD, 57, checks herself in the mirror. She smoothes down 
           the cream silk shirt she’s wearing over a white skirt. She 
           takes off her neck-brace and replaces it with a white scarf.

                            Fame! Makes a man take things over.

           The rooms are plush, but cold and unfriendly. The funky beats 
           of David Bowie’s Fame are jangling out of a radio.

                          Fame! Lets him loose, hard to swallow.

           Betty dances a little to the Bowie and winces. She touches the 
           source of her intense pain - her shoulder. A pinched nerve. She 
           gives it a moment... But it’s not subsiding.

                       Fame! Puts you there where things are hollow.

           She fumbles a few pills out of a pouch and knocks them back 
           with two fingers of vodka.

           She snaps off the radio and in silence takes a last look in the 
           mirror, patting her perfectly coiffured hair.

           We close in on Betty’s eyes as she practices her smile in 
           the mirror.

           INT. REHABILITATION CLINIC, NAVAL HOSPITAL - DAY

           1978 - THREE YEARS LATER. Betty’s eyes again - now lined, 
           tired, grey. Trembling mouth set in a line of anxiety. She 
           tries to muster up a smile, but can’t.

           She’s sitting before an austerely uniformed NAVAL DOCTOR. He 
           looks at the paperwork in front of him. 

           To Betty’s eyes, the surroundings are grey and dreary. To 
           Betty’s ears, every sound is loud and cruel. Her hands shake. 
           She jumps as he speaks. 

                                 NAVAL DOCTOR
                        Narcotics.

                                 BETTY
                        On prescription. For my shoulder.

                                 NAVAL DOCTOR
                        Valium?

           Betty nods and he makes a mark on the paperwork. 
                                 NAVAL DOCTOR
                        Librium?

           Betty nods. 

                                 NAVAL DOCTOR
                        Miltown?

                                 BETTY
                        Yes.

                                 NAVAL DOCTOR
                        Codeine, Dervocet?

                                 BETTY
                        Both. Yes. 

                                 NAVAL DOCTOR
                        Ambien?

                                 BETTY
                        All of them. Just put them all.

                                 NAVAL DOCTOR
                        You’ve listed no illegal drugs?

                                 BETTY
                        No. 

                                 NAVAL DOCTOR
                        We’ll still need to test for that.

           Betty nods. The doctor moves on to a new list.

                                 NAVAL DOCTOR
                        Alcohols.

                                 BETTY
                        What?

                                 NAVAL DOCTOR
                        Vodka?

                                 BETTY
                        That’s not why they’ve put 
                        me here.

                                 NAVAL DOCTOR
                        They?

                                 BETTY
                        My family.
                                 NAVAL DOCTOR
                        We need to know. If we’re going to 
                        help you.

                                 BETTY
                        I have a problem with drugs - 
                        prescription drugs. 

                                 NAVAL DOCTOR
                        Betty.

                                 BETTY
                        Mrs Ford.

                                 NAVAL DOCTOR
                        Betty... Vodka?

           Betty takes a shuddering breath - this hurts.

           LATER

           Betty follows a uniformed NURSE down a institutional corridor.

           She pauses for a moment to look at a poster on the wall that 
           lays out the Twelve Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous.

           Betty’s eyes focus in on the word - Alcoholics.

                                 NURSE
                        Come along, Betty.

           Betty is led into a sparsely-furnished bedroom. One of the two 
           beds already has a bag and coat laid on it. Betty looks at it 
           anxiously.

           The nurse gestures her to the other bed by the window. Betty 
           looks out at the militant rows of flowers in the garden.

                                 NURSE
                        You’ll need to read this 
                        through carefully.

           Betty takes a dossier from her - Code of Conduct - Long Beach 
           Navel Hospital Rehabilitation Clinic.

                                 NURSE
                        Your name will be added to the 
                        chores schedule in the main hall. 
                        We’ll call you for supper at five.

           As the nurse goes out, another woman comes in - LINDA is 
           younger than Betty, skinny and tired. 

           The two women smile awkwardly. Linda gestures to the bed --
                                 LINDA
                        I took this one, is that ok?

                                 BETTY
                        I like to look out at the garden. 
                        It reminds me of home.

           Linda lies on her bed and faces the wall.

           Betty looks at her - wondering whether to try a conversation. 
           She doesn’t and instead just sits, wringing her hands. 

           INT. GROUP THERAPY ROOM - DAY

           Betty sits in a circle with twenty or so others as the GROUP 
           THERAPIST mediates. She and Linda are two of only four women.

                                 GROUP THERAPIST
                        Linda?

           Betty glances up at Linda who is hunched into herself on her 
           chair. Linda shakes her head.

           The therapist catches Betty’s eye. He smiles and nods to her. 

           Betty clutches her shaking hands and clears her throat. It 
           feels as though all the eyes in the room are burning into her. 

                                 BETTY
                        ... My name is... Betty. 

           Silence. 

           Those who were preoccupied have now realized who is sitting 
           amongst them. Betty falters... A WOMAN smiles at her --

                                 WOMAN
                        Hello, Betty. 

           The others catch up --

                                 GROUP
                        Hello, Betty. 

           Betty smiles at the woman - grateful. 

                                 BETTY
                        My name is Betty and I’m...

           Betty’s face, as she struggles to think what to say. 

                                 BETTY
                        I’m a... I’m the...
           INT. HOTEL SUITE, CLEVELAND, OHIO - DAY

           It’s 1975 again - we’re back in Betty’s hotel room from the 
           first scene.

           Betty’s reflection in the mirror finds a smile she’s happy 
           with. The pill kicks in, and as it does her face softens, the 
           world around her becomes warmer and more colorful.

           She heads for the door --

           As she strides down the corridor, Bowie starts up again, the 
           sound much fuller now.

                       Fame, it’s not your brain, it’s just the flame
                         That burns your change to keep you insane.

           The hotel staff stand to attention as she approaches. She 
           smiles at each of them - warm, friendly, personable.

           She feels like she’s floating.

           Her social secretary NANCY HOWE - warm, a little anxious - 
           intercepts her path and hurries alongside. Extracts a seating 
           plan from a file. Betty glances over it.

                                 BETTY
                        That looks fine, thanks Nancy.

                                 NANCY HOWE
                        I’m sorry, I had to put Kissinger 
                        next to Mason...

                                 BETTY
                        If you had to, you had to. As long 
                        as I’m with Queen Alia.

                                 NANCY HOWE
                        What shall we put on the menu?

                                 BETTY
                        I think a cold platter. Salmon, 
                        roast beef, a nice artichoke 
                        salad, maybe? A round of cheese 
                        and a selection of mousse to 
                        finish it off.

                                 NANCY HOWE
                            (scribbling it down)
                        Okay.
                                 BETTY
                        Make sure someone’s checked their 
                        Highnesses have no dietary 
                        requirements. And can you have 
                        something ready for me to change 
                        into? We won’t have long to 
                        prepare. The pale green Frankie 
                        Welch dress, you know the one?

           Nancy bristles as Betty’s fierce fast-talking press secretary 
           SHEILA WEIDENFELD interrupts them.

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        I’ll take you to the stage. 
                        There’s a chair at the base of the 
                        flag pole. Sit on it until you’re 
                        introduced. Afterwards, exit to 
                        the left and I will be there to 
                        guide you to the press room.

           Betty, still hurrying along flanked by her two secretaries, 
           pats her hair.

                                 BETTY
                        Will they have cameras, Sheila?

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        Yes.

                                 BETTY
                        Do I look ok?

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        Fine.

                                 BETTY
                        Fine?

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        Great.

                                 BETTY
                        Great. We can’t stay long, we have 
                        to get back to the White House for 
                        dinner with the Husseins.

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        I’ll let them know in advance, 
                        they have ten minutes only.

                                 BETTY
                        Ten minutes.

           Betty’s husband PRESIDENT GERALD R. FORD, 62, is waiting for 
           her with his entourage. Betty stops to kiss him.
                                 BETTY
                        You didn’t have to come all the 
                        way here.

                                 GERALD
                        I couldn’t miss it.

           He’s a huge oak tree of a man and for a moment, enveloped in 
           his branches, Betty allows herself to look terrified. Gerald 
           whispers in her ear --

                                 GERALD
                        I believe in you.

           Betty squeezes his arm, then follows Sheila --

           To find herself beside a stage - incredibly bright lights ahead 
           of her. She looks back at Gerald --

           GERALD’S ENTOURAGE

           are moving around him anxiously, including Assistant Chief of 
           Staff DICK CHENEY.

                                 DICK CHENEY
                        They didn’t let us vet the speech.

                                 GERALD
                        Because they know you’d try to 
                        stop her.

           BETTY

           takes a deep breath and steps out onto stage. The Bowie cuts 
           out and she sways for a moment - the combination of pills and 
           booze making her woozy - then pulls herself together.

           Staying out of the spotlight, she makes her way to the flag 
           pole, and sits. She looks out at the audience - thousands of 
           expectant women. The lights are now blinding, hurting her eyes.

           She breathes deeply. Shifts in her seat to try and ease 
           her shoulder.

           She notices the row of press photographers at the front of the 
           audience. Then she tunes into the WOMAN at the podium beside 
           her, just in time --

                                 WOMAN
                        ... the First Lady of the United 
                        States, Betty Ford!
           The crowd erupt in applause and Betty slowly gets to her feet 
           to shake hands with the woman. She moves behind the podium 
           which is covered in white flowers and adorned with the venus 
           symbol and three microphones.

           Cameras are flashing. Blinding. The audience are still 
           clapping. So loud. She smiles at them. Smiles again. They keep 
           on clapping.

                                 BETTY
                        Thank you...
                            (falteringly as they 
                            quieten down)
                        Thank you so very much... It’s... 
                        A great privilege... and a great 
                        delight to be here and have this 
                        opportunity to say a few words to 
                        all of you wonderful people...

           She looks down at her notes - they’re blurred - she squints and 
           they come into focus. She starts to speak more formally --

                                 BETTY
                        I am here because I believe the 
                        best way to celebrate 
                        International Women’s Year is to 
                        examine the very real problems 
                        women face today, not the progress 
                        of yesterday.
                        While many new opportunities are 
                        open to women, too many are 
                        available only to the lucky few.
                        Many barriers continue to block 
                        the paths of most women, even on 
                        the most basic issue of equal pay 
                        for equal work.

           Gerald and his advisors are watching from the side of the 
           stage, Cheney wincing at the applause.

                                 DICK CHENEY
                        The party is going to be furious.

           Gerald ignores him. Watches his wife with great admiration.

                                 BETTY
                        And the contributions of women as 
                        wives and mothers continue to be 
                        underrated. This year is not the 
                        time to cheer the visible few, but 
                        to work for the invisible many, 
                        whose lives are still restricted 
                        by custom and code.
           A child cries out in the audience, and she looks towards it as 
           if wondering whether she should respond. But she glances back 
           at her notes and carries on --

                                 BETTY
                        Many of these restrictions spring 
                        directly from those emotional 
                        ideas about what women can do and 
                        should do.

           She’s talking slowly, deliberately. Sometimes her mouth moves, 
           and then reconsiders, tries again. She looks as though she’s 
           picking her way through a fog.

                                 BETTY
                        These definitions of behavior and 
                        ability inhibit men and women 
                        alike, but the limits on women 
                        have been formalized into law, and 
                        structured into social custom. For 
                        that reason, the first important 
                        steps are to undo the laws that
                            (she slurs slightly, but 
                            pulls it back together)
                        hem women in and lock them out of 
                        the mainstream of opportunities.

           The audience are lapping up her words. The women are excited, 
           emotional, relieved, that finally someone so close to the 
           highest office in the land - the First Lady - is saying what 
           they need the world to hear.

                                 BETTY
                        But my own support of the Equal 
                        Rights Amendment has shown what 
                        happens when a definition of 
                        proper behavior collides with the 
                        right of an individual to personal 
                        opinions.
                            (the audience laugh, and she 
                            allows herself to enjoy it)
                        I do not believe that being First 
                        Lady should prevent me from 
                        expressing my ideas.
                            (the audience cheers)
                        I spoke out on this important 
                        issue, because of my deep personal 
                        convictions. Why should my 
                        husband’s job, or yours, prevent 
                        us from being ourselves? Being 
                        un... being ladylike does not 
                        require silence.
                                 BETTY
                        The Equal Rights Amendment when 
                        ratified will not be an instant 
                        solution to women’s problems. It 
                        will not alter the fabric of the 
                        constitution or force women away 
                        from their families. But, by 
                        making us legally equal within all 
                        areas of society, it will help 
                        knock down those restrictions that 
                        have locked women in to the old 
                        stereotypes of behavior and 
                        opportunity. It will help open up 
                        more options for women.
                            (she relishes this 
                            next thought)
                        But it is only a beginning.

                                                               SMASH CUT TO:

                                          BETTY

           -- fills the screen in a funky 70s color and font.

           INT. A LIVELY DANCE HALL - EVENING

           1947. A young hand with perfectly polished nails accepts a gin 
           sling. A 29-year-old BETTY FORD takes a sip. Delicious. 

           She smiles up at her date - 34-year-old GERALD FORD - a large 
           quarterback, completely besotted with his mischievous date.

           Betty knocks back her drink and holds out her hand. 

                                 BETTY
                        Shall we?

           There is no way Gerald is saying no. The couple glide onto the 
           dance floor, attracting looks of both admiration and jealousy. 

           Betty’s gown swirls around her as she shows off her moves. Her 
           eyes twinkle and her perfectly coiffured hair doesn’t budge. 

           Like the rest of the room, Gerald smiles down at her, 
           captivated. Betty changes his hold on her body.

                                 BETTY
                        I thought it’s the gentleman who’s 
                        supposed to lead.

                                 GERALD
                        So did I. 
                                 GERALD
                            (changing the hold back)
                        But I get the feeling you’re a 
                        little better at it than me.

                                 BETTY
                        Well, I did dance with Martha 
                        Graham, you know? 

                                 GERALD
                        That right?

           He smiles. EVERYONE knows this about Betty.

           She runs her hands over his muscular shoulder --

                                 BETTY
                        It’s a shame you don’t still 
                        play ball.

                                 GERALD
                        And why’s that? 

                                 BETTY
                        We all used to say that Jerry Ford 
                        was going to go all the way.

                                 GERALD
                        I had my shot. Made other choices. 

                                 BETTY
                        Work...

                                 GERALD
                        Work. 

                                 BETTY
                        Sensible.

                                 GERALD
                        And stable. 

                                 BETTY
                        But not necessarily exciting...

           Gerald smiles. It is clear he is used to and charmed by Betty’s 
           provocations. 

                                 GERALD
                        I happen to think a man who cares 
                        about his responsibilities is 
                        pretty exciting.
                                 BETTY
                        Touché. 

           Betty and Gerald are interrupted by another couple - BILL and 
           GINNIE. Bill pumps Gerald’s hand.

                                 BILL
                        Jerry! Not often we see you at one 
                        of these.

                                 GERALD
                        Well, I guess I had an 
                        incentive... Betty - Bill and 
                        Ginnie Lewis. Bill and I were at 
                        Michigan together. 

                                 BETTY
                        Pleasure. Betty Bloomer.
                            (smiling at Ginnie)
                        We’ve met before.  

                                 GINNIE
                        And I believe you were Betty 
                        Warren when we were last in each 
                        other’s company... 

           Awkward silence. The men shuffle. Ginnie smiles - butter 
           wouldn’t melt. 

                                 BETTY
                        Warren was my married name. 
                        Bloomer my maiden. Such a luxury 
                        to get to choose. Good to see you 
                        both. Time for some air. 

           Ginnie huffs. Bill looks admiring. 

           OUTSIDE

           Betty and Gerald walk. He lights her slim cigarette. 

                                 GERALD
                        He’s actually very nice. 

                                 BETTY
                        I’m sure. 

                                 GERALD
                        Running for congress as a matter 
                        of fact. 

                                 BETTY
                        Well, that’s spoilt it.
                                 BETTY
                            (off Gerald’s raised eyebrow)
                        I don’t like politics.

                                 GERALD
                        You don’t strike me as apathetic. 

                                 BETTY
                        I’m not. And I have great respect 
                        for people who want to live a life 
                        of service.

                                 GERALD
                        But?

                                 BETTY
                        But I just spent several years 
                        caring for a very ill husband. And 
                        this country isn’t very kind to 
                        women who want... or have to work. 
                        It dampens the political spirit 
                        somewhat.  

                                 GERALD
                        That rather scuppers my 
                        plans then. 

                                 BETTY
                        What plans?

                                 GERALD
                        I’m going to stand for the House 
                        of Representatives. And I had sort 
                        of hoped you may be the one 
                        standing by my side.

           Betty takes a drag and puts out her cigarette. She leans on 
           some railings looking back at him. 

                                 BETTY
                        I’m a divorcée.

                                 GERALD
                            (shrugging)
                        What you gonna do?

                                 BETTY
                        Easy for you to say.  

                                 GERALD
                        Seriously, Betty. By my side. Not 
                        behind me. 
                                 BETTY
                        You’re too handsome for a 
                        politician. 

                                 GERALD
                        And you’re too smart for one. But 
                        I’m prepared to take the risk. If 
                        you are?

           Betty considers this. She takes a step closer to him, looks up 
           into his eyes and smiles.

           INT. THE FORD HOME, ALEXANDRIA SUBURBS - MIDDAY

           1957 - TEN YEARS LATER. Betty jiggles a CRYING BABY DAUGHTER in 
           her arms as her THREE YOUNG BOYS scream and holler, chasing 
           each other around the house. She’s overwhelmed by the chaos.

                                 BETTY
                        Shhh. Shhh. It’s ok... Boys! Will 
                        you please just stop!

           At her raised voice, the baby starts crying louder.

           Betty puts her daughter in a play pen and steps into the 
           kitchen larder. She closes the door behind her and rests her 
           head against it. She starts to cry agonized, depressed tears. 

           She jumps as one of the kids bangs on the door -- 

                                 YOUNG SON (O.S)
                        Mommy! There’s smoke in 
                        the kitchen.

           Betty rushes out - their lunch is burning in the cooker. The 
           boys stand around concerned. The baby wails in the living room. 

                                 BETTY
                        Go and see to your sister. 

           The eldest boy scampers off. Betty pulls a smoking pot roast 
           out, burning her hand. She throws the food into the sink and 
           runs her hand under the faucet.

           The youngest boy starts to cough. Betty tries to open the 
           window. It’s stuck. She wrenches it hard, and howls in pain.

           She clutches her shoulder in agony and drops to the floor.
           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Gerald and a DOCTOR stand at the bedroom doorway, looking in on 
           Betty who’s lying sedated in traction on the bed.

           The doctor hands Gerald a bottle of pills.

                                 DOCTOR
                        This is for the inflammation 
                        surrounding the pinched nerve.
                            (another bottle)
                        These are for the pain. 
                        And these...
                            (third bottle)
                        Are muscle relaxants.

           Gerald looks overwhelmed.

                                 GERALD
                        Seems like a lot.

                                 DOCTOR
                        You’d be surprised how much these 
                        housewives can handle. She can 
                        take the codeine and valium 
                        together - up to three times a 
                        day. Then the anti-inflammatory at 
                        night and in the morning. I’ll 
                        write you a repeat prescription 
                        now. Saves time.

           Betty tries to shift in the bed. She groans in her sleep.

           INT. THE FORD HOME - EVENING

           March 1973 - SIXTEEN YEARS LATER. Betty sweeps down the narrow 
           stairs in a glamorous ball gown. She is now 55 and SECOND LADY 
           of the United States.

           Gerald is waiting, dapper in his black tie, holding a charity 
           ball invite embossed with the White House insignia.

           As Betty pulls on a pair of long white gloves, she winces at 
           the pain from her shoulder.

                                 BETTY
                        One minute.

           She opens a kitchen cupboard, takes a bottle from a stash of 
           prescribed medicines and swallows a Valium.

                                 GERALD
                        Ready?
                                 BETTY 
                        Not too late tonight, Jerry.

           Gerald ushers her out the door into the residential street.

                                 GERALD
                        Pat relies on you being there. 
                        You’re a conversation starter.

           Betty sighs. As a SECRET SERVICE AGENT opens her limo door, she 
           looks at the vice presidential flags flying from the hood --

                                 BETTY
                        Why don’t I get my own flags?

           She winks at the agent.

                                 GERALD
                        They’re not mine. Position not 
                        person, Betts. 

                                 BETTY
                        But it’s the person who makes that 
                        position, Jerry.

           As she gets in the car, Gerald and the agent exchange an 
           amused smile.

           INT. BALLROOM, WHITE HOUSE - LATER

           A jazz band plays. Betty sits at a table scattered with the 
           remnants of dessert. Neatly coiffured women in ball gowns chat 
           around the table as men circulate and smoke. 

           Betty looks over to Gerald who is deep in conversation with 
           Secretary of State, HENRY KISSINGER.

           Betty frowns at Gerald’s worried face. She waves at a waiter 
           for another glass of wine and zones back into the conversation 
           at the table.

           Across from her, the First Lady - PAT NIXON - is holding court.

                                 PAT
                        Dick is obviously deeply 
                        concerned. But as I said to him 
                        just last night - Dick, until some 
                        time has passed, none of us know 
                        what the impact will be. It’s 
                        distressing - absolutely - but we 
                        can’t lose our heads at such an 
                        important time.  

           CLAIRE next to her - shakes her head. 
                                 CLAIRE
                        I tell you, Jane Roe marks the end 
                        of sexual morality in our country.

           MAJORIE joins in. 

                                 MAJORIE
                        I lie awake every night when 
                        Patricia is out with Mike. 
                        Terrifying to think this could be 
                        one of our daughters.

           Betty drains her glass.

                                 BETTY 
                        Or us.

           The women laugh.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I think we’re a little past that, 
                        don’t you?

                                 PAT
                        The age or the action?

                                 MARJORIE
                        Both.

                                 BETTY
                        Speak for yourself, Marjorie. 

                                 PAT
                        She’s teasing. Betty, you’re a 
                        monster... Betty and I have a 
                        difference of opinion on the 
                        matter.

                                 CLAIRE
                        You mean you support this 
                        decision, Betty? 

                                 BETTY
                        I simply believe the right to a 
                        woman’s body should remain in her 
                        own hands. Not...
                            (to Pat) 
                        with all due respect, in those of 
                        our husbands. 

                                 MAJORIE
                        That’s not a popular opinion. 

           Betty holds up her hands and gives a broad smile.
                                 PAT
                        Dick isn’t unsympathetic. In cases 
                        - genuine - cases of... rape.

                                 MAJORIE
                        God forbid.

                                 PAT
                        Exactly. Or 
                            (whispering)
                        interracial relationships. 
                            (Betty shakes her head and 
                            waves for another drink)
                        All I think, is it’s a personal 
                        thing. I mean, abortion on demand, 
                        wholesale? I’m sorry, but I simply 
                        don’t agree.

                                 BETTY
                        Neither do I... I think it should 
                        be free.

           The women are shocked.

                                 MAJORIE
                        Betty! You’re a liberal...

           The women are interrupted by BOB HOPE swooping down on Betty.

                                 BOB HOPE
                        Excuse me ladies, but whilst her 
                        husband is otherwise engaged, I’m 
                        going to cash in my chips and take 
                        this young lady for a spin.

           The women titter in delight. Betty takes Bob’s hand and whisks 
           him to the dance floor.

                                 BETTY
                        As ever, your timing is 
                        impeccable.

                                 BOB HOPE
                        Betty, you’re too much fun for the 
                        stiffs, you know that?

                                 BETTY
                        They’re well meaning enough and I 
                        like Pat. Most of the time.  

           Across the room, Gerald watches Betty laugh with Bob as 
           they dance.
                                 HENRY KISSINGER
                        All I’m saying Jerry, is that it’s 
                        better to be prepared.

                                 GERALD
                        He’s not guilty, Henry.

                                 HENRY KISSINGER
                        Hey, look. Did he? Didn’t he? Many 
                        did far worse and I am sure many a 
                        president to come will too. But he 
                        may have been caught, and I just 
                        think it’s best to be smart and 
                        prepare for the call, is all. 

                                 GERALD
                        I promised Betty we’d retire... 
                        She’s exhausted. 

                                 HENRY KISSINGER
                        You must be the only politician 
                        who’d willingly swap the Oval 
                        Office for the golf course. You 
                        know how many in here would kill 
                        to be in your position right now?

                                 GERALD
                        That’s what I’m afraid of.

                                 HENRY KISSINGER
                        Listen...

                                 GERALD
                        Later, Henry. Not the time 
                        or place. 

           Gerald leaves Henry, and cuts in on Betty and Bob.

                                 GERALD
                        You mind, Bob?

                                 BOB HOPE
                        That’s my cue anyhow.

           He kisses Betty’s hand and goes to the stage.

           Gerald and Betty dance - she’s fairly drunk.

                                 GERALD
                        Time to go?

                                 BETTY
                        I want to stay for Bob.
                                 GERALD
                        I thought you didn’t want a 
                        late night?

                                 BETTY
                        I’m having fun now.

           A COMPERE on stage--

                                 COMPERE 
                        Ladies and gentlemen, it is my 
                        pleasure to introduce the man 
                        you’ve all been waiting for - Mr 
                        Bob Hope!

           Bob takes the microphone.

                                 BOB HOPE
                        Thank you, thank you. Hey - you 
                        ever heard the one about the bus 
                        full of politicians? Not one of 
                        them could get a seat...

           A drumroll for the joke and laughter. Betty’s drunk face grins 
           broadly as the crowd laugh around her.

           INT. THE FORD HOME, ALEXANDRIA SUBURBS - EVENING

           August 8th 1974 - FIVE MONTHS LATER.

           Betty’s bustling about in the kitchen. Gerald shifts nervously 
           as he watches her pull a steaming lasagne from the oven.

                                 BETTY
                        Make yourself useful, Jerry - help 
                        me put this on the table.

           But instead Gerald checks his watch, distracted.

                                 BETTY
                        Jerry - the mat?

                                 GERALD
                        Sorry, of course.

           He hurries over and helps her safely set the lasagne down.

                                 GERALD
                        That smells fantastic, mother.

                                 BETTY
                        Can you call Susan down?

           Gerald heads to the stairs to call up --
                                 GERALD
                        Susan? Susan!

                                 SUSAN (O.S.)
                        Coming!

           Betty starts putting out the salad, but Gerald takes it from 
           her and leads her out to intercept their seventeen-year-old 
           daughter SUSAN --

                                 BETTY
                        Is everything alright?

                                 GERALD
                        Can I bring you into the living 
                        room for a moment?

           He snaps on the TV. President RICHARD NIXON’s face appears in 
           startling closeup --

                                 RICHARD NIXON (ON SCREEN)
                        ...our entire focus should be on 
                        the great issues of peace abroad 
                        and prosperity without inflation 
                        at home.

           Susan turns away, bored already. But then she freezes as Nixon 
           continues --

                                 RICHARD NIXON (ON SCREEN)
                        Therefore, I shall resign the 
                        presidency effective at noon 
                        tomorrow. Vice President Ford will 
                        be sworn in as president at that 
                        hour in this office.

           Betty stares at her husband, his face lit by the flickering 
           screen. She sits down, the blood drained from her face.

                                 RICHARD NIXON (ON SCREEN)
                        As I recall the high hopes for 
                        America with which we began this 
                        second term --

           Gerald switches it off.

                                 BETTY
                        He actually did it.

                                 GERALD
                        It seems that way.

           They all look at each other for a long moment...
                                 BETTY
                        What do we do?

           Then the phone rings. And keeps on ringing.

                                 BETTY
                        Well.

           Betty takes a moment, hovering over the handset, to get into 
           the right gear for this. She picks it up, listens, gives it to 
           Gerald, and then turns to her daughter --

                                 BETTY
                        We need to pick out a dress.

           In the background, Gerald is making a statement on the phone --

                                 GERALD
                        I think the president has made one 
                        of the greatest personal 
                        sacrifices for the country, and on 
                        behalf of all us Americans...

           There’s a knock at the front door and Nancy Howe hurries in, 
           followed by several burly secret service men.

                                 BETTY
                        Oh, just come on in then, why 
                        don’t you?

                                 SUSAN
                        Do I really need to be there?

                                 BETTY
                        I’m afraid we all do.

           Gerald hands her the phone --

                                 GERALD
                        They need to speak to you.

                                 BETTY (INTO PHONE)
                        Hello?... My children? They’re all 
                        over the place...

           INT. BEDROOM, STEVEN FORD’S HOUSE, WASHINGTON - NIGHT

           STEVEN FORD jolts out of sleep - woken by a sustained thumping 
           on the front door.
           EXT. STREET, BOSTON - NIGHT

           A U-Haul truck pulls onto a driveway. MIKE and GAYLE FORD climb 
           out. They stretch and rub their tired eyes.

           A pair of headlights come on across the street and two secret 
           service men approach. After a brief explanation, Gayle’s 
           shoulders droop and Mike is handed a set of plane tickets.

           EXT. YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - EARLY MORNING

           JACK FORD is in a ranger uniform riding a horse. His steed 
           bucks as a helicopter lands nearby. A secret service man hops 
           out and, after a brief explanation, takes the horse while Jack 
           climbs into the chopper.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - MORNING

           Betty is waiting at the large internal doors to the executive 
           mansion. A dozen STAFFERS are standing stiffly around, waiting 
           for an AIDE who is listening to someone on the phone. Finally, 
           he puts the receiver down and opens the doors for Betty.

           Betty steps into an impressive hall. As the doors close behind 
           her, she feels very small.

           She can hear high-heels clicking on the floor. Pat Nixon 
           emerges from a bedroom and approaches Betty.

           Pat wavers, then collapses into a chair, sobbing.

           Betty hurries down the long corridor to her.

                                 BETTY
                        Oh Pat, I’m so sorry.

           Betty crouches to hug Pat warmly.

                                 BETTY
                        I don’t need a tour. Why don’t we 
                        just have some tea?

           Pat nods and wipes her eyes.

           YELLOW OVAL ROOM

           Betty and Pat sit on very upright uncomfortable chairs. Betty 
           looks around - the room is fastidiously decorated in stuffy 
           formal style - lots of stripes and dark wooden arms and legs. 
           She notices two Greek goddesses holding up a bowl.
                                 BETTY
                        Look at us - taking tea while our 
                        husbands do the politics. How 
                        louche.

           Pat allows herself a smile.

                                 PAT NIXON
                        We just have to pray that they get 
                        it right, don’t we?

                                 BETTY
                        I’ve got a knot in my stomach... 
                        Shall we have a proper drink?

                                 PAT
                        Good idea.

           They put their tea aside and Betty follows Pat through into a 
           kitchen where Pat sets about fixing them strong margaritas.

                                 PAT NIXON
                        I suppose it will be a relief, to 
                        have a change of pace.

                                 BETTY
                        A few months ago, I would have put 
                        money on us getting to California 
                        before you. I’ve found a house.

                                 PAT NIXON
                        Where?

                                 BETTY
                        Rancho Mirage, just outside Palm 
                        Springs. I’m picking out the 
                        wallpaper in my head.

                                 PAT NIXON
                        Speaking of which, promise me as 
                        soon as you get in here, you’ll 
                        change the wallpaper in the dining 
                        room? You’ll see why.

           Betty takes a slug of her drink. Pat stares into the bottom of 
           her own glass.  

                                 BETTY
                        You didn’t deserve this, Pat. 

           Pat puts her drink down and covers her face with shaky hands.  

                                 BETTY
                        Hey? Come on.
           Pat sniffs and wipes her eyes. 

                                 PAT
                        It’s just, I’ve worked so hard for 
                        him. I’ve given him every piece of 
                        me. And he’s thrown it away. 
                        Without even thinking of me. He’s 
                        barely even looked at me. 

           Betty reaches across the counter and takes her hand. 

                                 PAT
                        I don’t know who I am. What I 
                        thought I knew has turned to dust 
                        inside my head. 

           She withdraws her hand and takes a large gulp of her drink. 

                                 PAT
                        This is strong...

           Betty stares at her - scared for her own future. She picks up 
           her drink and the two women knock them back.

           INT. THE EAST ROOM, WHITE HOUSE - MIDDAY

           Betty and Gerald walk down the long room. Two hundred people 
           have gathered, all clapping. Betty sees some of the crowd 
           smiling, some wiping wet swollen eyes.

           Betty smiles and steels herself to keep going. Beside her, 
           Gerald is nervously looking ahead, grim-faced.

           As they reach the podium, a military aide takes Betty’s arm, 
           guides her to behind the lectern and hands her a bible. Gerald 
           stands to the left of the lectern, and CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN 
           BURGER faces him.

           She looks up at all the emotional faces, the clapping hands, 
           and convinces herself to smile.

           She shifts stiffly as her husband puts his left hand on 
           her bible.

                                 CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN BURGER
                        Mr Vice President, are you 
                        prepared to take the oath of 
                        office of the President of the 
                        United States?

           Gerald awkwardly raises his right hand. Then he falters, 
           realizing he’s too early.
                                 GERALD
                        I am, sir.

           Betty is now sitting in a golden chair at the side of the 
           stage, watching Gerald making his speech from the podium --

                                 GERALD
                        My dear friends, my fellow 
                        Americans...

           Betty glances at the news cameras recording her every move, and 
           we watch as she runs through a series of micro-expressions, 
           until she finally fixes on one she hopes looks natural.

                                 GERALD (O.S.)
                        I assume the presidency under 
                        extraordinary circumstances never 
                        before experienced by Americans. 
                        This is an hour of history that 
                        troubles our minds and hurts our 
                        hearts...

           Betty gazes up at her husband, enjoying the comforting tone of 
           his voice, and the words fade out as the booze from earlier 
           washes over her. Until she becomes aware that her eyes are 
           flagging and she jolts herself awake. Gerald’s still talking --

                                 GERALD
                        You have not chosen me by secret 
                        ballot, neither have I gained 
                        office by any secret promises.

           Betty notices her four children in the audience and locks eyes 
           with Susan. Susan, seeing that her mother looks like a cat 
           caught in headlights, winks at her. Betty smiles at this, and 
           directs it encouragingly at her husband.

                                 GERALD
                        I have not campaigned either for 
                        the presidency or the vice 
                        presidency. I have not subscribed 
                        to any partisan platform. I am 
                        indebted to no man, and only to 
                        one woman – my dear wife –

           And Betty is suddenly very aware again that she’s being watched 
           by millions of people. She shifts, smiles self-consciously, as 
           Gerald’s voice quivers.

                                 GERALD
                        - as I begin this very difficult 
                        job. I have not sought this 
                        enormous responsibility, but I 
                        will not shirk it.
           INT. PRESIDENTIAL LIMOUSINE - EVENING

           Betty and Gerald are sitting quietly, holding hands. 
           Shell-shocked.

           Their limousine slows as it pulls up to Crown View Drive. Betty 
           looks out - their quiet residential street has been cordoned 
           off by secret service. Two police officers move the barriers 
           aside to let the vehicle roll through.

           The limo pulls up outside the Fords’ house. Protection officers 
           open the doors and as Gerald and Betty climb out, exhausted, 
           their neighbors emerge to applaud them excitedly.

           Betty wants to go and speak to them, but resigns herself to 
           just waving as the couple are ushered towards the house.

           INSIDE

           They stand and look around at their familiar surroundings.

                                 BETTY
                        I guess the White House is out 
                        here in Alexandria for a few days.

           Their children all appear at the living room door --

                                 SUSAN
                        Mum? We’re hungry.

                                 MIKE
                        We were going to cook, but we 
                        didn’t know when you’d be back.

           Betty mock-rolls her eyes at him and they follow her through to 
           the kitchen where she sets about reheating the lasagne they 
           didn’t eat last night.

                                 BETTY
                        Have you all figured out where 
                        you’re going to sleep?

           INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

           Noise from downstairs wakes Betty. She rolls over - she’s 
           alone. She groggily levers herself out of bed and looks out of 
           the window --

           Down below, Gerald is swimming laps in the pool. Around the 
           garden perimeter, security men are scouring the hedges.
           INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

           Betty comes down in her housecoat, her face carefully made up. 
           She finds Susan doing her homework on the kitchen table, trying 
           to zone out the drilling and hammering from nearby.

           Betty takes in the workmen and security team busy turning their 
           garage into a surveillance room. She enjoys watching a 
           particularly attractive one for a moment, then --

                                 BETTY
                        Do you want me to make 
                        you breakfast?

                                 SUSAN
                        Don’t we get a chef now?

                                 BETTY
                        Not yet, I guess.

           She sets about making eggs on the range.

           BEDROOM

           Betty packs piles of linen into boxes.

           HALLWAY

           Betty empties out a cupboard. Stacks of full boxes lined up 
           along the wall. 

           Betty drops a box and kicks it across the hall, taking out her 
           frustration. She winces - her shoulder hurts.

           LOUNGE

           Betty switches on the TV and mixes herself a martini. Behind 
           her an episode of The Mary Tyler Moore Show starts up - MARY 
           TYLER MOORE driving, then whirling in the street, throwing her 
           hat in the air.

                                 THEME SONG
                        Who can turn the world on with her smile? Who 
                        can take a nothing day, and suddenly make it all 
                        seem worthwhile? Well it’s you girl, and you 
                        should know it, With each glance and every 
                        little movement you show it...

           Betty settles down on the couch to drink her afternoon cocktail 
           with a Valium and watch Mary Tyler Moore go about her business.
           EXT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

           As their cavalcade of limos approaches the White House, Betty 
           looks out at the iconic building that will now be her home.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

           Betty and Gerald are being led down a corridor by the elegant 
           grey-haired head usher, REX SCOUTEN.

                                 REX SCOUTEN
                        And when we pass through these 
                        doors, we will be in the Executive 
                        Mansion. As you know, this forms 
                        the most familiar part of the 
                        visage, and connects the East Wing 
                        to the West Wing.

                                 BETTY
                        Who decided to call it the 
                        Executive Mansion?

                                 REX SCOUTEN
                        I think it’s always been 
                        called that.

                                 BETTY
                        I can’t live in a mansion.

                                 GERALD
                        I think we can call it whatever 
                        we like.

                                 BETTY
                        It’s just our residence, so...

                                 REX SCOUTEN
                        The Executive Residence it is, 
                        then. Welcome home.

           They reach the doors, and Rex opens them to reveal their 
           sumptuous new home.

           Betty looks at the paintings of previous presidents as 
           photographer DAVID KENNERLY buzzes around capturing the moment.

                                 REX SCOUTEN
                        Your belongings have been unpacked 
                        in your respective rooms.

                                 BETTY
                        Respective rooms?
                                 REX SCOUTEN
                        I think they would be a good place 
                        to start.

           Rex breezes down the corridor. Betty follows, glancing into the 
           various rooms as she hurries past.

           Rex opens a door to reveal a large gaudily-decorated bedroom --

                                 REX SCOUTEN
                        This serves as the first lady’s 
                        bedroom, and the president 
                        sleeps...

           He opens a door to reveal a smaller adjoining room, with 
           Gerald’s exercise bike and favorite blue leather chair sitting 
           either side of the bed.

                                 REX SCOUTEN
                        In his room.

                                 BETTY
                        I can’t sleep in a different room 
                        from Jerry.

                                 REX SCOUTEN
                        I believe the thinking is that the 
                        president is likely to keep quite 
                        unsociable hours and you would 
                        both be more comfortable this way.

                                 BETTY
                        Well, I like to have Jerry in 
                        my bed.

                                 GERALD
                        Yes. Can we take the bed out of 
                        the other room and make it a 
                        sitting room? We can put the TV in 
                        there. And can we...
                            (gesturing the decoration)
                        Change this up a bit?

                                 REX SCOUTEN
                        Of course, Mr President. These 
                        rooms are yours to do as you see 
                        fit. The Nixons had quite... 
                        particular taste.

           Betty raises her eyebrows at Pat’s taste as she and Gerald look 
           around, trying to imagine living in this room. Betty sits on 
           the bed. Rex waits, awkwardly.
                                 GERALD
                        Thank you, Rex. Could we have a 
                        few minutes to settle in?

           Rex lets himself out, closing the door behind him.

           Betty throws herself back on the bed, cackling.

                                 BETTY
                        I wonder how many presidents have 
                        made out in this bed?

                                 GERALD
                        I can’t see Dick chasing Pat 
                        around this room.

                                 BETTY
                        I think it needs to be a priority 
                        of your presidency to break that 
                        dry spell.

           She pulls Gerald down onto the bed with her and they kiss.

           INT. EXECUTIVE RESIDENCE - DAY

           Betty watches as men in suits herd Gerald down the corridor and 
           out. The door closes behind them.

           And now Betty is alone in her new home. It’s 
           surprisingly quiet.

                                 BETTY
                        Hello?

           No response. She wanders through the huge rooms, feeling lost 
           and small under the high ceilings.

           In the dining room, she notices the walls are papered with a 
           historical wallpaper depicting scenes from the Revolutionary 
           War - she shivers as she looks closely at the soldiers dying.

           She walks into the kitchen and relaxes, running her hands over 
           the work surfaces.

           She hears someone moving around nearby and hurries into a 
           bedroom, where a MAID is making an impressive four-poster bed. 
           The maid looks up in shock at being caught in the act --

                                 BETTY
                        I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to 
                        startle you.

           The maid just shakes her head and scurries towards the door.
                                 BETTY
                        Excuse me, what room is this?

                                 MAID
                        It’s the Lincoln Bedroom, 
                        Mrs Ford.

                                 BETTY
                        Thank you...

           But the maid has gone. Betty frowns. She sits on the bed. 
           Lincoln’s bed.

           INT. BEDROOM, NAVAL HOSPITAL - EARLY MORNING

           1978. Betty blearily forces her eyes open as an alarm clock 
           jangles nearby. She pulls the covers over her head. Linda 
           touches her shoulder.

                                 LINDA
                        Come on now.

           Hearing Linda in the shower, Betty drags herself upright and 
           sits on the side of the bed. She looks like hell. She clutches 
           her body to stop herself from shaking.

           BATHROOM

           Betty is being sick into the toilet. An authoritative male 
           voice calls from the corridor --

                                 NAVAL DOCTOR (O.S.)
                        Muster!

           Betty flushes the toilet and wipes her mouth.

           COURTYARD

           Betty stands in a row of patients as an officer does the 
           roll call.

           CORRIDOR

           Betty lacklusterly mops a floor. Another PATIENT, a large 
           seaman, offers her an apple --

                                 PATIENT
                        You didn’t make it to breakfast. 
                        For the nausea.

           Betty puts it in her pocket.
           THERAPY ROOM

           Betty is in a one-on-one with a NAVAL THERAPIST. They stare at 
           each other, her eyes shielded by large sunglasses.

                                 NAVAL THERAPIST
                        I wonder whether you would take 
                        your glasses off, Betty?

                                 BETTY
                        I’m very sensitive to the light 
                        right now. 

           The therapist draws the blinds over the window.

                                 NAVAL THERAPIST
                        It’s hard to talk to someone if 
                        you can’t see their eyes. But I’m 
                        sure there’s no need to tell you 
                        that?

                                 BETTY
                        ... No. 

           She slowly removes the glasses and folds them very carefully. 

                                 NAVAL THERAPIST
                        That’s better. I imagine the last 
                        few years have been tremendously 
                        pressured. 

                                 BETTY
                        You don’t expect me to talk about 
                        all of that, do you?

                                 NAVAL THERAPIST
                        Would that be so bad? 

                                 BETTY
                        Of course not. But it would be 
                        impossible. 

                                 NAVAL THERAPIST
                        Why?

                                 BETTY
                        Because, with all due respect, 
                        trying to make someone like you 
                        understand all that’s happened 
                        would take far longer than my 
                        family can afford to pay for.

                                 NAVAL THERAPIST
                        Someone like me?
                                 BETTY
                        Normal... Ordinary. 

                                 NAVAL THERAPIST
                        ... And you see yourself as 
                        extraordinary?

                                 BETTY
                        You’re putting words into 
                        my mouth.

           Betty stares into the distance for a long while. She fights 
           herself and makes the decision to invest in this process. 

                                 BETTY
                        I was an ordinary woman who was 
                        called on stage at an 
                        extraordinary time. 

           Betty’s face is tortured. She takes a sharp intake of breath. 

                                 NAVAL THERAPIST
                        And that required great courage? 

                                 BETTY
                        Yes. 

                                 NAVAL THERAPIST
                        And a great deal of struggle?

           Betty can’t speak. She nods. 

                                 NAVAL THERAPIST
                        I’m going to open the blinds now. 
                        Is that ok?

           Light floods the room and Betty’s face. 

           INT. WEST WING - DAY

           1974. Betty and Sheila sit in a meeting room in the White 
           House. Cheney is pacing the room, while his own secretary takes 
           furiously fast notes in the corner.

                                 CHENEY
                        I just need to know at this stage 
                        what you are. 

                                 BETTY
                        What I am? 
                                 CHENEY
                        Interests, hobbies, campaigns to 
                        support, charities... Children? 
                        Animals?..

                                 BETTY
                        Yes. 

           The secretary scribbles. 

                                 CHENEY
                        Which one?

                                 BETTY
                        Well, I have children and animals 
                        so I suppose I have a vested 
                        interest in both, Mr Cheney. 

           Sheila suppresses a smile. Betty looks to her. 

                                 BETTY
                        This is moving a little fast. I 
                        need to apply some thought and 
                        make choices depending on how I...

                                 CHENEY
                        With all due respect, Mrs Ford, 
                        this is an... unusual situation. I 
                        need to get ahead of this now so 
                        that we can reassure the American 
                        people that the new president and 
                        his wife are committed to engaging 
                        with the work that was established 
                        by the previous office. 

           His dismissive use of the word wife has rankled Betty. 

                                 BETTY
                        I want to support women’s rights.  

           Dick’s secretary scribbles. 

                                 CHENEY
                        ... Ok. We can ease you in. Let’s 
                        take a look at what Mrs Nixon has 
                        left uncovered and start there. 

                                 BETTY
                        Pat is a friend, but she and I 
                        hold some difference in views. 

           The secretary stops scribbling and looks up. 
                                 CHENEY
                        ... Are you a liberal, Mrs Ford?

                                 BETTY
                        I don’t know what that word really 
                        means these days, Mr Cheney. 

                                 CHENEY
                        You don’t?

                                 BETTY
                        To be honest, I never considered 
                        myself all that political. 
                            (she winks at the secretary)
                        But now that I’m here, I suppose 
                        I’m starting to re-consider that. 

                                 CHENEY
                        Mrs Ford... Betty. Do you mind?

           Betty waves him on and he sits in front of her. 

                                 CHENEY
                        Betty, we’re in... troubling 
                        times. The country needs 
                        stability. And your husband should 
                        be able to give the people that. 
                        They can trust him. But they and 
                        he also need to trust you... Right 
                        now, we - the Republican Party - 
                        can’t be seen to be promoting or 
                        supporting any causes that may 
                        threaten that trust. Do you 
                        understand what I mean, Betty?

                                 BETTY
                        Yes, I understand, Dick. You’ve 
                        explained yourself very clearly. 

                                 CHENEY
                        Good. Good. Well, let me take a 
                        look at some specific campaigns 
                        that I think will benefit us and 
                        I’ll get back to you... Thank you 
                        for your time. 

           Betty smiles politely as he heads for the door. 

                                 CHENEY
                        June?

           Betty watches as his secretary hustles out after him, then 
           turns to Sheila -- 
                                 BETTY
                        Can you get me the lists of Pat’s 
                        responsibilities and commitments? 
                        I don’t want to wait for him.

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        Of course. Do you want me to bring 
                        you her ERA contacts?

                                 BETTY
                        ... Just the commitments for now. 
                        Thanks Sheila.  

           Sheila leaves looking disappointed. Betty takes in the large, 
           empty meeting room - it feels incredibly lonely.

           CORRIDOR

           Betty hurries to intercept a BUTLER -- 

                                 BETTY
                        May I?

           The butler looks confused as she reaches to take his coffee 
           tray. He looks to his MANAGER who has bustled up. 

                                 MANAGER
                        Is there a problem, Mrs Ford?

                                 BETTY
                        Betty, please. No problem. Just 
                        taking my husband some coffee.

           She takes the tray with a smile. The manager goes to speak, but 
           too late, as Betty knocks on a door and sweeps into -- 

           THE OVAL OFFICE

           Gerald is at his desk looking mildly harassed by his chief of 
           staff, DONALD RUMSFELD.

           Director of communications GERALD WARREN is smoking on the 
           sofa, Kissinger is leaning against the wall, also smoking, and 
           advisor DAVID GURGEN is making notes in an armchair.

           All the men look up - confused at Betty’s entrance.  

                                 BETTY
                        Coffee, gentlemen. 

           Dick Cheney sidles into the room - also surprised to see Betty. 
           She sets the coffee tray on her husband’s desk and goes over to 
           a bay window - tries to open it. 

                                 BETTY
                        Goodness, what a fug.

                                 GERALD
                        Mother...

           She calls to a security guard stationed outside the window --

                                 BETTY
                        Can you get this open please? 

           The security guard looks baffled, but opens it slightly. 

                                 BETTY
                        Thank you. 

                                 CHENEY
                        Did I forget something, Mrs Ford?

                                 BETTY
                        What? Oh no. Not at all. Please. 
                        Carry on. 

           She starts pouring coffee. The men all look to Gerald, who is 
           trying to cover his amusement. 

                                 GERALD
                        It’s fine. 

           Betty hands out the coffee cups - making rather a song and 
           dance about it. 

                                 KISSINGER
                        I’m only expressing what needs to 
                        be said, Mr President. It was 
                        spoken of as a... motivation for 
                        his acceptance of resignation. 

                                 BETTY
                            (to Rumsfeld)
                        Milk?

                                 RUMSFELD
                        Oh. No. No, thank you.

                                 WARREN
                        Mr President, we have to tread 
                        more carefully than ever. If you 
                        make a decision to run in ‘76...

           At this Betty looks to Gerald but he avoids her gaze.
                                 WARREN
                        Following this line is liable to 
                        derail your popularity with the 
                        electorate.

                                 KISSINGER
                        Look, these aren’t my suggestions. 
                        And I’m not forcing one opinion 
                        over another. The staff members 
                        who feel this is the most 
                        appropriate route...

           He tails off to look at Betty. Clears his throat. Betty sips at 
           her own coffee. He shifts uncomfortably. Rumsfeld steps in --

                                 RUMSFELD
                        I apologize, Mr President, but 
                        this is a highly sensitive and...
                            (looking at Betty)
                        confidential matter. 

           Gerald sighs. He would rather not have to ask Betty to leave. 

                                 GERALD
                        Mother. Betty... I’m sorry but I’m 
                        going to have to ask you to leave 
                        us to this.

           Betty is embarrassed - she has made a fool of herself. 

                                 BETTY
                        Oh. Yes, of course... I don’t know 
                        what I was thinking. Gentlemen, my 
                        apologies. 

           The men smile awkwardly. She puts down her coffee cup, spilling 
           it slightly. Cheney tuts at her clumsiness.

                                 BETTY
                        I have a lot to be getting on 
                        with. NBC are wanting to come in 
                        to see my redecoration plans...

                                 GERALD
                        That sounds like it will keep you 
                        well occupied. 

           Betty looks at him - hurt. 

                                 CHENEY
                        And it’s probably for the best. 
                        The East Wing needs its first 
                        lady. 
           There is an awkward pause. Betty doesn’t look at Gerald as 
           she leaves. 

                                 RUMSFELD
                        Thank you for the coffee. 

           He blushes as the others stare at him. 

           Betty closes the doors behind her. The flotilla of staff who 
           were waiting on her exit jump back into action guiltily. 

           Betty catches her breath - humiliated.

           She notices the staffers glancing at her and forces a smile. 
           She hears Rock The Boat by The Hues Corporation emanating from 
           a radio in an office and strides towards it.

           As she looks in, the staffers in the office look up guiltily - 
           busted. But Betty winks at them and turns it up.

           She does The Bump in the doorway to the staffers’ astonishment, 
           before heading off down the corridor.

           As she walks away, we see that her face is absolutely stricken.

           Rock The Boat continues over the following --

           MONTAGE --

           Betty climbs out of a limo and waves to the crowd, beaming.

           Betty is in a town hall at a formal dinner, happily chatting. 
           Drinking liberally.

           Betty climbs out of her limo, makes her way down a line of 
           female army volunteers, shaking hands, chatting warmly. She 
           borrows one of their hats and the press eagerly snap photos.

           Betty greets guests to a White House soirée. The consummate 
           host. She laughs uproariously as Bob Hope entertains the room.

           Betty larks about with the HARLEM GLOBETROTTERS - they’re 
           teaching her to dribble the basketball in a corridor, Betty 
           squealing with laughter as she loses control of the ball. They 
           all stop guiltily as Rumsfeld erupts furiously through a door.

           At another state function, Betty turns from talking to the 
           Japanese Prime Minister to see Gerald chatting with singer 
           VIKKI CARR, who’s in a very low-cut dress. Betty frowns as 
           Gerald kisses Vikki on the forehead.

           Betty dances happily amongst her guests as PEARL BAILEY 
           performs for them. 
           Afterwards, Betty and Pearl drink, smoke and laugh together. A 
           drunk Betty falls off her chair. Gerald, fuming, leads her out 
           of the room.

           Alone in her room, Betty knocks back pills, more pills, 
           collapses onto the bed in agony. Wakes in the armchair with an 
           empty bottle of gin beside her.

           A hungover Betty sweeps through the Yellow Oval Room and 
           balances a cigarette between the fingers of the Greek goddess.

           INT. BATHROOM, EXECUTIVE RESIDENCE - DAY

           Rock The Boat stops abruptly as Betty hunches over the sink, 
           silently retching. She jumps at a tap on the door.

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD (O.S.)
                        Betty? It’s time to go down 
                        to them.

                                 BETTY
                        Ok, I’m just... I’m... coming now.

           Betty opens the door to reveal Sheila and Nancy --

                                 NANCY HOWE
                        We can reschedule this if you 
                        like. We could do a smaller one 
                        next week?

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        I don’t know...

           Nancy shoots her daggers.

                                 BETTY
                        They’ve come all the way over 
                        here. Give me a moment.

           She waves them both out, then heads to the drinks cabinet and 
           knocks back two fingers of vodka.

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

           Seventy-five reporters are arranged on the lawn. Betty waves to 
           them as she steps up to the bank of microphones.

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        Does anyone have any questions for 
                        the first lady?
                                 MALE REPORTER
                        Will you be a Jackie or a Pat?

                                 BETTY
                        I... Are they the only 
                        two options?

                                 MALE REPORTER 2
                        Or a Marilyn?

                                 BETTY
                        Well, I imagine you know what they 
                        say - you can’t teach an old dog 
                        new tricks. If I try and be anyone 
                        else, I’ll just make a mess of it. 
                        I can’t be changed now... no 
                        matter how much some of the White 
                        House advisors hope I can be.

           The press chuckle, charmed by her straight-forwardness.

                                 MALE REPORTER 3
                        How do you like your new house?

                                 BETTY
                        I really don’t consider it my 
                        house, I consider it the house of 
                        the people of the United States. I 
                        think it’s very beautiful. And I’m 
                        delighted there’s a kitchen on the 
                        third floor so my husband can make 
                        his breakfast.

                                 FEMALE REPORTER
                        He can cook his own breakfast?

                                 BETTY
                        Of course... all he needs is 
                        a toaster!

           Everyone laughs at this.

                                 FEMALE REPORTER 2
                        Where does your husband stand on 
                        equal rights?

                                 BETTY
                        Gerald occasionally makes a remark 
                        when I discuss equal rights, and I 
                        say I remember well that there was 
                        a time when we couldn’t even vote. 
                        So certainly I talk to him 
                        constantly about equal opportunity 
                        and equal pay. 
                                 BETTY
                        And he’s come a long way in his 
                        thinking on it.

                                 BETTY
                        It’s a little early...
                            (glances over at Sheila)

                        liberated woman?

                                 BETTY
                        I think, somebody who is really 
                        very confident in themselves and 
                        likes what they are doing. That’s 
                        what I would consider a liberated 
                        woman, whether what they’re doing 
                        is being a housewife - I consider 
                        bringing up children a responsible 
                        job - or a nurse, or even a vice 
                        president... yes, I would like to 
                        see a female vice president soon.

                                 MALE REPORTER
                        Are you trying to influence the 
                        president to choose a woman?

                                 BETTY
                        I think it might be a few years 
                        before we’re ready for that. I 
                        know it’s coming... But I would 
                        like to see my husband put a woman 
                        in his cabinet, and I am sitting 
                        on his shoulder about that.

           As the press erupts in chatter at this, Betty steps past the 
           microphones towards the crowd to shake hands and say hello. She 
           stops in front of the second female reporter.

                                 BETTY
                        Thank you for your questions.

                                 FEMALE REPORTER 2
                        Thank you, Mrs Ford. 
                                 BETTY
                        I feel as though I’ve been asked 
                        everything except how often I 
                        sleep with my husband.

                                 REPORTER
                        What would you have said?

                                 BETTY
                        As often as possible!

           The two women grin at each other, then Betty is escorted away. 
           Nearing the White House, she catches up with Sheila --

                                 BETTY
                        Could you get me those ERA 
                        contacts? And a better desk? A big 
                        one. With a nice chair.

           Sheila nods, pleased.

           WEST WING

           Consternation from Dick Cheney and the Republicans watching her 
           conference on TV --

                                 DICK CHENEY
                        She is going to be trouble.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Betty and Sheila are sitting opposite two slickly-suited men - 
           DOUG BAILEY and JOHN DEARDOURFF - who’re flicking through a 
           slide-show. The current slide has the words EQUAL RIGHTS 
           AMENDMENT emblazoned over a map of the states.

                                 JOHN DEARDOURFF
                        So we just need five more states 
                        to ratify it, then the amendment 
                        can be brought before Congress to 
                        enact.

                                 DOUG BAILEY
                        The thirty-three who’ve come 
                        aboard already were the most 
                        likely to, so convincing those 
                        remaining is quite a challenge.

                                 JOHN DEARDOURFF
                        The general impression is that the 
                        Republican Party is against 
                        passage.
                                 DOUG BAILEY
                        And we get the feeling... we’re 
                        hoping... that you would be 
                        interested in trying to correct 
                        that image?

           Before Betty can speak, Sheila asks --

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        What’s the deadline?

                                 DOUG BAILEY
                        March ‘79, but we feel the sooner 
                        the better.

                                 JOHN DEARDOURFF
                        We can guide you through the most 
                        effective course of action - North 
                        Dakota and Missouri are due to 
                        vote very soon.

                                 DOUG BAILEY
                        We can give you a list of the 
                        ideal people to contact in each 
                        state to express your support.

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        And would Mrs Ford’s lobbying in 
                        any way create a national verses 
                        states’ rights conflict?

                                 DOUG BAILEY
                        Not at all. We’re lobbying for 
                        state passage of a national 
                        amendment to the constitution. 
                        There’s no conflict.

           Betty stands and reaches out to shake their hands.

                                 BETTY
                        Thank you, gentlemen. This has 
                        been very helpful. You know, 
                        looking forward, I believe that I 
                        will hold the ERA as a measure of 
                        how successful I have been as 
                        first lady.

           She heads out, leaving Sheila to deal with the details. The two 
           men grin at each other. Sheila also looks very happy about this 
           - something to dig her teeth into.
           INT. EAST WING - DAY

           Betty is on the phone, as Sheila and Nancy work at desks 
           nearby. Gerald comes in and hovers nearby --

                                 BETTY (INTO PHONE)
                        ...yes, I understand completely. I 
                        think motherhood is swell, but I’m 
                        not so sure mothers shouldn’t have 
                        rights, just like fathers do... 
                        No, Senator, I’m not promoting ‘a 
                        bunch of lesbians’, but equal 
                        rights for all citizens, yes 
                        including lesbians by the way. All 
                        I am hoping is that you will use 
                        some of your considerable 
                        influence to help get the ERA onto 
                        the floor of your House of 
                        Representatives. I’m certain that 
                        once they can all vote on their 
                        consciences, Missouri will join 
                        the wonderful states who have 
                        already ratified. Can I count on 
                        your support?... Well, I’m sorry 
                        to hear that, but you haven’t 
                        heard the last of me. I’ll speak 
                        to you again very soon. Goodbye 
                        Senator.

           She puts down the phone and looks up at her forlorn husband.

                                 BETTY
                        Oh dear.

                                 GERALD
                        No luck for either of us today.

                                 BETTY
                        Come here.
                            (gives him a big warm hug)
                        Let’s see how bad it is.

           He slumps into a chair. She switches on the TV and flicks the 
           channels to find a news program.

                                 GERALD
                        They booed me in Pittsburgh. And 
                        JF resigned.
                                 NEWS REPORTER (ON TV)
                        Outside the conference centre 
                        where President Ford was a 
                        addressing an urban affairs 
                        convention, we spoke to just a few 
                        members of the public with very 
                        strong opinions indeed.

                                 MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC (ON TV)
                        He clearly made a deal with Nixon 
                        - the presidency for a pardon. 
                        It’s a disgrace. He said he was 
                        going to make a break with these 
                        dirty backroom tricks.

                                 MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC 2 (ON TV)
                        You can’t pardon someone who isn’t 
                        guilty. So Nixon’s got off scot 
                        free. That’s not justice. It looks 
                        like one rule for us and one rule 
                        for the rich and powerful.

                                 BETTY
                            (switching it off)
                        It’ll cool down. It has to.

           Gerald unrolls a copy of the New York Times --

                                 GERALD
                        It’s the reporters too. The Times 
                        was on my side until now. Look at 
                        this - a profoundly unwise, 
                        divisive and unjust act has 
                        apparently destroyed my 
                        credibility as a man of judgment, 
                        candor and competence.

                                 BETTY
                        Well, at least you fooled them 
                        into thinking you had competence 
                        in the first place.

           Gerald looks at her sharply and heads for the door.

                                 BETTY
                        Jerry, I was joking.

                                 GERALD
                        You have no idea of the pressure 
                        I’m under, Betty.

           He slams the door, leaving Betty alone.
           INT. PRESIDENTIAL BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Gerald gets into bed. He touches Betty’s shoulder, but she’s 
           passed out, no response.

           INT. EAST WING - MORNING

           Betty is doing paperwork. Nancy stops by her desk --

                                 NANCY HOWE
                        I have to go out for a couple 
                        of hours.

                                 BETTY
                        Want some company?

                                 NANCY HOWE
                        You don’t need to do that.

                                 BETTY
                        Well, doctor’s clinics give me the 
                        heebie jeebies. I’ll distract you.

           INT. PRIVATE CLINIC - DAY

           Betty and Nancy sit in the waiting room. 

                                 BETTY
                        What is the procedure? 

                                 NANCY HOWE
                        A mammogram.

                                 BETTY
                        Can anybody have one? 

                                 NANCY HOWE
                        I think so. If you pay...

           The RECEPTIONIST calls out.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Mrs Howe? You can go in now. 

           Nancy goes in. Betty sidles up to the receptionist. 

                                 BETTY
                        Do you have any leaflets or 
                        information about these mammograms 
                        I can look at? 
                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        The doctor doesn’t like 
                        information lying around.

                                 BETTY
                        Is that right?

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        He says it’s vulgar. 

                                 BETTY
                        Huh.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        But the nurse can talk you through 
                        it all. She has a free slot after 
                        Mrs Howe.

           EXAMINATION ROOM

           Betty steps up to the mammogram machine. A NURSE places her 
           breast in the correct position and starts the procedure. Betty 
           winces at the pain.

           RECEPTION

           Betty finishes getting dressed and heads to the receptionist. 

                                 BETTY
                        Thank you so much for 
                        accommodating me. 

           A DOCTOR comes out of his office, a concerned look on his face.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Mrs Ford?

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Betty is in bed. Her upper body is heavily bandaged and she 
           winces as Gerald and the nurses help her sit upright. 

                                 GERALD
                        Are you sure you’re ready? 

                                 BETTY
                        I want no cover ups in the Ford 
                        administration. Imagine. If Nancy 
                        hadn’t of been going, I would 
                        never have gone. 
                                 BETTY
                        I’ve lost a breast - I want to 
                        make that count, Jerry.

           She does up the buttons on her pink housecoat as Sheila goes to 
           open the door. 

                                 BETTY
                        Wait! Mirror...

           She checks her hair - gives it a fluff. 

                                 BETTY
                        Alright. 

           Sheila opens the door and waves David Kennerly in.

                                 BETTY
                        Hello David.

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        Wait a minute, please. 

                                 BETTY
                        Gerald, hold my hand. 

           Gerald does so. Betty smiles at him. David clicks away. 

           Sheila hands Betty a large dossier covered in names. Betty 
           looks at her quizzically. 

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        It’s a petition in support of 
                        faster, more aggressive treatment 
                        for womens’ cancers.

                                 BETTY
                        Oh... Very good, Sheila.

           Sheila smiles demurely as David continues to photograph them. 

           INT. WEST WING - DAY

           Staff gather to watch the news on TV in the bullpen. 

                                 NEWS ANCHOR
                        Photos have been released today 
                        from the bedside of First Lady 
                        Betty Ford’s hospital room as she 
                        continues to recover from a 
                        mastectomy operation for breast 
                        cancer. 
           Cheney hovers at the back of the admiring and largely female 
           crowd of staff.

                                 NEWS ANCHOR
                        In official statements, the White 
                        House have said that Mrs Ford is 
                        recovering well and expects to 
                        return to full service as soon as 
                        she is fit. The President and Mrs 
                        Ford are extremely grateful to all 
                        the staff at the Bethesda Hospital 
                        where the surgery as taken place 
                        and for the vigilance of the team 
                        who found Mrs Ford’s cancer during 
                        a routine check. 

           The TV reveals a photo of Betty throwing an American football 
           to a laughing Gerald.

           The White House staff clap - the women with great enthusiasm. 
           Cheney’s face sets into a hard line and he leaves the room.

           INT. PRESIDENTIAL BEDROOM - MORNING

           Betty is getting dressed, a morning martini on the go.

           She looks down at the scar on her chest, runs her fingers over 
           a section that hasn’t quite healed yet. She winces as she puts 
           on her bra and slips her prosthesis in. 

           She stares at herself in the mirror, trying to see whether the 
           prosthesis is obvious. She downs her martini.

           INT. MAIL ROOM, WHITE HOUSE - MORNING

           Nancy and Sheila breeze in, followed by a slightly dazed Betty. 
           She looks around - ten POST WOMEN are sat at a row of tables 
           opening mail and stacking the contents high. Bags and bags of 
           more mail are piled around.

                                 NANCY HOWE
                        You’ve got more than fifty-
                        thousand cards so far.

           Betty looks at some, but her eyesight is fuzzy from the drink.

                                 BETTY
                        Are they good?

           One of the post women rifles through the cards...
                                 POST WOMAN
                        Dearest Mrs Ford, I am writing to 
                        thank you. When you came out, my 
                        mother told me she herself had 
                        been treated. She had to whisper 
                        the word, it is so frightening. 
                        Well, as a result, I asked the 
                        doctor to check me, and I am so 
                        very grateful to you, because it 
                        saved my life. Yours eternally, 
                        Judith Williams.

           She looks up to find that tears are rolling down Betty’s face.

                                 POST WOMAN
                        Oh, I’m sorry. Are you...?

                                 BETTY
                        No, It’s okay, I’m just tired. I’m 
                        very tired. 

           She rifles in her handbag. Sheila guides her out.

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        We need to be getting on anyway.

                                 NANCY HOWE
                        Thank you for all your hard 
                        work, ladies.

           CORRIDOR

           Betty’s found a pill. Nancy looks around --

                                 NANCY HOWE
                        I don’t think we can find 
                        any water...

           Betty puts the pill in her mouth and forces it down dry.

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        We should probably get to the car, 
                        or we’re going to be late.

           They walk through the White House corridors, Nancy 
           supporting Betty.

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        Checkups have increased nationwide 
                        by around 400 percent, and 
                        thousands of dollars have been 
                        donated to the American Cancer 
                        Society. 
                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        I’d like you to do an interview 
                        for 60 Minutes - get your message 
                        out that this is the time for 
                        women to speak up and be honest 
                        with each other.

                                 BETTY
                        On TV? I don’t want everybody to 
                        just be looking at my breasts.

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        You can only do so much behind the 
                        scenes. It’s direct to the 
                        American people that you can have 
                        a real impact.

                                 BETTY
                        I don’t think I want 
                        the publicity.

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        Mrs Rockefeller’s going in for a 
                        mammogram at the end of the week.

                                 BETTY
                        ... I’d like to answer Judith 
                        Williams myself. Could you try and 
                        get hold of her card for me?

           They’re outside now, and climbing into a limo.

           EXT. POOL, FORT LAUDERDALE - DAY

           Betty and Sheila are relaxing with cocktails. Rumsfeld saunters 
           over to fix himself a drink and notices the huge ERA pin on 
           Betty’s blouse.

                                 RUMSFELD
                        So, are you going to equalize 
                        things up in the White House too?

                                 BETTY
                        Yes, sir. You’d better watch out!

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        It’ll take a hell of a lot to make 
                        it equal - I’ve only got three 
                        people in my department, and I’ve 
                        been fighting for months to get my 
                        own briefing box.
                                 RUMSFELD
                        The East Wing is actually outside 
                        of the White House. And quite 
                        frankly, I hope it stays that way. 
                        The fewer staff you have, the less 
                        damage you can all do over there.

           Sheila can see Betty is starting to fume.

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        If you could just give me one more 
                        staff member, it would go a long 
                        way to ensuring we’re on top of 
                        everything.

                                 BETTY
                        ... Why don’t you race us for it?

                                 RUMSFELD
                        What?

           Betty nods to the empty pool.

                                 BETTY
                        You’re both in bathing suits. If 
                        Sheila wins, you assign us one of 
                        your forty-five staff people.

           Rumsfeld looks at Sheila’s tiny frame and laughs. 

                                 RUMSFELD
                        Sure... Sure.

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        Yeah! Really, let’s race. I 
                        promise if I lose, you will have 
                        proven your superiority and I’ll 
                        never mention it again.

           Sheila puts her goggles on and people nearby have noticed the 
           challenge. They start to get excited as the two people move to 
           the pool edge.

                                 BETTY
                        But if you lose, Don, you have to 
                        promise to send someone over... 
                        And no deadweight, either.

           Rumsfeld nods. Betty stands by the corner and raises her arm --

                                 BETTY
                        On three... Ready? One, two, 
                        three - GO!

           They dive in. Rumsfeld’s thick body splashing Betty.
           The crowd cheers. Betty yells and claps as Sheila pulls ahead.

           Gerald emerges to see what all the fuss is about.

           Sheila makes a clumsy turn, but she’s way ahead of Rumsfeld...

           Betty is jumping for joy as Sheila touches the end of the pool 
           just as Rumsfeld is turning at the other end. Hearing the 
           cheers and laughter, he gives up.

           Sheila pulls her goggles off in triumph. Betty crouches down 
           to her --

                                 BETTY
                        To hell with it - I’ll do 
                        60 Minutes.

           Sheila grins.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

           Dick Cheney is rushing alongside Sheila as she heads up the 
           stairs to the executive residence --

                                 DICK CHENEY
                        You know, there’s a general 
                        feeling that first ladies should 
                        be seen and not heard...

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        Christ, Dick. You really are a 
                        caveman, you know that?

                                 DICK CHENEY
                        And right now more than ever. We 
                        need to play it safe. 

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        Is that your view, or the view of 
                        the president?

                                 DICK CHENEY
                        ... the first lady is not an 
                        elected position.

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        Come on, we both know no president 
                        is elected without a wife. And in 
                        this case, you’ve got a wife who 
                        everyone knows all about. They’re 
                        a package. The real deal.
                                 DICK CHENEY
                        White House mail... despite the 
                        general good wishes towards 
                        Betty’s health, are running three 
                        to one against her ERA lobbying.

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        Well, then I suggest they vote the 
                        Fords out of office.

                                 DICK CHENEY
                        Could you at least guarantee to me 
                        that she won’t directly mention 
                        the ERA?

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        You people really piss me off. You 
                        want her seen and not heard until 
                        you need her to say something one 
                        of your spotty little Yale 
                        speechwriting monkeys has penned 
                        to push your own manipulative and 
                        highly dubious moral agenda. All 
                        for a party who would cut their 
                        noses off to spite their sweaty 
                        faces... 

                                 DICK CHENEY
                        That is...

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        Sweaty - because you all know that 
                        it's her who will get you the 
                        votes. But you don't like that 
                        because those votes come from 
                        people you fundamentally don't 
                        give a shit about. 

                                 DICK CHENEY
                        You’re out of line. 

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        I’m warning you that if you use 
                        her - exhaust her - without 
                        letting her speak her mind and 
                        pursue her own agendas, you’ll be 
                        facing a tidal wave of crap. So. 
                        Be smart for a moment, will you, 
                        and let me get on with my day.

           Sheila pushes through the doors and lets them close in 
           Dick’s face. 

           She pauses to take a deep breath, then approaches the 
           presidential suite.
           She knocks. She can hear voices inside. A panicked Nancy 
           emerges and closes the door behind her.

                                 NANCY HOWE
                        She isn’t doing it.

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        Shit. She can’t not do it - 
                        they’re all set. The lights are 
                        ready, the crew are all waiting. 

                                 NANCY HOWE
                        You try speaking to her.

           Sheila skirts around Nancy and enters Betty’s rooms.

           Betty is sitting at the dressing table with a HAIRDRESSER 
           working on her hair. She is hysterically crying.

           Betty looks around her - shivers - a fog is closing in on her - 
           the room disappearing. She panics and wraps her blanket 
           tighter. Sheila’s face looms out of the fog alarmingly.

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        Betty!

           The room comes back into focus. Sheila kneels beside Betty and 
           takes her hand. Betty snatches it back.

                                 BETTY
                        I’m not doing it. I can't do it. I 
                        don't like this at all.

           Sheila puts a vodka into her hand.

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        They’re here. We’re supposed to be 
                        taping it now. They got here at 
                        six this morning, all the trucks, 
                        all the technicians. They’re all 
                        waiting down there.

                                 BETTY
                        I’m sorry, I just can’t...

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        It’s Morley Safer, you like him. 
                        He’ll be lovely to you. It’ll be 
                        really wonderful.

                                 BETTY
                        I’m not ready.
                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        Your hair’s nearly done. You just 
                        need to shake off this dressing 
                        gown and put on a frock.

           Betty starts crying again.

                                 BETTY
                        I just can’t face it, I don’t want 
                        publicity, them all looking at me.

           Sheila heads towards the door.

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        Alright. I don’t know what I’m 
                        going to say to them, though.

                                 HAIRDRESSER
                        Mrs Ford? Your hair is ready.

           Betty looks her perfectly coiffured hair and pristine make-up 
           in the mirror. 

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        Betty? Please? We’re working so 
                        hard for this. 

           The vodka is taking effect now, and Betty enjoys her glowing 
           reflection - who wouldn't want to see this on TV?

                                 BETTY
                        Okay, I’m going to do it.

           STAIRCASE

           Betty leads the way upwards in a sleek pink dress. She's on a 
           sudden high - her surroundings are warmed by bright sunlight. 
           She seems to be floating, a huge grin on her face.

           She sweeps into the solarium.

                                 BETTY
                        Mr Safer! It’s delightful to meet 
                        you. I’m a huge fan. Jerry and I 
                        watch you every week without fail.

           Betty’s turned on all her charm - she’s bright and upbeat now.

                                 MORLEY SAFER
                        The honor is mine. Please, call 
                        me Morley.
                                 BETTY
                        Shall we go straight into it?

           She plonks herself down on the sofa beside him.

                                 MORLEY SAFER
                        Absolutely.

           A TECHNICIAN rearranges the two microphones between them.

                                 BETTY
                        Well, that’s a big microphone 
                        you’ve got there.

                                 TECHNICIAN
                        All the better to hear you with.

           Betty laughs. The technician gives a thumbs up. Safer looks to 
           the cameraman, who does likewise, then the producer.

                                 MORLEY SAFER
                        ...And we’re rolling. Thank you 
                        for agreeing to talk to me at what 
                        must be a very busy time for you.

           Betty nods and tucks her legs up to turn and face him.

                                 MORLEY SAFER
                        Washington can be awfully tough on 
                        a political wife. What are the 
                        pressures on a woman living in 
                        this town?

                                 BETTY
                        There can be many. It depends on 
                        the size of the family, and the 
                        type of husband you have. Whether 
                        he’s a wanderer or a homebody.

           Sheila, watching warily from the doorway, starts to relax - 
           Betty is upbeat and engaging. 

                                 MORLEY SAFER
                        Did you ever have any doubts about 
                        your husband and some of the 
                        attractions in this city?

                                 BETTY
                        I have perfect faith in my 
                        husband. But I’m always glad to 
                        see him enjoy looking at a pretty 
                        girl. When he stops looking, then 
                        I’ll begin to worry.
           INT. VARIOUS AMERICAN HOMES - EVENING

           We see into a variety of the nation’s living rooms as the 
           interview is broadcast and the public start to react to it.

                                 BETTY (ON TV)
                        And he doesn’t really have time 
                        for outside entertainment - 
                        because I keep him busy.

           The viewers chuckle at this, completely charmed by Betty’s 
           candor and cheekiness.

                                 MORLEY SAFER (ON TV)
                        There was a time in your life here 
                        when you felt that you needed some 
                        help.

                                 BETTY (ON TV)
                        This is true.

                                 MORLEY SAFER (ON TV)
                        Some psychiatric help.

                                 BETTY (ON TV)
                        Yes.

           The nation raises its collective eyebrows.

                                 MORLEY SAFER (ON TV)
                        Was that, do you think, a function 
                        of being in Washington or what? 

                                 BETTY (ON TV)
                        Well, I was advised by the doctor 
                        who was treating me for my 
                        shoulder that perhaps a 
                        psychiatrist could help. And I 
                        found it very helpful, because 
                        apparently I was...

           INT. SOLARIUM, WHITE HOUSE - DAY

           Betty pauses for a moment, considering how much to give away.

                                 BETTY
                        ...I was really giving too much of 
                        myself and not taking any time out 
                        for Betty. It was all going to the 
                        children and my husband. And 
                        consequently, I was a little 
                        beaten down.
                                 MORLEY SAFER
                        It’s almost a rule of political 
                        life, that the higher a man gets 
                        in politics, the less outspoken 
                        his wife becomes. She becomes a 
                        mouse. It seems it’s been just the 
                        opposite with Betty Ford. The 
                        higher your husband’s gotten, the 
                        more really controversial things 
                        have been said.

                                 BETTY
                        But my... what I’ve spoken out on 
                        were issues pertaining to women. 
                        I’m not getting into political 
                        issues that...

                                 MORLEY SAFER
                        Well, the Equal Rights Amendment 
                        is a very hot political issue.

                                 BETTY
                        And we’re going to get to it. I 
                        feel that the ERA ought to pass in 
                        our bicentennial year. What could 
                        be greater to pass than that?

                                 MORLEY SAFER
                        Without wanting to be rude for a 
                        minute, you’ve talked about 
                        liberating women. But surely the 
                        most unliberated woman in this... 
                        in the world, is the wife of the 
                        president of the United States... 
                        in terms of the bonds that tie 
                        her, forgive me, to his shadow?

                                 BETTY
                        I don’t feel unliberated when I’m 
                        sitting here talking to you. You 
                        can ask me any question.

                                 MORLEY SAFER
                        Among the things you have spoken 
                        out about are abortion, which is 
                        kind of a taboo subject for the 
                        wife of the President. It’s one of 
                        the --

                                 BETTY
                        If someone asks a question, you 
                        have to be honest and say exactly 
                        how you feel. 
                                 BETTY
                        And I feel very strongly that it 
                        was the best thing in the world 
                        when the Supreme Court voted to 
                        legalize abortion and, in my 
                        words, bring it out of the 
                        backwoods and put it into the 
                        hospitals where it belonged. I 
                        thought it was a great, great 
                        decision.

           INT. OVAL OFFICE - EVENING

           Betty and Gerald are watching the broadcast, with Cheney and 
           Rumsfeld watching behind them.

                                 MORLEY SAFER (ON TV)
                        You’ve also talked about the young 
                        people living together before 
                        they’re married.

                                 BETTY (ON TV)
                        Well... they are, aren’t they?

                                 MORLEY SAFER (ON TV)
                        Indeed, they are. And what if 
                        Susan Ford came to you and said, 
                        “Mother, I’m having an affair.”

                                 BETTY (ON TV)
                            (does a double-take             
                            at him - really?)
                        Well, I wouldn’t be surprised. I 
                        think she’s a perfectly normal 
                        human being like all young girls, 
                        and I would certainly counsel and 
                        advise her on the subject... She’s 
                        pretty young to start affairs.

           At this, Cheney puts his head in his hands --

                                 CHENEY
                        Oh, please tell me you rowed right 
                        back up this stream?

           Even Gerald is looking worried. Betty feels Cheney’s eyes 
           boring into her hot face.

                        But nevertheless, old enough...

                                 BETTY (ON TV)
                        Oh yes, she’s a big girl.
                                 MORLEY SAFER (ON TV)
                        I mean, would it surprise you 
                        though, given the way you and the 
                        president brought these kids up, 
                        if that happened?

                                 BETTY (ON TV)
                        No, I think there’s a complete 
                        freedom among the young people 
                        now. And in some cases I’m not so 
                        sure that... perhaps there would 
                        be less divorce.

           Gerald throws a cushion at Betty. She’s shocked as it bounces 
           off her.

                                 GERALD
                        Damn it, what have you done?
                            (turns his wrath on Cheney)
                        Didn’t you give her the talking 
                        points? You’re supposed to be 
                        keeping on top of this.

                                 BETTY
                        It’s not his fault. I was just 
                        saying what I felt. Answering the 
                        question honestly.

                                 GERALD
                        And losing me ten million votes in 
                        the progress.

                                 RUMSFELD
                        Closer to twenty or thirty. This 
                        is a fucking disaster.

           Betty shrinks down in her seat, tears springing into her eyes 
           as the men storm out.

                                 BETTY (ON TV)
                        ...and I’m convinced in my own 
                        mind that I’m completely cured.

                                 MORLEY SAFER (ON TV)
                        And how about your back, that 
                        pinched nerve that you did have to 
                        take some...

                                 BETTY (ON TV)
                        Well, that still gives me trouble, 
                        but I’ve had it ten or eleven 
                        years and I don’t expect, you 
                        know... everybody can’t be 
                        perfect. 
                                 BETTY (ON TV)
                        You all have to suffer a little to 
                        appreciate life.

           Betty watches all alone as Morley Safer sums up to camera - 
           looking straight out of the TV at her --

                                 MORLEY SAFER (ON TV)
                        This first lady is not afraid to 
                        speak out, even on the most 
                        controversial of issues. She 
                        handles it all with thoughtfulness 
                        and a sense of purpose - but even 
                        more refreshing - with a sense of 
                        humor. She has a great deal to 
                        say, and when Betty Ford says it, 
                        she sparkles.

           INT. PRESIDENTIAL BEDROOM - DAY

           Betty is huddled in her bed. There’s a soft knock on the door. 
           Sheila slips in and opens the drapes, but Betty winces at the 
           harsh light.

           Sheila closes the drapes and switches on a small lamp instead. 
           She plinks an Alka Seltzer into a glass of water and Betty 
           pushes herself up into a sitting position to accept it.

                                 BETTY
                        I don’t think I can get up today. 

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD 
                        Ok. 

           Betty finishes the seltzer. 

                                 BETTY
                        Do you think it will be a problem?

           Sheila puts the glass away to give herself a moment to respond. 
           When she does, she is delicate.

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        Actually, Rumsfeld thinks it’s 
                        best if you lay low for a while. 
                        The party are in discussions...

                                 BETTY
                            (face in hands)
                        Oh God.

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        Hey. Don’t panic. 
                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        All of this is perfectly normal. 
                        It’s just the dance we have to do. 

                                 BETTY
                        Jerry left this morning without 
                        saying goodbye. 

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        He’s never done that before?

                                 BETTY
                        Not in twenty-five years.

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        ... I’m sure he’s just giving you 
                        some space.

                                 BETTY
                        He’s angry at me. 

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        Look, I know he’s your husband and 
                        you love him, blah, blah. But 
                        Betty. Gerald pardoned Dick Nixon 
                        and he’s going to let your 
                        interview be the problem?

                                 BETTY
                        Cheney said...

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        Forget what Cheney said. God, this 
                        place is literally full of Dicks.

           Betty gives a glimmer of a smile. 

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        That’s better. Listen, take today 
                        and tomorrow and then we’ll go 
                        back out there and show them that 
                        we stick to our guns, ok? 

                                 BETTY
                        Ok.

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        So, you do whatever you need to 
                        get yourself back on your feet.

           As Sheila heads out, she sees Betty staggering over to the 
           drinks cabinet. Sheila’s face sets in a hard line and she shuts 
           the door.
           LATER

           A drunk and high Betty dances clumsily around her bedroom. She 
           downs her drink and stands swaying for a moment, lost in --

           A VIBRANT MEMORY

           18-year-old Betty stands in a dance studio amongst an anxious 
           group of young women waiting to audition.

           Their nervous whispering falls into an intimidated silence as 
           choreographer MARTHA GRAHAM sweeps into the room - her lithe 
           body swathed in black, hair drawn up into a disciplined bun.

           She appraises the room. Betty stands straighter as Martha’s  
           piercing eyes fall on her and examine her form. 

                                 MARTHA
                        First position. 

           The women immediately adopt the balletic position. Martha 
           scrutinizes them.

                                 MARTHA
                        Do something more interesting 
                        with it.

           The women titter - unsure. Betty grins. She adjusts her body 
           into a more striking position.

           Martha looks over Betty’s body. She gives a tiny nod and moves 
           off down the line of women.

           Betty smiles, then catches herself and focusses again.

           LATER

           Betty and the other women wait patiently in the corridor. A 
           dancer emerges from an office and pins a list of names for the 
           Martha Graham Reserve Ensemble on a noticeboard.

           The women jostle each other to see. Most turn away dismayed. 
           Betty pushes her way through and scans for her name...

           She lets out a whoop of delight.

           WHITE HOUSE

           Back in her bedroom, Betty comes to. She drops her glass of 
           drink on the carpet and clutches her drunken head.
           INT. MAIL ROOM, WHITE HOUSE - DAY

           Sheila sifts through a huge pile of post for Betty - she 
           notices words from each letter - disappointed... shame... 
           thought better of you... bad influence...

           INT. WOMEN’S REPUBLICAN CLUB, SAN FRANCISCO - DAY

           Betty is in a row of speakers with a pompous INVIGILATOR.

                                 INVIGILATOR
                        Mrs Reagan, how would you respond 
                        were Patti to come to you and say 
                        she’s thinking of having an 
                        affair?

           NANCY REAGAN glances at Betty pointedly, then turns to the 
           audience of the local Republican Party --

                                 NANCY REAGAN
                        I would not hesitate in forbidding 
                        her. I would tell her to wait for 
                        the sacred bond of marriage. I 
                        want you all to be sure that I am 
                        directly opposed to this new 
                        morality whirling around among the 
                        young people, such as premarital 
                        sexual relations. And I think the 
                        access the young have to abortion 
                        only exacerbates these immoral 
                        tendencies.

           Betty shoots daggers at her.

           An anxious AIDE taps Betty on the shoulder and whispers in her 
           ear. Betty’s face turns ashen. She gets up shakily.

                                 BETTY
                        Excuse me. I’m so sorry... I have 
                        to leave.

           The invigilator follows her --

                                 INVIGILATOR
                        What’s going on?

                                 AIDE
                        Someone tried to shoot 
                        the president.

                                 INVIGILATOR
                        Again?
           EXT. TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE, OUTSIDE SAN FRANCISCO - DAY

           The limo speeds onto the tarmac and stops beside Air Force One.

           As Betty gets out, the president’s security detail run over and 
           hustle everybody towards the plane.

                                 SECRET SERVICE OFFICER
                        As quickly as possible, please, 
                        Mrs Ford. We need to get this bird 
                        in the air.

           Betty hurries up the stairs and through the plane, past a rowdy 
           group of staffers making themselves cocktails. The press are 
           yelling excitedly at Rumsfeld at the other end of the plane.

           Betty barges past Cheney into her husband’s office and into 
           Gerald’s arms. She clutches him tight.

                                 BETTY
                        Thank God.

                                 GERALD
                        I’m ok. Though this time the gun 
                        actually went off. The bullet 
                        bounced off the hotel wall beside 
                        me and hit a taxi-driver in the 
                        groin.

           Betty laughs, clamps her hand over her mouth.

                                 BETTY
                        Oh, God... I’m sorry. That’s 
                        not funny.
                            (she sits back in shock)
                        Thank God she was a poor shot.

           She notices Gerald is shaking. She fixes them both a very 
           stiff drink.

                                 GERALD
                        We’re still going on to Detroit, 
                        but I’m not going to let you join 
                        the march. It’s just too 
                        dangerous.

                                 BETTY
                        What? Gerald, that’s ridiculous. 

                                 GERALD
                        We can’t risk it. 
                                 BETTY
                        But there’ll be thousands of 
                        women there. 

                                 GERALD
                        Exactly!

                                 BETTY
                        What is that supposed to mean?

                                 GERALD
                        Cheney doesn’t think it’s 
                        coincidence that I’ve been 
                        targeted by women, Betty. At a 
                        time when my wife seems to be 
                        encouraging them in protest. 

           Gerald sits down and nurses his drink. 

                                 BETTY
                        How dare you. How dare you dictate 
                        to me where I can go and what I 
                        can do. How dare you suggest that 
                        the very movement that is good and 
                        necessary for this country - the 
                        thing that is increasing your 
                        popularity - is attempting to 
                        destroy it. 

           Gerald gets up to walk away from her. 

                                 GERALD
                        There’s no talking to you when 
                        you’re like this.

           Betty shouts, letting it rip --

                                 BETTY
                        I am your presidency!.. 
                            (Gerald stares in shock)
                        Without me and all the votes I can 
                        bring, you will be nothing. 
                        Without what I'm attempting, there 
                        would be no good in this 
                        administration. 

           Gerald comes very close to her. For once in her life, Betty is 
           intimidated by his size, but she glares up at him regardless. 

                                 GERALD
                        That may be, Betty. Everything you 
                        say may well be true. 
                                 GERALD
                        And you can shout and holler as 
                        much as you like, but you’ll not 
                        be leaving your hotel room to join 
                        that march. And if you do, I will 
                        have every security man in the 
                        building instructed to pick you up 
                        and take you back there. Because I 
                        am the president.

           Gerald stalks out, slamming the door. A furiously shaking Betty 
           throws her glass of whisky after him with a roar.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM, DETROIT - EVENING

           Betty winces as she sits on the edge of the bed - her body is 
           aching. She takes a few pills and rolls under the sheets. She 
           shifts around, trying to get into a position where she can bear 
           the pain. She sighs - gives up and takes a couple of Valium.

           As it kicks in, a broad grin spreads across her face. The room 
           warms up, and she starts to float relaxingly above the bed. She 
           slips into unconsciousness.

           MORNING

           Betty stands in a white dress looking forlornly out of 
           the window --

           In the street below, thousands of women, also all dressed in 
           white, are marching in honor of International Women’s Year, 
           waving ERA placards.

           She sees a group of women waving WE’RE WITH BETTY placards.

           Frustrated, she leaves her hotel room and finds the entourage 
           in another room. She waves at Sheila to join her.

           Shelia comes through into Betty’s room.

                                 BETTY
                        All these people complaining about 
                        60 Minutes, I want to reply to 
                        them in my own words. I don’t 
                        think thank you for writing in is 
                        enough - they need to hear what I 
                        really meant.

           Sheila sits at the desk and pulls out a pad and paper.
                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        Your strength is the personal 
                        touch - why not handwrite one 
                        perfect letter and hope the 
                        recipient will share it with the 
                        press? Let it emerge naturally.

                                 BETTY
                        Oh, Sheila - you're good.

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        I know. So, what do you want to 
                        say to the public?

           But a brain fog has come over Betty --

                                 BETTY
                        I'm not sure...

           LATER

           Betty and Sheila are drinking, tipsy --

                                 BETTY
                        Thank you for writing about my 
                        appearance on “60 Minutes”.

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        The concerns which inspired you to 
                        share your views are appreciated.

                                 BETTY
                        That’s good!.. I wish it were 
                        possible for us to sit down and 
                        talk one to another.

           INT. TEXAN KITCHEN - MORNING

           A middle-aged woman, LORENA CHERALIER, is going through her 
           post. She stops at one with the White House seal on it. She 
           carefully tears it open and starts to read --

                                 LORENA CHERALIER
                        I consider myself a responsible 
                        parent. I know I am a loving one. 
                        We have raised our children in a 
                        home that believes in and 
                        practices the enduring values of 
                        morality and personal integrity. 
                        As every mother and father knows, 
                        these are not easy times to be a 
                        parent...
           INT. ASSOCIATED PRESS OFFICES - DAY

           Several JOURNALISTS are crowded around a xerox of the letter as 
           one reads it out loud --

                                 JOURNALIST
                        Our convictions are continually 
                        being questioned and tested by the 
                        fads and fantasies of the moment. 
                        I believe our values to be eternal 
                        and I hope I have instilled them 
                        in our children. We have come to 
                        this sharing of outlooks through 
                        communication, not coercion...

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

           Cheney is reading the New York Times to Gerald and Rumsfeld --

                                 DONALD RUMSFELD
                        My husband and I have lived 26 
                        years of faithfulness in marriage. 
                        I do not believe in premarital 
                        relationships, but I realize that 
                        many in today’s generation do not 
                        share my views. However, this must 
                        never cause us to withdraw the 
                        love, the counseling, and the 
                        understanding that they may need 
                        now more than ever before... 
                        That's quite a recovery. 

                                 DICK CHENEY
                        It wasn't on my counsel.

                                 GERALD
                        Of course not. She doesn't 
                        need it. 

           INT. MAIL ROOM, WHITE HOUSE - DAY

           Betty and Sheila burst in hopefully - the mail girls have 
           sorted out Betty’s mail into two piles. One of which is huge. 
           Betty looks at them nervously...

                                 BETTY
                        Which one is good?

                                 MAIL GIRL
                        The big one is all good.

           Betty and Sheila high five. Betty squeezes the mail 
           girl’s shoulder.
           INT. EAST WING - DAY

           Betty is happily writing letters when Cheney hurries in.

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        Mr Cheney?

                                 BETTY
                        Hello Dick. Who let you in?

                                 DICK CHENEY
                        Good morning, Mrs Ford.

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        Where’s that staffer I won 
                        off you?

                                 DICK CHENEY
                            (ignoring this)
                        I hear you’ve been invited to 
                        speak at the International Women’s 
                        Conference?

                                 BETTY
                        That’s right.

                                 DICK CHENEY
                        I need to read your speech 
                        in advance.

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        Mrs Ford has seventy percent 
                        approval ratings. She’s more 
                        popular than any president we’ve 
                        ever had.

                                 DICK CHENEY
                        Even so...

           Betty stands and advances on Cheney, forcing him backwards --

                                 BETTY
                        Dick, I am perfectly aware that my 
                        words need to be clear, and my 
                        intention should not be 
                        misinterpreted. So let me practice 
                        now - we will write my words, I 
                        will not give you veto, I will 
                        speak my mind. And you will have 
                        to sit in the audience if you want 
                        to find out what I’m going to say. 
                        Do I make myself clear?
                                 DICK CHENEY
                        I’m not sure the president will be 
                        happy about this.

                                 BETTY
                        Then he can speak to me about 
                        it himself.

           She holds the door open for Cheney to leave.

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

           Betty approaches her waiting limo, a neck-brace visible above 
           her dress’s high neck. She notices her two secret service 
           bodyguards HARTWIG and SARDO are looking sheepish --

                                 BETTY
                        Alright, what’s eating you two?

                                 HARTWIG
                        My girlfriend’s a fan of yours. 
                        And she made this for you --

           He holds up a blue satin flag, trimmed with lace and decorated 
           with red, white and blue stars. Surrounding a large pair of 
           stuffed bloomers are the words DON’T TREAD ON ME - ERA.

           Betty is speechless. She puts her hand on her heart.

                                 SARDO
                        They’re bloomers - for your 
                        maiden name.

           Hartwig looks very proud as they all get into the car. 

           INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY

           As they drive into the outskirts of Cleveland, Ohio, Betty is 
           still admiring the flag.

           INT. BEDROOM, NAVAL HOSPITAL - MORNING

           1978. The alarm goes off in Betty’s bedroom. She levers herself 
           out of bed. She looks healthier than last time we saw her here.

           She puts on the kettle and slips into the bathroom to clean her 
           teeth. She returns to the bedroom as Linda is stirring, pours 
           two cups of tea and sets one on Linda’s bedside table.

                                 NAVAL DOCTOR (O.S.)
                        Muster!
           DINING HALL

           Betty takes toast and a coffee to sit quietly by the window.

           CORRIDOR

           Betty dusts paintings on the wall. She pauses to look at one - 
           a wild depiction of a ship in a storm.

           BEDROOM

           Betty is changing out of her work clothes. Linda walks in and 
           notices Betty slipping her prosthetic breast into one side of 
           her bra.

                                 LINDA
                        I’m sorry. Shall I come back?

           Betty puts her shirt on. 

                                 BETTY
                        It’s fine. I’m used to it. 

           Linda smiles shyly and starts making her bed. Betty sits and 
           watches this quiet woman.

                                 BETTY
                        You don’t talk... In group 
                        sessions. I know it took me a 
                        while to engage - properly I mean 
                        - but you haven’t said one word.  

                                 LINDA
                        ... I didn’t realize there would 
                        be so many. 

                                 BETTY
                        People? 

                                 LINDA
                        Men. 

                                 BETTY
                        Ah. I see.

                                 LINDA
                        All their important stories. Their 
                        fathers. Work. War... I’m just a 
                        housewife. Nothing wrong per se. 
                        No real worries. But I still 
                        drink. All day. Have for years. 

           Linda continues to straighten her bed. Betty takes a punt --
                                 BETTY
                        ... I started drinking in the 
                        mornings after my second child. I 
                        was so tired and Gerald worked so 
                        much, I told myself I deserved it. 
                        A drink before lunch. One with 
                        food, one in the afternoon to help 
                        me nap when the children did. A 
                        glass with neighbors before Gerald 
                        was home for his dinner. Dinner. 
                        And as many as I could fit in with 
                        him in the only hour or two I got 
                        to spend with him. He never 
                        noticed because he only started 
                        when I had already reached my 
                        fifth... There is no name put to 
                        what women feel, I think. So we 
                        just feel shame. I used to stay 
                        quiet in front of men. A good 
                        American girl.

           Betty looks at Linda who is watching her emotionally - pillow 
           clutched in her hands. 

           For Betty it is a breakthrough - an admission of her 
           alcoholism. She looks out of the window at the garden. 

                                 BETTY
                        Men always say what they want, 
                        Linda. Whenever they want. So I 
                        learned there is never any point 
                        in staying quiet - because they 
                        won’t make space for you. You have 
                        to make your own.

           INT. HOTEL CONFERENCE HALL, CLEVELAND, OHIO - MORNING

           1975. We’re back with Betty on stage at the International 
           Women’s Year Conference - the podium decorated with white 
           flowers and venus symbol, the audience lapping up her words -- 

                                 BETTY
                        But it is only a beginning... The 
                        debate over the ERA has become too 
                        emotional, because of the fears of 
                        some - both men and women - about 
                        the changes already taking place 
                        in America.
                        Change by its very nature is 
                        threatening, but it is also often 
                        productive. 
                                 BETTY
                        And the fight of women to become 
                        more productive, accepted human 
                        beings is important to all people 
                        of either sex and whatever 
                        nationality.
                        The long road to equality rests on 
                        achievements of women and men in 
                        altering how women are treated in 
                        every area of everyday life.
                        Freedom for women to be what they 
                        want to be will help complete the 
                        circle of freedom America has been 
                        striving for. As the barriers 
                        against freedom for Americans 
                        because of race or religion have 
                        fallen, the freedom of all has 
                        expanded. The search for human 
                        freedom can never be complete 
                        without freedom for women.
                        By the end of this century, I hope 
                        this nation will be a place where 
                        men and women can freely choose 
                        their life’s work without 
                        restrictions or without ridicule.
                        Let us work to end the laws and 
                        remove the labels that limit the 
                        imagination and the options of men 
                        and women alike.
                        Success will open hearts and minds 
                        to new possibilities for all 
                        people. Much has been done, much 
                        remains, but we must keep moving 
                        on... Thank you, very much.

           The audience rise to their feet and applaud. Betty looks out 
           gratefully. Relieved to have got to the end.

           INT. MEETING ROOM, NAVAL HOSPITAL - DAY

           1978. Betty and Linda sit in group therapy. It’s Betty’s turn. 

                                 BETTY
                        My name is Betty and I’m 
                        an addict. 

                                 GROUP
                        Hello Betty. 

                                 BETTY
                        And I’m not sure I’ve been 
                        truthful to you or myself. 
                                 BETTY
                        I accepted that I had a problem 
                        with pills. And I could justify 
                        that, because they were prescribed 
                        to me. I convinced myself and you 
                        that my drinking was because of my 
                        social life. What was expected of 
                        me. But truth be told, my drinking 
                        has always been a problem and one 
                        that got worse when I became a 
                        wife... and a mother. 

           The women in the group look up. Linda edges forward on 
           her seat. 

           Betty catches the men’s attention too. Some shift uncomfortably 
           but a few look at her with renewed interest. 

                                 BETTY
                        I barely saw my husband and, 
                        although I love them dearly, being 
                        at home with my children all day, 
                        with no work, no drive except my 
                        family, drove me to the point of 
                        nervous collapse. Because it’s 
                        lonely. And it’s the hardest work 
                        I’ve ever done. And because it 
                        could also be so agonizingly... 
                        boring. 

           Linda smiles broadly. The other women in the group laugh. 
           Betty smiles. 

                                 BETTY
                        My name is Betty. I’m addicted to 
                        pain medication... And I’m an 
                        alcoholic.

           INT. AIR FORCE ONE - EVENING

           1975. Dr Lukash counts out 25 pills and hands them to Betty.

                                 BETTY
                        Thanks Doc. 

           As he leaves, she knocks back a few different pills and settles 
           into a comfortable chair.

           Gerald comes in --

                                 GERALD
                        How are you doing?
                                 BETTY
                        I’ll be better in a moment. I just 
                        feel so crippled.

                                 GERALD
                            (not listening)
                        You did fantastically. Maybe you 
                        should run for president.

                                 BETTY
                        I bet Cheney hated it?

           He fixes them both a drink.

                                 GERALD
                        There’s something I want to run by 
                        you. You know I need to announce.

           Betty’s sunk back into her chair and isn’t quite following --

                                 GERALD
                        ... My candidacy for reelection. I 
                        want to run.

                                 BETTY
                        Are you asking? Or telling me?

                                 GERALD
                        I want to make sure you’re 
                        onboard. And because the committee 
                        wants you with me all the way.

           Betty's world gets hazy.

                                 BETTY
                        By your side. Not behind you. 

                                 GERALD
                        That's right. 

                                 BETTY
                        I promised to get the ERA through, 
                        and I guess I can’t do that unless 
                        you continue as president.

           Gerald squeezes her hand.

                                 GERALD
                        I knew you’d understand.

           Betty closes her eyes momentarily. 

                                 BETTY
                        I don't know if I can do it. 
           Betty opens her eyes. Gerald has gone. She is alone. Her 
           eyelids become heavy.

           She dozes off, and we are washed into a

           HAZY CAMPAIGN MONTAGE --

           Betty wafts through the campaign trail in a drug 
           induced bubble. 

           A WASHINGTON THEATRE

           Betty dances a soft shoe number on stage in a long flowing 
           evening gown, as the Washington pressmen on stage behind her 
           sing to the tune of Once in Love with Amy --

                                 PRESSMEN
                        So start the draft for Betty, We’ll all go daft 
                        for Betty; Go tell the party we all want the 
                        dancer, She’s the perfect answer - and how! Let 
                        Betty have her equal rights now!

           Betty, delighted to be dancing, looks out at her husband who 
           grins back from the audience.

           And then he’s grinning at her from the opposite seat in their

           LIMOUSINE

           Betty chatting on a CB radio as their car rushes through the 
           countryside. She looks out of the window and sees the

           SAN ANTONIO RIVERSIDE

           Betty's on a float riding down the river in the Fiesta Parade. 
           An airplane roars overhead...

           VARIOUS AIRPORTS

           Air Force One takes off, Air Force One lands, takes off, lands, 
           take off, landing, take off, landing in

           INDIANAPOLIS

           Where Betty smashes a champagne bottle over the nose of a new 
           747 jet plane. She sticks her fingers into the wine running 
           down the plane and tastes it. She grins cheekily.

           Cameras click, the press are delighted. As are the press in

           NEW YORK
           Because the crowds are ecstatic to see Betty - many of them 
           wearing pins reading I’M WITH BETTY’S HUSBAND and KEEP BETTY IN 
           THE WHITE HOUSE.

           Betty raises her eyebrows as she hears a TV REPORTER speaking 
           to camera --

                                 TV REPORTER
                        It seems the Republicans have 
                        cottoned on to how popular Mrs 
                        Ford is with the voters - she owns 
                        the middle ground, that huge 
                        swathe of voters in a way that no 
                        first lady, or even politician 
                        ever has before.

           LOS ANGELES

           A pianist and two violinists play I Could Have Danced All Night 
           as Betty laughs and dances up the red carpet to the delight of 
           the crowds.

           SIOUX FALLS

           Betty steps into a reception. She pauses in front of the people 
           lined up to greet her --

                                 BETTY
                        Do you mind if I say hello to my 
                        husband first?

           She turns and plants a kiss on a poster of Gerald on the wall 
           behind her. To the delight of the crowd, who she is quickly 
           enveloped by.

           SAN DIEGO

           Betty is dancing with a crowd of senior citizens. The 
           octogenarians all want to whirl and twirl her with great 
           enthusiasm. Betty’s having a ball, but starts to get flustered 
           as she’s passed from OAP to OAP.

           The woman in charge stops the music --

                                 WOMAN
                        Please folks, let’s not wear the 
                        poor girl out.

           Betty catches her breath, and starts to speak in

           OAKLAND

           At a reception, in front of a huge crowd --
                                 BETTY
                        Thank you all for coming out. I’m 
                        so proud to be able to stand in 
                        front of you as your president --

           The crowd laugh --

                                 CROWD MEMBER
                        We wish you were!

                                 BETTY
                        Oh! Actually, you know, I was 
                        president of the Senate Wives Club 
                        when my husband was only vice 
                        president. I used to kid him about 
                        it as often as possible!

           HOTEL ROOM

           Betty is sobbing. She looks up at Sheila --

                                 BETTY
                        How could I do that? I just can’t 
                        get over it. All those stupid 
                        mistakes I keep making all the 
                        time. I really shouldn’t be 
                        allowed to speak in public like 
                        this. I keep thinking of all the 
                        things I said wrong. I’m so 
                        embarrassed.

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        It’s fine, you’re doing fine. I’d 
                        tell you if I thought you’d messed 
                        up, wouldn’t I? 

                                 BETTY
                        I can’t hear this now. Please 
                        leave me. Get out!

           AIR FORCE ONE

           On the plane between engagements, Betty is having hot 
           compresses applied to her back.

                                 STEWARDESS
                        Mrs Ford, it’s time to strap in 
                        for landing.

                                 DR LUKASH
                        That should help a bit. We’ll 
                        continue on the return flight.

           Betty struggles off the massage table and steps unsteadily 
           towards her seat.
           CHICAGO

           Betty steps unsteadily out onto stage at a Lithuanian Festival, 
           her hair piled untidily on her head.

                                 BETTY
                        Lobos!

           She gets a standing ovation from 15,000 Lithuanians for this.

           And crowds of working class Americans gather in

           PITTSBURGH

           Where Betty is causing a huge stir by knocking door-to-door to 
           shake hands with the voters.

           AIR FORCE ONE

           Betty struggles up the steps and into the plane, Sheila 
           following behind.

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        I really think you could benefit 
                        from being a bit more specific 
                        when answering questions.

                                 BETTY
                        I’m more than just a spokesperson 
                        for the bloody ERA.

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                            (a bit confused)
                        Well, then maybe you can talk 
                        around it, your beliefs in 
                        people’s rights... You could talk 
                        about cancer too - something that 
                        you --

                                 BETTY
                        I’m sick of the cancer thing. I 
                        hate the thought that every time 
                        people look at me they clutch 
                        their bosoms. 

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        But I’m always meeting women who 
                        say that by speaking about it, you 
                        saved their lives. I really feel 
                        that’s something valuable we could 
                        focus on.

                                 BETTY
                        I can't...
                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        It's important that we're seen to 
                        be engaging with...

                                 BETTY
                        I’ve had enough!
                            (collapses into her seat)
                        I can’t breathe! They have me just 
                        jammed with events, it never 
                        stops. It feels like they're 
                        choking the life out of me. They 
                        hated me, Sheila. They hated me, 
                        and now they're loving me to the 
                        point where I'm going to collapse. 
                        I feel abused. I'm so tired. 

           She looks down at her palms - they're raw from shaking hands.

           INT. PRESIDENTIAL BEDROOM - MORNING

           Betty is in bed, bleary-eyed. Nancy Howe in the chair beside 
           her. Betty groans - the light is blinding.

                                 BETTY
                        Could you just shut those drapes? 
                        It’s too much.

           Nancy does so, and Betty moans in relief.

                                 BETTY
                        Tell Sheila they have to postpone 
                        today. I can’t do it.

           Nancy dials the phone --

                                 NANCY HOWE (INTO PHONE)
                        Hello Sheila? I’m with Betty, 
                        she’s not too good. Is there any 
                        possibility... No... I see.

                                 BETTY
                        She can’t make me do something I 
                        don’t want to do! Send her away. 
                        I’ll be better tomorrow.

                                 NANCY HOWE (INTO PHONE)
                        Sheila, can you stop? I can’t have 
                        everyone shouting at me.

                                 BETTY
                        I can’t be seen like this. Do you 
                        know how many people watch that 
                        show? Everybody!
                                 NANCY HOWE (INTO PHONE)
                        Just give us an hour or so?

           Nancy puts the phone down and heads to the drinks cabinet to 
           pour a glass of water over an Alka-Seltzer. She places the 
           fizzing glass beside Betty’s bed.

                                 BETTY
                        I don’t know why she keeps trying 
                        to make me do these things.

                                 NANCY HOWE
                        I’ll give you a bit of peace 
                        and quiet.

           Nancy heads for the door, then turns back --

                                 NANCY HOWE
                        I do know, though, how much of an 
                        admirer you are of Mary’s. Do you 
                        think you’ll regret...

                                 BETTY
                        Please not you too, Nancy?

                                 NANCY HOWE
                        How excited do you think your 
                        daughter would be if you were on 
                        the show?

                                 BETTY
                        Susan’s living in the White House 
                        - if she’s not already excited, 
                        then I don’t know...

           Nancy shrugs, goes out and shuts the door.

           Betty lies in the dark for a long long moment. Then she sighs 
           and sits up. She pushes the aspirin water off the table onto 
           the floor.

           She drags herself into the sitting room. She sits in an 
           armchair and reaches under the cushion where she’s stowed a 
           flask. She takes a long drink from it.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - MORNING

           Betty walks down the stairs, weaving slightly, leaning heavily 
           on the banisters.

           In the corridor, Rumsfeld is having his photo taken with
           MARY TYLER MOORE as her producers stand anxiously by.
           They all perk up at the sight of Betty coming towards them in a 
           floaty psychedelic dress and a lot of beads. The two women 
           approach each other warily.

                                 BETTY
                        Mary Tyler Moore. I might well be 
                        your biggest fan.

                                 MARY TYLER MOORE
                        Hello, Mrs President.

                                 BETTY
                        Hopefully one day that will be 
                        someone’s actual title.

                                 MARY TYLER MOORE
                        I do hope so.

                                 BETTY
                        Thank you for having me on 
                        your show...

           She stumbles and Mary helps her. They walk, holding each 
           other’s arms.

                                 BETTY
                        Your program got me through many 
                        long days.

           They smile at each other warmly.

           INT. HAY-ADAMS HOTEL - DAY

           Betty sits on a sofa with a phone and several framed photos of 
           Susan beside her. She’s reading her lines as technicians set up 
           the lights. The words are swimming in front of her. She squints 
           to try and still them - no luck.

           The show’s producer, ED WEINBERGER, approaches --

                                 ED WEINBERGER
                        How are you doing, Mrs Ford?

                                 BETTY
                        Yes, I think... There’s just 
                        one thing.

                                 ED WEINBERGER
                        Would you like to change one of 
                        your lines?

                                 BETTY
                        It’s this... 
                                 BETTY
                        He’s always leaving it - about his 
                        pipe - somewhere. Well, he 
                        doesn’t. I don’t want to make him 
                        look like a klutz.

                                 ED WEINBERGER
                        No, quite right. That’s 
                        no problem.
                            (crosses the line out on 
                            his script)
                        So we’ll go line by line. We’re 
                        all ready, when you are?

           Betty nods, unsure. Ed steps in and takes the script from her.

                                 ED WEINBERGER
                        Okay so, roll camera. And sound.

                                 CAMERAMAN
                        Rolling.

                                 SOUND RECORDIST
                        Speed.

                                 ED WEINBERGER
                        And let’s mark it?

           The CLAPPER LOADER steps up to Betty with a clapper board --

                                 CLAPPER LOADER
                        Scene one, shot one, take one.

           Betty jumps as he snaps the clapper.

                                 ED WEINBERGER
                        And... action.

           Betty stares at the camera like a rabbit in headlights.

                                 ED WEINBERGER
                        ... so, the phone is ringing, 
                        Mr Ford.

           Betty looks towards it, a bit confused.

                                 ED WEINBERGER
                        Ring ring, ring ring.

           Betty picks the phone up.

                                 BETTY
                        Hello? This is Betty.
                                 ED WEINBERGER
                        Great. Thank you, Mrs Ford. Now 
                        it’s important that you say Mary’s 
                        name - Hello, Mary? So the scene 
                        flows from the previous line.
                            (to camera man)
                        Keep rolling.

                                 BETTY
                        The previous line?

                                 ED WEINBERGER
                        That Mary says in the other room, 
                        to Lou.

                                 BETTY
                        Okay...

                                 ED WEINBERGER
                        And I need you to say Betty Ford - 
                        that’s what makes the joke work.

                                 BETTY
                        Hello, this is Betty Ford... 
                        I’m sorry.
                            (slurs her words)
                        Hello Mary, I’m Betty Ford. Ugh.
                            (getting angry with herself)
                        Hello...

           Ed glances over at Mary, who takes a copy of the script and 
           comes to kneel beside Betty.

                                 MARY TYLER MOORE
                        Mrs Ford?

                                 BETTY
                        Oh, Mary, please call me Betty.

                                 MARY TYLER MOORE
                        Betty, don’t worry - we can take 
                        our time, and we only need to get 
                        each line once.

           Mary looks into Betty’s eyes and can see she’s drunk. Mary 
           turns to Ed --

                                 MARY TYLER MOORE
                        Can you give me a moment?

           She hurries out of the room.
                                 BETTY
                        Where’d you get these pictures of 
                        Susan? They’re not the best.

           Mary rushes back in with a glass of clear liquid. She hands it 
           to Betty, who takes a sip. Betty relaxes and takes Mary’s hand.

                                 BETTY
                        Thank you, Mary. Will you read 
                        each line for me?

                                 MARY TYLER MOORE
                        Of course. I’ll sit real close - 
                        here. You can just ignore all 
                        these men and their toys.

                                 BETTY
                        I’m just talking to you in the 
                        script anyway?

                                 MARY TYLER MOORE
                        Yes, let’s just make this fun.
                            (to Ed)
                        Are we still rolling? Good.

           Mary moves the glass just out of shot.

                                 MARY TYLER MOORE
                        Now, it’s ringing. Ring ring.

           Betty picks the phone up.

                                 MARY TYLER MOORE
                        And I say hello, and you say 
                        Hello, Mary? This is Betty Ford.
                            (she winks at Betty)
                        Hello?

                                 BETTY
                        Hello, Mary? This is Betty Ford.

           Mary claps happily. Betty beams.

                                 MARY TYLER MOORE
                        Fantastic! Then I say Hi Betty, 
                        this is Mary - Queen of Scots.

           Everyone laughs. Betty takes another sip from the glass.

                                 MARY TYLER MOORE
                        And Betty, when you hear that, you 
                        need to look at the handset in 
                        confusion.
                                 BETTY
                        That’s okay.

                                 MARY TYLER MOORE
                        Hi Betty, this is Mary - Queen 
                        of Scots.

           Betty hammily holds the handset out to look at it in extreme 
           confusion. Mary chuckles. She shoots a look at Ed, who shrugs.

                                 MARY TYLER MOORE
                        Great, thanks Betty. So the next 
                        line is I just wanted you to know 
                        that I’m sorry we missed you. So, 
                        sort of look off into the 
                        distance... Actually...
                            (she sits on the floor)
                        Look at me... And I say to you 
                        “Well, I have to go now.” ...and 
                        you say?

                                 BETTY
                        Well, I just wanted to tell you 
                        I’m sorry we missed you.

                                 MARY TYLER MOORE
                        And then I go into a long tirade 
                        about Lou organizing someone to 
                        impersonate you and then you say 
                        Please tell Lou I’ll have the pipe 
                        picked up.

                                 BETTY
                        Please just tell Lou we’ll have 
                        the pipe picked up.

                                 MARY TYLER MOORE
                        Now shrug and put the phone down.

           Betty does a big shrug and puts down the phone.

                                 MARY TYLER MOORE
                        Fabulous! I think we got that, Ed?

                                 ED WEINBERGER
                        That’s a wrap, folks.

           The crew all applaud. Betty downs the rest of the glass.

           Sheila sees this, and nudges Nancy to step in to help Betty off 
           the sofa.
                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        I’m afraid we have to whisk Mrs 
                        Ford away to another engagement.

                                 MARY TYLER MOORE
                        Oh, that’s a shame, it really has 
                        been such an honor to meet you, 
                        Mrs Ford... Betty.

                                 BETTY
                            (really slurring now)
                        Noo... the honor’s allll mine.

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        Thank you so much. We will look 
                        forward to seeing the finished 
                        product.

           Mary watches regretfully as Betty is maneuvered out of 
           the room.

           EXECUTIVE RESIDENCE

           The two women help Betty into the bedroom and onto the bed.

                                 BETTY
                        That was a lot of fun.

                                 NANCY HOWE
                        Yes, it was.

                                 BETTY
                        Next time, we’ll go and do it 
                        in Hollywood.

                                 NANCY HOWE
                        For now, let’s just sleep it off.

           INT. SUSAN'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

           Susan is on the phone with a packed bag at her feet --

                                 SUSAN'S FRIEND (ON PHONE)
                        The others just don't feel 
                        comfortable with your security men 
                        all around... Susan, we just feel 
                        it's better if you don't come.

           Susan puts the phone down, upset. 
           CORRIDOR

           Susan hovers outside her parents' bedroom door --

                                 SUSAN
                        Mom?... Mom?

           She opens the door and steps inside. She stands and stares at 
           Betty, who's face down fully-clothed on the bed. Clearly 
           completely zonked out. Sheila appears.

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        Susan? What is it honey?

                                 SUSAN
                        I just wanted to talk to mom.

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        She's had a real long day. She 
                        needs to rest.

                                 SUSAN
                        I live in the same house as my 
                        parents, but I never see either of 
                        them.
                            (storming out)
                        You give her too many pills.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE BALLROOM - EVENING

           Betty hovers in the doorway to observe the fundraising dance. 
           Gerald waves to her from the middle of the dance floor.

           She hobbles to a table using chair backs as support. She’s 
           obviously in pain as she levers herself down into a chair.

           A man passes by --

                                 MAN
                        Mrs Ford, it’s an honor to 
                        meet you.

                                 BETTY
                        Noo, the honoh izz all mine.

                                 MAN
                        I just wanted to say how much my 
                        wife and I loved you on The Mary 
                        Tyler Moore Show. You were a big 
                        hit in our house.

                                 BETTY
                        Whell, thanking you.
           The man heads off, stoked that he spoke to her.

           Betty surreptitiously slips a pill into her mouth and swallows 
           it with some wine.

           She sits and watches heartbroken as everyone else dances 
           around her.

           The chair next to her is empty, but she starts to talk to it --

                                 BETTY
                        I luurve to dance - isss the 
                        purest pleasure innnn eye life.

           The band kicks in with I Could Have Danced All Night.

           She watches Gerald dancing with a beautiful celebrity. She’s 
           clearly jealous. She floats into --

           A VIBRANT MEMORY --

           18-year-old Betty rushes down a corridor.

           She bursts into a dance studio where a group of young women are 
           warming up. A couple frown at her disapprovingly. Betty is 
           relieved that Martha Graham’s not here yet.

           LATER

           The dancers are executing a complicated and energetic routine. 
           To the untrained observer they all seem perfect, but to Martha 
           Graham’s eagle eyes...

           Martha claps her hands and the women all stop. 
           Breathing heavily.

           Martha stalks between them and pauses beside Betty. Examines 
           her - close up, Betty is flushed and a little hungover. 

                                 MARTHA GRAHAM
                        Heretic.

           She claps her hands, the pianist strikes up and the women begin 
           again. Betty trying extra hard under Martha’s close gaze.

           Then Martha turns and starts to dance with them. And Betty can 
           breathe again.

           LATER

           Betty waves goodbye to some of the other dancers and heads out. 
           As she passes an office, Martha calls from inside --

                                 MARTHA GRAHAM
                        Betty?

           Betty hesitantly enters. Martha stands - poised - staring out 
           of the window.  

                                 MARTHA GRAHAM
                        When we have no form, we lose the 
                        ability to be articulate. Training 
                        is here to give you that form. But 
                        part of the training of a dancer 
                        is to meet a situation with 
                        courage and complete honesty. 

                                 BETTY
                        I’m not sure I understand. 

                                 MARTHA GRAHAM
                        You were drinking last night and 
                        didn’t sleep. 

                                 BETTY
                        I...

                                 MARTHA GRAHAM
                        That wasn’t a question. 

                                 BETTY
                        I feel fine.

                                 MARTHA GRAHAM
                        Do you think I am able to do what 
                        I do because I feel merely fine?

                                 BETTY
                        ... Then I feel good. Great. I can 
                        do both.

                                 MARTHA GRAHAM
                        No. You cannot... I do not want 
                        nuns and priests, Betty. But if 
                        you wish to dance, you must devote 
                        your life to it. If not, you must 
                        find something else that suits you 
                        better. It’s for you to decide. 

           Martha turns to smile at her. Betty swallows hard.
           INT. WHITE HOUSE BALLROOM - EVENING

           Back to Betty watching her husband dancing with the beautiful 
           celebrity. Betty emotional at the memory. As a tear starts to 
           escape from the corner of her eye, she pushes herself out of 
           her chair to leave, and clutches her back in intense pain...

           The room spins around her and we are spun back into the --

           HAZY CAMPAIGN MONTAGE --

           Betty lies in bed all day, clearly in agony. Dr Lukash puts a 
           pill in her mouth and helps her wash it down.

           AIR FORCE ONE

           Dr Lukash dispenses a handful of different color pills to 
           Betty. And then suddenly she’s in a

           TV STUDIO

           watching from the wings, mouthing the words as Gerald debates 
           with JIMMY CARTER. She drinks to steady her nerves.

           OREGON UNIVERSITY CAFETERIA

           Demonstrators climb onto tables to yell at Betty --

                                 DEMONSTRATORS
                        Abortion is murder! We stand for 
                        life, for God’s life. Betty - you 
                        support murder! You liberal scum! 
                        Shame on you! Shame on you!

           Betty’s security detail rush her out.

           HOTEL ROOM

           Betty is knocked out on the bed, still in her clothes.

           MESA, ARIZONA

           Betty cuts a ribbon with 3-foot long scissors to open the 
           reproduction of an adobe schoolhouse. She almost drops the 
           scissors as someone guides her to a soapbox and helps her 
           balance on it.

           Betty looks around - the crowd and the reporters come in and 
           out of focus. She tries to speak, but slurs her words --

                                 BETTY
                        Thisss isss a lovely sschoool. 
                                 BETTY
                        Thank you. Hellllo everyone, 
                        thanksss for being here. 

           She realizes she ought to be reading her prepared words, and 
           fumbles with her cue cards --

                                 BETTY
                        From the very firssst settizens of 
                        thisss proud country...
                            (loses her place)
                        We need to translate our ideasss 
                        into relality.

           She looks around, confused. Reaches out for Sheila, who helps 
           her down --

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD 
                        Thank you everyone!

           Sheila helps Betty towards her car, the press swarming behind 
           them and sits her down in the

           LIMOUSINE

           Betty is getting frustrated with her CB radio - she jabs at the 
           dials. Sheila tries to help --

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        Here, let me try?

           Betty flaps her hands away.

                                 BETTY
                        I’m not Betty Ford anymore, I’m 
                        back again being Mrs Gerald Ford, 
                        and I’m so trapped.

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        Just a few more days.

           Betty screws her eyes together --

           GRAND RAPIDS

           And now she’s lurching towards the voting station, Gerald 
           helping her along. He looks drained and exhausted too, trying 
           to focus ahead, get through this crowd of locals who’ve turned 
           out for them.

           In the privacy of the booth, Betty scrabbles to get her vote 
           through the slot. Her knees buckle and she clutches the box. 
           She slowly turns and opens the curtains, winces as the press 
           cameras flash.
           An 18 foot-long mural of Gerald Ford’s achievements is unveiled 
           - Betty looks closely and finds herself in the mural, painted 
           in shadow behind Gerald.

           The crowd applaud deafeningly. Gerald sheds a few tears, and 
           Betty hides behind him, exhausted and emotional.

           INT. SITTING HALL, EXECUTIVE RESIDENCE - NIGHT

           A bank of TVs, the volume is up on one --

                                 NBC REPORTER (ON TV)
                        We’re going to take another look 
                        at our map. At present it’s 
                        largely Democrat to the East and 
                        in the Deep South where even Texas 
                        has gone to Carter, and President 
                        Ford has held all the plains and 
                        mountain states.

           The Ford children, partners and friends are having a party at 
           one end of the room. At the other end, Gerald, Rumsfeld, 
           various senators and advisors, are all looking quite glum.

                                 WALTER CRONKITE (ON TV)
                        It has just been announced that

                        Dakota, we don’t know about yet. 
                        California and Oregon still 
                        undecided. But we can clearly see 
                        where each man’s support lies.

           Betty, Sheila, Nancy and Pearl Bailey are sat on the floor with 
           a big bowl of punch on the go, chanting at the TV --

                                 CHANTING
                        Come on California! Come on Cali!

           INT. OVAL OFFICE - MORNING

           The Ford family are milling about. Gerald is at his desk, 
           looking around at his office. He croaks --

                                 GERALD
                        I can’t believe I lost to a 
                        peanut farmer.

                                 JACK FORD
                        He didn’t win. Nixon lost.
                                 BETTY
                        But you kids got a father back, 
                        and I got my husband back.

           Susan bursts into tears.

                                 GERALD
                        I can’t read the concession 
                        speech, not with this voice.

           He looks at Betty.

                                 BETTY
                        No, Gerald. That’s not my role. 

                                 GERALD
                        Betty, you’re the only other 
                        person they’ll accept it from. 

                                 BETTY
                        So, you lose but I have to be the 
                        one to stand and take your defeat?

                                 GERALD
                        Betty!

           Betty’s family stare at her - shocked. Betty is caught out, but 
           unwilling to apologize. She turns to leave.

                                 BETTY
                        I need to get my hair done first. 

           INT. PRESS BRIEFING ROOM - MIDDAY

           The Ford family step up onto the podium.

           Betty closes her eyes and takes a deep breath. Then she starts 
           to speak to the nation --

                                 BETTY
                        It has been the greatest honor of 
                        my husband’s life to have served 
                        his fellow Americans during two of 
                        the most difficult years in our 
                        history. The president urges all 
                        Americans to join him in giving 
                        our united support to President-
                        elect Carter as he prepares to 
                        assume his new responsibilities...

           While Betty is smiling her way through the speech, behind her 
           Gerald is staring blankly into space and their children are 
           blinking back tears.
           INT. EXECUTIVE RESIDENCE - DAY

           Betty and Nancy walk slowly through the residence towards the 
           double door entrance. Betty slows, fiddling with her dress.

                                 NANCY HOWE
                        Is everything alright?

                                 BETTY
                        I just... This dress is all wrong.

                                 NANCY HOWE
                        It looks lovely to me.

                                 BETTY
                        It’s terrible. I can’t do it like 
                        this. Can you just cancel her?

                                 NANCY HOWE
                        I’m not sure I can.

           But Betty’s heading the other way.

           INT. PRESIDENTIAL RESIDENCE - AFTERNOON

           Betty is sitting surrounded by piles of clothes. She’s looking 
           lost and pretty spaced out. Gerald comes in.

                                 GERALD
                        Here you are. Why don’t you leave 
                        this for Rex to sort out?

                                 BETTY
                        I just want to make sure it’s all 
                        organized. It’s such an upheaval. 
                        Another one. It’s really unfair.

                                 GERALD
                        My dear, let’s try and make it as 
                        easy and smooth as possible then?

                                 BETTY
                        I’m trying to! That’s why I’m 
                        organizing!

                                 GERALD
                        Jimmy called me. You can’t keep 
                        cancelling Rosalynn’s tour.

                                 BETTY
                        But why does she need a tour? She 
                        doesn’t belong here - it’s still 
                        my home until we move out.
                                 GERALD
                        Yes, it is. But... Well, I said 
                        tomorrow at 11am. Okay? Thank you, 
                        mother.

                                 BETTY
                        Oh for goodness sake, the kids 
                        have all left home now, will you 
                        stop calling me mother!

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE STEPS - MORNING

           Betty very reluctantly stands beside Gerald as ROSALYNN and 
           Jimmy Carter climb the steps towards them. They all shake hands 
           and smile rigidly as David Kennerly takes their photos.

           INT. EXECUTIVE RESIDENCE - LATER

           A daunted Rosalynn follows Betty, who sweeps through the rooms.

                                 BETTY
                        And out there is the Truman 
                        Balcony. We like to eat out there 
                        when it’s sunny.

                                 ROSALYNN CARTER
                        Did you bring your own help?

                                 BETTY
                        No... But some have, in the past.

                                 ROSALYNN CARTER
                        I might need to, for Amy’s sake.

                                 BETTY
                        I’m sure that’s no problem.

           Betty stops beside the two Greek goddess statues and a cheeky 
           look washes over her...

                                 BETTY
                        Do you have a cigarette in 
                        that handbag?

           Rosalynn hands one to Betty, who inserts it into the 
           goddess’ fist.

           The two women look at each other, and smile - and just like 
           that the tension eases. They walk on, much more friendly now.
                                 BETTY
                        I’m sure you will love it here, I 
                        have very much - once I discovered 
                        that I could make it my own.

           David Kennerly snaps a photo of them.

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE STEPS - MIDDAY

           Betty waves Rosalynn off. She looks out over the Washington 
           Monument, and the city beyond, then walks with David Kennerly 
           back inside --

                                 BETTY
                        Leaving Washington is going to be 
                        like leaving all our married life 
                        behind. Our children were born in 
                        this town, Jerry’s twenty-eight 
                        years of working... Our home. It 
                        does feel as though it’s all going 
                        down the drain.
                            (she pauses)
                        I’ve got an idea.

           CABINET ROOM

           Betty bounds in, excited. She clicks off her shoes and climbs 
           up onto the long grand cabinet table.

           She does a graceful little dance and ends up in a pose for 
           David to snap the famous photograph of Betty Ford standing 
           barefoot on the cabinet table, a huge defiant grin on her face.

           INT. THE FORD HOUSE, PALM SPRINGS - TWO WEEKS LATER

           Betty follows Gerald to the front door of their new home, where 
           he hands his suitcase to his chauffeur. He turns to kiss his 
           wife goodbye.

                                 GERALD
                        You have my itinerary? Call me 
                        every night.

                                 BETTY
                        If it’ll help keep you away from 
                        the pretty girls.

                                 GERALD
                        And keep active. Make sure you get 
                        out and see people.
           Betty nods. She watches Gerald get into his car and waves until 
           the vehicle disappears through the perfectly manicured golf 
           course that is now their home.

           She feels the heavy heat of Palm Springs roll over her.

           She smiles at her SECURITY DETAIL - two men in sharp suits 
           standing in the sun - then shuts the door.

           She stands for a moment, appreciating the breeze from the 
           overhead fan. She looks around at her large empty home with its 
           modernist design and funky 70s decor.

                                 BETTY
                        Well.

           She goes to the sideboard and pours herself a drink.

           LATER - she sits on the couch, a lot of empty space beside her. 
           She takes out a jar of pills, rifles through them and picks out 
           a blue one. Washes it back.

           LATER - she’s watching The Mary Tyler Moore Show. She’s crying.

           LATER - she’s asleep on the couch, the TV hissing fuzz in front 
           of her.

           ANOTHER DAY - she’s blearily wandering around in her nightgown.

           ANOTHER DAY - she seems to have lost weight. Three women are 
           sitting in the living room with her, chatting away. Betty’s 
           just staring out into space.

           ANOTHER DAY - in her nightgown again, searching through drawers 
           for something. Gives up. Makes a drink instead.

           ANOTHER DAY - Betty trips on some steps and just lies there 
           staring at the carpet.

           ANOTHER DAY - another visitor, chatting. Betty’s eyes are 
           drooping, and she falls asleep. The visitor sits there 
           awkwardly for a while, then gets up to leave.

           INT. THE FORD HOUSE, PALM SPRINGS - DAY

           An extremely drunk Betty staggers over to answer the door. She 
           eventually gets it open to reveal Sheila on the doorstep.

                                 BETTY
                        I can’t do a speech today, Sheila.

           Betty stumbles into the living room, cannoning off furniture. 
                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        No, Betty. I’ve come for a visit. 
                        Gerald called me. You haven’t be 
                        answering your private line.

                                 BETTY
                        I’ve been terribly busy.

           Betty crawls onto the couch and passes out.

           Sheila makes her comfortable and looks around. The house is 
           chaos, the evidence of Betty’s drinking everywhere.

           Sheila sits beside Betty and gently strokes her hair.

           A FEW DAYS LATER

           Betty slowly makes her way through to the lounge. She looks the 
           worst we’ve ever seen her. She opens the drinks cabinet and 
           looks inside in confusion - it’s empty.

           The front door opens and Gerald comes in.

                                 BETTY
                        Jerry, what have you done with...

           A whole hoard of people traipse in after Gerald: Sheila, Nancy, 
           all the Ford children and Dr Lukash.

           Betty lights up as Mike and Gayle come over to embrace her --

                                 BETTY
                        You’ve flown out to see me? What a 
                        lovely surprise!

           Behind them, everyone efficiently moves chairs into a 
           semicircle around the couch. A planned maneuver.

           Betty looks back down at the drinks cabinet --

                                 BETTY
                        I would offer you a drink, but...

           Gerald hands her a glass of seltzer, then gently guides her to 
           the couch.

           She looks small and lost amongst all the cushions. Her husband 
           sits beside her and puts his hand on hers.

                                 GERALD
                        Betty, we’ve got something to talk 
                        to you about, and we want you to 
                        listen, because we love you.
           Betty looks around at all the faces watching her - tense and 
           serious... And then she realizes what’s happening.

           She flushes, angry and embarrassed. Can’t bear to look at her 
           family now. Shoots a glare at Sheila.

                                 SHEILA WEIDENFELD
                        I am sorry, Betty. But we should 
                        have done this much sooner.

                                 SUSAN
                        Mom, we’re here because we love 
                        you. And we need to tell you about 
                        what’s been happening over the 
                        years. Things you don’t think 
                        we’ve noticed or seen.

           LATER

           Betty turns to Dr Lukash. 

                                 BETTY
                        I don’t have a problem. You 
                        prescribed me the pills. I take 
                        them for my shoulder. 

                                 GERALD
                        It’s not just the pills, Betty. 
                        There’s the drink too.

           Betty gets up and stomps through to the kitchen.

                                 BETTY
                        None of you have any idea what 
                        you’re talking about! You don’t 
                        know what it’s like to be me. To 
                        have to deal with all of you. It’s 
                        work. It’s hard, hard work. 

           Jack looks hurt and heads for the door. 

                                 JACK
                        This is awful.

                                 SUSAN 
                        Jack. You need to stay. 

           Betty now starts to plead.

                                 BETTY
                         Have I not been a good mother?

           Her children look at the floor. 
                                 BETTY
                        Have I not been a good mother to 
                        our children, Gerald?

                                 GERALD
                        This isn’t about that, Betty. Of 
                        course, you’re a good mother. 
                        You’re wonderful. 

                                 BETTY
                            (to her children)
                        I have this injury because of 
                        having you all! Because of the 
                        pressure I put on my body!

                                 SUSAN
                        Mom, you hurt your shoulder 
                        opening a window. 

                                 BETTY
                        Because my body was so broken from 
                        giving birth to you!

           Mike puts his head in his hands, crying. Betty looks at her 
           family - confused. 

                                 BETTY
                        I did everything I could to work 
                        with you, Gerald. I worked myself 
                        into the ground for you. And this 
                        country. And what? You’re telling 
                        me that because I enjoy a cocktail 
                        or two. The odd pill to relax me 
                        that I’m some monster?

                                 SUSAN
                        Twenty-five. 

                                 BETTY
                        Twenty-five what?

                                 SUSAN
                        Pills. A day, mom. 

           Betty is further confused. She looks to Lukash, who nods. 
           Gerald goes to her and takes her hand. 

                                 GERALD
                        Betty. We, family and friends, 
                        have decided that you need help. 
                        You need to be somewhere they can 
                        help you. Professionally.
                                 BETTY
                        No.

                                 GERALD
                        It’s the only way, Betty.

           Betty sobs into Gerald’s shoulder. 

                                 BETTY
                        Please no, Gerald. Please don’t 
                        lock me up. I’m not mad. I’m just 
                        in pain. 

           Gerald starts to cry quietly as he rests his chin on her head. 

                                 GERALD
                        I know you’re not mad, my love. 
                        We’re doing this because we know 
                        how capable you are. Because this 
                        will make you so much clearer and 
                        healthier. 

           Betty’s tactic hasn’t worked. She pulls away from him - 
           furious again. 

                                 BETTY
                        You’re not family. I don’t know 
                        you people. 

           She rushes to the front door - it's locked. She disappears into 
           her bedroom, slamming the door behind her.

           Susan comforts Gerald. Mike still cries as Gayle wraps her arms 
           around him. The others talk and reassure each other quietly.

                                 SUSAN
                        Dad? Are there any pills in 
                        the bedroom?

           Gerald jumps up and rushes after Betty.

           BEDROOM

           Betty rests against her bedroom door for moment. She locks it 
           and rummages through her dressing table. 

           Gerald hammers on the door --

                                 GERALD (O.S)
                        Betty!
           Betty finds two valium and pops them. She sweeps the other 
           surfaces and drawers - nothing. 

                                 GERALD (O.S)
                        Open the door, Betty!

           Betty looks in the mirror. Calms herself. Fixes her hair.

           EXT. GARDEN, NAVAL HOSPITAL - EARLY MORNING

           1978. Betty is sitting on a bench admiring the militant rows 
           of flowers.

                                 NAVAL DOCTOR (O.S.)
                        Muster!

           Betty stands to start the day.

           THERAPY ROOM

           Betty is sitting opposite her therapist.

                                 BETTY
                        The problem is that I remember 
                        everything I said. And I said some 
                        unforgivable things to my 
                        children.

                                 NAVAL THERAPIST
                        The same children who didn’t miss 
                        a single family therapy session.

                                 BETTY
                        That’s true.

                                 NAVAL THERAPIST
                        This isn’t best practice, but I 
                        think in this case, I can say it. 
                        I think you’re going to be okay.

                                 BETTY
                        ...I do too.

                                 NAVAL THERAPIST
                        And that’s a frightening thought, 
                        isn’t it?

           She nods.
           LECTURE HALL

           Betty walks onto stage and collects her one-month sobriety 
           medallion. She does a little tap dance and curtsies to the 
           audience as they applaud her, Susan and Gerald amongst them.

           INT. CAR - DAY

           Betty looks out, enjoying the brilliant blue sky as they drive 
           past Palm Springs through the Rancho Mirage desert.

                                 BETTY
                        When are the children coming?

                                 GERALD
                        Tomorrow. We thought you could do 
                        with a quiet night before the 
                        hordes descend. 

                                 BETTY
                        Pah! I want to see everyone. 

                                 GERALD
                        You need to rest, Betts. 

                                 BETTY
                        I need something to do, Gerald. 

           She glimpses a large plot of land for sale.

                                 BETTY
                        Stop the car!

           They pull up and Betty gets out. She stares at the dusty 
           empty plot.

           1982 - FOUR YEARS LATER.

           Standing in the same spot, Betty is now staring at the 
           completed Betty Ford Center - six white single-story buildings 
           clustered around a central garden. The sun setting behind it.

           Betty walks towards it. Through windows, she can see a couple 
           of workers putting bath mats down, straightening paintings. And 
           Gerald making his way down a corridor polishing the light 
           switches with his shirt cuff.

           Betty ducks under the red ribbon strung over the entrance.
           LECTURE HALL

           Betty stands in a large empty lecture hall. There is a small 
           stage and a lectern.

                                 GERALD (O.S.)
                        Betty?

                                 BETTY
                        Just a minute.

           She stands at the lectern - looks out at a sea of empty chairs.

           The center is finally ready and the significance of it in 
           Betty’s journey shows on her face as she looks around.

           INT. LECTURE HALL, BETTY FORD CENTRE - DAY

           TWO YEARS LATER. Betty is at the same lectern, but she is now 
           looking out at forty faces - some expectant, hopeful, bleary-
           eyed, resistant.

                                 BETTY
                        Hello everyone.

                                 EVERYONE
                        Hello.

                                 BETTY
                        I’m Betty Ford, and I’m an 
                        alcoholic. A recovering woman 
                        alcoholic, and I might say, very 
                        grateful.

           She turns on a huge bright smile, which seems to lift the room.

                                 BETTY
                        I am here speaking to you as a 
                        representative of your future 
                        selves. I have come to tell you 
                        that there is great joy and 
                        freedom in being well and waking 
                        up each morning feeling good, and 
                        knowing that you have that 
                        wonderful day ahead. 

           She notices a familiar face in the audience - Mary Tyler Moore, 
           looking quite disheveled eight years after their first meeting. 
           Betty warmly locks eyes with her for a moment.

                                 BETTY
                        I am, and for long periods of my 
                        life have been, a working woman. 
                                 BETTY
                        I am a mother. I am a wife - a 
                        partner. And, for a while, I was 
                        all of those whilst being in one 
                        of the most public positions in 
                        the world. I’m sure like all of 
                        you, I had some very sick days. 
                        And some of our sick days are more 
                        public than others. I know you’ve 
                        all seen some of mine.  

           Seeing Betty give such a confident and eloquent speech is 
           having a huge impact upon Mary.

                                 BETTY
                        This meant that, luckily for me, I 
                        was unable to hide my addiction. 
                        It is through enormous privilege 
                        that I find myself here today. But 
                        I am not above you, or above my 
                        addiction, I am just further along 
                        in my process. We are all 
                        suffering from the same disease, 
                        and self-discovery can be a 
                        difficult painful process, but I 
                        want you all to know that I, and 
                        the other mentors here, are here 
                        to help and support you. You are 
                        not alone.

           INT. BETTY FORD CENTRE - DAY

           Betty walks towards her office. Just before she gets there, she 
           peers into a therapy room marked: Sober Living Guidance.  

           She quietly enters the room. The small group who are sitting in 
           a circle turn to stare.

                                 BETTY
                        I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to 
                        interrupt. 

                                 THERAPIST
                        Are you joining the session?

                                 BETTY
                        ... Yes. 

           She pulls a chair up to the circle. The therapist continues. 
           Betty sits attentively and listens.
           INT. THE FORD HOUSE, PALM SPRINGS - MORNING

           Betty is drinking a coffee at a window seat when the phone 
           rings. She answers it --

                                 BETTY
                        Hello?

                                 ASSISTANT (ON PHONE)
                        Mrs Ford, you wanted me to keep 
                        you updated on Mary Tyler Moore?

                                 BETTY
                        Is everything okay?

                                 ASSISTANT (ON PHONE)
                        Well, not exactly. She left last 
                        night. She phoned in this morning 
                        and seems to be okay. It was an 
                        argument - quite a heated one by 
                        all accounts - with one of the 
                        councillors.

                                 BETTY
                        And where is she now?

                                 ASSISTANT (ON PHONE)
                        In a hotel nearby.

           INT. HOTEL / BETTY’S HOME OFFICE - MORNING

           Mary Tyler Moore is scrunched beside the bed looking through 
           her clinic journal. The phone rings. She ignores it for a bit, 
           then picks it up.

                                 MARY TYLER MOORE
                        Hello?

                                 BETTY
                        Hello Mary? This is Betty Ford.

           Mary gapes... then pulls herself together.

                                 MARY TYLER MOORE
                        Hi Betty, this is Mary - Queen 
                        of Scots.

           Betty laughs, relieved.

                                 BETTY
                        What have you been up to?
                                 MARY TYLER MOORE
                        I haven’t had a drink!

                                 BETTY
                        It’s okay, I know.

                                 MARY TYLER MOORE
                        I did eat a cheeseburger 
                        last night.

                                 BETTY
                        And how was it?

                                 MARY TYLER MOORE
                        It never tasted so good.

                                 BETTY
                        Why do you think that is?

                                 MARY TYLER MOORE
                        Because I broke free.

                                 BETTY
                        I don’t think you have 
                        yet, though.
                            (silence at the other end)
                        Do you?

           INT. BETTY FORD CENTER - DAY

           Betty watches the receptionist sign Mary back in.

           GARDENS

           Betty and Mary wander through the center's desert gardens.

                                 MARY TYLER MOORE
                        You make this look so easy, so 
                        natural. It feels like you’ve 
                        found your calling. I envy you 
                        that. I don’t think I ever really 
                        found anything I felt at home 
                        doing.

                                 BETTY
                        You’ve always been so graceful 
                        on screen.

                                 MARY TYLER MOORE
                        But it’s always taken me a drink 
                        to get to look like that. 
                                 MARY TYLER MOORE
                        And the drinking gave me a hand 
                        tremor, so I took Valium to reduce 
                        that, and that quickly went from 
                        ten milligrams to fifty...

                                 BETTY
                        I remember when I was very young, 
                        there was an enormous storm and my 
                        mother took me in her arms on the 
                        front porch and told me how 
                        beautiful storms are, and how 
                        exciting the sound of rain can be. 
                        And to this day, I love to watch 
                        storms. I’ll go out of my way to 
                        watch them, and I love the sound 
                        of rain falling on the roof.
                            (she laughs)
                        My mother confessed much later 
                        that storms scared her to death.

                                 MARY TYLER MOORE
                        That photograph of you on the 
                        White House cabinet table. That 
                        had a huge impact on me. Your 
                        defiance.

                                 BETTY
                        This will sound like a cliche, but 
                        I truly believe that if you want 
                        to get all the air out of a glass, 
                        what do you do? There’s no way to 
                        do it but fill it with something 
                        else. And that something else is 
                        joy of living, dancing, being 
                        creative. Find your joy and focus 
                        on that.

                                 MARY
                        ... Well, it sure is pretty here. 

                                 BETTY
                        I like nice views. 

                                 MARY
                        Like Capitol Hill?... Do you 
                        miss it?

                                 BETTY
                        I miss the... parties. 
                            (they both laugh)
                        You want the truth? 
                                 MARY
                        Always. 

                                 BETTY
                        The memories are all so... patchy. 
                        Jumbled with pills and booze. I'm 
                        scared I don't remember the right 
                        narrative.

                                 MARY TYLER MOORE
                        You know, I think most women still 
                        feel that being a female alcoholic 
                        is a sloppy disgrace, the lowest 
                        of the low, and an intelligent, 
                        well-read, dignified woman can’t 
                        possibly be a drunk. But here you 
                        are - creating a new narrative. 
                        And filling in your blanks.

           Betty looks at her - realizing she’s right.

           Betty stands and closes her eyes as the sun warms her face. She 
           gently starts moving her right foot in a tap rhythm. 

           She raises an eyebrow at Mary... 

                                 MARY TYLER MOORE
                        No. 

           Betty smiles cheekily and begins a slow tap routine. Mary still 
           resists - shaking her head. Betty continues to dance. 

           Mary sighs - a true show woman, she can’t resist any longer. 
           She stands next to Betty and joins in the routine. 

           The two women dance quietly in unison.

           A group of people gather at the door of the main building 
           to watch. 

           INT. HARPER AND ROW PUBLISHING HOUSE - DAY

           Betty sits opposite her BOOK EDITOR.

                                 BETTY
                        I need to write another book.

                                 EDITOR
                        About the presidency?

                                 BETTY
                        No. About being drunk.
           INT. BETTY’S OFFICE - DAY

           Betty kicks off her shoes and pours herself a seltzer.

           She sits at her desk and stares at a pad of paper in front of 
           her. She taps a pen against it for a moment and then writes at 
           the top of the page - A Glad Awakening.

           She puts the pen down, leans back in her chair and closes 
           her eyes. 

           A VIBRANT MEMORY --

           A young Betty dances in CHRONICLE. Martha Graham leads the 
           troupe - their costumes and set starkly monochrome. 

           The dance is rigorous and ecstatic. Betty and the others leap, 
           swirl, lunge. Betty’s heart pounds. Her face pours with sweat. 

           As the troupe reach and hold their final poses, there is a 
           pause before the audience burst into rapturous applause. 

           Betty takes her bow amongst the troupe, adoring the attention. 

           The women run off stage, where there’s a whirlwind of kisses 
           and congratulations. Betty stands amidst it all, thrilled. One 
           of the crew hands her a glass of champagne.

           From the wings, Betty watches with great admiration as Martha 
           performs a mesmerizing solo dance.

           Martha strikes an extraordinary final pose - her body and face 
           rigid with strength and tension. 

           Betty downs her glass of champagne. She drags her suitcase from 
           under a bench, pulls on her coat and, as applause rises from 
           the auditorium, slips out of a side door.

           As the door closes behind her, Betty takes a deep breath and 
           steps away.

                  I think I was born to be outspoken.
                  Hopefully it’s been of benefit to others.

                             Betty Ford 1918-2011

           The End.
