           EXT. CHINESE HIGHWAY - DAY

           The G4 Beijing-Hong Kong Expressway. Packed but flowing. A 
           postmodern Ford assembly-line. Just another 6AM on a Monday 
           when…

                                 JANE (V.O.)
                        People like to think they're the 
                        heroes of their own stories. And 
                        why not? For most people, it's 
                        true. Their stories are just really 
                        fucking boring. Wake up, go to 
                        work, go home, sleep. Rinse, wash, 
                        repeat.

           A Bugatti Veyron needles artfully into the artery of traffic. 

                                 JANE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        But what if it were all a lie? What 
                        if there was an invisible hand 
                        guiding them all along, and the 
                        free will they thought they had was 
                        actually just a sandbox in Rikers? 

           SCREECH! An armored van BARRELS ANGRILY towards the Bugatti. 

           The van's tailpipe bounces against the road behind it like a 
           stone skipping on water. TAT-A-TAT-TAT-TAT. In the front, the 
           van's bumper and hood are bunched up, ripped skin hanging 
           over an open wound.

           This is a van on a war path.

           Inside the Bugatti, JANE (mid 20s, Imperator Furiosa in 
           spirit, Rory Gilmore in shell) swings a hard left, LUNGING 
           INTO THE NEXT LANE JUST SECONDS AHEAD OF A 16 WHEELER.

                                 JANE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        No one wants to think about that, 
                        of course. So let's get back to 
                        stories. My story.

           In her rearview mirror, Jane sees the armored van GUNNING 
           TOWARDS HER, weaving sharply between lanes. She looks at the 
           road ahead, then back at the rearview mirror. 

           THE VAN IS GONE.

                                 JANE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Most people's stories are about how 
                        they lived.

           Jane punches the accelerator when-- 
           A STACCATO OF GUNFIRE SPRAYS the body of her car. She turns 
           to her right. The armored van is now neck-to-neck with her -- 
           the muzzle of an AR-15 trained at her head.

           Jane pumps the brakes, precipitously slowing down. The 16 
           wheeler BLARES ITS HORN. It looks like SHE'S GOING TO GET 
           MOWED OVER when -- 

           -- SHE PITCHES RIGHT, CUTTING THROUGH THREE LANES OF TRAFFIC 
           AND CLIPPING THREE CARS IN THE PROCESS. She leaves a wake of 
           sparks and shrieking metal.

           The armored van follows in pursuit. Gains speed. Darts onto 
           the shoulder to Jane's right.

           THUNK! 

           A serrated HARPOON RIPS through behind Jane. CATCHES on the 
           steel body it punctured.

           The Bugatti JERKS towards the van. The harpoon connects to it 
           via a steel, umbilical-like cord. Ahab and his whale.

           Jane looks over and grips the wheel. Braces herself. Hopes 
           she's wrong to be an atheist. Then RAMS HER CAR INTO THE VAN. 

           BOTH CARS SOMERSAULT HEAD OVER HEELS OVER THE HIGHWAY'S 
           RAISED EDGE.

                                 JANE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Mine is about how I died.

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. APARTMENT - BOSTON - MORNING

           CHYRON: 18 YEARS AGO

           Wearing a "Doctors Without Borders" shirt, ALICE (late 30s) 
           wheels a squeaky, weathered suitcase towards the front door.

           A teary-eyed young Jane (6) bounds up and throws her arms 
           around her.

                                 JANE
                        Why do you have to go, Mommy?

                                 ALICE
                        A lot of bad things happen in the 
                        world, sweetheart. We all need to 
                        do what we can to put in some good.

           Jane looks away, upset.
                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Want to see a magic trick?

           Jane looks back, unsure whether to take the bait. 

                                 JANE (V.O.)
                        I guess I should start at the 
                        beginning. This part was good. 

           Alice picks up a styrofoam cup and holds it in her hands.

                                 ALICE
                        Want me to make it float?

           Jane nods shyly. Alice stares hard at the cup. Mutters an 
           incantation. Then--

           The cup starts LEVITATING ABOVE HER LEFT HAND.

                                 JANE
                        Wow!

                                 ALICE
                        Must be magic, huh? 

           Jane nods vigorously.

           Alice turns the cup towards Jane. There's a hole in it, which 
           Alice grips with her thumb.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        When you were listening to my voice 
                        and watching my fingers wiggle, I 
                        made this hole. 

                                 JANE
                        Woah!

                                 ALICE
                        Magicians distract you from the 
                        truth. They direct your attention 
                        to where they want your attention 
                        to be.
                            (then)
                        Now, you try.

           Alice gives Jane the cup. Jane stares hard at it, then makes 
           it levitate too. Alice smiles.

           Jane's dad, BRUCE (late 30s), walks in wearing an apron.

                                 BRUCE
                        Time for breakfast!
                                 JANE
                        Pancakes?

                                 BRUCE
                        Bran Flakes.

                          JANE
           Ugh! GROSS!
                                                      ALICE
                                           Gross! Why are you wearing an 
                                           apron?

           Jane performs the cup levitation magic trick for Bruce.

                                 JANE (V.O.)
                        The next parts were not so good.

           Suddenly, red and blue lights flood the window.

           Bruce walks to the door. Two POLICEMEN stand outside, grim.

                                                           CUT TO:

           A swarm of cicadas crawl over an oak tree in front of the 
           apartment.

           VFX: GRAINY GREEN SCALE FOOTAGE of the tree and, in the B.G., 
           the policemen entering Jane's apartment. 

           It's surveillance footage. Somebody is watching.

           INT. GRIFFIN FINAL CLUB - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           CHYRON: 5 YEARS AGO

           An elite college society. Stuffed animal busts. Smoldering 
           cigars. Gilded ashtrays.

           A group of tuxedoed MEN IN ANIMAL MASKS file into the dining 
           room and line up on one side of the table. On the other sits 
           a row of the eager and mask-less. The candidates.

           A bell is rung. The men in masks take their seats. A MAN IN A 
           PIG MASK sits at the head of the table. 
                                 MAN IN PIG MASK
                        A toast!

           Everyone raises their glasses.

                                 MAN IN PIG MASK (CONT’D)
                        To everyone in this room. Welcome 
                        to the final round of punch.

           Everyone cheers. 

           There are only two women among the mask-less. Jane (19) is 
           one of them.

                                 MAN IN PIG MASK (CONT’D)
                        Each of you will now tell us a 
                        story. About what or whom is 
                        entirely up to you. My only advice: 
                        be memorable.
                            (then)
                        Who wants to kick things off?

           A muscular, TALL PUNCH stands up, his neck thick as a 
           stockpot.

                                 TALL PUNCH
                        I will, Sir Don Quixote. When I was 
                        summering in St. Tropez with my 
                        family--

           A tale of blustering bravado. An OBNOXIOUS CLUB MEMBER 
           catcalls.

                                 OBNOXIOUS CLUB MEMBER
                        Tuck your dick back in your pants!

           SFX: The Tall Punch's voice sounds watery and dreamlike. A 
           world away. It starts to fade as the camera focuses on Jane. 

           One of these things is not like the others -- in more than 
           one way.

           Another catcall. Then the Tall Punch's voice regains aural 
           clarity.

                                 TALL PUNCH
                        So even if you don't remember me, 
                        Taylor Swift's new album will.

           The room bursts into applause and more catcalls.

                                 MAN IN PIG MASK (CONT'D)
                        To Punch Taubman!
           Everyone raises their glasses and drinks. The room throbs 
           with inebriation and ritual.

           The Man in the Pig Mask turns to Jane.

                                 MAN IN PIG MASK (CONT'D) (CONT’D)
                        Punch Marshall.

           Jane nervously stands.

                                 JANE
                        Hello sirs and vixens, fellow 
                        punches. 

           Jane takes out some notecards from her pocket.

                                 JANE (CONT'D) (CONT’D)
                        I never thought I'd make it here. 
                        To Harvard. My mom died when I was 
                        young, and it was a struggle for my 
                        dad to make ends meet. Luckily, I 
                        got a full-ride because someone 
                        thinks I'm good at computers. So to 
                        be here, at the Griffin Club for 
                        punch -- I can hardly believe it. 

           Eyes glaze over. Sincerity has no currency here.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                            (reading the room)
                        And you know what? I don't think I 
                        do. My guess is I was punched as a 
                        joke.

           A few members glance around.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        It's fine. I never wanted to join 
                        anyways. I just wanted to drop this 
                        off--

           She throws a folder onto the table. Papers and photos fly 
           everywhere. The Man in the Pig Mask picks up one of the 
           papers.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        It's kind of an open secret, isn't 
                        it? The bad things that happen 
                        here. The really bad things. Like 
                        what happened to my roommate. 
                            (then, hardening)
                        Most of you aren't predators, but 
                        the ones who aren't still protect 
                        the ones who are.
                                 (MORE)
                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        You'd think somebody would have a 
                        better moral compass--

                                 MAN IN PIG MASK
                        What is this?

           His voice is calm. Tempered. Terrifying.

                                 JANE
                        It's everything. All the security 
                        footage, the emails, the texts, the 
                        phone calls -- all the evidence the 
                        Ad Board will need to expel you. 
                        All of you.

           Jane turns to the other woman.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Did you know they have three 
                        bedrooms upstairs? Three bedrooms 
                        with three beds. No dressers, no 
                        desks, no chairs. Just three beds.

                                 OBNOXIOUS CLUB MEMBER
                        How did you get all this??

                                 JANE
                        Turns out Harvard was right: I am 
                        very good at computers.

           The Obnoxious Club Member angrily grabs all the files and 
           throws them into the fireplace.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Those were your copies. A courtesy. 
                        President Brown already has them in 
                        his inbox.
                            (then)
                        Was that memorable enough for you?

           Everyone in the room stares at Jane. Then, the Man in the Pig 
           Mask takes off his mask. Smiles. It's chilling. 

                                 MAN IN PIG MASK
                        Let me tell you what's going to

                        expunged. Wiped off the face of the

           The room erupts in shouting. Taunting. The men in masks throw 
           drinks and spit on Jane as she walks calmly towards the exit.

           PRESIDENT BROWN sits, peeved, behind his desk. There's a 
           knock on the door. The Obnoxious Club Member walks in.

           A MAN IN A NAVY SUIT (60s) stands by a window. He looks at 
           the Obnoxious Club Member, then at the President. 

           The Man in a Navy Suit walks over to the President's desk and 
           takes out a checkbook.

                                 JANE (V.O.)
                        It turned out he was right, of

           INT. JANE'S CAR - MORNING

           CHYRON: 6 MONTHS AGO

           A bedraggled Jane sits behind the wheel of a beat-up old 
           Camry. She waits at a stoplight. Looks down at her almost-
           empty gas tank.

                                 JANE (V.O.)
                        Not immediately. But they'll pick 
                        up.

           As the light goes green, a grey Jeep FLIES in front of her. 
           She SLAMS THE BRAKES, narrowly avoiding collision.

                                 JANE
                        Fuck!

           Jane speeds up and next to the Jeep. HONKS. Lowers her window 
           to talk to the DRIVER (40s, natural-born dick).

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Hey! Hey! Sir! What you just did 
                        was very dangerous.

           The driver gives Jane the finger, then CUTS OUT in front of 
           her and SCREECHES TO A STOP.

           WHAM! Jane's car PLOWS into the Jeep. Airbags deploy in an 
           eruption of white. The Jeep driver peels off, leaving Jane's 
           front hood buckled like an accordion.

           Jane pounds the gas. Gains on the Jeep. Nearly on him when-- 

           The car lets out a guttural cry, then slows to a stop. She 
           looks down: the tank is empty. 

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. INSURANCE COMPANY - BULLPEN - DAY

           An incredibly sweaty Jane sits in a small cubicle. A nothing 
           job at a nothing company. The prophecy seemingly fulfilled.

           STEPHEN (30s, squishy) sidles up.
                                 STEPHEN
                        Hey.

           Jane grits her teeth.

                                 JANE
                        Hey, Stephen.

                                 STEPHEN
                        The printer's jammed up again.

                                 JANE
                        What a shame.

                                 STEPHEN

                        For the last time, Stephen, I'm IT, 
                        not Staples.

                                 STEPHEN
                        You're the closest thing we've got.

                                 JANE

           Jane stands at the printer as it spews out copy after copy of 
           coupons for coyote urine.

           A matronly woman, MARGE (40s, the Phyllis in this office), 
           stands next to her.

                        so sorry.

                        Don't sweat it, Marge.
                                 MARGE
                        So you went to Harvard, right?

                                 JANE
                        Yep.

                                 MARGE
                        I heard you were Phi Beta Kappa. 
                        Top of your class in computer 
                        science. That's very impressive.

                                 JANE
                        Thanks.

                                 MARGE
                        How'd you end up here?

           The printer makes a noise like it's choking, and smoke starts 
           billowing out.

           Jane walks to her car. Looks at the busted front hood. 
           Frowns.

           She walks to the driver's door and notices a flyer on it. It 
           has an image of a cicada. 

           Jane picks up the flyer, looks at it, then crumples it up, 
           tossing it on the ground. 

           She gets into her car. Backs up. Stops. Gets out. Picks up 
           the crumpled flyer.

           She looks at it again. A beat. Then she walks it over to the 
           recycling bin near the elevators.

           It's the same apartment Jane lived in as a kid, just older 
           and grayer. She walks in carrying bags of Chinese take-out 
           and a check in her teeth. 

           Bruce (now late 50s) sorts pills on a counter in the kitchen.

                                 JANE
                        Hey dad.

                        It's two red and two blue.

                        Got you kung pao chicken. Here's 
                        the rent.

                                 BRUCE
                        I can cover us, Jane. 
                            (then)
                        I should be taking care of you.

                        You should be on bed-rest.

           She kisses his forehead.

                        I need to wrap up some work. I'll 
                        be in my room.

           INT. APARTMENT - JANE'S ROOM - NIGHT

           A desk with three computer monitors. Tentacle-like wires 
           drape everywhere. Hard-drives litter the floor. 

           Within this technological nest is a training mannequin in the 
           middle of the room. On its face is a pig mask. 

           Jane wraps her hands with starch white athletic tape. Walks 
           up to the mannequin. Takes a breath. Then --

           BAM BAM BAM! Jane LAUNCHES A STEADY STREAM OF PUNCHES at it. 

           As she steps back, the mask falls off the mannequin, now just 
           a crumpled piece of plastic.

           Jane sits at her desk. RICK (30s, heart of coal), the guy in 
           the cube next to her, is on the phone with a customer.

                                 RICK
                        Well, I'm sorry for the 
                        misunderstanding, but 
                        unfortunately, your home wasn't 
                        covered by flood insurance.

           Jane looks over.

                                 RICK (CONT’D)
                        I'm very sorry to hear that, ma'am. 
                        No, I can't imagine what it's like 
                        to have three young children. It's 
                        just awful, I know.

           Rick looks over at Jane. He rolls his eyes and mimes firing a 
           gun into his head. 

                                 RICK (CONT’D)
                        We don't set out to mislead you--

           He presses mute.

                                 RICK (CONT’D)
                            (to Jane)
                        Oh my goddddd, she won't shut up!

                                 JANE
                        Did you set out to mislead her?

                                 RICK
                        I'm an insurance salesman.

                                 JANE
                        So, yes?

           Rick shrugs his shoulders. He un-mutes his phone.

                                 RICK
                        I can assure you I'm very familiar 
                        with your policy, but sure, I'll 
                        read it again.

           Jane opens up a window of code. 

           JANE'S POV: 

           Note: Whenever we are in Jane's POV, we see an enhanced, 
           almost superhuman vision of the world.
           Like a computer, her vision superimposes spreads of 
           information like maps, data, profiles, etc. Important details 
           are highlighted and augmented. Anything extraneous cuts out 
           like white noise. Within this vision, we are able to see 
           patterns and details that would otherwise be glossed over. 

           Within lines of inscrutable code, "BRONZEPKG" is highlighted. 

           Jane types quickly and ruthlessly, peeking at Rick every few 
           seconds to make sure his eyes are still trained on his 
           screen. Even to a layperson, Jane clearly possesses a level 
           of skill beyond what most Silicon Valley titans could muster.

           Finally, Jane types in "replace(BRONZEPKG, GOLDPKG)". Sits 
           back.

           END POV.

                                 RICK (CONT’D)

                                 JANE
                        Is she covered?

                                 RICK
                        There's no way I would have sold 
                        her this package at the price she's 
                        paying.

           Jane smiles. Despite it all, she's still her mother's 
           daughter.

                        Sorry again about the printing.

                        Totally. 

           Marge smiles, relieved she got this off her chest, and waves 
           goodbye.

           Jane starts to gather her things when a chat window appears 
           on her screen.

           Jane furrows her brow. Moves her mouse to close it when 
           another message appears.

                                 JANE
                        Rick?

           She stands up and looks over. Rick's got earbuds in and plays 
           air drums with pencils which then knock over his mug and 
           spill coffee all over him.

                                 RICK
                        Fuck!

                                 JANE
                        Yeah, didn't think so.

           Suddenly, a live-feed of Jane appears on her computer. 

           THE CAMERA IS ON. 

           She quickly covers it with a post-it. Almost immediately, her 
           phone BUZZES with a text from an unknown number:

                                 TEXT
                        Don't play hard to get, Jane.

           The screen goes dark. 

           Jane anxiously hits the power button. On. Off. On. Off. 
           Nothing. She unplugs and replugs her computer. Waits.
           The Apple logo appears. She sighs, relieved, when--

           THE APPLE IS REPLACED BY A CICADA. 

           Jane's phone BUZZES with another text:

                                 TEXT (CONT’D)
                        Join us.

                                 JANE
                            (texting)
                        Who is this?

                                 TEXT
                        We are Cicada 3301.

                                 JANE
                            (texting)
                        What do you want?

                                 TEXT
                        You.
                            (then)
                        We have all your records.

           A VIDEO appears of a young Jane giving a eulogy at her 
           mother's funeral. Then, SCANS of her social security card, 
           passport, college grades, police record…

                                 JANE
                            (texting)
                        WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT??

           There's no response.

           Jane grabs her purse and hurries out.

                                                           CUT TO:

           EXT. INSURANCE COMPANY - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Skittish, Jane walks quickly towards her car. Freezes. 

           IT'S COMPLETELY COVERED IN FLYERS. They all have the same 
           image of a cicada comprised of code.

           As she tears all the flyers off her car, we see a shadowy 
           figure watching her from several rows away.
           EXT. APARTMENT - LATER

           Jane parks her car and walks towards her apartment building. 
           Another shadowy figure surveils from a nearby complex.

           INT. APARTMENT - JANE'S ROOM - LATER

           Jane sits warily at her desk. She JUMPS as the tea kettle 
           starts whistling on the stove in the kitchen. She gets up to 
           turn it off.

           Jane walks back to her desk. Looks out the window and sees a 
           digital billboard. A lithe model poses libidinously as she 
           drinks coconut water.

           Suddenly, the billboard wipes out to white. A line of red 
           text appears: "LOOK DOWN, JANE MARSHALL."

           Jane looks back at her computer and sees a blown-up photo of 
           an old red car. 

           Jane's eyes WIDEN. She knows this car. A MAN IN A BLACK 
           HOODIE clips the brakes.

           A chat window pops up.

                                 CHAT WINDOW
                        Your mom's old car. The day she 
                        died.
                            (then)
                        She didn't die in a car accident, 
                        Jane. She was killed.

           There's a pause before the other user starts typing again.

                                 CHAT WINDOW (CONT’D)
                        They're coming for you too.

           Jane's phone starts emitting A HIGH-PITCHED SHRIEK. 

           She looks down and sees a full screen of code. The code 
           starts to scroll at dizzying clip as it also shrinks and 
           slowly reveals itself to be the cicada, once again.

           Jane blanches. Drops her phone as if it were radioactive.

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. INSURANCE COMPANY - BULLPEN - NEXT DAY

           Jane sits at her desk. Marge walks over.
                                 MARGE
                        Hi Jane! 

                                 JANE
                        Ah!!

           Jane jumps from the sudden interruption.

                                 MARGE
                        What's wrong?

                                 JANE
                        What? No, nothing. What?

                                 MARGE
                        I can't remember my new password.

           INT. INSURANCE COMPANY - MARGE'S CUBE - A LITTLE LATER

           Jane types away at Marge's computer. She pulls up a file.

                                 JANE
                        Here's the list of everybody's 
                        passwords. Yours is… here. 

           Jane points to it. It's under Rick's: "B00bshake".

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                            (re: Rick's password)
                        What does that even mean?

                                 MARGE
                        You have a list of all our 
                        passwords?

                                 JANE
                        The company does. The encryption 
                        technology here is Jurassic. I keep 
                        telling them to change it, but they 
                        won't listen.

           Then, underneath Marge's desk, she spots a crate of the 
           coconut water advertised on the billboard last night.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                            (whispering, wild-eyed)
                        Are you one of them?

                                 MARGE
                            (noticing Jane staring at 
                            the coconut water)
                        Do you, um, want one?
           Jane stares at her.

                                 JANE
                        Yes.

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. APARTMENT - JANE'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Jane takes a swig of coconut water and pulls up an old home 
           video. A young Jane wears a superhero costume.

                                 ALICE (OFF SCREEN)
                        What are you for Halloween this 
                        year, honey?

                                 YOUNG JANE (ON SCREEN)
                        A superhero!

                                 ALICE (OFF SCREEN)
                        Why did you want to be a superhero?

                                 YOUNG JANE (ON SCREEN)
                        I'm gonna save the world!

                                 ALICE (OFF SCREEN)
                        Super Jane!

           Jane races around the room, pretending to fly. Alice turns 
           the camera around to tape herself. It looks like she's 
           speaking to Jane now, beyond the grave.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        That's right, honey. You're going 
                        to do big things. You're going to 
                        save the world.

           Jane cringes. In this ratty old apartment, in her shitty 
           office job -- she's done nothing big. Nothing important.

           Suddenly, she freezes. She sees something in the video that 
           chills her to the bone:

           ON THE WALL, THERE'S A PINNED CICADA IN A GLASS FRAME. An 
           entomological curiosity now a picture of horror.

           Jane looks at her mother's face in the screen.

                                 JANE
                        Who were you? What were you a part 
                        of?
           She picks up the lone surviving Cicada flyer. Off Jane's 
           resolved look, we...

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. APARTMENT - JANE'S ROOM - MONTAGE

           SERIES OF SHOTS

           Whereas most hackers have an OCD-like attention to detail, we 
           see through this sequence that Jane's technical strength is 
           pattern-recognition. The ability to see the forest for the 
           trees.

           A) The flyer lies on Jane's desk. The coded image of the 
           cicada stares back at us.

           Fingers flying over her keyboard, Jane soon finds that the 
           0's and 1's in the image translate into a website.

           She types the web address into her computer and finds a page 
           filled with small dots.

           She pauses and thinks. Leans back.

           JANE'S POV:

           As certain dots fade into the background, we see that THE 
           PAGE IS AN OPTICAL ILLUSION -- A MAGIC EYE FOR THE TWENTY-
           FIRST CENTURY. Jane gasps.

           RACK FOCUS TO REVEAL WHAT'S HIDDEN: A 4CHAN SUBSITE.

           END POV.

           Jane navigates to it.

           B) Jane reads the text on the subsite aloud:

                                 JANE
                        "I am a black child sprung from a 
                        bright sire… A wingless bird, 
                        fleeting to heaven from earth…  
                        Each eye that meets me weeps, but 
                        not from grief… And in thin air I 
                        vanish at my birth. What am I?"

           A window with an empty text box pops up. 

           JANE'S POV:

           Jane paces around the room.
                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        A black child sprung from a bright 
                        sire. Bright sire. Bright sire… 

           She looks out the window.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        The sun? The stars? A streetlamp?

           VFX: She superimposes a list of possibilities and mentally 
           crosses out each one.

           She looks around her apartment. Zeroes in on a candle.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        A fire… 

           She picks up a box of matches from her coffee table. She 
           strikes a match and lights the candle.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                            (realizing)
                        Smoke.

           END POV.

           Jane clicks on the text box and enters the answer.

           C) All the windows on her computer disappear. A lone chat 
           window pops up.

                                 CHAT WINDOW
                        We have installed a Trojan horse in 
                        your computer that will collect and 
                        send all records of your previous 
                        hacks to the FBI. You have two 
                        minutes to shut it down.

           A countdown clock appears.

           Jane panics. Her fingers fly over the keyboard. She opens up 
           a terminal and types in: "shutdown -r now".

           An error message pops up: "The system is locked. Access 
           denied."

           She tries again: "# wipe /dev/sda2" then "Okay to WIPE 1 
           special file ? (Yes/No) yes"

           The error message appears again.

                                 JANE
                            (looking at monitor)
                        Why can't I shut you down?
           JANE'S POV:

           She scrolls through the code at light-speed, combing for any 
           crumb that might help her. Then she leans back and sees it: 
           the Apple logo on her monitor.

           END POV.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                            (realizing)
                        The virus is in the operating 
                        system.

           She clicks on "System Preferences," then "Software Update". 

           A window pops up: "Upgrade to Mac OS Delgado?" She clicks 
           "yes".

           The upgrade downloads, then completes.

           A beat.

           A chat window pops up: "Congratulations. Few have made it 
           this far."

           D) The window closes and is replaced by a blank, black page.

           Jane squints at the page, not seeing anything. She pulls up 
           the source code.

           JANE'S POV:

           While she scrolls through the code, Jane SEES THE REFLECTION 
           OF HERSELF on the all-black screen.

           She hovers her cursor over the black, highlighting it and 
           revealing the next clue.

           END POV.

           E) To indicate the passage of time, we fly through a TIME-
           LAPSE of Jane at the computer, then pacing around the room, 
           then scribbling on paper, then writing equations on her 
           window, etc. 

           F) Hidden in code in her terminal is the final clue:

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                            (reading aloud)
                        "To gain entrance, you must knock 
                        three times on the sky and listen 
                        to the sound."
           Jane walks around her room, knocking on walls and doors. She 
           picks up a tennis ball. Tosses it against a wall. Listens to 
           the ambient sounds of the city.

           JANE'S POV:

           SFX: We focus on different sounds, one at a time: a firetruck 
           gunning down the street, a bird chirping, neighbors arguing, 
           construction workers drilling into the ground.

           As Jane continues to throw the tennis ball at the wall, we 
           focus on the sound of the ball. Suddenly, she stops. 

           Jane pings the web address three times, and a ream of data 
           shoots back. To a layperson, it's unintelligible garble. To 
           Jane, it's El Dorado. 

           She sits down giddily at her computer and starts decoding the 
           ribbons of numbers. 

           END POV.

           G) A set of coordinates and a time -- 10:33AM -- blink back 
           at her. The gold at the end of this rainbow. 

           She looks it up on Googles Maps and finds a private tarmac at 
           Boston Logan. 

           Adrenaline pumping, Jane scribbles a note for Bruce on the 
           kitchen table: "Gone on business trip. Be back in a few days. 
           Love, J"

                                                           CUT TO:

           EXT. PRIVATE TARMAC - MORNING

           Jane walks onto the sprawling tarmac, cavernous hangars 
           yawning behind her. 

           There's nobody around, but, conspicuously, there is one 
           Cessna Citation Longitude jet sitting outside. It hums gently 
           as it idles, seemingly waiting for Jane to board.

           Jane looks around. She's alone. She walks around the jet. 
           Inspects it carefully.

           After a moment of hesitation, Jane climbs the stairs to the 
           jet's door.

                                 JANE
                            (to self)
                        This is crazy, this is crazy, this 
                        is crazy...
           She peeks inside. An automated voice startles her:

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE
                        Welcome, Jane Marshall. Please take 
                        a seat.

           Jane takes a deep breath, looks behind her, then steps 
           inside.

           The plane door closes, a pneumatic hiss hermetically sealing 
           her in.

           The interior is sleek, austere, antiseptic.

           Jane knocks on the pilot's door. No answer. She opens it and 
           finds:

           A bleeding-edge, fully automated, self-navigating aeronautics 
           system. It looks like something Elon Musk might have dreamt 
           up.

           Head spinning, Jane makes her way to the lone white, leather 
           seat. She checks its pockets and finds The Archidoxes of 
           Magic by Theophrastus Paracelsus.

           As she settles in, the wall in front of her flickers into a 
           screen.

           Inked illustrations bleed onto and dissipate from the screen 
           -- an allegorical fable depicted in a technological work of 
           art. An animated watercolor tableau.

           A voiceover narrates:

                                 WOMAN (V.O.)
                        There was once a group of prisoners 
                        who lived in a deep cave. They were 
                        bound so that they could not look 
                        to either side or behind them -- 
                        only straight ahead. They had been 
                        chained in that position all their 
                        lives. A great fire burned behind 
                        them, and all the prisoners could 
                        see were the shadows playing on the 
                        wall in front of them.

                        The prisoners watched the stories 
                        that these shadows played out, and 
                        because these shadows were all they 
                        ever got to see, they believed them 
                        to be the world. 

           The ink animation fades into white. It is again just a wall.

           The blinds on the plane's windows all descend. Jane soon 
           finds herself sitting in total darkness. 

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE
                        We recommend that you take this 
                        opportunity to rest, Jane Marshall. 

           A button lights up on her armrest to convert her seat into a 
           bed.

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE (CONT’D)
                        You'll find a blanket and pillow 
                        under your seat.

           Jane reaches under and pulls out a duvet and pillow.

                                 JANE
                        Well, if I die, at least I die in

           A mechanical whir as the blinds rise up. Jane blearily opens 
           her eyes. She sees that the plane is descending, and from the 
           looks of it, into a sprawling city.

           The plane glides onto blistering pavement. A compartment 
           slides out of the wall, offering Jane a black hood. 

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE
                        Please place this over your head.

                                 JANE
                        Hard pass.

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE
                        We insist that you comply. 
                        Otherwise, your candidacy will be 
                        terminated.

           Jane picks it up. Reluctantly puts it on.
           The plane slows to a stop. Jane hears the door hiss open.  
           Footsteps come onto the plane. She starts to bring her hands 
           to her hood -- maybe she can catch a glimpse -- but she is 
           gruffly handcuffed and pulled out of her seat.

           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           BLACK. 

           We see everything from Jane's POV. Chopin plays delicately in 
           the background. She also hears the din of a bustling, 
           metropolitan city.

           The car slows to a stop, and Jane is taken out. When her hood 
           is removed, she finds herself deep in some Parisian 
           arrondissement.

           MASKED CAPTORS forcibly push Jane into a gray, crumbling 
           building. She hears the locks turn behind her. 

           INT. PARIS CICADA HQ - VESTIBULE - CONTINUOUS

           Alone, again.

           In front of Jane now is a lectern and a book. She opens it up 
           and finds that it glows with black-and-white pictures -- a 
           continuation of the animation from the plane.

                                 WOMAN (V.O.)
                        One day, one of the prisoners was 
                        set free and dragged up to the 
                        mouth of the cave. First, his freed 
                        limbs gave him pain. Then, the toil 
                        of climbing upward gave him pain. 
                        But eventually, he reached the 
                        daylight of the outside world, and 
                        he was stunned. As his eyes 
                        adjusted, he began to see the 
                        world. The birds, the trees, the 
                        sun, the skies. He had at last seen 
                        the real truth. 

           When the story concludes, a painting before her POPS open, 
           revealing a cavernous shoot behind it. 

           The only way to go is down.

           Jane looks. There's a ladder. She takes a deep breath and 
           nervously threads her right foot onto the ladder's first 
           rung. 
                                 JANE
                            (to self)
                        Think about it, Jane. If they 
                        wanted to kill you, they would have 
                        already done it.

           It's a lot farther down than it looks. As Jane descends, the 
           little light from the previous room is swallowed up by 
           blackness.

           One step.

           Two steps.

           Another.

           After what feels like an eternity, Jane finally reaches the 
           bottom. 

           Light flickers from a candle on an oval oak table. Next to it 
           is a blank sheet of parchment and a quill.

           Jane tries checking her phone. Fuck. It's dead. 

           She touches the walls, looking for a trap door or hidden 
           room. Then, FOOTSTEPS APPROACH.

           She scrambles for her purse and pulls out a taser, bracing 
           for whoever -- whatever -- is coming.

           The footsteps get louder, crisper. 

           Click. Click. Click. Heels.

           GEMMA (early 30s) walks up to Jane. She's the kind of 
           haunting that would find you in your dreams and your 
           nightmares.
                                 GEMMA
                        Welcome to Paris. And 
                        congratulations. You have been 
                        invited to join Cicada.

           Gemma gestures towards the parchment next to Jane.

                                 JANE
                        I don't sign anything without 
                        reading the fine print. 

                                 GEMMA
                        If you don't sign, your candidacy 
                        will be terminated.
                            (then, looking at Jane's 
                            taser)
                        Leave that on the table when you're 
                        done.

           Gemma walks away.

           Jane thinks. Fuck. Doesn't have much of a choice. Fuck. 

           She reaches for the quill. No ink. A cursory glance around 
           the room isn't promising. 

           She looks again at the quill's sharp edge, realizing.

                                 JANE
                        A little dramatic, don't you think? 

           But Gemma's gone.

           Jane takes the quill and makes a small incision in her left 
           forearm. She digs the quill into the wound. Winces. Draws 
           enough blood to sign.

           Jane stares at her signature. A literal blood oath.

           She puts the quill down, takes the candle, and walks down the 
           hallway.

           On the wall, glue-like mold drapes over centuries-old stone. 
           There are errant spatters of red -- origin unknown.

           At the end of the hallway, Jane finds a gnarled, wooden door. 
           She tries pushing it. 

           Nothing.

           She throws all her weight against it. Still nothing. 

           Jane looks around for clues -- a latch, a key, a symbol, 
           anything.
                                 JANE (CONT’D)

                            clue)
                        "To gain entrance, you must knock 
                        three times..."

           Realizing, Jane wraps her fingers around a rusting iron ring. 
           Knocks once. Twice. Three times.

           INT. PARIS CICADA HQ - BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS

           THE DOOR MOANS OPEN. Gemma stands behind it.

                        Deep cut.

                                 GEMMA
                        You're actually supposed to pull 
                        it.

                                 JANE
                        Oh. So the three knocks...

                                 GEMMA
                        Had nothing to do with it.

                                 JANE
                        Right.

           Inside, Jane finds a hacker's paradise: banks of computer 
           monitors and the world's most advanced tech outfits. The 
           monitors all display security footage from the most covert 
           locations in the world: the Oval Office, the bullpen of the 
           NSA, North Korea's Ryongsong Residence, the Cabinet Room at 
           10 Downing Street, etc.

           Sitting underneath the monitors are a dozen men and women all 
           intensely focused on the screens in front of them.

                        invisible. You'd never know about 
                        it unless you knew about it. The

                        disasters that Cicada was able to

                        working on "redistributing" their 
                        funds.

                                 JANE
                        Redistributing?

                                 BEATRICE
                        Siphoning them back into their 
                        original accounts.

                                 JANE
                        How has no one broken the emergency 
                        glass?

                                 BEATRICE
                        Cloaked server-side mirrors. They 
                        go down the same day they go up. 
                        Protracts the process, but --

                                 JANE
                        They leave no trace.

           Jane takes this in, impressed.

           Down the row, DMITRI (30s, lives a very full life online) 
           starts cursing at his screen.

                                 DMITRI
                        Fuck fuck fuck! Gemma! Get over 
                        here!

           Gemma looks at Jane, then runs over.

                                 DMITRI (CONT’D)
                        We've got a situation.

           INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS

           In a crowded plane, a WOMAN IN A BLACK BURQA unbuckles her 
           seat belt and walks slowly towards the galley. In the 
           adjacent aisle, another WOMAN IN A WHITE BURQA does the same.
           The STEWARDESS sees both women walking towards her. Reaches 
           for a GUN tucked inside a beverage cart, but--

           BANG! Then--

           THUD. She drops onto the floor, a bullet between her eyes.

           People SCREAM.

           The women in white and black rip off their burqas to reveal 
           that THEY ARE TWO MEN ARMED TO THE TEETH. PISTOLS. ASSAULT 
           RIFLES. GRENADES. 

           Shouting in Arabic, both men wave glocks at everyone in the 
           cabin.

           INT. PARIS CICADA HQ - BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS

           On Dmitri's screen, we see surveillance footage of the Libyan 
           Presidential Council Chambers. It's a flurry of activity.  

                                 DMITRI
                        ISIS hijacked a plane out of 
                        Tripoli. Commercial liner. 347 
                        civilians on board. They're holding 
                        everyone for ransom.

                                 GEMMA
                        How much?

                                 DMITRI
                        500 million dollars. The Libyan 
                        Presidential Council is refusing to 
                        pay. They've got their intelligence 
                        teams working on it, but--

                                 GEMMA
                        Is there money we can divert over?

           Dmitri snorts.

                                 DMITRI
                        Yeah, like no one's going to miss 
                        500 million dollars.

                                 JANE
                        They won't if they don't know it's 
                        missing. 

           Gemma and Dmitri look at Jane. She slides into the seat next 
           to Dmitri and pulls up a terminal on the computer.
                                 DMITRI
                            (to Gemma)
                        Who is she?

                                 JANE
                        Like with Lieberman, if we put in a 
                        server-side mirror, then none of 
                        the data will leave the network. 
                        We'll catch the transaction 
                        internally.
                            (then)
                        I'm Jane.

                                 GEMMA
                        Marshall. 

                                 DMITRI
                        Well, Jane Marshall, we need 
                        someone whose funds are robust 
                        enough--

                                 JANE
                        Qatar. They can deny it all they 
                        want, but they've sent money to 
                        ISIS before. It'll be the easiest 
                        way for us to get the money in and 
                        then out once they land the plane.

           A beat.

                                 DMITRI
                        Qatar'll do.

           Jane types furiously.

                                 GEMMA
                        It won't work. It's one thing for 
                        Lieberman's people not to find out. 
                        It's another for the bank of Qatar 
                        not to detect a breech.

                                 JANE
                        It just needs to work long enough 
                        for ISIS to think they got the 
                        money. In the meantime, we also 
                        hack into the plane's systems and 
                        take it over remotely. Get it to 
                        the closest UN country nearby so 
                        they land somewhere safe. Italy 
                        probably. You--

                                 DMITRI
                        Dmitri.
                                 JANE
                        Figure out how to get into the 
                        plane's MCAS. I'll take care of the 
                        money.

           Dmitri locks eyes with Gemma. She takes breath. Thinks. Nods.

           Dmitri gets to work.

           Next to him, Jane hunkers over the computer. Shoulders 
           bunched. Eyes focused.

           Gemma looks at the screen. All she sees is a spectral river 
           of 1's and 0's. But when Jane looks...

           JANE'S POV:

           The reams of code get smaller and smaller until they become 
           Seurat dots making up the faces of the Qatar Emir's five 
           closest associates.

           She pulls up classified files. Gemma looks over her shoulder.

                                 GEMMA
                        What are you doing? We need to get 
                        into the bank.

                                 JANE
                        This is how we get in. 

                                 GEMMA
                        None of these people have the money 
                        we need.

                                 JANE
                        We don't get in through the Emir of 
                        Qatar. We get in through his team. 

           Jane whips through the files.

           She creates a graph of all their recent withdrawals. As she 
           squints at the screen, she notices something:

           Five identical data points at different times in the same 
           month.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        See? There's one guy making the 
                        same large sum withdrawal five 
                        times a month.

           She pulls up a different window of code.
                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        If he's making five large sum 
                        withdrawals a month, it's not 
                        bread-won money. It's blood money. 
                        He must be linked to the Emir's 
                        accounts. He's our back door.

           END POV.

           A few more keystrokes.

           Jane stops. Waits. Then--

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        I'm in. Transferring the money now. 

           INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS

           One of the men gets a call. He picks up his phone.

           INT. PARIS CICADA HQ - BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS

                                 JANE
                        They've got the money. Dmitri?

           Dmitri has his head in his hands as he stares at his screen.

                                 DMITRI
                        I'm in, but I haven't been able to 
                        take over. The pilots need to cede 
                        control.

                                 JANE
                        Can we get a message to them?

                                 DMITRI
                        Already sent. Three, actually. They 
                        were sent to the main console, so 
                        they have to have seen them. I'm 
                        not seeing any signal interference.

           JANE'S POV:

           Jane pulls up Libyan Airway's internal database. Searches 
           through the code. Finds personnel information for the flight.

                                 JANE
                        The scheduled pilots for this 
                        flight called in sick. 
                            (then, realizing)
                        The pilots are in on it.
                                 (MORE)
                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        The ransom was a diversion. They're 
                        going to crash the plane anyways.

           One of her terminals start to flicker. All the code shifts 
           down one line.

           To most people, it looks like a momentary blip. But Jane 
           knows:

           An unknown user has signed onto the terminal.

           END POV.

           Without missing a beat, Jane unplugs her computer, then 
           Dmitri's.

                                 DMITRI
                        What the fuck are you doing??

                                 JANE
                        They planted a Remote Access 
                        Trojan. It was a trap. Someone knew 
                        we were coming.

                                 GEMMA
                        Shit! 

           Jane plugs their computers back in.

                                 JANE
                        We need to build new firewalls. 
                        Now. Otherwise, they'll get access 
                        to everything here. Everything will 
                        be compromised.

           Her fingers fly over the keyboard, rapidly constructing a 
           digital fortress we can visualize via VFX.

           After a flurry of typing, she stops. 

           A beat.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        I failed.

                                 DMITRI
                        You couldn't build the firewalls?

                                 JANE
                        No, the firewalls are up. The 
                        plane...

                                                           CUT TO:
           INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS

           The plane starts to NOSEDIVE. Unbuckled passengers hit the 
           cabin ceiling. Babies scream. People desperately call loved 
           ones.

           With the plane HURTLING downwards, we CUT BACK TO:

           INT. PARIS CICADA HQ - BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS

           Jane sits quietly, shaken by the repercussions of her 
           failure.

                                 JANE
                        I don't understand. How could they 
                        have known? 

                                 ADAM (O.S.)
                        ISIS didn't. Someone used them to 
                        draw us out.

           ADAM (70s, avuncular... if your uncle's ordered some hits), 
           enters the room.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Hello Jane.

                                 JANE
                        Who are you?

                                 ADAM
                        My name is Adam. Come with me.

           Jane looks at Gemma, who nods at her.

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. PARIS CICADA HQ - NARTHEX - CONTINUOUS

           A circular library. Some of the world's most arcane titles 
           line the linden wood shelves -- Codex Seraphinianus, 
           Heptameron, The Picatrix, etc.

           Adam pours Jane and himself each a glass of scotch. Hands 
           Jane a glass.

           She looks away, distant. Sick to her stomach.

                                 ADAM
                        You should be proud of what you 
                        just did. You prevented a 
                        cyberattack against Cicada.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                            (then)
                        As you found out, that plane was 
                        going down no matter what. 

           Jane's eyes meet his. There's a callousness in the way he 
           speaks that is unsettling. 

           In this moment, her adrenaline fades. Gives way to the 
           reality of why she's here. She focuses.

                                 JANE
                        I'm not here to talk about that. 

           Jane looks suspiciously at her glass of scotch.

           Adam holds up a remote and presses play. An audio recording 
           of Jane from the chute plays:

                                 JANE (CONT’D)

                        Think about it, Jane. If they 
                        wanted to kill you, they would have 
                        already done it.

                                 ADAM
                        That plane was a trap planted by an 
                        organization called Zero. 

                                 JANE
                        I told you, I'm not here to talk 
                        about--

                                 ADAM
                        Your mother was a good woman and a 
                        good friend. It was Zero that 
                        killed her.

           A beat.

                                 JANE
                        How did you know her?

                                 ADAM
                        She was one of Cicada's founding 
                        members.

                                 JANE
                        Then why hadn't I heard of it until 
                        three days ago?

                                 ADAM
                        Technically, we don't exist.

           Adam takes a sip from his drink.

                        Your mother died for a cause. One 
                        which we still aim to achieve.
                            (then)
                        Zero became aware of our existence. 
                        Of her involvement. Her loss was a 
                        great blow to Cicada.

                                 JANE
                        I think it was probably a greater 
                        blow to the husband and six year 
                        old daughter she left behind.

                                 ADAM
                        Yes.

                        I'm sorry about your mother, Jane, 
                        but I hope you'll hear me out. We 
                        chose you to join us because you 
                        are your mother's daughter. You're

                        uniquely remarkable way.

           Adam leads Jane down a labyrinthine tunnel careening further 
           and further underground. The whole compound is a scene out of 
           an Escher drawing.

                                 ADAM
                        Jane, tell me, how much do you know 
                        about contemporary world 
                        macroeconomics?

                                 JANE
                        Well, I studied Computer Science at 
                        Harvard.

                                 ADAM

                        Well, this is a fact that even the 
                        world's most esteemed economists 
                        don't know: all the bank systems in 
                        the world are linked by a stateless 
                        entity. Zero.

           EXT. OLDER CHATEAU - FLASHBACK

           Blades beating against a blue sky, a helicopter lands onto 
           the field near a medieval chateau. Out of its steel belly 
           emerges a MAN IN A SUIT (50s, white).

                                 ADAM (V.O.)
                        Zero works to quietly regulate the 
                        banks from behind a curtain no one 
                        even know exists. It maintains 
                        order and prevents worldwide 
                        economic collapse.

           INT. OLDER CHATEAU - CONFERENCE ROOM - FLASHBACK

           The Man in a Suit walks into a ritzy conference room. A group 
           of other old, white men mill about, sipping thousand-dollar 
           champagne.

                                 JANE (V.O.)
                        So they all went on a bender in 
                        2008?

                                 ADAM (V.O.)
                        2008 was sanctioned.

                                 JANE (V.O.)
                        So Zero is a bunch of assholes.

                                 ADAM (V.O.)
                        Zero is a group predicated, in 
                        theory, on the principle that it 
                        acts for the greater good. In 
                        practice, it's a whole other 
                        story...

           The blinds on the window descend. Someone clicks on an old-
           school projector, which beams images onto a screen. 

           The first is a headshot of Alice.

                        for many years.

                        been using it for less than

                                 JANE (V.O.)
                        Why do they have access?

           A FAT MAN walks up to the projector. He uses a red marker to 
           scrawl "X" over Alice's photo.

                                 ADAM (V.O.)
                        They're not the ones you're 
                        thinking of -- the ostensibly 
                        corrupt. No one like Kim Jung Un or 
                        Putin has access. Who we worry 
                        about are the much more discreet.

           EXT. APARTMENT - FLASHBACK

           A man we recognize: THE MAN IN THE BLACK HOODIE. We see him 
           clip the brakes on Alice's red sedan. He scurries away just 
           as Alice walks up to the car.

           EXT. BOSTON HIGHWAY - FLASHBACK

           Alice drives quickly down a highway. Sees one of the lanes 
           ahead is closed. Traffic slows down.

           She puts her foot on the brake. The car doesn't react.

           She presses harder. HARDER. The brake pedal is now flush with 
           the floor. 

           THE CAR'S NOT SLOWING DOWN.

           Alice HURTLES towards the stalled cars in front of her -- her 
           car a steel beast of insurgent velocity. Alice's eyes WIDEN 
           as we...

           It's a different conference room at a different chateau.

           The tech's improved. Someone clicks on a much more 
           sophisticated projector, which beams images in all 
           directions. 

           There are photos of heads of states, maps, government 
           budgets, real-time tickers of global stock markets.
           It's a digital war room.

           The suited men direct their attention towards a set of 
           proposals projected onto one of the walls.

                                 ADAM (V.O.)
                        People like the oil tycoons who 
                        fund dictatorships, the hedge fund 
                        managers who build their billions 
                        off the backs of the world's most 
                        vulnerable. They're the world's 
                        invisible influencers.

           We now INTERCUT between the men approving proposals and the 
           executions of those proposals:

           -The US stock market plunges 800 points.

           -Reporters announce that Xi Jinping will be President of 
           China for life.

           -Alarms blare as workers in a nuclear plant are obliterated 
           to dust by a subatomic blast.

           -Cartel thugs toss bodies into a mass grave.

           -And finally, the Libyan airliner plummets into the 
           Mediterranean Sea. 

                                 JANE (V.O.)
                        When does this "invisible 
                        influencing" occur?

                        But this year is unlike any other. 
                        This year, Zero is planning their

                            (then)
                        When they meet, Zero will funnel 
                        trillions of dollars into North 
                        Korea's defense program. Not just 
                        into their nuclear arms factories 
                        but also into their international 
                        sleeper cells. It will finally give 
                        them the ammo they need to unleash 
                        what they want: worldwide nuclear 
                        warfare. Complete chaos. Complete 
                        destruction. It'll be Zero's carte 
                        blanche to completely rebuild the 
                        world under their rule. 

           A beat as Jane digests this.

           They arrive at a door. Jane turns to Adam.

                                 JANE
                        So we need to stop them?

                        The mission isn't just to stop 
                        them. The mission is to destroy 
                        them.

           Adam swipes a keycard, which opens the door.

           INT. PARIS CICADA HQ - SANCTUM - CONTINUOUS

           Adam and Jane walk inside. It's a starkly white room, flood 
           lights illuminating an immaculate marble floor.
           It takes Jane a moment to adjust to the blinding white, but 
           then she sees it: the grisly images of war, genocide, human 
           trafficking. They compete over every last inch of real 
           estate. 

           It's a museum of the world's darkest evils.

                        A reminder of why we do what we do.

           Jane sees a photograph of a young girl, 7 at most, her face 
           knotted in both agony and relief. Her dead body lies atop a 
           dozen others.

                        it's Zero's greatest feat to date: 
                        making you feel like you're in 
                        control of your world when in fact 
                        it's all a construct. The world's

                        Do you really believe Cicada can 
                        pull it off?

                                 GEMMA
                        Don't you think we at least have to 
                        try?

           They share a moment of quiet as they look at the photographs. 
           Then--

                        I knew your mother, Jane. 

           Gemma hands Jane the book.

                        This was hers.

           It's Plato's Republic. Jane opens it. Notices a note her 
           mother scribbled on the back of the cover: 

                                 JANE
                            (reading aloud)
                        "Sometimes one must die in order to 
                        live." What does that mean?

                                 GEMMA
                        She devoted everything she had to 
                        our war with Zero, and she knew the 
                        consequences.
                            (then)
                        She believed in me the way I 
                        believe in you. We need you on 
                        this. 

           Jane swallows. Looks down at the book.

           Adam picks a book out of a shelf. Flips through it. Jane and 
           Gemma approach.

           Jane straightens her back. Something inside her is different. 
           Hardened. Resolved.

                                 JANE

                        Then I suppose it's time to meet

           Gemma, dressed in a white tank and denim shorts, snaps on a 
           pair of rubber gloves as she sits down next to a JAPANESE MAN 
           (20s, 80% of his body already inked).

                                 ADAM (V.O.)
                        Gemma is former Yakuza. 

           She turns on the pen, which starts buzzing and depositing 
           technicolor ink into the Japanese Man's neck.

                        You'll be glad she's on our side.

           He closes his eyes. Narrowing hers, Gemma STABS the pen into 
           the man's carotid artery. Blood BURSTS everywhere. Soaks 
           Gemma's white tank in crimson.

           Gemma stands over him as he takes thready, wet breaths. His 
           throat GURGLES with blood. He's dead within ten seconds.

           Yoked in munitions and cloaked in camouflage, SEO-JUN (50s, 
           Korean powderkeg) slinks quietly along in a forest.

                                 ADAM (V.O.)
                        Who is our arms specialist. In 
                        another life, he was a high-ranking 
                        Lieutenant… 

           Suddenly, the forest is PEPPERED BY GUNFIRE. Seo-Jun takes 
           out a machine gun and SQUEEZES OFF A ROUND with one hand. 
           With the other, he whips out a rifle and starts SPITTING 
           SHELLS in the other direction.

           After the smoke clears, we see that he stands alone amongst a 
           sea of bullet-chewed bodies.

                                 ADAM (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        …in North Korea.

           He takes off running farther into the forest, and we ZOOM OUT 
           to reveal that he's headed for the border.

                        Robert is former MI6. 

           A waiter whisks by and slips something into Robert's drink.

           Robert notices but takes another sip anyways.

           He then covertly follows the waiter behind the bar, and, in 
           one fluid motion, inserts a syringe into the waiter's arm, 
           then himself, while extracting a small black box hidden in a 
           champagne ice bucket.

                        Then there's Isabella. 

           Suddenly, a group of CARTEL THUGS bursts through the doors 
           and surrounds Isabella.

           Isabella puts her arms up, smirking.

                        the part where you beg for your 
                        life.

           Isabella continues smiling but does not respond.

           As the thugs look at each other, DRONES START FLYING IN 
           THROUGH THE DOOR, DROPPING GRENADES. The thugs look at each 
           other and dive away just as the grenades EXPLODE. 

           By the time the smoke clears, Isabella is gone, and the 
           thugs' broken bodies litter the floor.

                        found some photographs. Photographs 
                        of young boys.

           There's heavy breathing, but the Priest does not respond.

                        I don't judge you.

           Gemma picks a medicine ball off the ground and HURLS IT AT 
           JANE.

           Without thinking, Jane WHIPS HER BODY TO THE SIDE AS THE BALL 
           HURTLES BY, MILLIMETERS FROM HITTING HER.

                                 GEMMA
                        I can work with that.

                                 JANE
                        What the hell was that??

           In one quick motion, Gemma grabs another medicine ball and 
           HURLS IT AT JANE AGAIN.

           This time, it PUMMELS JANE IN THE STOMACH. She doubles over 
           in pain.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                            (struggling to breathe)
                        WHAT -- THE -- HELL -- IS -- YOUR -
                        - PROBLEM!?

                                 GEMMA
                        That was less promising. 

                                 JANE
                            (catching her breath)
                        Can't you get someone else to do 
                        the agent-ing part for me?

                                 GEMMA
                        You can't hack Bilderberg remotely. 
                        You need to be on site. 
                            (nodding at the training 
                            center)
                        What we're doing is basic field 
                        training. 

           Without warning, Gemma kicks the feet out from under Jane, 
           who lands with a thud.

                                 JANE
                        Stop doing things to me!

                                 GEMMA
                        Lesson one: expect the unexpected.
           Jane gets up.

                                 JANE
                            (annoyed)
                        Alright, lesson learned. 

           Gemma sweeps Jane's feet out again. THUD.

                                 GEMMA
                        Apparently not.

           Fists flying, Gemma delivers blow-after-blow. An outmatched 
           Jane finally crumples to the ground..

                                 GEMMA
                        Lesson two: pain is only temporary.

           Jane groans and curls into a ball. Gemma frowns.

           Jane stands over a deep, gaping pool with tall poles that 
           bridge the gap from one side to the other.

                                 JANE
                        So are there alligators at the 
                        bottom too? Or is that too Scooby 
                        Doo villain for you guys?

                                 ROBERT
                        Don't be ridiculous. The 
                        fluoroantimonic acid is a thousand 
                        times worse than any alligator 
                        could be. It'll eat through flesh, 
                        bone, metal, pretty much 
                        everything.
                            (grinning)
                        Plus, we don't have to worry about 
                        feeding it.

                                 JANE
                        That was a joke, right?

           Taking a few steps back, she LEAPS ONTO THE FIRST POLE, 
           barely holding her balance.
           The poles are thin, unforgiving. Jane takes a deep breath and 
           LUNGES ONTO THE NEXT ONE, which is over six feet away.

           Jane lands but WOBBLES WILDLY AS SHE TRIES TO MAINTAIN HER 
           BALANCE. Once stabilized, she looks back at Robert and gives 
           a thumbs up. Robert smiles, but Jane SLIPS, TUMBLING OVER THE 
           EDGE.

           At the last second, the tips of Jane's fingers manage to 
           catch the edge of the pole. Robert hops over. He hoists Jane 
           up onto the little real estate that remains.

                                 ROBERT
                        Lesson three: never get 
                        comfortable.

           Robert pushes Jane off the pole. SPLASH.

                        It's just water. The markup on acid

           Jane stands at a firing range in front of a row of 
           mannequins. She nervously holds a glock.

           Seo-Jun nods at her, and she begins firing. POP. POP. POP. 
           POP.

           A beat.

           None of the bullets have hit a mark.

                                 SEO-JUN
                        Lesson four: aim.

           He takes the glock and fires four shots. They each hit a 
           mannequin in the middle of the forehead.

           INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - PARIS - LATER

           A gaping maw with teeth of crates, raw steel, boxes, 
           corrugated machinery.

                                 ISABELLA
                        You have thirty seconds to get out.
                                 JANE
                        What happens if you find me?

                                 ISABELLA
                        Let's hope you don't find out.

           Isabella grins. A Cheshire smile. It's unnerving. 

           Jane's eyes dart around the room.

                                 ISABELLA (CONT’D)
                            (calling out)
                        Thirty! Twenty-nine! Twenty-
                        eight!...

           She continues to count down as Jane DUCKS behind a pile of 
           crates. 

           Jane tries to make sense of the space. She makes her way to 
           one of the walls and starts sprinting along the warehouse's 
           perimeter.

           As she does, she trips over a wire, SETTING OFF AN EXPLOSION 
           BEHIND HER. She dives behind a pile of scrap metal for cover.

                                 JANE
                        WHAT THE FUCK!?

           She makes her way towards the door they entered from but sees 
           Dmitri stationed next to it. He's holding a machine gun.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Guess that's not the exit...

                                 ISABELLA
                        Eighteen! Seventeen!

           Jane sets her eyes on an old Caterpillar hydraulic 
           excavator... but it's at the other side of the warehouse.

                                 ISABELLA (CONT’D)
                        Ten! Nine!

           Jane hesitates, then decides to make a run for it. 

           BOOM! She's SET OFF ANOTHER EXPLOSION BEHIND HER. 

           Weaving between pieces of falling, smoldering rubble, Jane 
           slides behind a pile of scrap metal just as Isabella reaches 
           the end of the countdown.

           Silence.

           THUMP. THUMP. 
           Jane hears heavy footsteps on the other side of the 
           warehouse. Looking around, she tries to find something that 
           could serve as a shield, a weapon -- anything.

           The footsteps get closer.

           THUMP. THUMP. THUMP.

           Jane trains her eyes on a lever in the Caterpillar, but it's 
           still a good twenty feet away. 

           THUMP. THUMP. THUMP.

           In a panic, Jane squeezes herself in a pocket of space 
           beneath the scrap metal.

           Thick, rubber boots appear. Jane holds her breath.

           The boots walk away. Jane sighs.

           Suddenly, the scrap metal above her is lifted off, and SHE IS 
           DRAGGED AND THROWN ONTO THE FLOOR.

           She looks up and sees that it's Dmitri. CLICK. He raises his 
           gun--

                                 JANE
                        Wait, wait! What the fuck!? This is 
                        TRAINING, isn't it!?

           --And FIRES! Jane DUCKS AND ROLLS AWAY, BARELY MISSING THE 
           BULLET. She lunges into the Caterpillar and shuts the door, 
           locking it. 

           Inside, Jane finds the lever and wraps her fingers around it. 

           Before she can pull it, Dmitri BREAKS THE GLASS BEHIND JANE 
           AND STARTS CLIMBING THROUGH. Jane grabs him by his hair and 
           SMASHES his head against the roof of the Caterpillar. 

           While he's momentarily stunned, Jane reaches back for the 
           lever. She pulls it and--

           Nothing.

                                 DMITRI
                            (whispering)
                        It's not on.

           Jane looks around, then back at Dmitri.

                                 JANE
                            (whispering too)
                        What?
                                 DMITRI
                        The machine. You have to turn it 
                        on.

                                 ISABELLA (O.S.)
                        Hey! Hey! Stop helping her!

           Jane looks around the panel and finds a key. She twists it to 
           the right, and the machine roars to life.

                                 JANE
                            (to Dmitri)
                        That was my next move.

           A beat.

           Dmitri LEAPS TOWARDS JANE. She DUCKS AND GETS BEHIND HIM, 
           SMASHING HIS HEAD INTO THE PANEL.

           She reaches once more for the lever. The arm of the 
           Caterpillar mirrors her movements, which then HURTLES TOWARDS 
           THE WALL. It SMASHES against it a few times before finally 
           BLASTING THROUGH to the other side.

           Jane slides out and onto the ground, where Isabella awaits 
           her.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        I thought you were the one I was 
                        supposed to be worried about.

                                 ISABELLA
                        Who says I'm not?

           She kicks over a black box, its cavity bursting with wires of 
           different colors. 

           Jane leaps towards the box and examines the wires. There's 
           green, blue, red, orange… 

           She makes a decision.

           Jane trepidatiously untangles a blue wire. Brings its frayed 
           end towards a red wire. Then--

                                 ISABELLA (CONT’D)
                        STOP!!

           Jane freezes. The wires are a razor's edge apart.

                                 JANE
                        You told me blue and red have a 89% 
                        statistical probability--
                                 ISABELLA
                        This falls into the other 11%.

           Jane thinks, trying to recall the protocol.

                                 ISABELLA (CONT’D)
                        You have thirty seconds, Jane.

           She thinks. Thinks. Thinks.

                                 JANE
                        White. I need the white one.

           Jane's fingers tremble as she combs through the wires, 
           searching desperately for white. She finds it in the very 
           back, knotted underneath a tangle of others. She tries to 
           pick her way through, but--

           Isabella grabs the box from Jane and HURLS IT OUTSIDE. 

           BOOM!!

           THE BOX EXPLODES. 

           Smoke billows from the bones that remain. Fire and charred 
           detritus rain everywhere.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                            (staring in disbelief)
                        What's lesson five?

                                 ISABELLA
                        Stay alive.

           Isabella points a pistol at Jane.

           Jane ROUNDHOUSE KICKS the gun out of Isabella's hand. 

                                 JANE
                        That's my plan.

           Isabella smiles. Not bad.

           Over a SERIES OF CUTS, we see Jane relive the past few scenes 
           -- only this time, she's achieves an almost clinical 
           perfection:
           -Jane spars with Gemma. It's a flurry of blows and kicks that 
           end with Jane SWEEPING GEMMA'S FEET OUT FROM UNDER HER. Gemma 
           lands. Hard. Jane smiles.  

           -Jane leaps from pole to pole with surprising alacrity and 
           grace. Robert stops his watch. 15 seconds.

           -Jane shoots. BANG. BANG. BANG. BANG. She squints through the 
           smoke. When it clears, we see that there's a hole in the 
           heads of all four mannequins.

           -At the warehouse, Jane TRADES PUNCHES WITH FIVE LARGE, BURLY 
           MEN. She DUCKS JUST AS ONE SLICES A MACHETE TOWARDS HER. Jane 
           weaves and launches from one pile of metal to another, 
           expertly avoiding the trip wires and taking down a Burly Man 
           as she goes. One-by-one, Jane KNOCKS OUT EACH OF THEM, 
           sending the last one FLYING THROUGH THE WAREHOUSE DOOR.

                                                           CUT TO:

           EXT. PARIS STREET - DUSK

           In a sleek Lamborghini Murcielago, Jane WHIPS OUT of an 
           underground garage. 

           She SURGES onto a street of commuters. Her driving is 
           graceful, poetic. 

           She slows at a stoplight. Out of nowhere, a Range Rover 
           CHARGES THROUGH THE LIGHT, NEARLY MOWING OVER A WOMAN PUSHING 
           A BABY IN A STROLLER.

           Jane's eyes narrow. When the light turns green, she BLASTS 
           TOWARDS THE ROVER IN PURSUIT. 

           Jane catches up to it by the next light. Jane rolls down her 
           window. 

           The DRIVER (30s, aspirationally thug-ish) looks over. He 
           grins, apparently liking what he sees. He rolls down his 
           window too.

                                 DRIVER
                            (in French)
                        Hey sweetheart.

           From Jane's POV, she sees the driver as FLASHES OF DIFFERENT 
           PEOPLE:

           -The Man in the Pig Mask. 

           -The Man in the Jeep.
           -The Man in the Black Burqa on the Libyan plane.

           She blinks. Back to normal.

           Jane pulls out a gun and aims it at the Driver.

           He SCREAMS.

           She points the gun at one of the Rover's front tires.  

           BANG.

           She aims it at his back tire. Shoots again.

           BANG.

           The tires hiss as gas gushes out. 

                                 JANE
                        I'm not your sweetheart.

           She smiles and speeds off.

           INT. PARIS CICADA HQ - TRAINING ROOM - LATER

           Jane and Gemma stand in front of the wall of weapons. Gemma 
           holds an unassuming black pen.

                                 GEMMA
                        If you hold the button at the end, 
                        the pen will emit high-frequency 
                        waves that can shatter pretty much 
                        any glass. But you can think of it 
                        more as a Swiss army knife. It can 
                        also--

           She swivels the pen.

                                 GEMMA (CONT’D)
                        --Serve as a laser.

           A laser shoots out and burns a hole in the wall.

                                 GEMMA (CONT’D)
                        If you open this compartment, an 
                        injectable sedative comes out.

           She switches open a side of the pen, and a syringe slides 
           out.
                                 JANE
                        Sweet. What else can it do?

           She clicks a button, and a tip comes out.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                            (excited)
                        Poison?

                                 GEMMA
                        No. It's also just a pen.
                            (then)
                        We'll of course arm you with higher 
                        grade weapons, but it's something 
                        easy to hide just in case.

           Jane takes the pen and tucks it into a back pocket.

                                 GEMMA (CONT’D)
                        Let's see what the rest of the 
                        cavalry's cooked up, shall we?

           Jane, Gemma, Adam, Robert, Isabella, Dmitri, and Seo-Jun sit 
           around the conference table. 

           Gemma drops a photo of François (60s, obviously French) in 
           the middle of the table.

                                 GEMMA
                        Alright, let's catch Jane up. This 
                        man's name is François Terrien. 
                        He's the Founder and CEO of 
                        Corveta. 

                                 JANE
                        The agrichemical firm?

                                 GEMMA
                        Among other things. More 
                        importantly, he's also the Director 
                        of Zero. The drive will be with 
                        him.

                                 JANE
                        What's the drive?

                                 ROBERT
                        The only way to gain access to 
                        Zero's systems. 
                                 DMITRI
                        Which is why this drive also has a 
                        fail-safe. Should François's heart 
                        stop beating, a signal will be 
                        triggered for the drive to self-
                        destruct. 

           Adam turns on the projector. On the screen, we'll see a high-
           tech computer simulation of their mission, which Adam 
           narrates:

                                 ADAM
                        François is scheduled to meet with 
                        Patrick Anderson, an Exxon board 
                        member, on Friday afternoon. Gemma 
                        will distract and disable the real 
                        Patrick while Robert takes his 
                        place. In the meantime, Isabella 
                        will set up and detonate a bomb in 
                        the basement of the chateau. That 
                        should draw out all the guards, 
                        leaving François unprotected. Seo-
                        Jun will be set up with his rifle 
                        on the roof of a neighboring 
                        building. Dmitri will be on 
                        surveillance nearby. Jane, you will 
                        be deployed on site. You'll only be 
                        able to gain access to the hotel's 
                        systems through a direct connection 
                        to the network. 

           He pauses. Looks around.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        We only have one shot to get this 
                        right. If we fail...

                                 GEMMA
                        We won't.

           Everyone sits back, metabolizing the gravity of the mission.

           Jane looks around. This is the first time she's seen anyone 
           at Cicada -- even Gemma -- betray a hint of uncertainty.

           The rich and powerful mingle at a palatial Chinese seaside 
           estate modeled after a Bavarian fairytale castle. Zuckerbergs 
           rub shoulders with Vanderbilts. The demographic here is very 
           white, very old, and very male.

           A fountain of Armand de Brignac bubbles next to a giant 
           goblet dripping with caviar. 

           Manufacturing magnates and banking titans discuss their 
           latest vineyard acquisitions like grocery store hauls.

           It's disgusting -- a sickening look into excess at its most 
           wanton.

           VFX: We now see everything through a tactical scope.

           Seo-Jun peers through the lens of the scope. He's lying on

           We see the back of a BELLMAN walking into the lobby. He 
           carries a messenger bag. A SECURITY GUARD stops him.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Where's your ID?

           We now see that the bellman is Jane. She flashes a smile, 
           then an ID badge at the guard. He scans it. 

           Jane holds her breath. The scanner beeps.

                                 SECURITY GUARD (CONT’D)

                        You're late. Hurry up and put your 
                        things away!

           Jane nods and walks briskly towards the service elevator. We 
           now see that she has an earpiece in. It connects her to every 
           other member of the team.

           INT. THE CASTLE HOTEL - BASEMENT - A LITTLE LATER

           Elevator doors open. Jane steps out. Locates an unmarked 
           door. 

           She takes out a small, metal disk and sticks it on the door, 
           near its handle. 

           Jane looks around. The coast is clear. She spots an alcove 
           thirty feet away and runs to it. 

           Jane takes out a black detonator. Takes a breath. Presses it.

           Boom!

           A small, controlled explosion. A few tendrils of black smoke 
           lick the disk. Other than that, the explosion has left no 
           other trace. 

           The door is now open. Jane slips inside.

           INT. THE CASTLE HOTEL - CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The brainstem of the hotel. Technicolor wires hang 
           everywhere. It's a canopy of cords and circuits.

           Jane takes out her computer and connects it to one of the 
           wires.

           Her eyes scan a terminal of code. She types. Waits. Clicks.

           Dmitri sits inside a van with monitors that line the entire

           monitors that are show surveillance footage from each 
           operative's POV.
           Suddenly, the inactive, black monitors all light up with CCTV

                        Get one of your toys.

           Patrick nods vigorously and leaps towards his suitcase.

           While Patrick digs through, an elbow wraps around his neck 
           from behind. 

           Gemma starts CHOKING him.

           He flails, bucking wildly. Gemma tightens her grip until his 
           limbs fall slack to the ground. 

           He's out.

           Gemma drags him towards the closet. While she does, we ANGLE 
           ON Patrick's suitcase and see some rope and a ball gag.

           With a scotch in hand, Robert navigates towards François, who 
           chats with some ASSOCIATES. Two GUARDS stand discreetly 
           nearby.

                                 ROBERT
                            (with a Texan accent)
                        François Terrien?

           François looks up.

                        Patrick Anderson. 
           Robert extends his hand and flashes a smile. He's got more 
           charm than a senator from Oklahoma.

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        I do believe we've got us a tête-à-
                        tête in the books. And I hope you 
                        don't mind me sayin': I'm a big fan 
                        of your work.

                                 FRANÇOIS
                        Ah, yes, Mr. Anderson. Pleasure.

                                 ROBERT
                        Call me Pat. I know I'm a little 
                        early, but--

                                 FRANÇOIS
                        No, no. It's quite all right. Why 
                        don't we head up to my room?

           He nods at his two guards. They all walk towards the…

           INT. THE CASTLE HOTEL - ELEVATOR - A LITTLE LATER

           François stands with Robert and his two guards. Chamber muzak 
           plays softly.

                                 FRANÇOIS
                            (in French, to guards)
                        Did I order the chicken or the 
                        beef?

                                 GUARD 1
                            (in French)
                        I believe it was the chicken, sir.

           A beat.

                                 FRANÇOIS
                            (in French)
                        I've changed my mind. I want the 
                        fish.

           The guards look at each other.

                                 GUARD 1
                            (in French)
                        I don't think that was one of the 
                        choices.
           Guard 2 puts one of his hands to his mouth, in shock at the 
           faux-pas, as François shoots Guard 1 a withering look.

           Robert and François walk inside, guards in tow.

                                 FRANÇOIS
                            (in French)
                        Check the room.

           The guards flick on the lights, then spread out.

           They knock over chairs, shake the curtains, lift the couch, 
           point their flashlights under the bed -- they leave no corner 
           unturned.

                                 FRANÇOIS (CONT’D)
                            (to Robert)
                        A formality, really. But one can 
                        never be too careful.

                                 ROBERT
                        I do the same thing every time I go 
                        home.
                            (then, winking)
                        Make sure the missus never meets 
                        the mistress. 

           They laugh.

                                 GUARD 2
                            (in French, calling out)
                        All clear, sir!

           François and Robert walk towards the sitting area. Robert 
           opens his briefcase and takes out a file of papers.

                                 ROBERT
                        I appreciate you taking the time to 
                        meet with me. Am I under the 
                        correct assumption that you still 
                        have the appetite to take us 
                        private?

                                 FRANÇOIS
                        We'll get to all that business 
                        later, Mr. Anderson. Let's have a 
                        drink first. I take it you're a 
                        scotch man?
           Robert smiles politely.

           She casts one last glance at the box, nudges it an inch 
           closer to the electrical panels, then hurries out, shutting 
           the door behind her.

           INT. THE CASTLE HOTEL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Isabella runs into two female SPA WORKERS outside.

                                 SPA WORKER 1
                            (in Mandarin)
                        I think my daughter is gaslighting 
                        me.

                                 SPA WORKER 2
                            (in Mandarin)
                        How old is she?

                                 SPA WORKER 1
                            (in Mandarin)
                        Three.

                                 SPA WORKER 2
                            (in Mandarin)
                        Of course she's gaslighting you.

                                 ISABELLA
                            (to both Spa Workers, in

                        I bet it was that handsome Swede! 
           Clucking obscenities, the Spa Workers storm away. 

           Isabella makes a quick dash down the hall to make sure no one 
           else is around. 

           Once the coast is clear, she heads towards the service 
           stairwell.

           INT. THE CASTLE HOTEL - SERVICE STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           As she leaps up the stairs, Isabella takes out the detonator. 

           Stops. Takes a breath. Clicks it.

           There's a distant BOOM. The walls of the stairwell RATTLE.

           All the lights are out.

           Clink. Clink. Robert swirls the thick ice cubes in his glass 
           of scotch.

           Suddenly, the lights in the room flicker, then go out.

           Guard 1 draws the curtains open.

                                 ISABELLA
                            (over earpiece)
                        The bomb's been detonated.

                        The whole hotel's blacked out.

           Guard 2's phone starts buzzing. He answers.

                                 GUARD 2
                            (on phone, in French)
                        I understand.
                            (then, to François)
                        They're saying it's an electrical 
                        outage. They're working on it. 

           He hangs up. Continues to stand sentry. The other guard walks 
           back and joins him.

                        Why aren't they moving? They're

           Dmitri's eyes scan the monitors. 

           In the CCTV of the electrical room, a team of hotel staff 
           investigates the scene. All trace of the black box is gone. 
           The guards litigate the wiring in the electrical panels.

           One of the staffers throws on the switch for the emergency 
           generator.

                        The bomb was too clean. They're 
                        focused on the panels. They think

           It's a digital thermostat.

           A single bead of sweat falls down François's face. He takes a

           Robert clocks this.

           Robert sheds his jacket.

                        It is a bit uncomfortable, isn't 
                        it?

           Guard 1 takes this cue to check the thermostat. He tries to 
           turn the temperature down, but the screen seems frozen.

           Guard 2 waits by the elevator. The down button is lit. 

           DING. The doors open.

           Guard 1 is slumped against a corner, unconscious.

           Guard 2 cautiously steps inside.
           INT. THE CASTLE HOTEL - ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

           WHOOSH!

           Gemma lands on top of Guard 2. 

           They trade blows. WHAM. PUNCH. CRUNCH. CRACK. 

           It's a FUCKING MELEE.

           Guard 2 reaches for his gun, but Gemma's too fast. She knocks 
           it out of his hands and LANDS A HOOK to his face.

           Bellowing in pain, Guard 2 SLAMS Gemma against the wall. He 
           manages to untangle himself from under her, then THROWS her 
           onto the floor. 

           He unsheathes a knife from his belt. He pitches forward 
           towards Gemma's chest. She rolls out of the way just in time. 
           But--

           Gemma CRIES OUT. Guard 2 has managed to SLICE THROUGH THE 
           MUSCLE IN HER CALF. Blood oozes from the wound. Gemma looks 
           up at Guard 2, steeling herself for battle with this 
           handicap, when--

           SLAM! 

           The elevator PLUMMETS, LAUNCHING GUARD 2 AND GEMMA ONTO THE 
           CEILING. 

                                 JANE
                            (pre-lap)
                        Gemma, can you get him on top of 
                        the elevator?

           INT. THE CASTLE HOTEL - CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           On Jane's screen is a blueprint of the elevator shaft.

           Jane's POV:

           Superimposed math equations fly across the blueprint as Jane 
           does supersonic calculus in her head.

           We HIGHLIGHT the height of the shaft and the velocity of the 
           elevator.

           END POV.
                                 JANE
                            (into earpiece)
                        There should be a hatch on the 
                        ceiling. 

           INT. THE CASTLE HOTEL - ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

           Gemma finds the hatch above her. She opens it and starts to 
           crawl outside while Guard 2 is still disoriented. 

           The elevator slows down.

           She's almost out, but Guard 2 CATCHES HER FOOT BEFORE SHE 
           MAKES IT. He DRAGS HER BACK IN.

           At the last second, Gemma manages to grip the lip of the 
           hatch. She KICKS Guard 2 in the head, then hoists herself 
           back up to the top of the elevator.

           Guard 2 climbs out behind her.

                                 JANE
                            (over earpiece)
                        Gemma, I'm going to open the doors 
                        to the tenth floor. That's your 
                        stop.

           There's a mechanical whir.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                            (over earpiece)
                        Here we go.

           The elevator SHOOTS UP AGAIN. 

           The doors to different floors flash by: One. Two. Three.

           Guard 2 sends a fist into Gemma's right cheek. The punch 
           connects.

           Four. Five.

           Gemma reels. Recalibrates.

           Six. Seven.

           Gemma sweeps the feet out from under Guard 2. He falls.

           Eight. Nine...

           The brass doors to the tenth floor glide open. Gemma LAUNCHES 
           HERSELF OUT. THE ELEVATOR CONTINUES TO FLY UPWARD AND--
           SMASHES AGAINST THE CEILING OF THE SHAFT!

           Bones CRUNCH. 

           Then, SILENCE as blood seeps down the side of the metal car.

           Just as everyone breathes a sigh of relief, the monitors of 
           operative feeds cut into digital snow.

                        van.

           Isabella starts walking. 

           A bullet TEARS THROUGH THE SKIN OF A TREE NEXT TO HER HEAD.

           A MAN IN BLACK steps out from behind another tree with a gun 
           trained at her head. 

                                 MAN IN BLACK
                        Don't move.

           There's a faint WHISTLING that crescendos into...

           A THUD.

           The Man in Black's eyes glaze over. THERE'S A BULLET IN HIS 
           FOREHEAD. He falls, dead before he hits the ground.

           EXT. NEARBY BUILDING - DALIAN - CONTINUOUS

           Seo-Jun looks through his scope. More guards materialize 
           around Isabella, guns pointed and cocked.

           But before he can aim at his next target, HE FINDS HIMSELF 
           STARING DOWN THE BARREL OF A GUN. 
           Another MAN IN BLACK looks down at him and puts his index 
           finger to his lips.

                                 MAN IN BLACK 2
                        Shhh.

           Jane pulls up a signal coverage map of the whole compound.

           JANE'S POV: 

           Jane's eyes scan the map. Different areas of the hotel 
           pulsate with varying signal strengths. 

           Then, in a VFX RACK FOCUS, she sees a DULL BLUE SIGNAL which 
           permeates the entire map.

                        jammer. It's in the whole hotel. 
           She pulls up a terminal. Thinks. Types in a block of code. 
           Enters.

           The dull blue signal fades, then disappears.

           François dips his hand into a pocket and pulls out a 
           handkerchief. Wipes his brow.

           Gemma backs up ten feet, then CHARGES AT THE DOOR, using her 
           shoulder to slam against it.

           Gemma BURSTS THROUGH, GUN AT THE READY. But François is not

           Gemma looks down. Robert's dead body is sprawled out on the 
           floor, a bullet in his temple.

           Before she can process this data, she feels a cold muzzle in

                        it yourself. I couldn't release it 
                        to them.

                                 FRANÇOIS
                        Why were there two of them?
                            (then, scowling)
                        Never mind. I have an idea. Give me 
                        the pen.

           He unhooks the chain, then opens the door. Jane hands him the 
           clipboard and pen.

           As François signs, Jane catches a glimpse into the room. 
           Robert. Gemma…

           François clears his throat, impatient.

                                 JANE
                        Oh, sorry.

           She hands François a large, flat box. 

                                 FRANÇOIS
                        Do you know what this package is?

                                 JANE
                        No, sir, I don't.

           François rips it open, revealing its contents to be a mirror. 
           He turns to go back inside but then stops to look at Jane in 
           the mirror's reflection.

                                 FRANÇOIS
                        This package tells me Cicada's next 
                        target. 
                            (then)
                        Chérie, this is the part where you 
                        get out your gun.

           Thrown, Jane scrambles for the .64 and thrusts it into the 
           back of François's head. 
                                 JANE
                        Drop the mirror, and put your hands 
                        in the air.

           François does as he's told.

                                 FRANÇOIS
                        First mission, I presume?

                                 JANE
                        Into the room. NOW!

           François walks inside, Jane right behind him.

           INT. THE CASTLE HOTEL - FRANÇOIS'S SUITE - CONTINUOUS

           Jane closes the door behind her. 

           Gemma sits, hands bound, on the floor. Robert's dead body is 
           beside her. 

                                 JANE
                        Gemma!

                                 GEMMA
                        Don't worry about me, Jane. Just 
                        get the drive.

                                 JANE 
                            (to François)
                        Where is it?

                                 FRANÇOIS
                        No small talk? You really must be 
                        new.

                                 JANE
                            (pushing on)
                        Where is it!?

                                 FRANÇOIS
                        You mustn't be so bull-ish. You'll 
                        never get anywhere acting so bossy.

           Jane spins him around so that he faces her.

                                 JANE
                        I'm sorry, did you have a stroke? 
                        You must have forgotten who's 
                        holding the gun.
                                 FRANÇOIS
                        You see that suitcase in the corner 
                        by the bar?

           Jane's eyes dart over, clocking the suitcase.

                                 JANE
                        Yes.

                                 FRANÇOIS
                        It's in there.

                                 JANE
                        Open it.

           Jane walks François over to the suitcase. Using his 
           thumbprint, the suitcase opens. Inside is another locked box.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Keep going.

           François punches in a set of numbers, at which point a prick 
           appears. He presses his thumb against it, allowing it to draw 
           blood.

           The box makes a purring sound, then opens, revealing a small, 
           obsidian-lacquered drive.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Give it to me.

           François obeys. Jane pockets the drive.

                                 FRANÇOIS
                        You'll do well to remember that not 
                        all is what it appears to be.

                                 ADAM
                            (over earpiece)
                        Get out of there, Jane. He's buying 
                        time. He knows they'll miss him at 
                        dinner. 

           François continues.

                                 FRANÇOIS
                        We knew you were coming, but that's 
                        not what should frighten you. What 
                        should frighten you, Jane Marshall, 
                        is what you're now a part of. 
                            (then)
                        Do you know what really happened to 
                        your mother?
           Jane stiffens, unsure whether to take the bait. Then--

                                 JANE
                        Yes. Zero killed her.

                                 FRANÇOIS
                        She was working against us. That 
                        part's true. But it wasn't Zero 
                        that killed her.

                                 ADAM
                            (over earpiece)
                        Don't listen to him, Jane.

                                 FRANÇOIS
                        It was Cicada.

           Jane's eyes narrow.

                                 JANE
                        You're lying. If they killed her, 
                        then why would they recruit me?

                                 FRANÇOIS
                        You're the fall man. In case this 
                        fails, which it will. Who better to 
                        pin this on than the daughter of 
                        the insurgent?

                                 JANE
                        Insurgent? What are you talking 
                        about? 

           François stands and turns to face her. Jane keeps the gun 
           pointed, though her hand trembles.

           Seizing the opportunity, François kicks Jane in the shin. 
           Then KNOCKS the gun out of her hand. He pulls out his own gun 
           and aims it at her.

                                 ADAM
                            (over earpiece)
                        Jane! JANE! Don't move! Stay 
                        absolutely calm. We can talk you 
                        through this.

                                 FRANÇOIS
                        You can tell the little voice in 
                        your ear that there's no need.  

           François TURNS THE GUN ON HIMSELF.

                                 FRANÇOIS (CONT’D)
                        You'll never get in now.
           BANG!

           Shellshocked, Jane stares as François' body crumples onto the 
           ground.

                                 ADAM
                            (over earpiece)
                        Jane? Do you copy? Jane?

                                 GEMMA
                        Jane, we need to go. NOW!

           Still stunned at the turn of events, Jane shakes herself out 
           of her haze and unties Gemma's ropes.

           As they rush out of the room, we catch the fastest glimpse of 
           a tattoo on François's wrist. A tattoo of a cicada.

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. VAN - DALIAN - MOMENTS LATER

           Dmitri opens the back door as Jane and Gemma scramble inside.

                                 DMITRI
                        Are you guys okay??

                                 JANE
                            (breathless, panicked)
                        François… he killed himself! We 
                        only have minutes--

                                 GEMMA
                        Do you have the drive?

           Fumbling, Jane fishes the drive out of her pocket. She hands 
           it to Gemma.

                                 JANE
                        What are we going to do??

           Gemma looks at the drive, then at Jane. 

           Gemma turns back to Dmitri and SHOOTS HIM IN THE CHEST.

           Before Jane can even process what has happened, Gemma RAMS 
           THE HANDLE OF HER GUN INTO JANE'S TEMPLE.

                                                      CUT TO BLACK
           INT. UNKNOWN CICADA BUNKER - SMALL CHAMBER - LATER

           Head spinning, Jane wakes up bound and gagged. Vision swims, 
           the room throbs and undulates.

           Looking around, she sees that she's in a cement-lined room. A 
           single fluorescent bulb swings overhead.

           Jane's stunned to see that Adam is bound and gagged next to 
           her. For the moment, he's still out.

           An intercom crackles to life.

                                 ENCRYPTED VOICE
                        Hello, Jane.

                        Where am I??

                        You're safe.

                        What the hell is going on? 
                            (then)
                        The drive...

                        We have terminated Zero's fund

                                 JANE
                        Then why am I here?

                                 ENCRYPTED VOICE
                        Cicada's plan was never going to 
                        work.

           Adam stirs.

                                 ENCRYPTED VOICE (CONT’D)
                        Zero will always exist. Exposing 
                        the organization will do no lasting 
                        damage to it. The current 
                        leadership would be sacrificed, but 
                        new leadership would take over. 
                        It's a Hydra -- you can cut off one 
                        head, but another will appear in 
                        its place. 

                                 JANE
                        What do you want?

                        99 percent of the world's wealth.  
                        Capitalism is simply a clever veil 
                        -- a euphemism -- for oligarchy. 
                        Governance by the few. The elite. 
                        Whistleblowing is not enough. We 
                        believe a global restructuring is 
                        in order. A redistribution. An 
                        equalization. 

                                 JANE
                        What you're talking about...
                            (wide-eyed, realizing)
                        You don't want to destroy Zero. You 
                        want to become Zero.

           The door opens. Gemma walks in.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        I trusted you.

                                 GEMMA
                        A wise decision.

                                 JANE
                        How long has this been your plan?

                                 GEMMA
                        It wasn't my plan. It was your 
                        mother's.  

                                 JANE
                        You're lying.

                                 GEMMA
                        Once she realized that Cicada would 
                        never succeed, she created a 
                        splinter group that would. But 
                        leadership found out.
                            (then)
                        She recruited me just before they 
                        ordered her assassination. I was 
                        the only member of the splinter 
                        group who was never discovered.

           Jane shakes her head, not wanting to believe any of it.

                        live.

           Jane's blood runs cold.

           CREAK. The doorknob turns. Stops. Then--

           Jane's mother, Alice (now in her 50s), walks in. She's older. 
           Grayer. Her face lined with years of fighting a shadow war.

                                 ALICE
                        Hello Jane.

           Jane stares. Her reality has been ruptured. Wrung. Twisted 
           inside out.

                                 JANE
                        This -- this isn't real. You're 
                        dead.

                                 ALICE
                        It's me, Jane. 

           Jane shakes her head.

                                 JANE
                        No. No. This doesn't -- this 
                        doesn't make any sense.

                                 ALICE
                        Cicada tried to kill me, and they 
                        thought they did. I had to go 
                        underground. You have no idea how 
                        long I've waited for this moment. 
                        To see you again. 
                            (then, softly)
                        I'm so sorry, Jane.

                                 JANE
                        No. No. No. This is a dream.

           Alice walks up. Pauses. Then wraps her arms around Jane.

                                 ALICE
                        I'm so sorry, sweetheart. I'm so 
                        sorry for everything. 

           Adam groans. As he starts to come to, his eyes dart around, 
           taking stock of the situation. His voice is raw, guttural, 
           desperate.
                                 ADAM
                        Alice...?? What's going on? You're 
                        still alive?

           Alice turns to him, her eyes cold and unforgiving.

                                 ALICE
                        Sorry to disappoint you.

           In one fluid movement, she unholsters a gun and SHOOTS ADAM 
           IN THE HEAD. He slumps off the chair, then onto the ground.

                                 JANE
                        No! Adam!!

           Jane stares in disbelief at Adam's lifeless body. She looks 
           at her mother. Doesn't recognize, doesn't believe the woman 
           she sees.

                                 ALICE
                        He was the one who ordered the hit 
                        on me, Jane.

           Jane struggles against the ties binding her wrists.

           As she squirms, her fingers brush against the pen tucked in 
           her back pocket -- the pen Gemma gave her. 

                                 JANE
                        You always said... we should put 
                        good into the world.

           Jane contorts her fingers around the tip of the pen.

                                 ALICE
                        And that is what we're doing.

           Jane's able to shimmy the tip of the pen between her middle 
           and ring finger. Subtly, she coaxes it up.

                                 JANE
                        No. What you're planning is -- it's 
                        all wrong. 

           Alice holds Jane's head in her hands, admiring her.

                                 ALICE
                        You're here. You're finally here. 
                        My baby girl.

           The pen is in Jane's fingers. She swivels the top open...
                                 JANE
                        How could you leave us? 
                            (then, small)
                        How could you leave me?

           Alice looks at her, then turns away.

                                 ALICE
                        You have to understand -- what 
                        we're doing here, it's bigger than 
                        any of us. We're rebuilding the 
                        world, Jane. That necessitates some 
                        sacrifice.

           Alice turns back around, but now --

           JANE IS STANDING IN FRONT OF HER. The ropes are curled around 
           her feet.

           Gemma draws her gun. Then--

           BAM! Jane KICKS IT OUT OF HER HANDS AND CATCHES IT.

           Jane's movements are primal, instinctive, lethal.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                            (to Gemma)
                        Don't hurt her.

           Alice walks out.

           Gemma edges slowly towards Jane.

                                 GEMMA
                        Give me the gun, Jane.

                                 JANE
                            (sarcastic)
                        Oh totally, let me just give you 
                        the gun.

           Jane's hand shakes, which Gemma notices.

           In less than the blink of an eye, Gemma CHARGES AT JANE. They 
           both hit the deck. Hard. 

           Bang! Bang!

           Two errant bullets lodge into the ceiling.

           Gemma DRIVES a fist into Jane's wrist, and HER GUN SKITTERS 
           AWAY. 

           They trade KICKS, BLOWS, SWINGS. 
           It's raging, unfettered kinetic energy.

           WHAM! Gemma DELIVERS AN UPPERCUT INTO JANE'S JAW. 

           While Jane's disoriented, Gemma clocks her gun. Starts to 
           DIVE towards it but-- 

           Jane DRIVES A SHOULDER INTO HER. CRASH! Jane pins her to the 
           ground.

           Jane reaches into her pocket. Plucks out the pen. She flicks 
           open the side and--

           STAB! Jane SHOOTS the syringe into Gemma's neck. PUSHES the 
           plunger.

           Before she realizes what's happened, Gemma goes slack.

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. UNKNOWN CICADA BUNKER - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Jane surges after Alice. Whatever tunnel this is twists deep 
           and long. The belly of the beast.

           As Jane runs, she sees the bodies of the first Cicada members 
           she met -- the hackers in the bullpen. They now marinate in 
           their own blood.

           Jane pauses for a moment, finally feeling the weight of what 
           has happened. 

           Then, turning, she breaks into a sprint. 

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. UNKNOWN CICADA BUNKER - LARGE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Jane bursts into a vast room. Thousands of monitors stare 
           down at her from towering columns. 

           Each monitor displays the CCTV footage of banks, private 
           villas, presidential offices -- the most secure places in the 
           world. No longer.

           Jane hears footsteps, but the cacophony from the screens 
           makes it impossible for her to place where they're coming 
           from.

                                 ALICE (O.S.)
                        Join us, Jane.
                                 JANE
                        You can't take all the money in the 
                        world and just redistribute it 
                        willy-nilly. That's playing God. 
                        It's wrong.

           Jane hears Alice's footsteps and follows them to a column. 

           Suddenly, all the monitors show surveillance footage of Jane 
           from different angles. It's like a twenty first-century hall 
           of mirrors.

                                 ALICE (O.S.)
                        The world is broken, and this is 
                        how we fix it. It's the only way 
                        forward.
                            (then)
                        I'd like for us to work together, 
                        Jane. 

           The words hang. A threat unspoken.

                                 JANE
                        You've been gone for twenty years 
                        of my life. Twenty years. How could 
                        you lie to me this whole time?

                                 ALICE (O.S.)
                        It was for your own protection. The 
                        less you knew, the better. 

           Her voice is louder. Her footsteps, closer.

                                 ALICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I did all this for you, Jane. 
                            (then)
                        I did this because I love you.

                                 JANE
                        You sure have a shitty way of 
                        showing it.

           The footsteps stop.

           HOLDING A GUN, ALICE STEPS OUT FROM A COLUMN BEHIND JANE.

           Jane puts her hands up.

                                 ALICE
                        I'm giving you a choice.

                                 JANE
                        Really? Doesn't look like it.
                                 ALICE
                        You can join us.

           Alice cocks the gun.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Or you can not.

           Jane's eyes brim with tears. Betrayal, confusion, rage all 
           course like blood through her veins. 

                                 JANE
                        You're not who I thought you were.

           Jane looks down. Steels herself. Then LUNGES towards Alice. 

           It's a battle both are reluctant to fight. There are more 
           parries and deflections than actual blows. 

           Alice shoots. Jane ducks. Alice swings. Jane dodges.

           Eventually, they find themselves with Jane's hands locked on 
           Alice's arms.

           Alice is surprisingly strong, but Jane is stronger. Jane 
           SCREAMS, then--

           TWISTS Alice's arm behind her and wrests control of the gun.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        I've spent my entire life trying to 
                        live up to you. But this whole time 
                        -- I was chasing a ghost.

                                 ALICE
                        Maybe it's better if that ghost 
                        lives and this one dies.

           Jane closes her eyes. The room's walls start shaking. A 
           distant rumble crescendos.

           JANE'S POV:

           We ZOOM OUT to see a superimposed map of the base in relation 
           to the rest of Beijing. There's a hidden tunnel to the 
           subway.

                                 JANE
                        My ride's here.
                            (off Alice's look)
                        We were in Dalian, so the closest 
                        city with a Cicada base is Beijing.
                                 (MORE)
                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        There's an underground tunnel that 
                        connects it to the Orange Line on 
                        the metro. 

                                 ALICE
                        Impressive.

           Jane tears off a piece of cloth from her sleeve and ties it 
           around Alice's wrists.

           Still in Jane's POV, we superimpose digital manifestations of 
           what she describes: 

                                 JANE
                        But you expected that, didn't you? 
                        I bet you have five guards 
                        stationed at the end of the tunnel. 
                        Am I right? Based on the look on 
                        your face, I'd say I'm probably 
                        right. So I did a little digging, 
                        pun semi-intended, and I found 
                        where Cicada keeps a reserve of 
                        cars. I can understand why it's not 
                        on the map. It's quite the 
                        collection. Anyways, the point is: 
                        I think I'd rather take a car.

                                 ALICE
                            (speaking a little 
                            frantically)
                        Jane, you really don't--

                                 JANE
                        I really do.

           END POV.

           Jane tears off another piece of cloth and wraps it around 
           Alice's mouth.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        You might want to clean up a bit. 
                        Interpol, the DOJ, the NSA, the 
                        CIA, and even the local Chinese 
                        police are all going to want a 
                        piece of you. I'll make sure 
                        they're all notified.

           Alice makes frantic muffled noises from behind the cloth. 

           Jane walks towards the end of the room. Takes out her pen. 
           Clicks it.
           The back wall, made of glass, SHATTERS INTO A BILLION PIECES. 
           IT'S A HAILSTORM OF BLACK SHARDS.

           Jane steps through it to the other side, where a fleet of  
           cars await.

           She looks back at Alice.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Lesson one: expect the unexpected.
                            (then)
                        Goodbye, mom.

                                                           CUT TO:

           EXT. CHINESE STREET - DAY

           A familiar Bugatti Veyron EXPLODES out of an underground 
           garage. It HAIRPIN TURNS around a corner onto a street 
           specked with motorbikes and early commuters.

           JANE'S POV:

           The road ahead, SUPERIMPOSED WITH A PRECISE TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP 
           OF THE CITY. Jane hones in on the most efficient route out. 

                                 JANE
                            (thinking aloud)
                        It's early, but it's a Monday. 
                        School day. Surface streets'll be 
                        crammed with kids, parents.

           INSERT OF: Parents herding children across crosswalks.

           Jane hears a SCREECHING of tires as an armored van PEELS out 
           of the garage and barrels towards her. 

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                            (thinking aloud)
                        Can't go to the Embassy. They're in 
                        the government's pocket. Cicada'll 
                        blackmail them.

           INSERT OF: A morass of military infantry surrounds the 
           American Embassy.

           END POV.

           Jane BLOWS through a red light.

           The armored van is not so lucky. It SLAMS into a passing 
           sedan.
                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                            (thinking aloud)
                        If I can get to the airport…

           Jane guns down the street. Spying an opening, she WHIPS the 
           car into a tiny alley. Vendors of a night market closing up 
           for the day SCREAM and JUMP out of Jane's way. An EXPLOSION 
           of woks, tarps, and skewers rain down on her windshield.

           In the chaos, Jane looks in her rearview mirror: the van is 
           nowhere in sight.

           Suddenly, it SCREECHES OUT OF A HIDDEN ENTRANCE IN FRONT OF 
           HER. A MAN IN A BLACK SKI MASK leans out of the passenger 
           window with an assault rifle trained on Jane. 

           Jane THROWS her car in reverse, sending vendors leaping out 
           of the way again. She PINWHEELS sharply onto the 
           perpendicular street and pops the car into drive.

                                                           CUT TO:

           EXT. CHINESE HIGHWAY - DAY

           Back to our opening scene. 

           Jane's on the highway.

           She swings a hard left, millimeters from a 16-wheeler.

           In her rearview mirror, Jane sees the armored van in pursuit.

           Jane turns to her right and sees the armored van now neck-to-
           neck with her. The AR-15 comes out.

           Jane slows down, then lunges right, cutting through three 
           lanes of traffic.

           The armored van follows. Then maneuvers onto the shoulder to 
           Jane's right.

           The harpoon blasts into Jane's car.

           Jane looks over.

                                 JANE (V.O.)
                        I wasn't getting out of this alive.

           JANE'S POV:

           We see a superimposed decision tree on the windshield:

           -Get to the Embassy
           -Get to Hong Kong

           -Get to the airport

           -Give yourself up

           One by one, Jane mentally crosses out each option on the list 
           until she arrives at the last one:

           -Take them out

           END POV.

           She braces herself.

                                 JANE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        But neither were they.

           Resolved, she CUTS THE WHEEL TO THE RIGHT. Her car SLAMS into 
           the van, then somersaults in slow-motion through the air. 

           The Bugatti careens wildly down towards a roiling river. The 
           van tumbles around it, their fates still tethered.

           WHAM!

           Shockwaves RIPPLE through Jane's car as it SLAMS into the 
           river. When it hits, there's a DEAFENING SILENCE. We now hear 
           nothing. 

           As brackish brown water BURSTS in through the holes punched 
           into the car's body, Jane sees a swarm of shadowy figures 
           swim towards her. 

           The water gushes in. It churns. Rises. 

           As the shadowy figures get closer, Jane realizes that they're 
           SCUBA DIVERS. One of them uses an oxygen tank to hit Jane's 
           driver-seat window.

           There's only a pocket of air left. Jane claws at the glass. 
           Takes one last gasp before--

           She's completely submerged now. Looks around desperately.

           CRACK! The window spiders. 

           Jane pounds her fists against the glass. Her vision starts to 
           fade. It's dark. Darker. Then--

           The cracks BURST INTO SHARDS AS THE SCUBA DIVER PUSHES 
           THROUGH. 
           The diver slips an oxygen mask around Jane's mouth as we...

                                                      CUT TO BLACK

                                 JANE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Or so I thought.

           INT. UNKNOWN WHITE CHAMBER - LATER

           Jane's vision swims as she comes to. It's all a blur of 
           shadowy figures and fluorescent hospital lights.

           She hears the strident beeping of a heart monitor. The 
           shadowy figures disappear.

           Straining her eyes, she finds herself hooked up to a tangle 
           of IVs on a hospital bed.

           A NURSE (50s) comes in to administer a shot. Jane doesn't 
           feel anything.

                                 JANE
                        What's going on? Where am I?

           The nurse looks at her but says nothing. She touches Jane's 
           forehead just as Jane's vision begins to melt into more 
           black.

           INT. UNKNOWN WHITE CHAMBER - LATER

           Jane wakes up again, her head throbbing.

           She strains her eyes. Manages to make out...

                                 JANE
                            (still groggy)
                        Dad?

           Bruce sits next to Jane's bed. He takes her hand.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        What's going on...? Is this a 
                        dream?

           She looks down at her arm. A thin, transparent tube still 
           pumps her veins with saline and narcotics.

                                 BRUCE
                        Hi sweetheart.

           There are male and female voices in the doorway. Jane makes 
           out three figures.
                                 JANE
                        Dad, who is that? What's going on?

           The voices stop.

           One of the figures moves closer. IT'S ADAM.

                                 ADAM
                        Welcome to the other side.

           Jane shakes her head.

                                 JANE
                        You're dead. I saw you die. 

           Another figure steps forward. IT'S FRANCOIS.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        You should also be dead.

                                 FRANÇOIS
                        It would appear.

                                 JANE
                        Does anyone here not speak riddle? 
                        Am I in purgatory?

                                 FRANÇOIS
                        Physically, you are as alive as 
                        ever. 

                                 ADAM
                        Well, except for the two minutes 
                        when you were medically dead. 

                                 JANE
                        What the hell is going on!?

           The final figure walks into the room. Stepping into the 
           light, we see that IT'S GEMMA.

                                 GEMMA
                        Hi Jane.

                                 JANE
                        Gemma.

                                 ADAM
                        To reiterate François's point, none 
                        of us are dead, Jane. We are all 
                        very much alive and well. As are 
                        you.
                                 JANE
                        Then what in the actual fuck is 
                        going on!?

           François smiles.

                                 FRANÇOIS
                        You've been initiated. Reborn.

                                 ADAM
                        Cicada never had any intention of 
                        following through with the Zero 
                        plan. In fact, Zero never existed 
                        at all.

           Jane takes a deep breath and closes her eyes. What the fuck!?

                                 GEMMA
                        We needed to see every fold and 
                        curve of your brain. Every nucleic 
                        acid that constitutes who you are 
                        and what makes you tick.

                                 FRANÇOIS
                        The code you live by.

           Jane is apoplectic.

                                 JANE
                        So this was all a test of what? 
                        Character?

                                 GEMMA
                        It was more than that.

                                 JANE
                        This is crazy. You're all crazy. 
                        How you could even think to do this 
                        to someone is fucking criminal.

           Gemma, Adam, and François all soften, sympathetic.

                                 ADAM
                        We had no choice. This was your 
                        training.

                                 JANE
                        Training for what?

                                 ADAM
                        That's a question for Cicada's #1.

           There's a knock on the door. 
           Alice walks in.

                                 ALICE
                        Hello Jane. 

           Jane says nothing. She looks practically catatonic.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        I didn't want to leave, Jane. 
                        Please believe me. I'm wanted by 
                        some very bad people. But I knew 
                        that if they thought I was dead, 
                        they'd stop looking. It's killed me 
                        every day since I left, but I did 
                        it to protect you and your father. 

           Her voice is desperate. Pleading. This is the real Alice.

           Jane looks at her. Then Bruce. Then turns away. 

                                 BRUCE
                        She left because she loves you, 
                        Jane.

                                 ALICE
                        I've thought about you every second 
                        of every day since I've been gone. 
                        Your father sent me photos, videos, 
                        anything he could. 

           Jane looks at her mother. Then her father. She's angry. 
           Conflicted. Betrayed.

                                 JANE
                        My whole life, you were both lying 
                        to me.

                                 ALICE
                        I'm sorry, Jane.

                                 BRUCE
                        This was the only way to keep you 
                        safe.

           A long beat.

                                 JANE
                        Who was looking for you?

                                 ALICE
                        A group called The Order. 

                                 JANE
                        So what was all this? 
                                 ALICE
                        This was to get you ready to face 
                        them. If you thought this was bad--

                                 JANE
                        Why couldn't you have just told me?

           Her eyes are wet. Her voice is raw.

                                 ALICE
                        Think about the day I left. What I 
                        told you that morning. Then think 
                        about everything that's happened 
                        since you joined Cicada.

           Alice reaches out, placing her hand on Jane's. Jane 
           instinctively flinches. Takes a breath. Then allows it. It's 
           a brave new world.

                                 JANE
                        What now?

                                 ALICE
                        Now, we go to war.

           Gemma holds up a photo of the Man in the Pig Mask, now five 
           years older.

                                 GEMMA
                        The Order is a secret society that 
                        has shaped and controlled human 
                        history since World War I. This man 
                        has just been inducted into their 
                        ranks. 

                                 ADAM
                        The Order is like our fictional 
                        "Zero" but far more insidious. They 
                        have agents everywhere. In every 
                        government agency, legislative 
                        body, and executive branch in the 
                        world. 

                                 FRANÇOIS
                        They've infiltrated the private 
                        sector as well. The boards of every 
                        Fortune 500 company -- they've all 
                        been compromised.

                        Their collective power and access 
                        to capital grants them the latitude 
                        to shape the world to their whims. 

                                 GEMMA
                        Because of the nature of their 
                        organization, it's been impossible 
                        for us to even land a blow. Until 
                        now.

           Jane takes this all in. She's quiet. It's a lot of data.

           Alice notices. Leans in.

                                 ALICE
                        It's a lot to process, I know. We 
                        can pick this up later. But 
                        first...

           A beat.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        It's been almost twenty years, 
                        Jane. Twenty years of one long 
                        story we were telling you. 

           Jane looks up.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Now, we want to hear yours.

           Jane looks around at everyone. François. Adam. Gemma. Her 
           father. Her mother. She takes a deep breath. Thinks. Then, 
           smiling to herself, she kicks off the opening narration.

           But as she recounts her story to them, what we hear is a 
           slightly different version:

                                 JANE (V.O.)
                        People like to think they're the 
                        heroes of their own stories. It 
                        took me a long time to be the hero 
                        of mine. But here's the thing about 
                        heroes...

           We ZOOM OUT to reveal a massive, underground compound. There 
           are munitions testing facilities, an Olympic-sized training 
           room, sleeping quarters, a server farm... this is much more 
           vast than anything we've seen. 

           We also see that the compound spreads under the entirety of 
           Beijing.
                                 JANE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Every time they think they've saved 
                        the world, they've got to do it 
                        again.

           The screen now flicks into GREEN SCALE SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE 
           OF EACH ROOM IN THE ENTIRE COMPOUND. 

           SOMEBODY IS STILL WATCHING.
