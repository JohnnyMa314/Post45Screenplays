           EXT. WEEKS FOOTBRIDGE - CRISP AUTUMN DAY

           A calm, serene vision of New England splendor in the 1980s.  
           The Charles River rolls placidly under the beautiful 
           footbridge, which supports the well-pedicured and -pedigreed 
           feet of preppy coeds.  Business as usual for the 
           Massachusetts autumn day.  Everyone’s doing pretty well.

           Except for KAREN HOWDY (35), who is scanning the bridge for 
           someone.  She looks like she hasn’t slept in two weeks.

           FATHER ELIOT (middle-aged, kind yet stern face) approaches.

                                 FATHER ELIOT
                        Ms. Howdy?

                                 KAREN
                        Oh, Father Eliot, thank god you’re 
                        here.

                                 FATHER ELIOT
                        I heard about your daughter.  It 
                        sounds... dire.

                                 KAREN
                        I’m not a religious woman, Father.  
                        But I need all the help I can get.  
                        None of the other priests in town 
                        would come.

                                 FATHER ELIOT
                        When a child of Christ cries out, 
                        God listens.  I am confident I can 
                        help her.

           They walk off together.

           EXT. NEW ENGLAND STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Karen and Father Eliot continue on their way to the Howdy 
           home.  He carries a square of parchment with an ancient-
           looking rune drawn on it.

                                 FATHER ELIOT
                        From what you’ve described, it 
                        sounds like your daughter is 
                        possessed by the demon Lamashtu.  
                        I’ve come bearing her Sigil, a 
                        symbol that will draw her out of 
                        your daughter, upon which I, with 
                        the help of a strong female 
                        presence like yourself, can cast 
                        her back to hell.
                                 KAREN
                             (unsure)
                        That... doesn’t sound too hard?

                                 FATHER ELIOT
                        Do not underestimate her.  Lamashtu 
                        is one of the most powerful demons 
                        there is, alongside her brother 
                        Pazuzu.  She is pure evil.  She 
                        delights in killing women in 
                        childbirth and kidnapping babies as 
                        they breastfeed.  Male demons can 
                        be cast out with base terrestrial 
                        energy like electricity, but female 
                        demons need a purer, more spiritual 
                        faith.  This will be the hardest 
                        trial I have ever faced.

                                 KAREN
                        Oh, dear.

           They arrive at Karen’s home.

           INT. NEW ENGLAND HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Karen lets Father Eliot in through the front door of her 
           beautiful New England-style home.  We hear HORRIFYING SHRIEKS 
           coming from the second floor.  Father Eliot’s face falls.

                                 KAREN
                        This way.

           He hesitates for a moment, then steels himself.

                                 FATHER ELIOT
                        Just a moment, Ms. Howdy.  Let me 
                        take a breath.  I have been waiting 
                        for this opportunity for my whole 
                        life.  I feel it strongly, so 
                        strongly.  I was put on this Earth 
                        to cast Satan back to his winged 
                        realm of forsaken beasts.

                                 KAREN
                        Father, I’m... so... scared.

           She breaks down crying.  Father Eliot grabs Karen by the 
           shoulders and shakes her.
                                 FATHER ELIOT
                             (forceful)
                        I know you’re scared, but God is 
                        good, and will always light the 
                        way.  When my mother died, I feared 
                        that I would never find my faith 
                        again.  But this is exactly what I 
                        needed.  A test is the only way 
                        that you can know your faith is 
                        pure.  It may appear this test was 
                        sent by the Devil but I believe it 
                        to be a gift from the Lord.  And 
                        let me assure you, Ms. Howdy.  I 
                        will do whatever is in my power, 
                        human and divine, to save your 
                        daughter.  She will emerge stronger 
                        for it.  A true child of Heaven.  I 
                        give you my word, Ms. Howdy.  I 
                        swear to God.

           Karen smiles.  They slowly, ominously walk up the stairs to 
           Kennedy’s room.  Karen pushes open the door, and we see...

           INT. KENNEDY’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           ...THE CRAZIEST FUCKING SHIT.  This is the bedroom from hell -
           - literally.

           KENNEDY (10) is tied by her hands and feet to her bedposts.  
           Even so, she and the bed are both floating.  Kennedy’s books 
           and toys are flying around her room.  Kennedy is covered in 
           blood and vomit and her head is spinning all the way around.  
           She SCREAMS in a voice that is distinctly not human.

           Karen looks hopefully at Father Eliot.  Long beat, then:

                                 FATHER ELIOT
                        Oh my god fuuuuuuuck.

                                 KAREN
                        What?!

                                 FATHER ELIOT
                        Okay so, ummmmm... fuck?  I am so 
                        sorry I gotta go.

           He sprints down the stairs, dropping the sigil, and out of 
           their lives, forever.

                                 KAREN
                        Okay.  That’s okay.  No priest is 
                        willing to exorcise my daughter.  
                        That’s cool.  Let’s reevaluate.
           Kennedy VOMITS on Karen.

           INT. KENNEDY’S ROOM - MONTAGE

           Karen stands with a jug of holy water and screams at the 
           demon inside her daughter.

                                 KAREN
                        You horrible demon, get out of my 
                        daughter!  I bought a bunch of holy 
                        water from that church down the 
                        street because they’re turning the 
                        building into a Goorin Bros!

           She pours the water on Kennedy, which doesn’t do anything.

                                 KENNEDY (POSSESSED)
                        Your mother sucks cocks in hell!  

                                 KAREN
                        My mother’s alive, she sucks cocks 
                        in Cleveland! 

           Kennedy VOMITS on Karen.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. KENNEDY’S ROOM - MONTAGE

           The demon SCREAMS and throws a lamp at Karen.

                                 KAREN
                        Let’s try some tough love, Kennedy!  
                        Clean up your room!

                                 KENNEDY (POSSESSED)
                        Bitch, you’re not my mom!

           Kennedy VOMITS on Karen.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. KENNEDY’S ROOM - MONTAGE

           Karen holds a CROSS above her head and throws GARLIC at 
           Kennedy/Lamashtu.

                                 KAREN
                        The power of Christ compels you!  
                        The power of Christ compels you!
                                 KENNEDY (POSSESSED)
                        The power of Christ couldn’t compel 
                        John Goodman to finish a ham 
                        sandwich, you stupid bitch!

           Kennedy VOMITS on Karen.

           Karen leads a DOCTOR into Kennedy’s room.

                             (nervously)
                        It’s really not as bad as it seems!

                                 DOCTOR
                             (screaming)
                        WHAT--

           Kennedy VOMITS on them.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Karen leads a POLICE OFFICER into Kennedy’s room.

           Kennedy VOMITS on them.

           Kennedy leads a MAGICIAN into Kennedy’s room.

                                 MAGICIAN
                             (screaming)
                        FUCK!!!!!

           Kennedy vomits on them.
                                 KAREN
                             (snapping at the magician)
                        Being covered in demon vomit is 
                        less embarrassing than being a 
                        close-up magician, Craig!

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. KENNEDY’S ROOM - MONTAGE

           Karen puts her hands on her hips.

                                 KAREN
                        Take a deep breath.

           She’s looking less scared of Kennedy/Lamashtu and more 
           annoyed.

                                 KAREN (CONT'D)
                        I’m getting real sick of this, 
                        Lamashtu.

                                 KENNEDY (POSSESSED)
                        I’m getting real sick--

                    KENNEDY (POSSESSED) (CONT'D)
                                                          KAREN
           --of smelling your rancid 
           cunt!
                                              --of smelling your rancid 
                                              cunt, yeah, yeah, you’ve used 
                                              that one before.

           Karen grabs Kennedy/Lamashtu and pins her to the bed.  She 
           gets inches within Kennedy’s face and speaks to her 
           intensely.

                                 KAREN (CONT'D)
                        Listen.  My daughter is still in 
                        there somewhere, and I’m going to 
                        get her out.  Because I’m an 
                        actress.  And we actresses don’t 
                        just wait for someone to boss us 
                        around and tell us what to say.  We 
                        act.

           She puts her hands on Kennedy’s shoulders.

                                 KAREN (CONT'D)
                        So take.  A deep.  Breath.

           For a second, Kennedy/Lamashtu HESITATES.  Karen excitedly 
           seizes upon the hesitation.
                                 KAREN (CONT'D)
                        Sweetie, I know you heard me!  
                        Kennedy!  Take a deep breath!

                                 KENNEDY (NORMAL VOICE)
                        Mama?  I’m scared!

                                 KAREN
                        Keep breathing, baby.  It’s 
                        working.

           She leads Kennedy in DEEP YOGA BREATHING.  We see the light 
           return to Kennedy’s eyes -- it is clear that it is truly 
           Kennedy who is in control for the moment, not Lamashtu.

                                 KENNEDY (NORMAL VOICE)
                        It’s me!  It’s really me!  I’m 
                        sorry I threw up on you so many 
                        times!

                                 KAREN
                        It’s okay, I know it wasn’t your 
                        fault!

                                 KENNEDY
                        It just makes me so mad that this 
                        demon is trying to tell me--

           Suddenly, Kennedy’s eyes flash -- LAMASHTU IS BACK.

                                 KENNEDY (POSSESSED) (CONT'D)
                        --I will eat your daughter’s 
                        insides and shit them out through 
                        her own asshole!

                        No, no, it was working until you 
                        got mad...

           Lightbulb moment for Karen.

                                 KAREN (CONT'D)
                        Kennedy.  Start breathing again.  
                        And try not to think about your 
                        anger.

           Karen and Kennedy breathe together again.  As they do, 
           Kennedy’s eyes turn normal again.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Hi, mama.
                                 KAREN
                        Hi, Kennedy.  Thanks for coming 
                        back to me.  I think we got this.

                                                        WE DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. HOWDY KITCHEN - MONTAGE

           Karen is gingerly leading Kennedy into the kitchen.  She sits 
           at the table as Karen puts a small plate of breakfast in 
           front of her.  Kennedy nervously picks up a knife.  In a 
           flash, Lamashtu has taken over and HOLDS THE KNIFE AT HER OWN 
           THROAT.

           Karen puts an arm around her, encouraging.

                                 KAREN
                        You got this, Ken.  Just remember: 
                        breathe in, breathe out, no anger, 
                        no fear.  You are the strongest 
                        person I know...

           Kennedy gets back in control and lowers the knife to the 
           plate.

           As Karen’s voice switches to voice over, we dissolve and 
           start watching Kennedy age.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. HOWDY LIVING ROOM - MONTAGE

           CHYRON: ONE YEAR LATER

                                 KAREN (V.O.)
                        ...This isn’t going to be perfect.  
                        You’re going to take steps forward 
                        and then steps back...

           In the scene, Karen is trying to home school Kennedy.  Karen 
           marks “72/100” on Kennedy’s math test.  Kennedy’s eyes FLASH 
           with anger and Lamashtu tries to STUFF THE HOMEWORK INTO HER 
           VAGINA.  Karen leads Kennedy in breathing and Kennedy regains 
           control.  She smoothes out the test and her mom continues to 
           teach her.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. NEIGHBOR’S HOUSE - MONTAGE

           CHYRON: THREE YEARS LATER
                                 KAREN (V.O.)
                        ...It’s going to be hard, and 
                        frustrating...

           In the scene, Kennedy is at another girl’s 13th birthday 
           party.  Karen hangs out with the other moms in the b.g.  The 
           girl, ANGELA, looks at Kennedy with disdain.

                                 ANGELA
                        I can’t believe you came.  I only 
                        invited you because my mom made me.

           Kennedy’s eyes flash and Lamashtu screams:

                                 KENNEDY (POSSESSED)
                        Your mom did make you... out of 
                        your dad’s fetid cum!  The world 
                        would’ve been a better place if you 
                        had stayed in his drooping balls!  
                        They’re like someone stapled two 
                        fried eggs to a cigarette!

           The entire party’s collective jaw drops.  Kennedy snaps back 
           to normal and clasps her hands to her mouth.  After a very 
           long beat:

                                 KAREN
                        Okay, so maybe no more parties.

           She scoops Kennedy up and they run out the door.

           INT. KENNEDY’S ROOM - MONTAGE

           CHYRON: SIX YEARS LATER

                                 KAREN (V.O.)
                        ...But you’re not doing this alone.  
                        I’m always there with you, every 
                        step of the way.

           In the scene, sixteen-year-old Kennedy is coding alone on her 
           laptop in her bedroom.  A slightly older Karen enters and 
           brings her daughter a snack on a platter.  Kennedy smiles as 
           her mom leaves.

           Kennedy looks at her computer and realizes that Lamashtu has 
           USED HER HAND to type out a comment on Facebook: “Kill urself 
           u stupid ho”.  Kennedy panics and deletes the Facebook post.  
           She picks up a vial that says “Holy Water” and CHUGS IT.  The 
           demon from within Kennedy SCREAMS IN PAIN, then subsides.
           With a pained look on her face, Kennedy slumps back in bed, 
           as we hear the end of Karen’s voice over.

                                 KAREN (V.O.)
                        ...So, look alive, Ken.  You don’t 
                        need a priest, you don’t need God, 
                        all you need is yourself.  Breathe 
                        in, breathe out, no anger, no fear.  
                        Stay calm.

                                 KENNEDY
                             (to herself)
                        Stay calm.

           CUT TO CREDITS.

           INT. KENNEDY’S APARTMENT - MANY YEARS LATER

           CHYRON: TWENTY-ONE YEARS LATER

           We are in PRESENT-DAY KENNEDY (31)’S apartment.  A shitty, 
           shitty two bedroom in Boston.  Adult Kennedy, peacefully 
           asleep in bed, is jarred awake by her phone’s alarm.  She 
           starts grumbling at the clock but catches herself -- no anger 
           for Kennedy.  She takes a deep breath and begins her morning 
           affirmations.

                                 KENNEDY
                             (to herself)
                        Breathe in, breathe out, no anger, 
                        no fear, stay calm.

           She rises from bed.  Opens the blinds and looks out at her 
           horrible view.  She can see directly into her neighbor’s 
           bathroom window, where he’s clearly taking a shit.  He 
           salutes her.  She sighs.  Another day.

           INT. KENNEDY’S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           A modestly dressed Kennedy is sipping coffee at the kitchen 
           table.  Her obnoxious roommate MARTA (30s) barges in.  She’s 
           wearing a shirt that says “LIFE’S TOO SHORT TO NOT BE 
           THINKING ABOUT MY HORSE” with a clip art horse on it.  She 
           wears an Oculus Rift and sides it up to speak to Kennedy.

                                 MARTA
                        Ken, big “whoops” here on my part 
                        but my rent’s gonna be late this 
                        month.
                                 KENNEDY
                             (very quiet)
                        Oh, no worries.  If you could just 
                        get that to me as soon as you can, 
                        along with maybe the other four 
                        months you haven’t paid, that would 
                        be great.

                                 MARTA
                        You da best!  Yeah, I’m just sorta 
                        strapped right now ‘cause I bought 
                        another VR headset.

                                 KENNEDY
                        I thought those make you sick?

                                 MARTA
                        Yeah, but I just am addicted to the 
                        reality of the games.  Do you know 
                        what it feels like to actually get 
                        to ride a bike?!  It’s so raw.  
                        Sucks donk they’re so pricey.  Plus 
                        all the anti-nausea meds I have to 
                        buy ‘cause those puppies make me so 
                        motion sick.

                                 KENNEDY
                        No, it’s really fine.  If you could 
                        just not use my towels to clean out 
                        your Rift that would be nice, but 
                        totally no worries if that’s hard.  
                        Actually, forget I said anything.

                                 MARTA
                        Yeah, your towels are better ‘cause 
                        they’re thinner so it’s easier to 
                        get into the eye areas.  My towels 
                        are those big beach ones ‘cause the 
                        thin ones don’t tie around my large 
                        breasts, you know?

                                 KENNEDY
                        Yeah.

                                 MARTA
                        Yeah.

           Marta drinks coffee straight from the coffee pot.

                                 MARTA (CONT'D)
                        Hey, you know what?  I bet someone 
                        could make you a VR game where you 
                        could talk to your dead mom!
                                 KENNEDY
                             (horrified)
                        What?!

                                 MARTA
                        Oh, you know, I hear you talking to 
                        your dead mom in the mirror 
                        sometimes.  And like I bet it would 
                        be less weird if you got to look at 
                        her in the Rift.
                             (beat, then)
                        Sorry, don’t mean to pry.

                                 KENNEDY
                        No no, I should apologize for 
                        making that face.  It’s been a hard 
                        few months.  But I can’t complain.

           Marta flips back on the VR headset.

                                 MARTA
                        Welp, I better get started on my 
                        day!
                             (from inside the headset)
                        Hell yes!  I’m literally in the 
                        Mojave desert racing horses right 
                        now!
                             (she GAGS)
                        Damn, just getting a little sloppy 
                        on those turns, girl--
                             (she GAGS AGAIN)
                        I’m okay, we’re back.  Oh, she’s 
                        bucking.  I gotta get to the can--

           She runs out of the kitchen.  Kennedy sighs.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Stay calm.

           INT. KENNEDY’S CAR - LATER

           Kennedy drives to work.  She connects her cell phone to her 
           car and makes a call, which goes to voice mail.

                                 VOICE MAIL
                        “Hello, you’ve reached Karen Howdy!  
                        I’ve stepped away from my phone.  
                        Please leave a message and I’ll get 
                        back to you shortly!  Ken, how do I 
                        turn this off--”

           Her voice is cut off by a beep.
           Kennedy takes a deep breath and leaves a message for her 
           dearly departed mother, a ritual she does every day.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Hi, mama.  Just calling to say I 
                        miss you.  I can’t believe it’s 
                        been six months today since I got 
                        to talk to you.  This morning was 
                        pretty bad, but I remembered 
                        everything you taught me, and the 
                        “thing” didn’t happen, so that’s 
                        good.  Mama, I miss you so much.  
                        Okay.  Call me back when you can.

           She wipes away a tear and hangs up.

           A car suddenly CUTS KENNEDY OFF in traffic.  She has to 
           swerve to avoid a collision.  The driver LAYS ON THE HORN and 
           flips Kennedy off.

                                 DRIVER
                             (out the window)
                        Keep your eyes on the road, bitch!  
                        Get off Tinder, you’re a 7 at best!
                             (doppler)
                        Though I think getting bangs would 
                        help frame your face--

           Kennedy sighs and practices deep breathing.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Breathe in, breathe out.

           EXT./INT. CRTR OFFICES - LATER

           Kennedy runs into the headquarters for CRTR (pronounced 
           “CREATOR”), where she works as a coder.  CRTR’s offices look 
           like Google or Facebook -- all white walls and primary colors 
           and smooth rounded edges.  A big sign on the wall says: 
           “CRTR!  BECAUSE RME WASN’T CRTD IN A DAY!”  CRTR employees, 
           known as CRITTERS, bustle around.

           She beelines for an open-plan cubicle area and throws her 
           stuff on her desk.  Kennedy plops down next to AGNES (30s, 
           fat, sweet).

                                 AGNES
                        It’s all good, Ken, don’t stress!  
                        You’re only a tiny bit late.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Thank you.  Traffic was horrible 
                        today.

                                 KENNEDY (CONT'D)
                             (quickly)
                        Not that I’m complaining, I like 
                        the challenge!

                                 AGNES
                        I mean, not to bring this up again, 
                        but if you moved in with me, you’d 
                        be like two minutes from CRTR.  And 
                        we would have so much fun!  We 
                        could watch old movies like Ever 
                        After and do Chopped challenges for 
                        dinner every night!

           A pained look crosses Kennedy’s already-perma-pained face.

                                 KENNEDY
                        I just, can’t, Agnes.  You know I’d 
                        love to, but... I’m a horrible 
                        roommate.

                                 AGNES
                        Doesn’t your current roommate put 
                        cheese in the Keurig to make 
                        fondue?

                                 KENNEDY
                        Yeah, but.  I’m a bad roommate in a 
                        different way.
                             (clearly thinking of 
                              Lamashtu)
                        I’m really unpredictable.  I might 
                        even hurt you.  And if I ever did 
                        something terrible to you, or threw 
                        up on you, I would never forgive 
                        myself--

                                 AGNES
                        Look, you don’t have to make 
                        excuses.  Just wanted to let you 
                        know I’d love to have you.

           She smiles sadly.

                                 KENNEDY
                        But!  That doesn’t mean I’m going 
                        to miss your birthday party!  I’m 
                        so pumped!

                                 AGNES
                        Oh, it’s gonna be good.  I picked a 
                        theme -- the Hamburglar.  Everyone 
                        has to dress like the Hamburglar.
                                 KENNEDY
                        That’s so great.  I feel like the 
                        stripes look good on everyone.

           They open their computers.

                                 AGNES
                        So today Mike said we’re working on 
                        changing the logo for Arbor Day.  I 
                        guess the two “R’s” are going to be 
                        trees?

           Kennedy and Agnes both pull up CODING SCREENS on their 
           computers.

                                 KENNEDY
                        I’m so lucky.  This job sure is 
                        great.  Like, what other job gives 
                        you the freedom to make letters 
                        into trees?  Most jobs you don’t 
                        get to turn letters into anything.

                                 AGNES
                             (excited)
                        Oh, and Mike said apparently we’re 
                        allowed to pick whatever kind of 
                        trees we want!  Deciduous or 
                        conifer!

                                 KENNEDY
                        That’s awesome!  We’re basically 
                        the bosses!

                                 AGNES
                        Well, someday we’ll be the actual 
                        bosses.  When we start our own 
                        company.

                                 KENNEDY
                             (smiling, quiet)
                        Sure.

           They get to work.  We see Kennedy’s screen, where she’s 
           laboriously coding to change the “C” in “CRTR” to be green.  
           How does coding work?  No way to know.

                                 KENNEDY (CONT'D)
                             (more timid than usual)
                        Hey, um... What do you think 
                        David’s favorite tree is?

                                 AGNES
                             (teasing)
                        Why don’t you ask him?
           Kennedy looks over at another member of her team, DAVID 
           (30s).  David is handsome, but handsome for a regular person, 
           not handsome for a coder.  Kennedy’s look conveys all of 
           “this guy does not know I exist.”

                                 KENNEDY
                        I could never.  He’s probably 
                        really busy thinking about how cool 
                        his skin looks.

                                 AGNES
                        He’s so cute and normal.  He’s like 
                        a nice dad from a commercial.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Do you think he’s going to be at 
                        the holiday party this week?  Not 
                        that I would go, I just like 
                        thinking about him having fun.

                                 AGNES
                        I like to think about him having 
                        anything.

           She stares at David and gets lost in thought.  She’s 
           interrupted from her reverie by STEVIE (20s or 30s but 
           dressed like a mean nine-year-old, super dick), who gets in 
           her face and throws a ton of papers in front of her.

                                 STEVIE
                        Pull your tampons out of your ears 
                        and listen up, Kennedy.  Where’s 
                        the work I gave you last week?

                                 KENNEDY
                        I’m so sorry, I had to finish a 
                        bunch for my pod and I just got to 
                        your work, I can finish it by lunch-
                        -

                                 STEVIE
                        You better.  I told Mike I’d have 
                        it all coded by end of day and I 
                        absolutely do not have time.  I’m 
                        hosting an Incel meetup in my mom’s 
                        back house and I have to get home 
                        to put the pot roast in the slow 
                        cooker.

           He stares at her.

                                 STEVIE (CONT'D)
                        You want me to get on the Dream 
                        Team, right?
                                 KENNEDY
                        Of course.  Who wouldn’t want to 
                        get on the Dream Team?  You get 
                        unlimited resources to code 
                        whatever you want.  Of course I 
                        want that!
                             (then)
                        ...for you.

                                 STEVIE
                        That’s what I thought.

           He slaps her “playfully” on the back and walks off.  Kennedy 
           frantically goes back to working on Stevie’s work.  Agnes 
           stares at her.

                                 AGNES
                        Why do you let him boss you around 
                        like that?!

                                 KENNEDY
                             (cheery)
                        Oh, it’s really not that bad!  I 
                        like the practice.  It helps me 
                        learn about different types of 
                        coding, since he has a better job 
                        than us.
                             (quickly)
                        Did I say “better”?!  I meant 
                        “different.”

                                 AGNES
                        You should tell Mike.  This is a 
                        post-#MeToo world.  Or at least, 
                        it’s, like, still going on.  You 
                        should tattle.

                                 KENNEDY
                        It’s really much easier to not get 
                        angry.  To just stay calm.

           Kennedy takes two deep breaths and dives into her work.

           INT. CRTR OFFICES - NIGHT

           Kennedy is still hard at work.  Agnes is packing up her 
           space.  Very few people are left in the office.

                                 AGNES
                        You wanna walk out together?
                                 KENNEDY
                        No, I think I’m gonna stick around 
                        here a little longer.  I have some 
                        more work to get through.

                                 AGNES
                        Okay.  Let me know if you need me 
                        to Postmates you anything.

           Kennedy sadly waves to her as she walks out.  Back to work.

           INT. CRTR OFFICES - HOURS LATER

           The lights in the office are all off except for a small light 
           on Kennedy’s desk.  She’s still toiling over her and Stevie’s 
           work.

           INT. CRTR OFFICES - THE NEXT MORNING

           Critters, including Kennedy’s team, are filing in to begin 
           their day.  Kennedy, eyes bloodshot, is still working.

                                 AGNES
                        Kennedy, did you stay here all 
                        night?

                                 KENNEDY
                        Yeah, but it’s not so bad!  It 
                        saved me gas money on the commute 
                        and I got to make a midnight snack 
                        out of the loose crackers I found 
                        in my drawer, so it sort of was 
                        like Chopped!

           Agnes shakes her head and sits down to work.  Kennedy gathers 
           up her paperwork in her arms and stands up to give it to 
           Stevie.

           Just then, MIKE SHORE (50s, trim, bald), the head of 
           Kennedy’s pod, appears in the cubicles.  He gestures for 
           everyone to listen.

                                 MIKE
                        Pop a squat, Critters.

           The members of the pod take seats.  Stevie sits in Kennedy’s 
           chair.  With nowhere to sit, Kennedy smiles at Stevie and 
           awkwardly SQUATS on her heels in the middle of the floor.

                                 STEVIE
                             (whispering to Kennedy)
                        You smell like B.O.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 STEVIE (CONT'D)
                                 STEVIE (CONT'D)
                        This is why women shouldn’t be 
                        gamers, they can’t “pull off” not 
                        washing like dudes can.

           She quietly laughs “with” him.

                                 MIKE
                        Big announcement, gang.  Sergio has 
                        decided that CRTR is going to hold 
                        an in-house competition to find the 
                        next member and project for the 
                        Dream Team.

           The whole pod’s EYES LIGHT UP.  Everyone wants this spot.

                                 MIKE (CONT'D)
                        That new guy brought in from Amazon 
                        turned out to be a pedophile, so 
                        Serge thought we should focus on 
                        fostering development from within 
                        CRTR for now.  We’ll do a little 
                        presentation tomorrow of project 
                        pitches and then go from there.  
                        Good talk, gang!

           He holds out his hand for fist bumps and all the team members 
           fist bump him.  He walks off.

           Kennedy and Agnes huddle together excitedly.

                                 KENNEDY
                        I can’t believe it.  We have a 
                        chance to get on the Dream Team.

                                 AGNES
                        You have to go for it!  You are by 
                        far the most talented coder here, 
                        and you’ve never tried to get 
                        someone to kill themselves by 
                        cyberbullying over 4Chan.  You’re 
                        basically a unicorn in the tech 
                        world.

                                 KENNEDY
                        This could change everything.  If I 
                        got on the Dream Team, I wouldn’t 
                        have to do Stevie’s homework 
                        anymore.  I’d get a raise, I could 
                        move out of my apartment with Marta 
                        and I could actually be happy for 
                        once.
                             (getting excited)
                        I do have this idea.  Maybe it’s 
                        nothing, but I like it...
                                 AGNES
                        Yes!

           Kennedy catches herself.

                                 KENNEDY
                        I have to stay calm.  And that 
                        doesn’t just mean not getting 
                        angry.  I can’t get too excited 
                        about this yet...

                                 AGNES
                        You can do it, Kennedy.  I know you 
                        can.

           Kennedy smiles to herself, lost in thought.

           INT. KENNEDY’S KITCHEN - THAT NIGHT

           That night, Kennedy is hard at work in her apartment.  Her 
           laptop is open on the table and is surrounded by papers and 
           notes.  She looks happy, really and truly happy.

           Marta enters, wiping her mouth on her sleeve.  Her shirt says 
           “DR. WHO: THE OTHER OTHER WHITE MEAT” with a sexy picture of 
           Christopher Eccleston.  She’s still wearing a VR headset.  
           She pulls out the Keurig machine and STUFFS A STRING CHEESE 
           in the hole for the coffee pod.

                                 MARTA
                        Whatcha working on?

                                 KENNEDY
                        There’s this promotion at work I’m 
                        sorta up for--

                                 MARTA
                             (interrupting)
                        Cool, do you mind if I use the 
                        table?  I have to put my anti-
                        nausea pills in the fondue ‘cause I 
                        really hate the taste of them.

           Kennedy, still smiling, moves all her papers into one tiny 
           corner of the table.  Marta takes a bite of her cheese-and-
           pill fondue and GAGS STRONGLY.

           INT. KENNEDY’S CAR - THE NEXT MORNING

           Kennedy is happily driving to work.  She’s making her daily 
           call.
                                 VOICE MAIL
                        “Hello, you’ve reached Karen Howdy!  
                        I’ve stepped away from my phone.  
                        Please leave a message and I’ll get 
                        back to you shortly!  Ken, how do I 
                        turn this off--”

           Her voice is cut off by a beep.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Hi, mama.  Today for the first time 
                        since you died, I think I’m gonna 
                        have a really good day.  I worked 
                        so hard and I honestly think my 
                        idea is really good.  I’m still 
                        gonna stay calm, but... yeah, I 
                        think it’s gonna be a really good 
                        day.  Okay.  Call me back when you 
                        can.

           She hangs up and smiles.

           INT. CRTR OFFICES - LATER

           Kennedy happily walks to her desk, excited for the project 
           pitches.  Agnes comes over.

                                 AGNES
                        Are you so pumped for today?

                                 KENNEDY
                        I’m reasonably and appropriately 
                        pumped.  But I worked all night and 
                        I think my pitch turned out pretty 
                        solid!

                                 AGNES
                        What’s your project?

                                 KENNEDY
                        So.

           She opens her laptop and pulls out her paper notes to show 
           Agnes.

                                 KENNEDY (CONT'D)
                        It’s called “Teaser,” spelled “T-S-
                        R”.  It's a dating app like Tinder, 
                        but for female, trans, or femme 
                        users there's a big emergency 
                        button.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 KENNEDY (CONT'D)
                                 KENNEDY (CONT'D)
                        When you press it, it floods your 
                        phone with electricity and turns it 
                        into a makeshift taser.

           As she talks, we see a little animation on her screen 
           illustrating how this would work.

                                 KENNEDY (CONT'D)
                        I want to work on something that 
                        will make women and other 
                        marginalized people feel safe and 
                        empowered.  And like they’re in 
                        control of their own body.  Because 
                        it’s really horrible to feel like 
                        you’re not in control, and I don’t 
                        want any other women to ever feel 
                        that way.

           She quickly pulls herself together, realizing she’s revealed 
           too much.

                                 KENNEDY (CONT'D)
                        Or something like that.

                                 AGNES
                        That’s truly wonderful.  I can’t 
                        wait for the Dream Team to make it.

           Agnes and Kennedy share a nice moment, which is interrupted 
           by Stevie lumbering over to Kennedy.

                                 STEVIE
                        What up, Kennedy.  You ready to 
                        rumble?

                                 KENNEDY
                             (quiet)
                        I don’t really want to rumble.

                                 STEVIE
                        You gotta help me put some 
                        finishing touches on my pitch for 
                        today.  It’s pretty much totally 
                        amazing, but the graphics for the 
                        title page aren’t great.  And since 
                        your specialty is coloring letters, 
                        I thought you’d love to help out.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Of course.  I would love to help 
                        out.  What’s your project pitch?
                                 STEVIE
                        It’s called “Wifi-pedia”.  It’s an 
                        online compendium for wifi 
                        passwords, so people can steal from 
                        their neighbors.  I think it really 
                        helps the world.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Yeah.  I wish I had thought of 
                        that.

                                 STEVIE
                        I bet it’s way better than whatever 
                        shitty app for babies you thought 
                        of.
                             (claps)
                        Get on it!  The pitch is about to 
                        start and I need that title page!

           Kennedy sits at Stevie’s desk and starts coding.  While she 
           and Agnes are both indisposed, Stevie opens Kennedy’s pitch 
           for TSR and starts reading it.

                                 STEVIE (CONT'D)
                             (reading)
                        Oh Kennedy, you little Stacy you.  
                        This is some pretty good shit.

           He starts taking pictures of the pitch, then:

                                 STEVIE (CONT'D)
                        Screw it, I’m just taking the whole 
                        thing.

           He emails himself her pitch right as Kennedy starts walking 
           back to her desk.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Here’s your title page for 
                        Wifipedia!  It looks awesome, 
                        Stevie.  I bet you’re gonna win.

           Mike enters.

                                 MIKE
                        Alright, Critters, you ready?  
                        Let’s head to the “jammin’” room 
                        for your pitches!
                             (explaining)
                        “Jammin’ room” is what we’re 
                        calling conference room six now.

           Kennedy steals herself and gathers her things.
           INT. CRTR CONFERENCE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           The room is filled with excited, antsy Critters.  Kennedy is 
           taking deep breaths, trying to stop herself from getting too 
           excited.

                                 KENNEDY
                             (to herself)
                        Breathe in, breathe out, no anger, 
                        no fear, stay calm.

           Mike stands up in front of the room.

                                 MIKE
                        Hey, gang!  You know toe-jam?  
                        Let’s brain-jam!  I can’t wait to 
                        hear everyone’s pitches for the 
                        Dream Team.  Who wants to start?

           Agnes jostles Kennedy in her seat.

                                 AGNES
                             (whispering)
                        Come on, volunteer!  Your idea is 
                        so good!

                                 KENNEDY
                             (whispering)
                        I don’t want to make a big deal out 
                        of it.  I’ll just wait ‘til 
                        everyone else has gone and they’re 
                        about to turn out the lights, and 
                        I’ll just see if anyone notices I’m 
                        still in my seat.

           Stevie’s hand SHOOTS UP.

                                 MIKE
                        Yes, Stevie!  Start us off strong!  
                        Get up there, bud!

           Stevie stands up, opens his laptop, and clears his throat.

                                 STEVIE
                        So, I know you guys probably think 
                        of me as a really tough alpha guy.  
                        But I’m also a hashtag-feminist, 
                        I’m super into Me-Too stuff, and I 
                        think chicks need to be able to 
                        stand up for themselves.  That’s 
                        why my project pitch is for an app 
                        called “TEASER”, spelled “T-S-R”.

           Kennedy’s eyes GO WIDE.  Agnes looks at her, mouth agape.
                                 STEVIE (CONT'D)
                        “Teaser” is a dating app like 
                        Tinder, but female users can use a 
                        big emergency button that floods 
                        your phone with electricity and 
                        turns it into a makeshift taser.
                             (gets “choked up”)
                        I want to work on something that 
                        will make women feel safe and 
                        empowered.  Because I don’t want 
                        any other women to ever feel like 
                        they’re not in control of their own 
                        bodies.
                             (wipes away a tear)
                        I thought of this, using 
                        experiences I had.  As me.  Thank 
                        you.

           He bows.  A moment of silence, then FURIOUS, THUNDEROUS 
           APPLAUSE.

           Kennedy looks like she’s about to cry.  She is nearly 
           hyperventilating.

                                 KENNEDY
                             (to herself)
                        Breathe in, breathe out, breathe 
                        in, breathe out, breathe in--

           She accidentally makes eye contact with David, which is the 
           last straw of embarrassment.  She RUNS OUT of the conference 
           room before anything bad can happen.

                                 STEVIE
                             (smug)
                        She must’ve just been really choked 
                        up by all that stuff I said about 
                        being a woman and shit.

           Off Agnes’ horrified look...

           INT. CRTR HOLIDAY PARTY - THAT NIGHT

           The CRTR annual holiday party is in full swing.  They’ve 
           rented out an event space and it’s a swinging shindig.  
           Critters are drinking, dancing.

           People keep coming over to Stevie and congratulating him on 
           his amazing pitch for the Dream Team.

                                 CRITTER #1
                        Hey, I heard you crushed your pitch 
                        today, dude.
                                 CRITTER #2
                        Yeah!  Dude, you’re such a 
                        feminist!

                                 STEVIE
                             (smug)
                        Aww, thanks, it was no biggie.  I’m 
                        just an empath, you know?

           They all go back to partying.  Stevie sips his drink.

           Reveal that a VISIBLY-WASTED KENNEDY is hiding behind a 
           potted plant in the corner.  Agnes sees Kennedy hiding and 
           goes over to her.

                                 AGNES
                        Um, Ken?  Are you okay?

                                 KENNEDY
                             (slurring)
                        I’m great.  Thanks, sweet-cheeks.

                                 AGNES
                        You never drink, though...

                                 KENNEDY
                             (slurring)
                        Well, my life is over and my mom is 
                        dead, so why the hell not.

           She does two shots of tequila at once.

                                 AGNES
                        Where did you get those?

                                 KENNEDY
                        Floor.

           Kennedy spots Stevie celebrating his successful pitch.  Her 
           eyes narrow and she becomes hyper-focused on him.  With all 
           her liquid courage, she walks over to him.

                                 STEVIE
                        Kennedy!  Great to see you, happy 
                        holidays!  Such a bummer you ran 
                        out of the meeting today, I figured 
                        you had cramps or something.  I’ll 
                        buy the girls bathroom some Midol 
                        with all the money I’m making at my 
                        new position on the Dream Team.

                                 KENNEDY
                        You know what, Stevie...
           She tries to keep talking, but all of a sudden...

           A shadow falls over her face... A shadow she hasn’t 
           experienced since she was a little girl...  Her eyes turn 
           black, and...

           LAMASHTU IS BACK.

           For the first time in twenty years.  Lamashtu is BACK.  She 
           speaks out of Kennedy.

                                 LAMASHTU
                             (screaming through 
                              Kennedy)
                        Listen up, you taint-less cum-
                        stain.  Your mother is sucking 
                        cocks in hell, and if you don’t go 
                        to our superior at work and tell 
                        him how you stole Kennedy’s idea, 
                        then you will be, too.  And they 
                        won’t be nice cocks that you’d be 
                        happy to suck.  They’d be demon 
                        cocks, they’d be way weirder than 
                        normal cocks, which are already 
                        pretty weird!

           Kennedy/Lamashtu’s head SWIVELS around.  She pulls TWO LARGE 
           TUFTS of hair out of Stevie’s head and THROWS UP pea soup all 
           over Stevie’s front.

           Stevie immediately starts CRYING.

                                 STEVIE
                        Oh my god, oh my god, I’m sorry, 
                        I’ll tell Mike first thing, I’m 
                        sorry!  Oh my god, this was a new 
                        sweater, my mom’s gonna kill me!

           He PEES HIS PANTS.  As the wetness spreads, he runs away out 
           of the party.

           Kennedy’s eyes return to normal.  She doesn’t wait for anyone 
           to say anything -- she runs out of the party.

           INT. KENNEDY’S ROOM - LATER

           Back in her apartment bedroom, Kennedy looks at herself in 
           the mirror.  She looks HORRIBLE -- bloodshot eyes, green 
           vomit on her shirt.

                                 KENNEDY
                             (talking to the mirror)
                        This can’t be happening.

                                 (MORE)
                                 KENNEDY (CONT'D)
                                 KENNEDY (CONT'D)
                        This absolutely cannot be 
                        happening.  I’m sure it was just 
                        the alcohol.  I didn’t even eat pea 
                        soup today.  Breathe in, breathe 
                        out.  Stay calm.

           Off her worried face:

           INT. CRTR OFFICES - THE NEXT DAY

           Kennedy is at her desk, head down, trying to avoid eye 
           contact.  The other people in her pod look at her like the 
           demon that she is.

           Mike taps Kennedy on the shoulder and she whips her head up.

                                 KENNEDY
                             (panicky)
                        Hi, good morning, Mike.  You doing 
                        okay?  Can I help you with 
                        anything?

                                 MIKE
                        Hey, yeah, you actually can.  Pop a 
                        squat.
                             (off Kennedy’s look)
                        Oh, sure, you’ve already popped 
                        one, great.  Sooo, last night at 
                        like one I got a weird call from 
                        Stevie.  He sounded really panicky 
                        and he told me that he stole the 
                        Teaser idea from you.  Is that 
                        true?

                                 KENNEDY
                        I mean, I don’t want to lie.  It is 
                        true, but no worries...

                                 MIKE
                        Hmm.  This is all pretty weird...  
                        Can you come explain what happened 
                        to the Dream Team?  They were all 
                        pretty excited about Stevie.

                                 KENNEDY
                        I-- I guess.

           Kennedy nervously follows Mike into a private conference 
           room.
           INT. CRTR CONFERENCE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           They enter a conference room where a dozen douchey-looking 
           men are all gathered around the table.  This is the DREAM 
           TEAM.

                                 MIKE
                        Hey, buddys.  Here’s Kennedy Howdy, 
                        the coder who says that Stevie 
                        Martinet stole her idea for Teaser.

                                 KENNEDY
                             (timid)
                        Hi.

           Kennedy shyly waves hello.  The Dream Team barely registers 
           that Kennedy is there.  Douche #1 gives her a skeptical look.

                                 DOUCHE #1
                        None of this really makes sense.  
                        Stevie stole from you?  Why would 
                        he do that?  He’s always seemed 
                        like a really cool guy.

                                 DOUCHE #2
                        Maybe he was trying to show you he 
                        was a cool guy by collaborating.  I 
                        feel like he always tries to 
                        empower women.

                                 DOUCHE #3
                        Yeah, is there any chance he was 
                        empowering you by working with you?

                                 KENNEDY
                        I... really don’t think so...

           Kennedy is trying to practice breathing, but she’s tearing 
           up.

                                 DOUCHE #1
                        Oh god, are you crying?  Oh man.  
                        I’m really sorry, but we need cool-
                        headed dreamers who can handle the 
                        pressure and stand up for 
                        themselves.

           Kennedy is speechless as the men continue to laugh.  She 
           tries to find the words but can’t.

           Until...

           Kennedy finally SNAPS and, yet again, her eyes turn black and 
           LAMASHTU TAKES OVER.
           She STANDS ON THE TABLE and starts yelling.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        You disgusting maggots: take your 
                        balls out of your uncles’ asses 
                        because I am better and smarter 
                        than you’ll ever be.  I have more 
                        talent in my clit than you have in 
                        your entire rotting asshole.

           She makes all the chairs in the room LEVITATE slightly off 
           the ground.  Then they come CRASHING down, rattling the whole 
           room.  The seams of the walls all start to BLEED.

           After she finishes, the men are all silent.  Then: they start 
           APPLAUDING.

                                 MIKE
                        Wow, Kennedy, I had no idea you 
                        were such a go-getter!  Did you 
                        come in here after work and rig up 
                        the room?

                                 DOUCHE #3
                        This is just like Criss Angel!

                                 DOUCHE #1
                        Fuck yes!  Fuck!  Yes!  This is 
                        what I was talking about!  This is 
                        the kind of energy we need!

                                 DOUCHE #2
                        Welcome to the Dream Team!

           They all high-five her.  Kennedy is pleased with herself.

           From outside the conference room, David’s eyes meet Ken’s 
           through a window.  They smile.

           INT. KENNEDY’S ROOM - LATER

           Kennedy has rushed home in a frenzy.  She again looks at 
           herself in the mirror.  She doesn’t exactly look scared -- 
           more curious than anything else.

           She speaks out loud directly to Lamashtu, to herself in the 
           mirror.

                                 KENNEDY
                             (tentative)
                        Oh man, I’m going crazy.  Hi, 
                        Lamashtu?  Um, long time, no talk!  
                        Ha ha!  Well, if you can hear me... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 KENNEDY (CONT'D)
                                 KENNEDY (CONT'D)
                        whatever you did back there... do 
                        it again tomorrow?  Please?  Then 
                        we can really talk. 

           No response.  Kennedy hopes for the best.

           INT. DREAM TEAM OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY

           The next day is Ken's first day on the Dream Team.  Mike 
           shows her to her desk.

                                 MIKE
                        Feel free to hit me up if you have 
                        any questions about the Dream Team.  
                        But I’m sure you’ll be fine.  Just 
                        keep up that go-get-em attitude 
                        from yesterday and you’ll thrive.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Got it!

           Kennedy’s all smiles as she opens up her laptop.  The men on 
           the Dream Team are playing table tennis in their fancy 
           office.  Another DOUCHE turns to Kennedy.

                                 DOUCHE #4
                        I missed the meeting yesterday.  
                        Who are you?

                                 KENNEDY
                        I’m the new girl on the Dream Team.

                                 DOUCHE #3
                        Could you bring me some coffee, 
                        sweetie?

           The guys laugh.  Kennedy is speechless again.

                                 KENNEDY
                             (whispering to herself)
                        Please help me.

           Kennedy’s eyes go black.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        I can’t believe you have terminal 
                        erectile dysfunction and this is 
                        what you decided to do with your 
                        Make-A-Wish.  Your cock is softer 
                        than the top of a baby’s head.
           Douche #3’s jaw drops.  He’s hit in the side of the face with 
           a ping-pong ball.  All the other guys laugh at him.  Kennedy 
           sits down, proudly.

           INT. CRTR OFFICES - KENNEDY’S OLD DESK - MOMENTS LATER

           Kennedy is gathering up her stuff from her old desk to move 
           to her new one.  Agnes excitedly hugs her.

                                 AGNES
                        Oh my gosh, Ken, how did you become 
                        such a bad-ass?!  You are such a 
                        role model!

           Kennedy, with black eyes, laughs in Agnes’ face.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        I sure hope I’m not your role 
                        model, ‘cause that would mean you 
                        learned to dress from me.  Where 
                        did you even get those shirt 
                        stains?  Giving Ronald McDonald a 
                        rim job?

           Agnes instantly looks crushed.  Kennedy slaps her mouth shut 
           and her eyes return to normal.  She turns her back to Agnes 
           so she can whisper to herself:

                                 KENNEDY
                             (to herself)
                        No.  You cannot do that, not to 
                        her.  You have to be nicer or I’m 
                        going to lock you up again.

           Kennedy turns back to Agnes.

                                 KENNEDY (CONT'D)
                        I’m so sorry about that.  I’m just 
                        under a lot of stress and I think 
                        it’s coming out in inappropriate 
                        ways.  You absolutely do not look 
                        like you gave Ronald McDonald an 
                        “R”-job.

                                 AGNES
                             (suspicious)
                        It’s okay.  I understand.

                                 KENNEDY
                        I promise I’m sorry.  I’m really 
                        excited for the Hamburglar party!  
                        It will help me relax and have a 
                        little fun!
           Kennedy waves and rushes off.  Agnes clocks that Kennedy is 
           acting weird.

           INT. KENNEDY’S BATHROOM - THAT NIGHT

           Kennedy rushes home again.  She has had a taste of Lamashtu 
           and she LOVES IT.  She wants more.

           She LOCKS herself in the bathroom and stares at herself in 
           the mirror.  She unlocks a locked drawer and pulls out the 
           SIGIL OF LAMASHTU, that Father Eliot dropped so many years 
           before.

           Kennedy draws a SIGIL OF LAMASHTU ON HER MIRROR IN LIPSTICK.  
           She sets a little vial of WATER next to it.

                                 KENNEDY
                             (softy)
                        I summon thee, Lamashtu, slayer of 
                        children and drinker of the blood 
                        of men.  Disturber of sleep, 
                        bringer of nightmares, double-
                        headed serpent, lover of 
                        miscarriage.  I summon thee, Mother 
                        of Evil.  My body is yours.

           Her body is rocked as Lamashtu takes over.

                                 LAMASHTU
                             (screaming)
                        You fucking bitch!!!  I've been 
                        living in your butt for like 20 
                        years and you finally let me out?!  
                        I'm gonna fucking kill you!!

           A BIG FIGHT ensues.  Lamashtu takes over (we can tell from 
           the black eyes) and uses Kennedy’s hands to grab her own hair 
           and DRAG HER INTO THE WALL REPEATEDLY.  Kennedy/Lamashtu 
           starts LEVITATING a foot off the ground.

                                 KENNEDY
                             (screaming)
                        Stop it!  You’re gonna hurt me!

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Oh, I’m not going to kill you, I’m 
                        just going to make you wish you 
                        were dead--

           Lamashtu SWINGS KENNEDY’S BODY UP TO THE CEILING!  She sticks 
           to the ceiling and Kennedy tries to CRAWL DOWN THE WALL to 
           escape Lamashtu.  They SWITCH BACK AND FORTH quickly. 
                                                        LAMASHTU (CONT'D)
                          KENNEDY
           Stop--  You can’t do this--  
           I’m your gracious host--  I’m 
           going to--  Make you--
                                              I’m going to keep doing this 
                                              until one side of your head 
                                              is perfectly flat--   And 
                                              when’s the last time you 
                                              dusted up here--

           Kennedy, crawling down the wall, is finally able to reach the 
           VIAL OF HOLY WATER that she’s brought with her.  She CHUGS 
           the water, which instantly causes Lamashtu EXCRUCIATING PAIN.

                                 LAMASHTU (CONT'D)
                             (in pain)
                        Aaaaaahhhh you dirty little slam 
                        pig!  I’m going to make you pay!

           As Lamashtu doubles over, Kennedy is able to gain control of 
           her again.  Kennedy does some deep breathing while staring 
           into the mirror.

           In a last ditch effort, Lamashtu APPEARS IN THE MIRROR in her 
           true form.  We see Kennedy’s face morph into Lamashtu’s face -
           - a HORRIFIC, WRINKLED FACE OF AN ANIMALISTIC OLD WOMAN.

           With one more deep breath, Kennedy snaps back to herself.  
           The face disappears.  (As she flips back and forth between 
           Kennedy and Lamashtu for the rest of the scene, her eyes flip 
           from black to normal-colored.)

                                 KENNEDY
                        No, you won’t.  Because I’m in 
                        total control of you.  You only get 
                        to come out when I say, or I take 
                        deep breaths and drink this holy 
                        water, which you hate.  And let me 
                        tell you, I could drink this tasty 
                        refreshment for days.  Holy Water 
                        is like the original LaCroix.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        What the fuck you talking about, 
                        bitch!!  You think you’re in 
                        control of me?!  I can leave 
                        whenever I want, and I’ll do 
                        something horrible to your body 
                        before I go.

                                 KENNEDY
                        No, you can’t.  Or you would’ve 
                        left years before now.  What in the 
                        world could you possibly be getting 
                        out of living inside me, trapped?  
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 KENNEDY (CONT'D)
                                 KENNEDY (CONT'D)
                        And you just said you weren’t going 
                        to kill me, which I assume means 
                        you can’t.

           Beat of silence.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Okay.  So what?  I can’t kill you.  
                        Demons aren’t allowed to kill 
                        possessed women, they’re sacred 
                        vessels.  But I could give you the 
                        big Ben Affleck phoenix tattoo and 
                        you’d kill yourself for me.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Looks like we’re stuck together, 
                        then.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        It’s not my fucking fault.  You 
                        locked me away.  I couldn’t leave.  
                        The only way I can get out of your 
                        ass is through a real exorcism.

           Lamashtu/Kennedy starts pacing.

                                 LAMASHTU (CONT'D)
                        Damn it, it was such a great plan.  
                        I was going to possess you, some 
                        random weak little girl with a 
                        famous actress mom, then once you 
                        grew up I was going to make you 
                        become president of the United 
                        States.  I was going to use your 
                        platform to rain death and 
                        pestilence on the whole world and 
                        then my stupid family was going to 
                        know how truly evil I was.

                                 KENNEDY
                        I mean, that’s a pretty bad idea.  
                        People in this country don’t really 
                        like voting for women--

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Well, I didn’t fucking know that at 
                        the fucking time.

                                 KENNEDY
                             (sarcastic)
                        I’m so sorry your perfect plan 
                        didn’t work out.  If it makes you 
                        feel any better, you did ruin one 
                        person’s life: mine.
                                 LAMASHTU
                        Oh, boo-hoo.  It wasn’t so great 
                        for me, either.  Bitch, you eat 
                        salads all the time and I hate it 
                        so much.  Feed me dead cat for 
                        once!  Or at least Chili’s!
                             (beat)
                        Why are you talking to me after all 
                        this time?

                                 KENNEDY
                        I want to make a deal.  My co-
                        workers seemed to really respond to 
                        your “vibe” that I was tapping 
                        into.  If you help me be crazier 
                        and more aggressive at work, I’ll 
                        free you.  Just get me to a good 
                        place professionally, and I’ll get 
                        the best priest in town to exorcise 
                        you for good.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        I don’t know...  I’m not one of 
                        those girls that gets along great 
                        with other girls...
                             (then)
                        You promise you’ll exorcise me?

                                 KENNEDY
                        I promise.

           Lamashtu’s face lights up.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Well, then hell yeah, bitch!  Watch 
                        what I can do!

           Lamashtu/Kennedy grabs scissors, unlocks the door, and runs 
           out of the bathroom.

           INT. MARTA’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Lamashtu/Kennedy sneaks into Marta’s bedroom, where she’s 
           asleep in the nude.

                                 KENNEDY
                             (whispering)
                        What are you doing?!

                                 LAMASHTU
                        I’m helping you stand up for 
                        yourself.
           Lamashtu makes the scissors MAGICALLY LEVITATE.  They float 
           over to where Marta is sleeping.  It looks like Lamashtu is 
           about to kill Marta, then she starts CUTTING OFF MARTA’S 
           HAIR.  Marta wakes up and SCREAMS.

                                 MARTA
                        What the fuck are you doing?!

           Lamashtu gets up in Marta’s face.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        If you don’t start paying rent, I’m 
                        going to take one more inch off 
                        your scalp every day until I’m 
                        giving your brainstem a fade.

                                 MARTA
                        Is this real life?!  Force quit!

           Marta is terrified and quickly opens her wallet and gives all 
           her cash to Lamashtu/Kennedy.  Lamashtu flashes her a thumbs 
           up.

                                 LAMASHTU
                             (cheery)
                        Thank you kindly!  See you later, 
                        you hormonally-imbalanced sea cow!

           She slams the door.

           INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Kennedy is glaring the hallway.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Look, you can’t be doing stuff like 
                        this.  Or else I won’t exorcise 
                        you.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Isn’t this what you fucking wanted?  
                        I got your rent, didn’t I?

                                 KENNEDY
                        But I don’t want it like this.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        I didn’t realize beggars could be 
                        choosers.  They should make an 
                        expression to remind beggars 
                        whether or not they can be 
                        choosers.
                                 KENNEDY
                        Don’t talk to me anymore.  Just 
                        help me.

           Exasperated, they go back to bed.

           INT. CRTR OFFICES - THE NEXT DAY

           JUMP CUTS of Lamashtu being mean to men at work and people 
           responding to it.

           -- Kennedy/Lamashtu points and laughs at a member of the 
           Dream Team as he tries to speak.

           -- Kennedy/Lamashtu steals food off of a Dream Team guy’s 
           plate.

           -- Kennedy/Lamashtu uses a remote to crank up a Dream Team 
           guy’s standing desk until he has to jump to see his monitor.

           -- David smiles at Kennedy/Lamashtu.

           INT. CRTR OFFICES - SIMULTANEOUS

           From her cubicle, Agnes sadly watches Kennedy hold court and 
           have a great time.  Kennedy walks past her desk and Agnes 
           gets her attention.

                                 AGNES
                        Hey, Ken!  It looks like you’re 
                        having a pretty good time on the 
                        Dream Team.  You still planning on 
                        coming to my Hamburglar party?  You 
                        don’t have to dress up as the 
                        Hamburglar if you don’t want, you 
                        could be Grimace if that’s easier.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Yes, of course!  I wouldn’t miss it 
                        for the world.  So sorry, I can’t 
                        really talk, I’m late for a 
                        meeting.

           Kennedy/Lamashtu rushes off.  Agnes smiles sadly.

           EXT. OUTSIDE CRTR - CONTINUOUS

           Kennedy/Lamashtu are walking to their car in silence.  Then:
                                 KENNEDY
                             (apologetic)
                        Lamashtu, I know I snapped at you, 
                        but: you’ve been really helpful.

           Silence.

                                 KENNEDY (CONT'D)
                        As an olive branch, I wanted to 
                        take you out as a thank you.  
                        Somewhere special.  You choose.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        ...anywhere?

                                 KENNEDY
                        Anywhere.

           Off Lamashtu’s excited look, we:

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. CHILI’S - THAT NIGHT

           Kennedy/Lamashtu celebrate their promotion together by having 
           a GIRLS NIGHT OUT at Chili's.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        I honestly didn’t know they had 
                        Chili’s outside of hell!  I thought 
                        we did that!

           They walk to the bar.

                                 KENNEDY
                        What a great first day!  I had no 
                        idea that men liked it so much when 
                        you bossed them around!

                                 LAMASHTU
                        It’s like a “Madonna/whore” thing.  
                        And let me tell you, I know the 
                        real Madonna, and she fucking 
                        sucks.  So boring.  Way better to 
                        be the whore.

                                 LAMASHTU (CONT'D)
                        Let’s get drinks.  I’m buying.  
                        What’ll it be?
                                 KENNEDY
                        Oh, I’m fine.  Don’t want to party 
                        too hard, we have work tomorrow 
                        morning.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Oh, nuh uh, sorry, you don’t 
                        understand.  I only get drunk if 
                        your body gets drunk.  And I will 
                        be getting drunk tonight.  So you 
                        better start doing shots, honey.  
                        Or I’ll start chomping on your 
                        large intestine until you bleed out 
                        your asshole and die in the middle 
                        of this casual dining chain 
                        restaurant.
                             (cheery)
                        So what’ll it be?

                                 KENNEDY
                             (scared)
                        Three skinny margaritas, please.

           INT. CHILI’S - HALF AN HOUR LATER

           Kennedy/Lamashtu are now wasted.  A beautiful, tall, blonde 
           waitress with a name tag announcing her as CARLY puts a huge 
           bowl of chili and two more skinny margaritas in front of 
           Kennedy/Lamashtu.

                                 CARLY
                        Your chili, and your skinny margs.

                                 KENNEDY
                             (slurring)
                        Thank you kindly, sweet meat!

           Carly walks away.  They sit at a table by themselves laughing 
           and talking with each other and eating a bowl of chili.  
           Kennedy/Lamashtu keeps their head down, so they don’t seem 
           too weird.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Just one more bite.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Oh my god, no, I am so full!  I’m 
                        gonna barf!

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Do you think I care?  I haven’t had 
                        chili since I was in hell.  Feed me 
                        more chili!  The nectar of Satan!
           Kennedy forces down a bite of chili and laughs.  She sees a 
           guy setting up a KARAOKE STAGE in the back.

                                 LAMASHTU (CONT'D)
                        Oh my god, karaoke.  Demons used to 
                        talk about this all the time, but I 
                        never got to do it.  We have to.

                                 KENNEDY
                        I can’t.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Here, come on, let’s find a good 
                        song.  You owe me.  I had to listen 
                        to you do that stupid fucking 
                        mantra for like thirty years,
                             (mocking)
                        “Breathe in, breathe out, no anger, 
                        no fear.”  Who do you think you 
                        are, Gwyneth Paltrow?

           Kennedy is clearly hurt by this.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Come on, it worked.  My mom thought 
                        of it.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Shut up about your dead mom, we’re 
                        singing!

           She drags Kennedy up to the stage, punches in a number to the 
           karaoke machine, and gets ready.

           The song “The Boy Is Mine” by Brandy & Monica starts to play.  
           The other patrons of the Chili’s bar look curiously at 
           Kennedy/Lamashtu.  To them, it looks like one weird woman is 
           attempting to sing both parts of the famous duet.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Excuse me!  Can I, please, talk to 
                        you for a minute?

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Uh huh.  Sure.  You know, you look 
                        kinda familiar--

                                 KENNEDY
                        Yeah, you do too.  But I just 
                        wanted to know, do you know 
                        somebody named...  You know his 
                        name--
                                 LAMASHTU
                        Oh yeah, definitely I know his name-
                        -

                                 KENNEDY
                        Well, I just want to let you that 
                        he's mine--

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Huh.  No, no.  He's mine!

           The audience gives Kennedy/Lamashtu odd looks as they start 
           singing “a duet.”  Kennedy/Lamashtu is somehow able to make 
           two notes come out of her mouth at once -- she is actually 
           singing with two voices.

                                 KENNEDY/LAMASHTU
                        You need to give it up / Had about 
                        enough / It's not hard to see / The 
                        boy is mine / I'm sorry that you / 
                        Seem to be confused / He belongs to 
                        me / The boy is mine!

           They totally win the audience over.  As they finish their 
           duet, the audience BURSTS INTO APPLAUSE.  As Kennedy/Lamashtu 
           happily walks off stage, a ton of free drinks are shoved into 
           her hands.

                                 LAMASHTU
                             (quietly)
                        Let’s go to the bathroom where we 
                        can really talk.

           Kennedy/Lamashtu walk towards the bathroom.

           INT. CHILI’S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           They giggle and hide in a bathroom stall.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Bitch, you’re fun!  Why didn’t you 
                        ever kick back like this when I was 
                        in jail in your ass?

                                 KENNEDY
                        I was... scared.  That you would 
                        take over.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Scared of me?!  I’m not scary!  I’m 
                        only scary if you’re
                             (listing on her fingers)

                                 LAMASHTU (CONT'D)
                        A pregnant woman, a breastfeeding 
                        woman, a baby or child of any age, 
                        any type of man, a snake, foliage, 
                        a lake, a river, or anything.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Ya know, it’s kinda fun to have 
                        someone to talk to.  I only ever 
                        had two friends, and I couldn’t get 
                        too close to Agnes because I didn’t 
                        want you to hurt her.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Yeah, ‘cause she’s pregnant, right?  
                        I mean, she looks like she is.

           Lamashtu laughs.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Stop it.
                             (sighs)
                        The only real friend I ever had was 
                        my mom.  The only person I could 
                        truly be myself to.  No one else 
                        really likes me.  Everyone just 
                        thinks of me as the quiet girl who 
                        can’t get mad.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Yeah.  I just thought of you as my 
                        weird, boring car.

                                 KENNEDY
                        I just get so jealous of normal 
                        girls.  Like Carly.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Our waitress?

                                 KENNEDY
                        She’s so tall, so beautiful.  She’s 
                        got cool hair and works wherever 
                        she wants.  I wish my life could be 
                        like that.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        It could be.  Let’s just get 
                        drunker.

           They leave the stall and walk back out to the bar.
           INT. CHILI’S BAR - CONTINUOUS

           Kennedy/Lamashtu sit at the bar.  Carly comes to take their 
           order.

                                 CARLY
                        More skinny margs?

                                 KENNEDY
                        No, let’s switch to...
                             (reading the cocktail 
                              menu)
                        ...The Hellraiser.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        It’s a joke that you don’t get.

           Carly walks off, shaking her head.  Kennedy starts laughing 
           again.  Then: someone taps her on the shoulder.  She whips 
           her head around to find... DAVID.  Her crush from work.  
           Here.  At the Chili’s.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Oh my god.  David?  David 
                        Ledbetter?  You live near Mass 
                        General but why would I know that?

           He sits down next to her.

                                 DAVID
                        Ha, yeah.  That’s me.  And you’re 
                        Kennedy?  Kennedy Howdy?  You just 
                        got on the Dream Team and you’re 
                        pretty cute even though you have 
                        chili running down your arm?

           He picks up a drink napkin and dabs at the chili as Kennedy 
           looks on, horrified.  He winks at her.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        You know, I never really noticed 
                        you before, but the last few days, 
                        you’ve been so... interesting.  
                        Would you want to grab a drink or a 
                        trough of chili or something?

                                 KENNEDY
                             (tongue-tied)
                        Y-- yes.

                                 DAVID
                        Cool.  Tomorrow, after work?

           Kennedy just slowly nods, deer in the headlights.
                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        Cool.  See you around, Kennedy.

           He licks the napkin and slowly wipes a little more chili off 
           her arm.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        You don’t need it.  You look good 
                        without makeup.

           He smiles, gets up, and leaves.  Kennedy’s mouth is fully 
           open.  After awhile, Lamashtu buts in.

                                 LAMASHTU
                             (excited)
                        Oh, thank fucking god.  We’re about 
                        to get fucked.

           INT. KENNEDY’S ROOM - THE NEXT DAY

           The next day, after work.  Kennedy/Lamashtu is getting ready 
           for her date.

                                 KENNEDY
                        I can’t believe I’m going on a 
                        date.  With David.  David!  From my 
                        crush!

           She rummages through her closet.

                                 KENNEDY (CONT'D)
                        Thank god I took advantage of that 
                        sale on Kirkland-brand evening wear 
                        at Costco last month.

           She holds up an extremely ugly floor-length jean skirt.

                                 KENNEDY (CONT'D)
                        Now, which top do you think goes 
                        better with this skirt?  I like how 
                        the denim in this top really brings 
                        out the denim in the skirt.  But 
                        the sleeves of this one look like 
                        Game of Thrones.  Hmmm...

           She lays a denim shirt and a peasant blouse on the bed next 
           to the skirt.

                                 LAMASHTU
                             (encouraging)
                        I think they’re both so cute, Ken!  
                        Can I see the outfits to compare?
           Lamashtu picks up the tops, examines them both next to the 
           skirt, then her eyes go RED as she uses her mind to LIGHT THE 
           CLOTHES ON FIRE.

                                 KENNEDY
                        What are you doing?!

                                 LAMASHTU
                        We can't go on a date looking like 
                        that!  I'm not going to live in 
                        some virgin’s body!

           Kennedy looks extremely embarrassed.

                                 KENNEDY
                        You know that?

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Of course you’re a virgin.  I think 
                        it would’ve awakened my slumber if 
                        a dick had suddenly poked me in the 
                        eye.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Well, it wasn’t exactly up to me.  
                        I couldn’t risk letting you out by 
                        getting carried away with myself 
                        during sex.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Luckily for you, no one would come 
                        near you with a ten-foot-dildo 
                        looking the way you do.  I’m not 
                        human and even I know that your 
                        thong isn’t supposed to show above 
                        your high-rise jeans.

                                 KENNEDY
                             (getting angry)
                        You don’t think I would’ve liked to 
                        go on a date?  When other girls 
                        were getting to second base in a 
                        showing of The Sweetest Thing, I 
                        was hiding in my room, alone, 
                        teaching myself C++ and trying not 
                        to feel anything so the demon from 
                        hell that was using my body as an 
                        Embassy Suite wouldn’t bite the 
                        face off anyone!

           She takes a deep breath and gets ahold of herself.  It’s the 
           first time this has been articulated so concisely to 
           Lamashtu.
                                 LAMASHTU
                             (sincere)
                        Look.  I get it.  That sounds 
                        pretty shitty.

           Kennedy nods to herself in the mirror.

                                 LAMASHTU (CONT'D)
                        Hey.  I want to do something nice 
                        for you.  Let me give you a 
                        makeover!

                                 KENNEDY
                        You’re a demon in charge of ripping 
                        fetuses out of pregnant women and 
                        painting their houses with the 
                        blood.  I’m not sure I want to let 
                        you get close to my eye with a 
                        mascara brush.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        I promise this isn’t a trick.  I 
                        want to pay you back.  For, you 
                        know, letting me do all my demon-y 
                        stuff.

           Kennedy thinks about it.

                                 KENNEDY
                        And you’ll actually make me look 
                        good?  Not too far out of my 
                        comfort zone?

                                 LAMASHTU
                        I swear to Humbaba, monstrous giant 
                        of immemorial age raised by Utu, 
                        the Sun, guardian of the Cedar 
                        Forest!
                             (then, quickly)
                        You don’t know him.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Okay.  I guess.  Just don’t do 
                        anything irreversible.

                                 LAMASHTU
                             (extremely excited)
                        I have been waiting twenty years to 
                        do renovations on my house.  Let’s 
                        get a-choppin’!

           A huge grin spreads across Lamashtu’s face...
           INT. KENNEDY’S ROOM - MONTAGE

           ...AS WE ENTER A MAKEOVER MONTAGE!!!!  FINALLY!!!!

           Quick cuts of Lamashtu making over the body she shares with 
           Kennedy:

           -- Lamashtu WAXES Kennedy’s legs.  Kennedy SCREAMS, then 
           quickly switches to Lamashtu, who CACKLES.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Oh, man, that hurts so good!  Why 
                        didn’t I ever think to use leg wax 
                        as torture?  Humans are so good at 
                        torturing women.

           -- Lamashtu is comparing different shades of red nail polish.  
           She pulls up a HORRIFIC CRIME SCENE PHOTO on her phone, and 
           picks the red that most closely matches the blood.

                                 LAMASHTU (CONT'D)
                        Perfect!  I’ve always loved this 
                        shade.

           She starts painting Kennedy/Lamashtu’s nails.

           -- Lamashtu sets a pile of Kennedy’s dresses ON FIRE.

           -- Lamashtu sets a pile of Kennedy’s pants ON FIRE.

           -- Lamashtu holds a handful of Kennedy/Lamashtu’s hair and 
           sets it ON FIRE with her mind.

                                 KENNEDY
                        No, stop!!  Just use scissors!

           Lamashtu shrugs and pinches out the fire.

           -- Lamashtu takes off Kennedy’s glasses and puts contacts in.  
           As she pulls her hands away, we see the contacts are PURE 
           BLACK and Kennedy’s eyes now look demonic.

                                 LAMASHTU
                             (to herself)
                        Gorgeous.  I love how the black in 
                        the irises really brings out the 
                        black in the pupils.

           END OF MONTAGE.
           INT. KENNEDY’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Lamashtu is done and looks excitedly at her project in the 
           mirror.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Are you ready to see the finished 
                        product?

           Kennedy covers her eyes with her hands.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Yes!  Yes!

           Lamashtu uncovers her eyes.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Okay, don’t peek!  One second!

           She spins herself around in her chair so her back is to the 
           mirror.  Kennedy puts her hands over her eyes again.

                                 KENNEDY
                        I won’t!

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Okay,  I’m going to turn you 
                        around.

           Kennedy/Lamashtu, eyes still covered, swivels her chair back 
           around so it’s facing the mirror.

                                 LAMASHTU (CONT'D)
                        Alright.  Open them.

           Kennedy takes her hands off her eyes and GASPS.  She looks 
           AMAZING.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Oh, Lamashtu.  I look amazing!

           She smiles at herself/Lamashtu.

                                 KENNEDY (CONT'D)
                        You even cut out the hair wrap I 
                        got in eighth grade!

           Lamashtu holds up a DIRTY PIECE OF HAIR with thread around 
           it.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        I feel like this has somehow been 
                        wet since 1998?
           Kennedy runs her fingers through her beautiful hair.

                                 KENNEDY
                        I’ve never seen myself like this 
                        before.  I look like... a grown-up.  
                        I never got to be a grown-up.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Yeah, I was sort of going for “hot 
                        adult,” since I’m getting the sense 
                        that “hot kid” is generally frowned 
                        upon outside of the Vatican.

                                 KENNEDY
                        No, I just mean, I was so worried 
                        about you that I never got to have 
                        a normal adolescence.  I didn’t 
                        even pierce my ears, since I was 
                        worried that might cause me to 
                        freak out.  I mean, cause you.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Let’s do it now!

                                 KENNEDY
                        Wait, I don’t have a--

           Before she can finish, Lamashtu grabs a sewing needle and 
           JABS IT THROUGH BOTH EARLOBES, then jams two safety pins 
           through the holes.  Kennedy SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER.  She 
           finally settles down and looks at her ears.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Are you done?

                                 KENNEDY
                        I mean, I don’t love the means, but 
                        the ends are so... sparkly.  Thank 
                        you, Lamashtu.

                                 LAMASHTU
                             (smiling)
                        Call me “Mash.”

           INT. KENNEDY’S APARTMENT - FRONT DOOR - LATER

           Kennedy/Lamashtu is waiting on the couch by her front door.  
           The DOORBELL RINGS.  Kennedy stands up to get the door.  She 
           looks SMOKIN’ HOT.  Hair, dress, face, all on point.  She 
           hesitates for one moment before letting David in.
                                 KENNEDY
                        Now remember.  You only come out if 
                        I say “smorgasbord.”  I want this 
                        to be my date, not yours.

           Lamashtu gives her the thumbs up.  Kennedy nervously opens 
           the front door, letting David in her living room.

                                 KENNEDY (CONT'D)
                        Hey!

                                 DAVID
                        Oh my god, Ken.  You look 
                        unbelievable.  Your legs are so 
                        smooth, they’re like sexy wet 
                        carrots.
                             (then)
                        Sorry, I shouldn’t have said that, 
                        they’re like sexy normal carrots.

           He kisses her on both cheeks.  She looks very flustered.

                                 KENNEDY
                        How sweet!  I’ve had so many kisses 
                        I basically can’t even keep track 
                        of whether those were, like, my 
                        first, or hundredth, or whatever!

                                 DAVID
                        Wanna go to dinner?  I made a 
                        reservation at Eastern Standard 
                        downtown.  It’s sort of like a 
                        fancy Chili’s.

           Kennedy smiles and leads out of her apartment.

           INT. NICE RESTAURANT - LATER

           Kennedy sits across from David at an upscale restaurant.  A 
           waiter comes by the table.

                                 WAITER
                        Welcome to Eastern Standard!  Can I 
                        get you anything to drink?

                                 DAVID
                        Yes, I’ll have a martini and the 
                        lady will have a Long Island iced 
                        tea.

           The waiter nods and walks off.  Kennedy tries to be flirty.
                                 KENNEDY
                        Wow, that was so cool how you 
                        ordered for me!  It made me feel 
                        like I was a princess or sick or 
                        something.  Plus, I’ve never had a 
                        Long Island iced tea.  I’ve never 
                        even been to Long Island!  Though I 
                        once had a layover in Philadelphia.  
                        The accents were gorgeous.

           She giggles nervously.

                                 DAVID
                        It’s no biggie.  I read in The Game 
                        that women like when you guess what 
                        they drink.

                                 KENNEDY
                             (lighting up)
                        Oh, so you like to read?

           The waiter sets down their drinks.

                                 DAVID
                        A toast!  To learning new things 
                        about old co-workers!

           They clink glasses and Kennedy takes a big gulp of her Long 
           Island iced tea.

                                 KENNEDY
                             (forcing it down)
                        Mmmmm, so yummy!  Very exotic.  
                        Long Island must be a really 
                        beautiful place.
                             (to David)
                        So, what made you want to ask me 
                        out?  I didn’t think you knew I 
                        existed.

                                 DAVID
                        I definitely didn’t.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Oh!  Oh, cool!

                                 DAVID
                        I don’t really know that much about 
                        you.  But when I saw you tell off 
                        those guys at CRTR, and that goofy 
                        lady we work with... it just really 
                        piqued my interest.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        I’m a really high-powered guy and I 
                        totally respond to women who can 
                        hold their own.
                             (explaining)
                        I was raised by a hot single mom.

                                 KENNEDY
                             (nervous)
                        Oh, yeah, I was pretty quiet when I 
                        was younger but recently I’ve been 
                        trying to really get in touch with 
                        my aggression...

                                 DAVID
                        I think aggression is sexy.  I’ve 
                        dated like three Krav Maga 
                        instructors.  What do you do for 
                        fun, Kennedy?

                                 KENNEDY
                        Um, I like to code, develop, 
                        respond to work emails, finish the 
                        day’s work, start on tomorrow’s 
                        work...  I guess, I just like to 
                        work.  A lot.

                                 DAVID
                        Naw, man, you can’t be working all 
                        the time!  Work is lame!  I got a 
                        job at CRTR because I loved how you 
                        could come in at whatever time you 
                        wanted in the morning, and I’ve 
                        just sort of stayed there.  I’m 
                        going to show you how to have more 
                        fun.

           He WINKS at her and reaches to touch her hand.  His eyes 
           travel to her chest and linger there.  Kennedy clocks this.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Oh, is there something on my shirt?

                                 DAVID
                             (suave)
                        Yeah.  Your boobs.

           Kennedy’s eyes grow WIDE.

           INT. NICE RESTAURANT - AN HOUR LATER

           David and Kennedy are finishing up their date.  Kennedy is on 
           what is clearly her second or third Long Island.  David is 
           also a little tipsy.
                                 DAVID
                             (mid-story)
                        --What few people know, though, is 
                        that Lima is not a great place to 
                        get molly.  I had to really call in 
                        a bunch of favors to get what I 
                        needed by the christening, ‘cause I 
                        was not going to that sober.
                             (then)
                        Sorry, what was the question?

                                 KENNEDY
                        I asked what your sister does.

                                 DAVID
                        Sorry, sometimes I get a little 
                        carried away when I’m talking about 
                        myself.  I’m a natural storyteller.  
                        All my teachers used to say that.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Mmhmm.

                                 DAVID
                        That reminds me of when I made this 
                        papier mache basketball that my 
                        second grade teacher said was 
                        “literally the best project she’d 
                        ever seen”--

           Kennedy is barely listening.  As David continues to move his 
           lips and talk about himself, the sound fades out and we see 
           what Kennedy is seeing -- his PERFECT FACE, his HUGE BICEPS, 
           the little tuft of CHEST HAIR sticking out of the neck of his 
           shirt.  He’s just so hot that Kennedy does not care he kinda 
           sucks.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        ...Ken?  Kennedy?  Are you 
                        listening?

                                 KENNEDY
                             (snapping out of it)
                        What?  Yes.  Of course I’m 
                        listening.

                                 DAVID
                        I said do you want to go back to my 
                        place for a night cap?

                                 KENNEDY
                        Oh.  Oh!  Yes!  Yes!  I mean...
                             (playing it cool)
                        Sure.
           They stand up and David offers his arm.  Kennedy takes it, 
           and her eyes look like they’re going to pop out of her head.

           INT. DAVID’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Kennedy follows David in to his swanky Boston apartment.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Oh my god, your apartment is 
                        amazing.

                                 DAVID
                        Thanks.  I speculated in Sharper 
                        Image before they went out of 
                        business.  Get this--

           He yells out to his apartment.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        Alexa One, tell Alexa Two to play 
                        music!

           We hear the disembodied voices of Alexa robots.

                                 ALEXA ONE
                        Yes, David.  Alexa, play “Friday 
                        Night” playlist.

                                 ALEXA TWO
                        Yes, Alexa.

           Soft, sexy music starts playing throughout the apartment.

                                 DAVID
                        I got an Alexa to be my first 
                        Alexa’s servant.  Seemed fancy.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Mmhmm!

                                 DAVID
                        Here, lemme take your coat.

           David takes Kennedy’s coat and hangs it up.

                                 KENNEDY
                        So, you live here all by yourself?  
                        No roommate?  No one uses your 
                        bathtub to bleach their motion 
                        sickness bracelets?
                                 DAVID
                             (seductive)
                        Nope.  Just me, all alone.  In my 
                        big lonely apartment.  Just me, my 
                        Alexa, and my Alexa’s slave.

           He slowly turns to Kennedy and moves his face towards hers.

                                 KENNEDY
                             (extremely quiet 
                              whispering)
                        It’s happeningggg...

           Kennedy’s awkward whisper is interrupted by David’s lips 
           meeting hers in a PASSIONATE KISS.  They make out for a 
           little, then David pulls away.

                                 DAVID
                        Do you want to go to the bedroom?

           Kennedy doesn’t know what to say, so she awkwardly does the 
           WAKANDA FOREVER arm-sign.

                                 KENNEDY
                        I mean, yes.
                             (to herself, shaking her 
                              head)
                        Why did I do Wakanda Forever?

           David leads her by the hand to his bedroom.

           INT. DAVID’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           David and Kennedy sit on the bed and continue making out.  He 
           gently starts unzipping her dress and helping her out of it.  
           She starts unbuckling his belt and takes it out of his pants.

                                 KENNEDY
                             (nervous)
                        Cute belt, I like all the holes...
                             (alt)
                        Cute belt, I like all the little 
                        holes and the one big one...

           David starts kissing Kennedy again to get her to stop 
           talking.  He takes off his pants and Kennedy takes off her 
           dress.  They keep kissing.

                                 DAVID
                             (cocking his head down at 
                              his cock’s head)
                        Do you mind?
                                 KENNEDY
                        Oh my god.  I’d love to.  It would 
                        be an honor.

           She crawls down to the bottom of the bed and looks at David’s 
           crotch.  She has NO IDEA where to start.

                                 KENNEDY (CONT'D)
                        So I just...  Do it?  Just... go 
                        for it?

                                 DAVID
                        Sure.  Yes.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Okay.  I’ll just, do the dang... 
                        ding-dang.

           She gets under the covers.  We see David’s face as she’s 
           clearly giving him a blowjob.  He starts with a face of 
           PLEASURE, but quickly makes SHARP FACES OF PAIN.

                                 DAVID
                        What are you doing?

                                 KENNEDY
                             (from under the covers)
                        I am trying some moves I read about 
                        in my roommate’s Cosmopolitan 
                        magazine that’s been in my bathroom 
                        since 2012.  So... maybe they’re 
                        sort of out of style?

                                 DAVID
                        I’m not sure fingernails has ever 
                        been in style.

                                 KENNEDY
                             (from under the covers)
                        Okay, let me try something else...

           David begins to relax again.  He seems to be enjoying himself 
           for a moment, then:

                                 KENNEDY (CONT'D)
                             (from under the covers)
                        A... B... C... D...

                                 DAVID
                        What the hell are you doing now?
                                 KENNEDY
                             (from under the covers)
                        I heard you were supposed to spell 
                        the alphabet with your tongue to 
                        give a good blowjob!

                                 DAVID
                        You’re not supposed to say it out 
                        loud!  It feels like I’m getting 
                        head from someone who’s learning to 
                        read!

           Kennedy crawls out from under the covers.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        Let’s try something else.  Yeah, 
                        why don’t you talk dirty to me.

           He smiles and Kennedy lays next to him.  She’s still looking 
           damn good.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Okay, yeah!  Talk dirty!
                             (sexy voice)
                        I want to kiss...

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah...

                                 KENNEDY
                        Your big...

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah...

                                 KENNEDY
                        Floppy wiener...

           David gives her a dirty look.

                                 DAVID
                        Hey, Kennedy, I’m not sure this is 
                        working.

           Kennedy is panicking.

                                 KENNEDY
                             (whispering to herself)
                        Smorgasbord!  Smorgasbord!

                                 DAVID
                        Nope, still not dirty talk--

           All of a sudden, LAMASHTU IS BACK.
                                 LAMASHTU
                             (to herself)
                        Okay, Kennedy, you can tell me to 
                        stop at any time but just sit back 
                        and relax.  I’m gonna do you right.

           Kennedy gives the thumbs up.  Lamashtu starts climbing on 
           David.

                                 LAMASHTU (CONT'D)
                             (to David)
                        And I’m gonna do you right.  You 
                        want dirty talk?  I'm gonna rip 
                        your big fat cock through your 
                        stomach up through your mouth til 
                        you choke on it.

           David’s eyes go wide.  Lamashtu starts GRINDING on top of 
           David as they start furiously making out.

                                 DAVID
                        More.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        If you even try to look at my pussy 
                        I’m going to use your own pre-cum 
                        to blind you.

                                 DAVID
                        Oh yes you are.

           They start kissing again, then Lamashtu climbs under the 
           covers to give him a blowjob.  David is clearly in ecstasy.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        Oh my god.  Oh my god.  What 
                        happened?!  This is the best 
                        fucking thing that’s ever happened 
                        to me.

                                 LAMASHTU
                             (from under the covers)
                        Shut the fuck up, you piece of 
                        piping hot pigeon shit.

           His face is contorted in pleasure.

                                 DAVID
                        You’re using so much teeth, but 
                        it’s somehow amazing?!
                                 LAMASHTU
                             (from under the covers)
                        You better be glad I just sharpened 
                        them, it will hurt less when I bite 
                        clean through--

                                 KENNEDY
                             (from under the covers)
                        Stop it, Mash, no dismemberment--

                                 LAMASHTU
                             (from under the covers)
                        I was just kidding, jeez.  I’m not 
                        crazy!

           David looks confused for a moment and then has a HUGE ORGASM.  
           Lamashtu climbs out from under the covers.

                                 DAVID
                        Ken, that was literally the best 
                        thing I’ve ever felt in my entire 
                        life.  How the fuck did you do 
                        that?

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Oh, it’s nothing.  I sucked a lot 
                        of cocks in hell, that’s sorta a 
                        thing down there.

           David is out of breath.

                                 LAMASHTU (CONT'D)
                        You ready for more?

                                 DAVID
                        God yes.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        God has nothing to do with this.

           She climbs on top of him again.  She pins his hands back and 
           they start having wild sex.

           INT. DAVID’S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           Kennedy and David are lying in bed, asleep after their 
           passionate night.  Kennedy slowly begins to open her eyes.  
           She grins a huge grin -- she can’t believe how amazing last 
           night was!

           She rolls over and looks at David, who’s fast asleep with his 
           shirt off.  
           He has tons of visible BRUISES and SCRATCHES and a 666 
           MARKING that appears to have been burnt into his shoulder 
           blade.  Kennedy reaches out to touch the 666, which causes 
           David to stir.

                                 DAVID
                             (waking up)
                        Hey, babe.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Good morning.  How’d you sleep?

                                 DAVID
                        Jesus, I don’t think I’ve slept 
                        that well in my entire life.  After 
                        what we did, I’m surprised I ever 
                        woke up again.

           He reaches out to touch her cheek.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        I’ve never been with anyone like 
                        you.  You’re an animal.

           Kennedy nervously smiles.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Yeah, I’m something, aren’t I!

                                 DAVID
                        I have to see you again.  
                        Immediately.  What are you doing 
                        tonight?

                                 KENNEDY
                        I’m...
                             (tentatively)
                        ...playing pogo stick on your big 
                        fat cock?

           David’s face lights up.

                                 DAVID
                        You’re damn straight you are.

           He slaps her on the ass.  Kennedy smiles.

           INT. KENNEDY’S ROOM - LATER

           Kennedy, still dressed in her dress from the night before, 
           excitedly throws her stuff down on her bed.  She collapses 
           back on the bed, all smiles.
                                 KENNEDY
                        Oh my god!  This is what it’s like 
                        to put your stuff down...when 
                        you’re not a virgin!  This is what 
                        it’s like to lie on your bed...when 
                        you’re not a virgin!  It feels a 
                        lot like lying on your bed when 
                        you’re a virgin except for one big 
                        difference: you’re not a virgin!!

                                 LAMASHTU
                             (happy)
                        Hey, it was fun for me, too!  I 
                        forgot you could use a vagina for 
                        something other than crucifix 
                        storage!

                                 KENNEDY
                        Look, Mash, I will never be able to 
                        repay you.  As a reward, you can 
                        use my body for anything.  Go 
                        crazy.  Kill a cat.  Anything.  
                        Kill like a ton of cats!  So many 
                        cats!  Boom, dead!

                                 LAMASHTU
                        It was really no problem.  This is 
                        way more fun than sitting in a 
                        boring meat-car.  Just do me a 
                        favor someday when I need it.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Anytime, babe.  High-five!

           She holds up her left hand and Lamashtu HITS IT with their 
           right hand.

           INT. CRTR OFFICES - MORNING - MONTAGE

           In a MONTAGE, we see Kennedy/Lamashtu truly excelling at 
           work.  She is RISING THROUGH THE RANKS of CRTR.

           -- A group of developers presents Kennedy with the first 
           prototype for the TSR app.

                                 DEVELOPER
                        Here you go, Kennedy.  This is the 
                        first prototype of TSR.

           Kennedy turns into Lamashtu.
                                 LAMASHTU
                             (irate)
                        You call this a mother-fucking 
                        interface?!  This looks like it was 
                        designed by an alcoholic shrimp!  
                        Fix the color scheme and then go 
                        kill yourself!

                                 DEVELOPER
                             (terrified)
                        Yes, boss.

           Her boss at the Dream Team looks impressed.  Kennedy/Lamashtu 
           is pleased with herself.  She does her SECRET HIGH-FIVE 
           (Kennedy holds up her left hand and Lamashtu hits it with her 
           right.)

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BAR - MONTAGE

           -- Kennedy and David go on ANOTHER DATE at a cocktail bar.

                                 DAVID
                             (mid-story)
                        --And that’s how I ended up with 
                        two Range Rovers even though my dad 
                        said I really only deserved one--

           Kennedy is visibly bored.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Yeah, sure, cool, let’s go back to 
                        your place.

           -- Lamashtu and David are having WILD SEX.  Lamashtu is on 
           top of David, her whole body rotating around, insanely fast.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Yes!  Yes!  Yes!

           -- The same group of developers from before timidly approach 
           Kennedy and show her the new design of the app.

                        No!  No!  No!  You fixed the color 
                        but the scaling isn’t working!  If 
                        I could make a time machine, I 
                        wouldn’t use it to kill Hitler, I 
                        would use it to go back in time and 
                        convince all of your syphilitic 
                        mothers to get abortions!!

           The developers look like they’re going to cry.  

           We see Agnes through the window sadly watch Kennedy from 
           outside the office.

           -- Lamashtu and David are having WILD SEX in another insane 
           Kama Sutra position.

                             (whispering)
                        I want a turn!

                             (whispering)
                        Hold on, let a girl come and then 
                        you can go!

           They seem to struggle for a second, but Lamashtu wins and 
           keeps having sex.

                                                                CUT TO:

                        don’t want to be here!!  Ugh I can 
                        taste it!!

                        I can’t quite place it...

           INT. AGNES’ HOUSE - NIGHT

           It’s Agnes’ birthday party.  Agnes is dressed like the 
           HAMBURGLAR.  Her house has been transformed into a 
           McDonald’s, complete with a kiddie pool filled with balls 
           like a ball pit.  She sadly sips her drink.

           Her doorbell rings -- Agnes excitedly answers the door.  Her 
           BORING FRIEND (40s, boring) is at the door, also dressed like 
           a Hamburglar.

                                 BORING FRIEND
                        Hi Agnes.  Thank you for having me.

                                 AGNES
                             (disappointed)
                        Thanks for coming, Janice.

                                 BORING FRIEND
                             (very slowly)
                        I hope you’re not upset with my 
                        costume.  I didn’t have the exact 
                        same mask as the Hamburglar so I 
                        had to take one out of a Batman 
                        costume.  I hope that’s okay.  To 
                        make up for having to use an off-
                        brand mask I had my tie bespoke 
                        tailored in Cambridge.  They said 
                        they had never made a hamburger tie 
                        before.  But I thought they did a 
                        good job, considering they’d never 
                        made one before.

                                 AGNES
                        Oh, of course, that’s not why I’m 
                        upset.  You look amazing.  I just 
                        thought you might be my other 
                        friend.  But I guess she’s busy 
                        tonight...

           Agnes looks super sad.
                                 BORING FRIEND
                             (very slowly)
                        Well, if it makes you any happier 
                        to see me, I made a themed sangria 
                        to bring to this party.  I steeped 
                        raw hamburger meat in red wine for 
                        a full day, and then boiled it to 
                        kill off any possible salmonella.  
                        It’s a really interesting flavor.  
                        The guy at the wine store said he’d 
                        never thought to do that before, 
                        but he’d give it a try--

                                 AGNES
                             (snapping)
                        Just get inside, Janice.

           Janice and Agnes walk back in to the party.  Agnes pours 
           herself a very stiff drink from the bar and sits down on her 
           couch, clearly devastated.  She looks around her home -- a 
           smattering of people dresses as Hamburglars, a disco ball 
           sadly turning, but no Kennedy.

                             (to herself, a little 
                              drunk)
                        Oh, Ken.  Guess I’m just not enough 
                        of a b-word for you now.  Now that 
                        you’re, like, the ultimate b-word.  
                        Some might even say...

           She looks around.

                                 AGNES (CONT'D)
                             (to herself, a little 
                              drunk)
                        A c-word.

           She drinks another gulp.

                                 AGNES (CONT'D)
                             (to herself, a little 
                              drunk)
                        What is going on with you, Ken?

           She thinks for a moment, then pulls out her phone.  We see 
           her Google “sudden mood change + b word + c word”.

           She reads a few hits (that we don’t see), and then her eyes 
           grow wide as she finds something interesting...
           INT. KENNEDY’S ROOM - LATER

           Kennedy/Lamashtu is speaking to each other in her bedroom 
           mirror.

                                 KENNEDY
                             (excited)
                        Mash, did you read our email?

                                 LAMASHTU
                        No, what?

                                 KENNEDY
                        TSR hit one million downloads!  And 
                        apparently it’s helped nearly a 
                        thousand women protect themselves 
                        from dangerous dating experiences!

                                 LAMASHTU
                        You know, I’m usually more into, 
                        like, sinking my fangs into a 
                        pregnant lady to give her a heart 
                        attack as she goes into labor, but 
                        there’s something sort of 
                        satisfying about helping women, 
                        too.  I guess.  Actually, I’m going 
                        to try to think of it less as 
                        helping women and more as hurting 
                        men.  That makes me like it more.

           They do their high-five.  Kennedy looks so proud of herself.

                                 LAMASHTU (CONT'D)
                        It’s interesting.  I never 
                        considered that women were seen 
                        differently from men.  Where I’m 
                        from, female demons are just as 
                        powerful as male ones.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Welcome to America, baby.  I’ve 
                        always said, we’re worse than hell.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        All I’ve ever wanted was to prove I 
                        was better than my brother Pazuzu.  
                        He’s hated me for as long as I can 
                        remember and is always looking for 
                        a reason to turn the other demons 
                        on me.  But I never realized that 
                        was sexist.  This has given me a 
                        lot to think about.

           An EXTREMELY LOUD, WET COUGH outside Kennedy’s door.
                                 MARTA
                             (outside the door)
                        You got some mail.  I don’t know 
                        who got mac ‘n’ cheese on the 
                        envelope, it wasn’t me.  Probably 
                        like a racist Uber driver or 
                        something.

           A letter slides under the door.  Kennedy picks it up and 
           opens it with a knife on her bedside table.

                                 KENNEDY
                             (reading)
                        “Dear Ms. Howdy, we would like to 
                        cordially invite you to be a 
                        keynote speaker at the 2019 
                        National Women In Business 
                        conference.  Your app and

           She stops reading, mouth agape.  She clutches the letter to 
           her chest.

                                 KENNEDY (CONT'D)
                        Oh my god, Mash!  The Women In 
                        Business conference!  This is a 
                        dream come true!

                                 LAMASHTU
                        That’s your dream?  I feel like you 
                        should get a better dream...

                                 KENNEDY
                        No, you don’t get it!  It’s a week-
                        long conference in a reasonably 
                        priced, central area like Tucson 
                        where cis- and trans-women from all 
                        backgrounds and walks of life 
                        gather to inform each other on 
                        business strategies and 
                        intersectionality!  It’s a huge 
                        honor and it’s the next step 
                        towards my ultimate dream of 
                        starting my own business!

                                 LAMASHTU
                             (sarcastic)
                        Ohhhhhhh, now I get why this is 
                        literally your only dream!

                                 KENNEDY
                        Shut up, we’re going!  Let’s 
                        celebrate!
           Kennedy giddily throws the invitation in the air.  She’s 
           happier than we’ve ever seen her.

           Kennedy/Lamashtu is back at Chili’s, sitting at a table.  
           Kennedy is dressed up like it’s a fancy restaurant and is 
           wearing an EYE PATCH.  She sets up a stand-up mirror on the 
           seat across from her.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Okay... Now you can look!

           Lamashtu takes off the eye patch and her face lights up.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Yes!  Chili’s!  My favorite!

                                 KENNEDY
                        I just wanted to thank you for 
                        everything you’ve done.  You’ve 
                        completely changed my life.  I 
                        wasn’t lying when I made that video 
                        -- without my inner demon, I’d be 
                        nothing.

           Kennedy flags down a waitress.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Hey, there!  What can I get ya?

                                 KENNEDY
                        I’ll have a Long Island iced tea 
                        and...
                             (looking in the mirror)
                        ...a Bloody Mary, for the lady.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Um, okay.

           The waitress gives Kennedy a curious look, then shrugs and 
           walks off.

                                 KENNEDY
                             (to the mirror)
                        You’re why I’m going to the Women 
                        In Business conference.  You’re why 
                        I could make TSR.  You’re why I 
                        still smell like David’s--
                             (whispering)
                        --wiener--
                             (normal volume)

                        --even though I’ve taken two 
                        showers today.

           She holds out her left hand, and Lamashtu holds it with her 
           right.

                                 KENNEDY (CONT'D)
                        You’re the best friend I’ve ever 
                        had.  Not to be, like, corny or 
                        anything.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Can I admit something?

                                 KENNEDY
                        Yeah, anything.

           Lamashtu gets super serious.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        I know we made a deal that, if I 
                        helped you, you’d exorcise me, 
                        but... I don’t want to leave.

                                 KENNEDY
                        What?!  Really?

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Yeah, really.  I mean, first of 
                        all, it would be a whole “thing” 
                        with Pazuzu.  I’m sure he would use 
                        the fact that I became friends with 
                        you against me.  He’d most 
                        definitely have me killed.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Jeez, that’s complicated.  Are 
                        there family counselors down there?  
                        I mean, I bet, seems like a lot of 
                        therapists probably go to hell.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        But there’s other reasons.  I mean, 
                        I love Chili’s.  I love David’s 
                        deep-dickin’.

           She sips her drink.

                                 LAMASHTU (CONT'D)
                        And I get to go on so many 
                        adventures with you.  I get to 
                        dress up with you, and learn how to 
                        code with you.

                        I’m even starting to think I might 
                        want a pet, one that I don’t drink 
                        the blood out of/one that I keep 
                        the blood inside of.  I’ve never 
                        had anyone believe in me before.  I 
                        mean, other than the ancient 
                        Mesopotamians who, like, believed 
                        in me, but it was a different 
                        thing.  My brother was always the 
                        Big Demon on Campus, and I could 
                        never live up to him.  This is the 
                        first time I’ve felt like a star in 
                        my own right.

           They share a moment, then:

                                 LAMASHTU (CONT'D)
                        So yeah, you’re my fucking best 
                        friend, too.  Don’t get your pussy 
                        twisted over it.

           They clink glasses.  Two best friends.  In the mirror, we see 
           Lamashtu’s true form for a moment.  Her disgusting face winks 
           and smiles.  Back to Kennedy.

           INT. CRTR OFFICES - THE NEXT DAY

           Kennedy/Lamashtu is at their Dream Team desk, working on 
           CRTR.  Agnes sneaks up and corners her at her desk.

                                 KENNEDY
                             (startled)
                        Oh my god, you scared me!

                                 AGNES
                             (indignant)
                        Well, you didn’t scare me, when you 
                        didn’t come to my party last night.

           Kennedy’s face falls.  She totally forgot.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Oh no, Ag, I am so sorry I forgot.  
                        It just really slipped my mind.  
                        I’ve been so busy with work, and 
                        TSR, and David, and the Women In 
                        Business conference--

                                 AGNES
                        Oh, yeah, congrats on that, by the 
                        way.  I know that was always a 
                        dream of yours.

                        I just hope you don’t have some 
                        sort of demonic freak-out on stage 
                        and scare all the ladies.

                                 KENNEDY
                        ...what do you mean?

                                 AGNES
                        I think you know what I mean.

                                 KENNEDY
                             (defensives)
                        No, I don’t.  Just say what you 
                        mean.

                                 AGNES
                             (angry)
                        Okay.  I’ll say what I mean.  I was 
                        worried about you, so I Googled 
                        your symptoms.  Mood change, 
                        becoming a real b-word, etcetera.  
                        And then I didn’t find anything, so 
                        I started taking a “What Disney 
                        princess is your best friend?” quiz 
                        on Buzzfeed.  So I put in your 
                        name, because you’re my best 
                        friend, believe it or not.  But 
                        then one of the questions was “what 
                        city did your best friend live in 
                        as a kid?”  So I Googled “Kennedy 
                        Howdy + Elementary school” and I 
                        found an article about how you were 
                        demonically possessed.

                                 KENNEDY
                        What are you talking about.

                                 AGNES
                        Yeah.  It said you were 
                        “possessed,” and that your mom was 
                        blackballed from acting and you 
                        drove her insane.

                                 KENNEDY
                             (to herself)
                        She always said she quit acting 
                        because it got boring...

           Kennedy stares at Agnes, fuming.  Not Lamashtu -- this is all 
           her.
                                 AGNES
                        I don’t know if you’re psychotic, 
                        or you have anger problems, but you 
                        need help.  Or maybe you just had a 
                        friend you wanted to dump when you 
                        were ten, and it seemed like a good 
                        excuse.

           Kennedy FLIPS OUT.  This is the first time we’ve seen Kennedy 
           scream at someone, not Lamashtu.

                                 KENNEDY
                             (screaming)
                        You’re being jealous!  You’ve 
                        always wanted me to fail, and 
                        you’re grasping at straws to find 
                        reasons to ruin my life.  Demonic 
                        possession?!  What a crazy thing to 
                        say!  You’re crazy!  You’ve always 
                        been jealous and you’ve always 
                        wanted to beat me.  Way to be a 
                        white feminist, Agnes.

           Everyone in the CRTR office has stopped what they’re doing 
           and is listening in awe to the fight.

                                 AGNES
                             (small)
                        You know that’s not true.  I’ve 
                        never been jealous of you.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Oh, it isn’t?  Maybe not of my job, 
                        but you always had a crush on my 
                        boyfriend David, didn’t you.

                                 AGNES
                             (quiet)
                        Kennedy, stop.

                                 KENNEDY
                        You, Agnes, are just jealous, 
                        because you always wanted to fuck 
                        David.

           Agnes is now crying.  An intense silence falls over the 
           ENTIRE OFFICE.  Then, Agnes breaks the silence by gathering 
           all her stuff up into her bag.

                                 AGNES
                        Well, there you go, Kennedy.  I 
                        quit.  You hear that everyone?  I 
                        quit.  You win, Ken.  There you go.

                        You’re the only girl here now.

           In tears, Agnes runs out of the office.  The stunned Critters 
           finally go back to their work.  Kennedy looks like a truck 
           has run her over.

           EXT. CRTR OFFICES - MOMENTS LATER

           Kennedy immediately feels horrible and tries to run after 
           Agnes.  She bursts through the front doors of CRTR, but Agnes 
           is already gone.  Outside, Kennedy bursts into tears and 
           confronts Lamashtu.

                                 KENNEDY
                             (hysterical)
                        How dare you?!  I can’t believe you 
                        did that.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Nope.  That was all you, baby.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Agnes is a good person.  And you 
                        ruined her life.  I know deep down 
                        that that was you, not me.

           Kennedy puts her head in her hands.

                                 KENNEDY (CONT'D)
                        Look, I didn’t want to ruin the 
                        good things I had going, but now I 
                        see that my life is completely out 
                        of control with you, Mash.

                                 LAMASHTU
                             (scared)
                        I told you, I can’t go back.  My 
                        brother--

                                 KENNEDY
                        I don’t.  Care.  What happens to 
                        you.  I need you out of me.

           Kennedy has a crazed look in her eyes.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. CHURCH - MOMENTS LATER

           Kennedy has headed straight to a church.  She bursts through 
           the doors.  
           She looks almost like she’s had A STROKE -- her right side is 
           furiously walking into the church, and her LEFT SIDE is 
           dragging behind her.

           Kennedy and Lamashtu are arguing with each other.  They look 
           INSANE.

                         LAMASHTU
           Stop it!--  Don’t do this!--
                                                         KENNEDY
                                              You-- Can’t-- Tell me-- What-- 
                                              To-- Do!--

           Kennedy walks up to the front of the church (is this called 
           an apse??  I truly do not know and couldn’t possibly spare 
           the time to Google!) where a PRIEST is giving communion.

           Kennedy cuts everyone in line and marches up to the priest.

                                 PRIEST
                        Um, hello, my daughter--

                                 KENNEDY
                        Shut up.

           She steals the jug of HOLY WATER and pulls a shot glass out 
           of her pocket.  She pours the holy water into the shot glass 
           and starts shooting SHOT AFTER SHOT of it.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Stop it!  That burns!!

                                 KENNEDY
                        Then it’s working!!

           Off the priest’s horrified face, we cut to:

           EXT. DOWNTOWN BOSTON STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Kennedy has tied up her own hands and gagged herself.  She’s 
           slumped on a busy Boston street with a sign around her neck 
           that says “Please exorcise me, I’m possessed by Lamashtu!”

           People pass her and give her pitying or dirty looks.  Someone 
           throws a Dunkin Donuts gift card at her.

           A chipper woman unties Kennedy and takes the gag out of her 
           mouth.

                                 CHIPPER WOMAN
                             (chipper)
                        There you go!  Women helping women!  
                        Hashtag-me-too!

           She walks off.  Kennedy is annoyed.
           EXT. BOSTON BROWNSTONE - LATER

           Kennedy, still walking with a limp as Lamashtu drags one of 
           her legs behind her, approaches an old, beautiful Boston 
           brownstone.  She’s tied her hands up again behind her back.  
           She knocks on the door, and waits.

           The door opens, and who is the one opening it but...

           ...FATHER ELIOT.  A much older, much more wrinkled face, but 
           clearly the same man that Karen first brought to exorcize 
           Kennedy when she was a little girl.

                                 FATHER ELIOT
                        Can I help you?

                                 KENNEDY
                        Do you recognize me?

                                 FATHER ELIOT
                        I don’t think so?

           Kennedy starts WRESTLING WITH LAMASHTU, and THROWS UP on 
           herself in the process.

                                 KENNEDY
                        ...Well, do you recognize that?

           Recognition dawns on Father Eliot’s face.  He remembers.

                                 FATHER ELIOT
                             (hushed)
                        How did you find me?

                                 KENNEDY
                        My mom told me about you.  And then 
                        I looked at this--

           She uses her mouth to hold up the SIGIL OF LAMASHTU that 
           Father Eliot dropped all those years ago.

                                 KENNEDY (CONT'D)
                        --and on the back was your address.

           Close on the sigil.  We see that Father Eliot had written: 
           “If lost, return to Father Eliot, 23 Marlborough Street, 
           Boston.  Do not bend (could release apocalypse).”

                                 FATHER ELIOT
                             (sadly)
                        Well.  Thanks for returning it, in 
                        any case.  Please come in.
           Kennedy, foot dragging behind her, follows Father Eliot into 
           his home.

           INT. FATHER ELIOT’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Kennedy sits across from Father Eliot in his living room.

                                 FATHER ELIOT
                             (sincere)
                        There hasn’t been one day since I 
                        ran out of your bedroom twenty 
                        years ago that I haven’t thought 
                        about what I did.  I have regretted 
                        my cowardice with all of my heart, 
                        and it’s kept me up at night.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Well, luckily for you, you have a 
                        chance to redeem yourself!

                                 FATHER ELIOT
                        Oh, I don’t feel that bad...
                             (nervous)
                        Is your demon still scary?

                                 KENNEDY
                        Jesus Christ, Father.  Pull 
                        yourself together.  You are the 
                        only one who can help me.  And now 
                        there’s Yelp, and you don’t want me 
                        to give you a bad review.  Priests 
                        probably don’t want anything less 
                        than five stars in a post-Spotlight 
                        world.

                                 FATHER ELIOT
                        Yep, you’re right.  My bad.
                             (clapping his hands)
                        Okay, let’s look into this.

           He grabs a book off his shelf and blows dust off it.  It 
           looks ancient and vaguely spooky, a little like the 
           Necronomicon from The Evil Dead.

                                 FATHER ELIOT (CONT'D)
                             (looking it up)
                        Lamashtu...  Lamashtu...  Ah, yes, 
                        here, Lamashtu!

           He reads from the book with gravitas.
                                 FATHER ELIOT (CONT'D)
                             (reading)
                        “Lamashtu is a female demon who 
                        menaces women during childbirth 
                        and, if possible, kidnaps their 
                        children while they are 
                        breastfeeding.  She gnaws on their 
                        bones and sucks their blood.  She 
                        is often shown standing or kneeling 
                        on a donkey, nursing a pig and a 
                        dog, and holding snakes.”
                             (to Kennedy)
                        That sound right?

                                 KENNEDY
                        Yep.  Sounds about right.

                                 FATHER ELIOT
                        Okay...
                             (continues reading)
                        This says that we’re going to need 
                        to do a full, classical exorcism 
                        for a female demon.  Since Lamashtu 
                        is a female demon, it’s a little 
                        different than with a male demon.  
                        A female demon can usually only be 
                        exorcised with female energy.  Male 
                        demons can be tossed out with any 
                        type of energy, like being shocked 
                        by a car battery, guy-stuff like 
                        that.  Do you have any female 
                        family members or friends we can 
                        recruit for the exorcism?

           Kennedy looks like a knife has been plunged into her heart.

                                 KENNEDY
                             (curtly)
                        No.

                                 FATHER ELIOT
                        Well, I’ll do my best, but things 
                        might get kinda messy with the 
                        portal to hell if I don’t do it by 
                        the book.
                             (beat)
                        You really don’t have any girl 
                        friends?

                                 KENNEDY
                             (snapping)
                        You don’t want to get into it, 
                        Father.
                                 FATHER ELIOT
                             (small)
                        I’ll go get the tarp.

           INT. FATHER ELIOT’S HOME - DINING ROOM - LATER

           Father Eliot has cleared all of the furniture out of his 
           living room, turning it into a big dark wood exorcism room.  
           He’s laid a tarp down on the floor to catch whatever comes 
           out of Kennedy.  Candles are lit around the room.  There’s a 
           BABY GOAT tied to a coat rack in the corner.

           There’s a big arm chair in the middle of the room.  Father 
           Eliot gestures for Kennedy to sit down and he ties her hands 
           to the chair.

                                 FATHER ELIOT
                        Are you ready?

                                 KENNEDY
                        I’ve been ready since I was ten 
                        years old.

                                 FATHER ELIOT
                        Alright.  Let’s begin.

           He holds a LARGE CRUCIFIX above Kennedy and starts reciting 
           the Lord’s Prayer.

                                 FATHER ELIOT (CONT'D)
                        Our Father, Who art in Heaven, 
                        hallowed be Thy name; Thy Kingdom 
                        come, Thy will be done on earth as 
                        it is in Heaven. 

                                 KENNEDY
                        Oh yeah, she doesn’t like that, 
                        keep going.  I feel like I have the 
                        really bad gas I get after eating 
                        Taco Bell.

                                 FATHER ELIOT
                             (reciting in Latin)
                        Ave Maria, gratia plena; Dominus 
                        tecum: benedicta tu in mulieribus, 
                        et benedictus fructus ventris tui 
                        Iesus--

           Kennedy’s eyes turn black and she begins SCREAMING AN UNGODLY 
           SCREAM.  After she finishes screaming, she yells:

                                 KENNEDY
                        Keep going!
           Father Eliot starts sprinkling her with Holy Water as he 
           continues the Hail Mary:

                                 FATHER ELIOT
                             (Latin)
                        --Sancta Maria, Mater Dei, ora pro 
                        nobis peccatoribus, nunc, et in 
                        hora mortis nostrae!  Amen!

           The chair that Kennedy’s strapped to LIFTS UP IN THE AIR and 
           starts FLOATING.  Kennedy’s eyes turn black and Lamashtu 
           comes forward.

                                 LAMASHTU
                             (screaming)
                        Kennedy, stop!  You’re hurting me!

                                 KENNEDY
                             (screaming)
                        You think I care?!  You ruined my 
                        life!  I had everything and then 
                        you came along and you ruined my 
                        whole life!

                                 LAMASHTU
                        “Ruined your life”?!  If it weren’t 
                        for me, you’d still be a fucking 
                        virgin!

                                 KENNEDY
                        Well, maybe if you hadn’t possessed 
                        me when I was ten I wouldn’t have 
                        needed you to lose my virginity for 
                        me!  Of course you’ve always been 
                        second fiddle to your brother, your 
                        mom probably wished you were never 
                        born!

           Lamashtu’s feelings are very hurt.  She decides to use her 
           finishing blow.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        I got something to tell you.  Your 
                        mother doesn’t suck cocks in hell.  
                        She doesn’t suck cocks anywhere.  
                        Because she’s just dead, and gone, 
                        and you’re never going to see her 
                        again.

           Kennedy begins screaming at a pitch we’ve never heard up 
           until this point.  She starts VOMITING BLACK TAR and vomits 
           up far more than she should be physically able to.  Father 
           Eliot releases the GOAT and pushes it into the black tar.
           Finally, she’s gotten it all up, and the chair sinks down to 
           the floor.  The goat SCREAMS and runs out the front door into 
           the street.

           It is palpable: the exorcism was successful.  LAMASHTU -- IN 
           THE BODY OF THE GOAT -- IS GONE.  Kennedy and Father Eliot 
           are both spent.

                                 FATHER ELIOT
                        Is she...

                                 KENNEDY
                        She’s gone.

                                 FATHER ELIOT
                        You’re sure?

                                 KENNEDY
                        Trust me.  She’s gone.

           Kennedy stands up.  She hands the Sigil of Lamashtu back to 
           Father Eliot, who solemnly nods to her.  She walks out the 
           door.

           INT. KENNEDY’S ROOM - THAT NIGHT

           Kennedy is sitting by her vanity, staring into the mirror.  
           She’s clearly been crying.

           A KNOCK on her door.  She opens it -- it’s David.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Thanks for coming over.  I’ve had a 
                        really awful day.

                                 DAVID
                        No prob, babe.  I felt really bad 
                        about everything that happened 
                        between you and that girl you were 
                        friends with, I wanted to check on 
                        you.
                             (beat, then)
                        Also, all that stuff you were 
                        saying in front of everyone made me 
                        kind of horny?  You wanna... bone 
                        down?

           Kennedy is initially a little taken aback at David’s 
           inability to read the situation, but she’s intrigued.

                                 KENNEDY
                        I mean, I’m always in the mood... 
                        When it’s with you... 
           She tries to smile, but something is clearly wrong.  David 
           doesn’t pick up on it, though.  He whips off his shirt and 
           starts making out with Kennedy.  After a moment:

                                 DAVID
                        Are you okay?  You seem kinda out 
                        of it.

                                 KENNEDY
                        No, no, I promise I’m super horny.

           They lay back on Kennedy’s bed.  Kennedy flops on top of 
           David and tries to look sexy, but it’s just not working.

                                 DAVID
                        What happened to you, Ken?  You’re 
                        usually so disinhibited.  You 
                        sittin’ in a blood pud?  Renting 
                        from Red Box?

                                 KENNEDY
                        No, I don’t have my period.  I’m 
                        just in a really bad mood.  I don’t 
                        feel like myself.

           She starts CRYING.

                                 KENNEDY (CONT'D)
                        I’m really sorry.  You should 
                        probably just leave.

                                 DAVID
                        Wow.  Women.  It’s like, what do 
                        they want?

                                 KENNEDY
                        I want you to leave.  I just said 
                        that, very clearly.

           David exits quickly, leaving his jacket on Kennedy’s bed.

           INT. KENNEDY’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           As a sad song plays, Kennedy continues crying on her bed.  
           It’s the dark night of her damn soul.

           EXT. BOSTON STREET - SIMULTANEOUS

           We see David on his walk home from Kennedy’s apartment.  He 
           whistles to himself.  He turns a corner into an alley...
           Waiting for him is PAZUZU in his true demonic form.  He is a 
           mixture between a gargoyle and a huge dog, crouched by a 
           dumpster.  David sees him in the corner and SCREAMS.

                                 DAVID
                        Who the fuck are you?!

                                 PAZUZU
                             (scary)
                        I am Pazuzu, demon of the southwest 
                        wind.  I am known for bringing 
                        famine during dry seasons, and 
                        locusts during rainy seasons.  I am 
                        Lord of all fevers and plagues, 
                        grinning Dark Angel of the Four 
                        Wings, horned, with rotting 
                        genitalia--

                                 DAVID
                        --Okay, cool, what are you doing in 
                        Boston?

                                 PAZUZU
                             (furious)
                        Don’t interrupt me or I have to 
                        start the whole speech from the 
                        beginning!

                                 DAVID
                        Just keep going from where you left 
                        off, I don’t need to hear the whole 
                        thing again.

                                 PAZUZU
                        Where was I?

                                 DAVID
                        Rotting genitalia.

           Pazuzu takes a deep breath and restarts his speech.

                                 PAZUZU
                        I have wanted to kill my horrible 
                        sister, Lamashtu, for forty 
                        thousand trillion years.  Her gross 
                        displays of power have always made 
                        me look weak in comparison, and it 
                        embarrasses me in front of our 
                        family.  I hate her more than 
                        anything in the universe has hated 
                        anything.

                                 DAVID
                        Hmm, sounds like someone’s jealous!
                                 PAZUZU
                        Fuck you, I’m a demon!  Why would 
                        you say that?
                             (continuing)
                        Look, it’s not my fault she’s more 
                        powerful than me.  She’s a female, 
                        so she can harness the power of the 
                        feminine.  Men just have it so much 
                        harder than women.  It’s really 
                        unfair.

           He holds up a fist to fist bump.  David looks at it with 
           disdain.  Pazuzu continues talking.

                                 PAZUZU (CONT'D)
                        I have been waiting for her to 
                        leave her host so I could kill her.  
                        She’ll be at her weakest then.  I 
                        have been waiting, waiting for 
                        years.  And finally, mere hours 
                        ago, she has been released into the 
                        world.  I traced her smell to the 
                        apartment that you just came from.

           He starts pacing.  David tries to run out of the alley, but 
           Pazuzu, barely looking at him, sends out a MAGIC SPELL and 
           binds his ankles.  He falls over.

                                 PAZUZU (CONT'D)
                             (continuing)
                        The second that priest used 
                        Lamashtu’s Sigil, I was able to 
                        track my bitch sister again.  What 
                        luck, huh!

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah!

                                 PAZUZU
                        Oh, I mean, for me.  Not for you.  
                        Because I’m about to possess you 
                        now.

                                 DAVID
                        What--

           Pazuzu cuts him off by putting his hand over his mouth and 
           PINNING HIM TO THE GROUND.  He waits ten seconds, then--

           David makes some faces of agony, and then his eyes turn 
           black.

           He falls to the pavement.
           Still for a moment.  Then he gets up.

           His EYES ARE BLACK.

           He has been possessed.  By PAZUZU.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                             (possessed voice)
                        I am so close.  All I need to do is 
                        find that fucking goat, and my 
                        sister is good as dead.  And I can 
                        get out of this disgusting bro 
                        body.

           He pokes at his bicep.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                             (possessed voice)
                        Ugh.  Even his teeth smell like Axe 
                        Body Spray.

           David is looking at himself in the reflective building.

                                 PAZUZU
                        Well.  As soon as I kill Lamashtu 
                        and get exorcized from this guy, I 
                        guess I can kill him, too.  No one 
                        will miss a tech idiot.  I’ll say 
                        he died in a Bird scooter accident, 
                        no one will notice.

           He PUNCHES himself in the face.

                                 PAZUZU (CONT'D)
                        Yeah, fuck this guy’s face.

           He starts walking away.

           Just then, KENNEDY POPS OUT FROM BEHIND THE BUILDING.  Reveal 
           that KENNEDY HEARD THE WHOLE THING.  She had grabbed David’s 
           jacket that he forgot and followed him out to give it to him, 
           but hid behind a trash can to listen when he started talking 
           to himself.

           She’s heard everything.  She knows Pazuzu is on Earth, here 
           to kill her best friend.  She needs to warn Lamashtu.

                                 KENNEDY
                             (under her breath)
                        Lamashtu...

           She runs off.
           INT. KENNEDY’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Kennedy paces in her apartment living room.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Where could she be?  Where would I 
                        go if I had nothing left to lose 
                        and wanted to be among the true 
                        dregs of human society?

           She thinks, then: LIGHT BULB.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. ALLEY BEHIND CHILI’S - SIMULTANEOUS

           Lamashtu in the BABY GOAT is eating out of the dumpster 
           outside of Chili’s.  She eats a GLASS BOTTLE OF ALCOHOL and 
           appears to be drunk.

           Kennedy comes running up.

                                 KENNEDY
                             (scared)
                        Mash, oh my god, I’m so glad I 
                        found you!  Look, it’s not safe out 
                        here, you need to come inside--

           She grabs Baby Goat Lamashtu by the scruff of the neck and 
           starts pulling her into the Chili’s.

                                 GOAT LAMASHTU
                        Get your hands off me, bitch!!

           INT. CHILI’S - CONTINUOUS

           Kennedy drags Goat Lamashtu into the bar area of the Chili’s.  
           Kennedy drops down to Goat Mash’s level so they can talk face 
           to face.

                                 GOAT LAMASHTU
                        Get off of me before I rip your 
                        septum out with my teeth!!

                                 KENNEDY
                             (stern)
                        No.  Listen, Mash, this is an 
                        emergency.  I overheard David 
                        talking to himself, and it turns 
                        out that he’s been possessed by 
                        Pazuzu.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 KENNEDY (CONT'D)
                                 KENNEDY (CONT'D)
                        He couldn’t kill you while you were 
                        in me, but now that you’re out, 
                        he’s going to kill you as soon as 
                        he can.  You need to get in me, 
                        where you’re safe.

                                 GOAT LAMASHTU
                        No.  You’re just a basic boring 
                        bitch without me.  You’re lying 
                        about Pazuzu so that I’ll give up 
                        my freedom and come back.  I’m 
                        doing just great as a goat.  I get 
                        to eat as much trash as I want, and 
                        I once I find another goat I’m 
                        gonna get to fuck a goat.

           She LUNGES at Kennedy and tries to bite her face.  Kennedy 
           swats her away, but Goat Lamashtu keeps biting.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Stop that!  I’m sorry I accused you 
                        of being mean to Agnes, but I’m 
                        telling the truth now!

           People start gathering to watch a woman scream at a goat that 
           she’s dragged into the Chili’s.  People start filming on 
           their phones and CHEERING.

                                 BYSTANDER
                        Why does this always happen at 
                        Chili’s?!

           Kennedy grabs Lamashtu by the ears and speaks intensely into 
           her face.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Lamashtu, slayer of children and 
                        drinker of the blood of men, 
                        disturber of sleep, bringer of 
                        nightmares.  Friend of dweebs, 
                        deflowerer of losers, eater of 
                        chili, sister of Kennedy.  You 
                        aren’t just my best friend.  You’re 
                        a part of me.  Lying to you would 
                        be like lying to myself, and I’d 
                        never do that.  Never again, that 
                        is, I lied to myself that denim 
                        goes well with denim.

           Goat Lamashtu’s face softens.  It looks like she’s coming 
           around.
                                 KENNEDY (CONT'D)
                        I love you with all my heart.  And 
                        I love my life with you.  And I 
                        can’t lose you.  I already lost one 
                        family member, and I can’t bear to 
                        lose another.

           Goat Lamashtu melts.  A tear falls from her eye.

                                 GOAT LAMASHTU
                        I love you, cunt.

                                 KENNEDY
                             (smiling)
                        Let’s go home.

           EXT. CHILI’S - CONTINUOUS

           Kennedy leads Goat Lamashtu out of the Chili’s.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Okay, just get back inside me!

                                 GOAT LAMASHTU
                        To transfer my demonic essence back 
                        into your spirit, you’re going to 
                        have to physically create a conduit 
                        between our two corporeal beings.
                             (beat, then)
                        You’re going to have to make out 
                        with me.

                                 KENNEDY
                             (horrified)
                        I have to make out with a goat?!

                                 GOAT LAMASHTU
                        Don’t think of it as making out 
                        with a goat.  Think of it as making 
                        out with a demon.

           After a little hesitation, Kennedy starts MAKING OUT WITH THE 
           GOAT!  She even gets a little INTO IT!

                                 KENNEDY
                             (through the kiss)
                        Ugh...  There’s so much glass in 
                        your mouth...

           Carly, the Chili’s bartender from much earlier, walks out to 
           take out the trash.  She sees Kennedy making out with a goat 
           and shakes her head.
                                 CARLY
                             (to herself)
                        Why didn’t I finish high school?

           She keeps on walking.  They finish the kiss and... LAMASHTU 
           IS BACK IN KENNEDY!  They speak back and forth from Kennedy’s 
           body just like they have for most of the movie.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Hey, that was a pretty good kiss.  
                        I taught you well.

                                 KENNEDY
                        It was nothing, pal.  I want to 
                        save you, so I had to.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Oh, you actually didn’t have to.

                                 KENNEDY
                        ...What?

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Yeah, you just needed to touch me 
                        for longer than ten seconds.  I 
                        just thought you needed to 
                        experiment a little in your sex 
                        life.  It’s 2019, for god’s sake!  
                        Kiss a goat!

           Kennedy fumes.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Whatever.  Let’s go.

           She looks irate.  She walks off, leaving the baby goat in the 
           dumpster.

           EXT. KENNEDY’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Kennedy is walking up the stairs to her apartment.

                                 KENNEDY
                             (to Lamashtu)
                        So we just need to triangulate 
                        Pazuzu’s location by tracking where 
                        David has been.  I can use my Dream 
                        Team clearance to access his 
                        location through his work email, 
                        maybe through a FitBit or 
                        something.  Once we know his 
                        location, we can sneak up on him, 
                        since we have the advantage.
           She gets to her front door and sees... that the handle has 
           been decimated and a HOLE has been blown straight through the 
           door.

           Beat.

                                 KENNEDY (CONT'D)
                        Orrrrr: he has the advantage.

           INT. KENNEDY’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           They push the broken door aside and enter Kennedy’s 
           apartment.  IT IS IN FULL “EXORCIST” MODE.  Books and papers 
           are flying around the room.  All the furniture is levitating.  
           Pazuzu in David’s body is ON THE CEILING, on his back, facing 
           Kennedy/Lamashtu at the door.

                                 PAZUZU
                        Wow!  I came back here capture 
                        Kennedy and use her as bait, but it 
                        looks like you’ve done all the work 
                        for me and brought Lamashtu back 
                        with you!  Thanks, Ken!

           He flies down to the floor and starts walking slowly towards 
           Kennedy/Lamashtu.

                                 PAZUZU (CONT'D)
                        You remember me, right, Kennedy?  
                        I’m the only person in the world 
                        who would have sex with you, and 
                        I’m so stupid I let myself get 
                        possessed by a demon as an adult.  
                        That must feel pretty bad, huh?

           Kennedy starts screaming at Pazuzu.

                                 KENNEDY
                        You asshole.  If you want to kill 
                        Lamashtu, you’ll have to kill me, 
                        too.

                                 PAZUZU
                        Uh... okay?

           Pazuzu/David raises his hand to kill Kennedy.  Just then...

           SHE PUTS HER HAND ON PAZUZU’S SHOULDER.

                                 PAZUZU (CONT'D)
                        What the fuck are you doing?

           Kennedy quietly whispers under her breath.
                                 KENNEDY
                        Six... Seven... Eight... Nine...

                                 PAZUZU
                        What--

           PAZUZU IS SUCKED INTO KENNEDY’S BODY!  SHE IS NOW POSSESSED 
           WITH LAMASHTU AND PAZUZU!  DAVID’S BODY DROPS TO THE FLOOR!

           We hear both Pazuzu and Lamashtu’s voice coming out of 
           Kennedy’s body, in addition to Kennedy’s own voice.  As the 
           demons speak out of her mouth, Kennedy’s body is WHIPPED 
           AROUND THE ROOM, as if by invisible magnets.  She hits the 
           walls every time the siblings argue.

                                 PAZUZU (CONT'D)
                        What did you do?!

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Hey, bro!!  This is just like when 
                        we used to share a room as kids!!

                                 PAZUZU
                        Uch, just die already.  You know 
                        I’m going to win.  Everyone from 
                        home thinks I’m stronger and better 
                        than you, they all told me that.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Then why am I in this cool bitch 
                        and you had to possess a guy who 
                        voted for Jill Stein?!

                                 KENNEDY
                        Ahhhhhhhh!

           Kennedy SCREAMS as she’s whipped back and forth as the demons 
           are clearly punching each other inside her soul.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. MARTA’S BEDROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

           As the demons are all fighting in the living room, Marta is 
           FAST ASLEEP with a huge CPAP machine over her face.  There 
           are faint thuds in the background as the fight continues.

                                 MARTA
                             (in her sleep)
                        Oh, Sonic...  You couldn’t possibly 
                        swallow me whole...  Or could 
                        you...
           She is sleeping through the whole thing.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. KENNEDY’S APARTMENT - SIMULTANEOUS

           Kennedy is SMASHED into the ceiling.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Stay strong, Ken!  He can’t kill 
                        you while he’s inside!  You can’t 
                        kill a possessed woman!

                                 KENNEDY
                             (tired)
                        Okay, good to know.

           Kennedy is pulled down to the floor and SMASHES into a lamp.  
           Kennedy looks pretty banged up.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Pazuzu, stop this!  You’re hurting 
                        her!  Even if you can’t kill her, 
                        her body will never recover!

                                 PAZUZU
                        If you want to protect your friend, 
                        it’s easy!  Just jump out of her 
                        right now, let me kill you, and 
                        I’ll leave Kennedy alone!

                                 KENNEDY
                             (barely conscious)
                        It’s okay, Mash, just keep going.

                                 PAZUZU
                        Lamashtu, you know that I am the 
                        rightful King of Hell.  You never 
                        stood a chance against me.  You 
                        can’t stop me, and you never will.

           One more big BANG as Kennedy is thrown to the corner of the 
           room.

           Kennedy’s eyes are closed.  Her body is fading.

                                 LAMASHTU
                             (panicking)
                        No, Kennedy, come back.  I can feel 
                        you breaking.  Get up, Ken.

           Kennedy says nothing.  She moans quietly in pain.
                                 LAMASHTU (CONT'D)
                        Please.  Remember: breathe in, 
                        breathe out, no anger, no fear, 
                        stay calm.

           Nothing.

                                 PAZUZU
                        She’s almost gone.  Past repair.  
                        Admit it.  You can feel it.  
                        There’s nothing for you to do now 
                        but let me kill you.  You couldn’t 
                        possibly live with the guilt.

           But then: Kennedy’s eyes flutter open.

           She looks up to the table next to the couch that she’s 
           slumped by.  There’s a KNIFE on it by her phone, the same 
           knife that Kennedy used to open the letter.  She looks from 
           the knife to herself -- is she going to kill herself?

           She grabs the knife.  Kennedy’s hand wraps around the knife 
           as she prepares to bring it towards herself.  But: LAMASHTU 
           USES MAGIC TO KEEP HER HAND WITH THE KNIFE AWAY FROM HER 
           BODY.  They struggle.

                                 KENNEDY
                             (struggling)
                        Mash, let me do this.  It’s the 
                        only way.  You two might not be 
                        able to kill a possessed woman, but 
                        I can.

                                 LAMASHTU
                             (quietly)
                        You’re not sacrificing yourself, 
                        bitch.  I am.

           All of a sudden, Lamashtu LETS GO of the magic keeping 
           Kennedy’s hand at bay.  Without the counterweight, Kennedy 
           accidentally throws the knife and it ZINGS BY HER OWN HEAD.

           With Pazuzu distracted, Lamashtu grabs THE CELL PHONE.  She 
           quickly opens the TSR APP, PUTS THE PHONE TO HER CHEST, 
           PRESSES THE BUTTON AND SHOCKS HERSELF!

           In a chaotic explosion, suddenly Kennedy is on the floor.  
           Everything is still.  It looks like Kennedy is dead, along 
           with the demons possessing her.

           A silence, which feels like it lasts forever.

           And then...
           Kennedy sits up.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Hello?  Anyone there?

           A long beat of silence.  Kennedy’s face falls -- clearly 
           they’ve beaten Pazuzu, but Lamashtu is gone as well.

           And then...

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Hey, bitch!!!

           Kennedy GASPS.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Are you the only one there?!

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Hell yes!  That fucking idiot has 
                        been demoted.  Out of the track of 
                        “being alive.”
                             (explaining)
                        He’s dead, we killed him.

           Kennedy CHEERS and tries to hug herself.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Father Eliot was right.  Male 
                        demons can be exorcized by any old 
                        stupid guy thing, like a car 
                        battery, or a little old app a 
                        stupid girl made.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        I was more powerful than my brother 
                        this whole time.  I just bought 
                        into that whole patriarchy bullshit 
                        about men being better.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Now you’re finally getting it.

           Kennedy crawls up to standing and dusts herself off.

           INT. KENNEDY’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           A few moments later, David COMES TO.  He’d been passed out on 
           the floor this whole time.

                                 DAVID
                             (confused)
                        What happened?
                                 KENNEDY
                             (sweetly)
                        Don’t worry about it.  The grown-
                        ups were talking.
                             (then)
                        I think I’ll call you in, like, two 
                        weeks.

           EXT. BOSTON STREET - NIGHT - LATER

           Kennedy and Lamashtu are taking a long walk together in 
           Kennedy’s neighborhood.  They wander towards the Charles 
           River, where they see the Weeks Footbridge from the first 
           scene.

                                 KENNEDY
                        So, you’re pretty much Queen of 
                        Hell now.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Yeah, no big deal, I’m just, like, 
                        completely without rival and, like, 
                        literally control every winged 
                        beast and creature of the lake.

           Kennedy laughs.

                                 KENNEDY
                        You’ll probably want to be going 
                        home soon.
                             (off Lamashtu’s silence)
                        I feel like I’ve learned a lot from 
                        you.  I can finally take my own 
                        advice and “unleash my inner 
                        demon.”   Only this time, it will 
                        be metaphorical.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Yeah, I guess.

           They keep walking.

                                 LAMASHTU (CONT'D)
                        Ken, I’ll leave if you want, but... 
                        I’d like to stay here for awhile.

                                 KENNEDY
                             (excited)
                        Oh, I am so glad you said that!  I 
                        don’t want my inner demon to be 
                        metaphorical!  I want to it to be 
                        literal!
           They do their high-five.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        We complete each other.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Fuck yeah we do, cunt.

                                 LAMASHTU
                             (smiling)
                        Nice.

           They continue walking along the Charles.

           INT. KENNEDY’S CAR - THE NEXT DAY

           Kennedy is cheerfully on her way to work the next day.  She 
           makes a call on her cell phone.

                                 VOICE MAIL
                        “Hello, you’ve reached Karen Howdy!  
                        I’ve stepped away from my phone.  
                        Please leave a message and I’ll get 
                        back to you shortly!  Ken, how do I 
                        turn this off--”

           Her voice is cut off by a beep.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Hi, mama.  I just wanted to say, 
                        thank you for everything you did.  
                        I’m not sure I ever said that?  I 
                        used to be really resentful that I 
                        wasn’t like every other girl, but I 
                        don’t think I’m as different as I 
                        thought I was.  All women feel 
                        insecure, and like they don’t know 
                        their own power.  And that’s why we 
                        all have to stick together.  Like 
                        you did with me.  You’ll always be 
                        with me.  Okay.  Call me back when 
                        you can.

           She keeps driving but makes a turn where she usually goes 
           straight.

           INT. AGNES’ HOUSE - MORNING

           Kennedy gets to Agnes’ house and rings the doorbell.  Agnes 
           answers the door.  She looks HORRIBLE.
                                 AGNES
                             (cold)
                        What do you want?

                                 KENNEDY
                        I want to say I’m sorry.  Those 
                        things I said back there, that 
                        wasn’t me.

                                 AGNES
                        I don’t know, it sounded pretty 
                        “Kennedy” to me.

                                 KENNEDY
                        I know I can’t take it back.  But I 
                        just need you to know how much I 
                        love and respect you, and regret 
                        what I said.  And I know you quit 
                        CRTR, but CRTR is super toxic.  I’m 
                        pretty sure Stevie is planning some 
                        sort of domestic terrorism act 
                        there anyway.

           Agnes is listening.

                                 KENNEDY (CONT'D)
                        What if I quit too, and we started 
                        our own company?  Like we always 
                        dreamed?

           Agnes weighs what Kennedy has just said.

                                 AGNES
                        You really take back what you said?

                                 KENNEDY
                        If I could make a time machine, I 
                        wouldn’t use it to kill Hitler, I 
                        would use it to go back in time and 
                        keep myself from ever saying the 
                        things I said to you.
                             (beat)
                        And I guess I’d also kill Hitler, 
                        it would be insane for me not to.

                                 AGNES
                        And, um, are you demonically 
                        possessed?

                                 KENNEDY
                             (thinking)
                        You know, “possessed” doesn’t seem 
                        like the right word.  Let’s call it 
                        “demonically synergized.”
           They hug, and we dissolve as happy music plays.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. NEW OFFICES - MONTHS LATER

           Kennedy and Agnes have started their OWN COMPANY called 
           “BIBO,” which stands for “BREATHE IN, BREATHE OUT.”  A huge 
           sign in the warehouse office says as much.

           Every single BIBO employees is FEMALE.  Kennedy and Agnes 
           share a big desk in the middle of the room and busily do 
           work.

                                 KENNEDY
                        How’s the new Android app?

                                 AGNES
                        It's looking good, the team really 
                        stepped up and squashed some big 
                        bugs.

                                 KENNEDY
                        Amazing.  Want to celebrate at home 
                        later by finding some new recipes 
                        for keto cupcakes?

                                 AGNES
                        You know it!

           An excited female DEVELOPER runs up to Kennedy and Agnes.

                                 FEMALE DEVELOPER
                        Hey!  So sorry to bug you guys, did 
                        you see that the New York Times 
                        just ran a review of BIBO and said 
                        it was a masterpiece?

           Kennedy does a quick search on her computer and pulls up the 
           review.

                                 KENNEDY
                             (reading)
                        “BIBO, short for ‘Breathe in, 
                        breathe out,’ is a groundbreaking 
                        app for women to help manage their 
                        anger.  Created by two female 
                        former-Critters, it combines yoga 
                        techniques, cognitive behavioral 
                        therapy, and a strong community of 
                        users to directly target the 
                        specific sources of female anger, 
                        and to make users feel less alone.

                                 (MORE)

                                 KENNEDY (CONT'D)
                        I, for one, have used it three 
                        times while writing this review.  
                        It’s perfect.”

           Kennedy and Agnes both cheer.  They high-five the female 
           developer, who runs off excitedly.  Kennedy’s eyes turn 
           black.

                                 LAMASHTU
                        Good job, ladies.  Except they said 
                        two women started it and didn’t 
                        give me any credit.  I should rip 
                        that journalist’s breast-feeding 
                        infant off her chest and juice it 
                        in front of her.
                             (off Agnes’ look)
                        Or just leave her a mean anonymous 
                        comment online.  Whatever.

           Back to Kennedy.  She high-fives Lamashtu, then puts her arm 
           around Agnes.  She has everything.

           Off Kennedy’s pure joy, we FADE OUT.

           THE END.
