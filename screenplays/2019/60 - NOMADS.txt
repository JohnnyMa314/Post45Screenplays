          PARADIGM TALENT AGENCY
          Gabriel Mena
           “The Great Spirit took eight parts to form man: the body from 
           the earth, the bone from the stones, the blood from the dew, 
           the eyes from the depth of the clear water, the beauty from 
           his own image, the light of the eyes from the sun, the 
           thoughts from the waterfalls, the breath from the wind, and 
           the strength from the storms.”
                     - Montechema
           EXT. SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS - DAY

           A vast, virgin American landscape. Colorful and tranquil. 

           The majestic plains continue infinitely in all directions. 
           This is a place where the white man doesn’t dare to go. 

           It’s 1862. In the next hundred years, this place will change 
           forever... but not yet.

           Before this paradise is marred with railways and pipelines, 
           these grasslands have one more story to tell --

           THE SILHOUETTES OF THREE RIDERS, atop majestic mustang 
           horses, appear on the horizon, where mountains meet the sky. 
           The riders storm across the landscape. They own the prairie. 

           They’ve been riding for a day without rest and do not appear 
           to be slowing. They could go at this hard pace for hours 
           without fatigue. They can even drink the liquid inside their 
           horses’ stomachs to hydrate themselves if needed.

           These are Comanche scouts, members of one of the last 
           remaining nomadic tribes in the area. They kicked Apaches, 
           Mexicans and Texans off this land. They do not only own the 
           plains, they rule them.

           SOMEONE jumps down from a tree in front of us --

           ETENIA (8), Comanche. She smiles with pride as she spots the 
           riders. She rushes to her horse, mounts it in a single jump 
           and rides hard for --

           THE COMANCHE CAMP. 

           Hundreds of TIPIS in a valley beside a river. All tipi doors 
           point east. There are a hundred people in camp. At least A 
           THOUSAND GRAZING HORSES.

           EXT. COMANCHE’S CAMP - CONTINUOUS

           Etenia dismounts in a single bound and leaves her horse 
           behind. She storms across the camp, moving through:

           - Women dismantling tipis. 

           - Women painting parfleches and men making saddles.

           - Girls playing a game where the objective is to keep a ball 
           from touching ground.

           It’s everyday life in this camp.

           Etenia moves toward a tipi located in the center of the camp. 
           She rushes inside to find --
           INT. CHIEF’S TIPI - CONTINUOUS

           THE CHIEF (45) is seated, at work on a new arrow. He talks 
           with QUAN (40), the Chief’s brother and his right-hand man. 

           Quan is a skilled hunter and natural leader who has risen to 
           near mythical stature within the community. 

           (Note: Except when it is explicitly noted, all native 
           dialogue will be in the Comanche language)

                                 ETENIA
                        The scouts are coming!

                                 CHIEF
                            (to Etenia)
                        Tell your mother to bring all three 
                        of them some food.

           She nods and storms out, more than happy to help.

                                 QUAN
                        They took longer than usual.

           YAPA (30), one of the riders that we saw on the plain, 
           enters.  He is shy, clumsy, and slightly heavier than the 
           rest.

                                 CHIEF
                        Come, take a seat.

           Yapa sits.

                                 YAPA
                        Thank you.

                                 CHIEF
                        Now, tell me, where are they?

                                 YAPA
                        We only found carcasses. All were 
                        shot by the white men. 
                            (pause)
                        There are no buffalo.

                                 QUAN
                            (to Yapa)
                        We came this far because you 
                        thought we would find buffalo here.

           Yapa takes this as a provocation.

                                 YAPA
                        On the last big moon, this is where 
                        we found them.
                                 CHIEF
                        On the last big moon there were a 
                        thousand of us. We cannot do as we 
                        did in the past. The world is not 
                        like the one our fathers knew. 

                                 YAPA
                        Maybe you should consider leading 
                        us north. We found tracks heading 
                        there. 

                                 QUAN
                        No, people are tired, we need more 
                        rest before we can move again. This 
                        is how we have always done it.

           The weight on the Chief’s shoulders finally gives way.

                                 CHIEF
                        Yapa is right. We leave at the 
                        sunrise. We will starve if we stay 
                        here.

           Yapa nods in agreement, but Quan doesn’t look satisfied.

                                 YAPA
                        Something else. We saw a small 
                        group of Tonkawas prowling.

                                 CHIEF
                        When the time comes, we will take 
                        care of them.

                                 QUAN
                            (To Yapa)
                        Did you hear the news?

           Yaps looks at him, confused.

                                 QUAN (CONT'D)
                        You had a boy.

           Yapa smiles.

                                 QUAN (CONT'D)
                        His hair is golden like the sun and 
                        his eyes are as blue as the sky.

           Yapa stares at him in shock.

                                 QUAN (CONT'D)
                        And his skin is as white as snow.

           Yapa looks at him completely paralyzed, and then a small 
           smile breaks on Quan’s face. Yapa realizes he was joking.
                                 CHIEF
                        Look at your face! You turned white 
                        yourself for a second there!

           The Chief and Quan laugh at Yapa. Yapa doesn’t know how to 
           react.

                                 CHIEF (CONT'D)
                        She has not given birth yet, Yapa. 
                        Go visit her now, we will bring you 
                        the food. She better give us a 
                        warrior before we leave these lands 
                        or we will have to roll her north 
                        when we go.

           Yapa smiles and leaves the tipi.

           EXT. COMANCHE’S CAMP - MOMENTS LATER

           Chief holding the arrows walks next to Quan looking at the 
           camp.

                                 CHIEF
                        Quan, we will have to travel 
                        lighter.

                                 QUAN
                        Women are breaking down the 
                        fallen’s tipis, we will burn them 
                        today.

                                 CHIEF
                        Even lighter than that. 

           Quan, confused, doesn’t say anything at first. But then:

                                 QUAN
                        You want to leave the horses 
                        behind?

                                 CHIEF
                        We are too easy to track now. We 
                        almost lost all of our people in a 
                        single battle.

                                 QUAN
                        That was your mistake.

                                 CHIEF
                        Does one mistake make a man a 
                        failure?

                                 QUAN
                        Horses are all we have now. What 
                        would our ancestors think?
                                 CHIEF
                        They would want us to survive. The 
                        Great Spirit wants us to survive.

                                 QUAN
                        If we release the horses, our 
                        enemies will take them and become 
                        even stronger.

                                 CHIEF
                        What other choice do we have?

                                 QUAN
                        To become stronger than we have 
                        ever been.

                                 CHIEF
                        We are one of the only tribes left, 
                        Quan. If we lose another fight, we 
                        will disappear and our tongue will 
                        never be spoken again. Is that not  
                        more important than horses?

           Quan doesn’t seem convinced.

                                 QUAN
                        We have to fight for our people.

                                 CHIEF
                        We cannot fight forever.

                                 QUAN
                        We have to claim what is rightfully 
                        ours. You are a war chief, act like 
                        one.

           Quan moves away without looking back. The Chief can’t hide 
           how upset and worried he is. 

           EXT. COMANCHE’S CAMP - PERIPHERY - LATER

           Five riders race their horses. They are only teens, but they 
           race with all they have, as if their lives depend on it. 

           The winner is TENEWA (15), an athletic girl who looks as if 
           she’ll soon be a great warrior. Eager, disciplined and 
           respectful. Everything Comanches want their sons to become.

           The Chief contemplates them from the camp. He holds the 
           arrows he was making earlier. He turns to see some other kids 
           trying to hit a tree with improvised bows and arrows.

           The Chief looks for someone else, but can’t find them... 

           Then he spots Etenia shooting her arrows.
                                 CHIEF
                        Etenia! Where is your brother?

           EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY

           A hand takes a wooden stick and places it over a small fire 
           until it carbonizes. 

           The person then draws a line in charcoal on a piece of wood. 
           The drawing continues, the line becoming a very rustic sketch 
           of a fort.

           The artist is NACONI (14), a fragile kid with the steady 
           concentration of a surgeon.

           The Chief approaches him. 

                                 CHIEF
                        I have been looking for you, son. 
                        Look what I have made for you.

           Naconi immediately drops his drawing stick. He knows he was 
           caught doing something wrong.

                                 CHIEF (CONT'D)
                        Let’s go practice.

                                 NACONI
                        I do not want to do that now.

           The Chief takes a seat next to Naconi. 

                                 CHIEF
                        Things are changing fast, son. I 
                        need you to become a hunter and a 
                        warrior. I will need you by my side 
                        sooner than I had expected.

                                 NACONI
                        What do you mean, by your side?

           Before the Chief answers, he spots the piece of wood with the 
           illustration of the fort.

                                 CHIEF
                        What is this?

           A beat.

                                 NACONI
                        It is called “a fort.”

                                 CHIEF
                        A fort?
                                 NACONI
                        That is what the white men call it. 
                        It is like the one we saw days ago.

                                 CHIEF
                        How do you know what they call it?

           Naconi considers, but can’t lie.

                                 NACONI
                        She told me.

                                 CHIEF
                        Is she making you forget our 
                        tongue?

                                 NACONI
                        I only learned some words.  We will 
                        have to use it sooner or later.

                                 CHIEF
                        How much have you been talking to 
                        her about these things?

           Naconi doesn’t answer, he knows it will get him into trouble.

                                 CHIEF (CONT'D)
                        How much!?

           EXT. COMANCHE’S CAMP - MOMENTS LATER

           Chief walks angrily across the camp. He goes toward the women 
           dismantling the tipis and spots one --

           A WHITE WOMAN. Her face is disfigured with scars. Panic on 
           her face as the Chief approaches her. She then spots Naconi 
           walking behind the Chief. Naconi looks very worried and the 
           White Woman realizes what’s happening. 

           The Chief takes her by the hair and violently drags her away 
           from the others. She doesn’t even try to defend herself.

                                 NACONI
                        Is not her fault! I asked her to do 
                        it!

                                 CHIEF
                            (To Naconi)
                        Stay back!

           Naconi steps away, scared.

           A crowd of onlookers gather, watching. 

           The Chief throws the White Woman onto the ground and puts his 
           foot to her neck.
                                 CHIEF (CONT'D)
                        If you want to speak your tongue 
                        and talk about your rotten world, 
                        leave now. But if you stay in our 
                        home and use the name we gave you, 
                        you must forget everything about 
                        that world and never talk about it 
                        again. 

           The Chief lifts his foot and steps away, leaving the White 
           Woman on the ground. 

                                 CHIEF (CONT'D)
                            (to the crowd)
                        Break camp, we are leaving!

           The onlookers continue with their work, none go to her aid. 
           The White Woman stands slowly and goes back to her work.

           Naconi stays there, feeling sorry for what has just happened.

           EXT. COMANCHE’S CAMP - DAWN

           Camp is broken. All are getting ready to leave. 

           Women load the horses with tipis as the sun breaks fully 
           through the clouds. They tie their baggage to the saddles.

           Quan is giving food to his three dogs. He enjoys this. They 
           are like family to him.

           There is a bonfire built from dozens of tipis. They are 
           burning the tipis of the dead.

           There’s only one tipi still standing.

           Etenia stares at it. What’s going on inside? She approaches 
           the tipi slowly. Etenia stops in front of the tipi opening. 
           It is a low door covered with extra pelts.

           She lifts the door flap to look inside, when it suddenly 
           opens. She steps back, startled. Yapa comes out of the tipi.  
           He’s clumsily carrying a couple of jars which fall to the 
           ground when he sees her. He picks the jars up and walks away, 
           ignoring Etenia.

           Etenia peeks inside to see what’s going on -- A WOMAN is 
           lying on a bed. There’s a pole beside her. A MATRON places a 
           flat warm stone on the Woman’s side.

           Etenia can see this woman is in labor. 

                                 NACONI (O.S.)
                        We are leaving.

           Etenia turns to see Naconi standing behind her. 
                                 ETENIA
                        What about them?

                                 NACONI
                        They will catch up when she 
                        delivers. Let’s go.

           EXT. COMANCHE’S CAMP - LATER

           The tribe moves away, leaving behind the one tipi where the 
           labor is in process. Horses and mules draw travois piled with 
           tent poles and buffalo hides.

           All the women and children walk in front of an enormous herd 
           of horses.

           Quan is on horseback. His three dogs are tied to his horse. 

           Naconi walks with his sister, Etenia, and THE WHITE WOMAN -- 
           revealed to be his mother. 

                                 ETENIA
                        Mother, what happens if we cannot 
                        find any buffalo?

           Naconi’s mother doesn’t answer the question. She continues 
           walking, trying not to think about it.

                                 NACONI
                        I only wanted to learn about your 
                        world.

                                 NACONI’S MOTHER
                        Our people are my world now.  Your 
                        father is right, there is nothing 
                        outside worth learning, Naconi.

                                 NACONI
                        How can you say that?  Does their 
                        way not seem better?  They do not 
                        have to leave their homes to chase 
                        buffalo. They can build huge towns 
                        and create all kinds of magical 
                        things.

                                 NACONI’S MOTHER
                        Those of us who have settled in one 
                        place have disappeared. Do you want 
                        the same fate for your people?

                                 NACONI
                        Of course not, but I want something 
                        different for myself.
                                 NACONI’S MOTHER
                        I will make you a different soup 
                        for dinner, then.

           She smiles, but Naconi doesn’t respond. 

           EXT. PLAINS - LATER

           Afternoon shadows form on the prairie. The tribe slowly 
           crosses the expansive glass-lands.

           Warriors are in front now, guiding the travelers toward the 
           wide horizon. The enormous herd of horses is following them.

           EXT. ANOTHER PLAIN - LATER

           It’s been a long journey, but they continue moving.

           EXT. COMANCHE’S NEW CAMP - LATER

           The women are setting up camp. 

           Naconi is helping his mother when The Chief arrives.

                                 CHIEF
                            (To Naconi)
                        You, come with us.

                                 NACONI
                        Where?

                                 CHIEF
                        Hunting. Yapa found a herd.

                                 NACONI’S MOTHER
                        He is not ready.

                                 CHIEF
                        He would be if he had not wasted 
                        his time learning useless things.
                            (To Naconi)
                        Let’s go.

                                 NACONI’S MOTHER
                        It is too dangerous.

                                 CHIEF
                        We do not run from danger.

           The Chief rides towards his men. 

           Naconi is confused. He looks at his mother, but she doesn’t 
           say a word. Naconi has no option but to follow his father.
           EXT. COMANCHE’S NEW CAMP - DAY

           Women, children, and elderly gather around the hunters. The 
           group departs the camp on horseback, followed by a group of 
           women and horses loaded with light tipis.

           Half of the tribe stays behind. Most are women and children, 
           though some men stay behind too to protect the camp. 

           While Tenewa sets up her tipi, she watches the Chief help 
           Naconi ready his horse. Is he going on the hunt?

           Yes, Naconi is actually going with the hunting party. Tenewa 
           can’t hide her disappointment. She drops the tipi poles and 
           immediately mounts her horse, riding after them and leaving 
           her tipi behind. 

           Quan, who is traveling with the hunters, realizes Tenewa is 
           following them. He leaves the group and rides toward her.

                                 QUAN
                            (To Tenewa)
                        Go back!

                                 TENEWA
                        My family was killed. If I do not 
                        hunt, I will starve.

                                 QUAN
                        We will get you food.

                                 TENEWA
                        I am not a beggar. I am a warrior.

                                 QUAN
                        You are too young.

                                 TENEWA
                        I am the same age as Naconi.

                                 QUAN
                        He has someone to take care of him.

                                 TENEWA
                        I do not need anyone to take care 
                        of me. 

                                 QUAN
                        Your horse is not ready.

                                 TENEWA
                        He is more ready than me. I am 
                        going whether you like it or not.

           Quan thinks over what to say but can’t find an excuse. He 
           turns his back on her and returns to the group.
           Tenewa doesn’t think twice, she rushes ahead to join them.

           EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY 

           The small hunting party crosses the prairie. 

           Naconi rides up to his father. The Chief looks at Naconi and 
           continues on in silence for a moment. Then --

                                 CHIEF
                        You do not see it yet, but you are 
                        very important to your people. 

                                 NACONI
                        I am nothing.  If I die, it will 
                        not matter to the tribe. 

                                 CHIEF
                        If one of us dies, a part of all of 
                        us dies with him. Look around, we 
                        leave nothing behind, no buildings, 
                        no temples, nothing. Our people and 
                        the memories of our people are all 
                        we have. You are more important to 
                        your own people than you are to 
                        anyone else in the world. Here, you 
                        are the past and the future. Here, 
                        son, you are all of us.

           Naconi remains in silence, thinking this over.

                                 NACONI
                        I am not ready for the hunt.

                                 CHIEF
                        Nobody is ready until they do it. 

           The Chief looks at Naconi for a moment. He then kicks his 
           horse and moves on, leaving Naconi alone and worried.

           EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

           Two dozen of the tribe’s best hunters stand in a line. Only 
           three of them are women.

           It’s the day of the hunt, nothing is more important than 
           this.

           Naconi is beside the Chief and can’t hide his fear. 

           Quan and Yapa appear calm. 

           Tenewa holds her bow tightly. Is she ready or panicking? 
           Half a mile away from them -- They spot THE BUFFALO HERD.  
           Powerful, brutish, fantastic creatures. The animals detect no 
           sign of danger.

           Quan goes toward Naconi and Tenewa.

                                 QUAN
                        You probably think you are seeing a 
                        great many buffalo here today, but 
                        not so long ago there were 
                        millions. It was once impossible to 
                        imagine that they would disappear, 
                        but look at what has happened. They 
                        know the danger they are in, they 
                        are scared, they know they are 
                        becoming weak. But buffalo give us 
                        life. The Great Spirit has 
                        connected us to these creatures by 
                        blood. We are not here for their 
                        flesh, we have come to honor them.

           Quan looks at the buffalo.

                                 QUAN (CONT'D)
                        They run against the wind, we will 
                        move within it. One shot, one kill. 

           EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

           The hunters advance across the prairie. They encircle the 
           herd, concentrating on what lies ahead.

                                 QUAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Hit the animal diagonally behind 
                        the ribs, and drive your arrow into 
                        its heart. Today you will become 
                        hunters. Each hunter needs at least 
                        two kills. Remember, do not get too 
                        close and you will be fine. 

           There's a lump in Naconi's throat. 

           Their ponies leap forward, hooves churning up the ground.

           The race is on. The herd is in full flight now, the sound of 
           their stampede rumbles across the sky. 

           Quan, Yapa and the Chief have caught up with the buffalo. A 
           few more strides and they'll be in.

           Naconi speeds up, in a moment he’ll be there too. 

           From the corner of his eye, Naconi spots Tenewa readying her 
           first arrow.

           A bull swipes his horns at Tenewa, but Tenewa’s horse quickly 
           dodges, nearly throwing Tenewa as he does.
           Naconi loads an arrow, aims and shoots -- He misses. Naconi 
           sees a buffalo get hit and fall. A perfect shot from Quan.

           Tenewa passes Naconi and shouts --

                                 TENEWA
                            (To Naconi)
                        You have to get closer!

           Tenewa shoots and hits a buffalo -- This time she kills it! 
           She is really good.

           Naconi readies his bow again. He moves closer to the herd, 
           maybe too close... 

           This is his moment. He aims, about to shoot when --

           A BULL hits Naconi’s horse in the loin.  A terrifying impact. 

           The horse loses balance immediately and stumbles forward 
           violently, but Naconi clings tightly to his horse’s mane, 
           trying not to fall.

           The horse crashes to the ground sending up a thick cloud of 
           dust.

           And to make it worse -- nobody saw what happened.

           Naconi’s eyes are closed, he appears unconscious. A splash of 
           blood marks his face. He opens his eyes in shock. 
           Disoriented. 

           More blood splashes his face. Naconi looks around in 
           confusion. He then raises his head to see --

           A bull is charging him from just a yard away. That is where 
           the blood is coming from. The herd is crushing his horse as 
           it passes. 

           Naconi is lying on the ground in the middle of a stampede. 

           In a panic, Naconi tries to get to his feet but there’s 
           something holding him down. He looks to find -- 

           His leg is trapped beneath the horse. 

           PANG! PANG! Hooves blur past, smashing the ground next to 
           him. 

           Anxiety hits hard as Naconi realizes he can’t stay there any 
           longer or he’ll end up shredded like his horse.

           Quan shots at another buffalo, but misses this time. He looks 
           over his shoulder -- and is shocked to see that Naconi has 
           disappeared.
           Quan quickly splinters off, kicks his horse into a gallop and 
           races towards the back of the herd.

           Panic growing as Naconi struggles to pull his leg free of the 
           horse -- Still can’t, but he doesn’t give up.

           PANG! PANG! More buffalo stampede only inches away from him.

           Quan is speeding on horseback. He’s deeply worried about 
           Naconi. 

           Then, he spots something in the middle of the stampede --

           Naconi on the ground.

           The Chief and Yapa realize there’s something wrong -- they 
           quickly leave the hunt and race toward Quan. 

           Quan rides into the herd, traveling with the flow of the 
           animals. He quickly shoots arrows into the buffalo beside 
           him, forcing an opening to Naconi.

           Quan jumps off his horse and rushes to Naconi. The boy is 
           covered in blood. Quan is relieved to find him still alive. 
           Naconi is terrified. 

           Together they lift the heavy horse and free Naconi’s leg. 

           Quan lifts Naconi and brings him to his horse. They know 
           they’ll die if they do not get out of there fast. 

           They’re about to mount Quan’s horse, when --

           Quan’s horse is hit by a bull and thrown violently into the 
           stampede

           Quan and Naconi look on in shock as the horse disappears into 
           the chaotic cloud of bulls. 

           The color drains from Quan’s face as he realizes they won’t 
           get out alive. Quan quickly throws Naconi to the ground and 
           lies down on top of the boy, shielding Naconi with his body.

           Another bull storms past. Quan and Naconi are both scared.

           Another bull nearly hits them, but now the stampede is fading 
           as the last buffalo storms away. They slowly realize that 
           they’re safe.

           After a moment, Quan raises his head to look and spots the 
           other riders heading towards them. 

           The herd is moving off towards the horizon.

           The Chief reaches Quan and Naconi and dismounts his horse. 
           Naconi gets to his feet. Surprisingly, he’s unhurt.
           Nobody says a word for a moment, they’re too shocked to 
           speak. Then --

                                 YAPA
                        We lost the buffalo.

           Naconi realizes that they’re all looking at the Chief in 
           shame. 

                                 QUAN
                            (To the Chief)
                        He was not ready, and now we have 
                        to return to our hungry families 
                        empty handed.

           Quan is the first to turn his back and walk away. The rest 
           slowly do the same, leaving the Chief and Naconi alone.

                                 NACONI
                            (To the Chief)
                        I am sorry.

           The Chief can’t even look at Naconi, he knows it was his own 
           fault.

           The rest of the tribe arrive for the butchering, but to their 
           surprise, the hunt wasn’t as big as they’d expected.

           Only five buffalo have been killed.

           EXT. KILLING GROUND - DAY

           Small groups gather around each of the fallen buffalo and 
           begin to butcher the animals. 

           Tenewa starts butchering the buffalo she killed. Male hunters 
           do not have to do this task.

                                 YAPA
                            (To Tenewa)
                        You did well.

           She accepts the complement, it’s an honor coming from Yapa. 
           Yapa nears a buffalo, when a woman rushes towards him.

                                 WOMAN
                            (Calling out to him)
                        Yapa!

           He turns to face her.

                                 WOMAN (CONT'D)
                        Your child has arrived. It is a 
                        boy.

           He beams. Finally some good news.
           EXT. TEMPORARY CAMP - NIGHT

           People celebrate around campfires, all feasting on fresh 
           meat. Children play. 

           Etenia plays with Quan’s dogs while feeding them food scraps. 
           This little girl is the soul of the tribe. Even Quan smiles 
           when she’s around.

           The NEWBORN child is painted with grease mixed with red 
           ocher. 

           TADAN (55), the medicine man, is performing the ceremony. 
           We’ll learn more about him in the future.

                                 TADAN
                        He is little now, but he will be a 
                        great man.

           Tadan lifts the baby in his arms as they all celebrate.

           Yapa is drunk and dancing with the others. He’s very happy 
           about his new son.

           Seated at a distance, Naconi stares at his people. He’s not 
           taking part on the celebration.

           Naconi spots the Chief, seated in the circle, his happiness 
           fading away. The Chief looks smaller, far from the leader we 
           met before. 

           INT. CHIEF’S TIPI - LATER

           Naconi lies on his bed, lost in thought. He looks at his 
           father -- asleep. He then checks on his mother and Etenia -- 
           both are also asleep.

           Naconi thinks for a moment longer, then stands. The ground 
           crunches beneath his feet. He listens to the breathing of the 
           three sleeping people -- they do not stir.

           He takes a step and listens again -- there’s no sound from 
           the others except the noises of sleep. Naconi loses patience, 
           grabs his bow and arrows, and rushes from the tipi.

           We stay there, in silence. Close on Etenia who, suddenly --

           Open her eyes.

           EXT. TEMPORARY CAMP - NIGHT

           A cloud breaks apart, a nearly full moon hoverers in a 
           restless sky. 
           Naconi glances across the tipi at their horses tied to a 
           pole. Moves quietly towards the horses. All the PEOPLE are 
           asleep following the intense celebration. 

           He makes it to the horses. Cautiously, the kid looks for his 
           horse until he finds it. He unties it and takes it with him.

           EXT. TEMPORARY CAMP - PERIPHERY - MOMENTS LATER

           Naconi walks his horse away from the camp. He stops and looks 
           back to make sure he’s not being followed... but he appears 
           to be in the clear.

           He continues moving off. As soon as he feels he’s safe, he 
           mounts his horse and takes a long last look at the camp.

           He’s sure about what he wants to do next. Without hesitation, 
           he kicks! Horse and rider speed away into the dark night.

           EXT. PRAIRIE - NIGHT

           Naconi advances through the foggy night. He can see very 
           little and rides slowly. The fog blocks all light from the 
           moon and stars above.

           This may not have been a good idea after all.

           He keeps moving, when he hears a slight movement behind him. 
           He stops the horse and waits, listening --

           Nothing. Was it his imagination? He continues on for a 
           moment, when he hears -- A HORSE.

           He turns fast. Carefully, peering around. Naconi slowly 
           reaches for his bow and raises it. He draws an arrow and 
           loads it, but the fog obscures his vision.

           He waits, bow ready. He can feel a presence in the darkness. 
           He mumbles under his breath.

           Slight movement in the fog ahead of him. Then he clearly 
           hears A HORSE approach at a walk.

           The kid holds his bow tight and pulls the string back. He 
           looks down the arrow and aims ahead of him --

           A silhouette lurks in the fog -- Naconi lowers the bow in 
           shock when he sees --

           Etenia. Riding a horse and carrying her small bow and arrows. 
           He can’t believe his eyes.

                                 ETENIA
                        Where are you going?
                                 NACONI
                        You should not have come this far!

                                 ETENIA
                            (Repeating)
                        Where are you going?

                                 NACONI
                        Father sent me to do something. Go 
                        back home or he will be mad.

                                 ETENIA
                        He is asleep.

                                 NACONI
                        I know he is asleep. He did not 
                        want me to wake him up.

           Etenia considers what Naconi said, but --

                                 ETENIA
                        I do not believe father sent you 
                        here.

                                 NACONI
                        Well, he did. 

                                 ETENIA
                        Can I go with you?

           Screw it -- he makes a big confession.

                                 NACONI
                        I am leaving the tribe. I do not 
                        belong there. I cannot be what they 
                        wanted me to be. I am not a 
                        warrior, I am not even a hunter.

                                 ETENIA
                        I do not want you to leave.

                                 NACONI
                        Please, go back.

                                 ETENIA
                        Alone?

                                 NACONI
                        You will be fine. Do not follow me. 
                        Please go.

           Naconi takes off riding. Etenia stays there.

                                 ETENIA
                        Naconi!

           Leaving his sister breaks his heart, but he keeps going.
                                 ETENIA (CONT'D)
                        Naconi!

           He doesn’t stop. He continues moving until Etenia disappears 
           in the fog behind him.

           EXT. BROKEN FOREST - LATER

           Naconi continues his ride. He hears a stream, jumps off his 
           horse and moves toward the sound of the water.

           He finds it. A creek. Cold water coming down from the 
           mountains. He takes the horse to the water so it can drink. 
           Everything appears calm, when he hears --

           A NOISE. He looks around, worried, when suddenly something 
           crosses in front of him moving really fast --

           It’s A HORSE -- without a rider.

           He stares at the horse as it moves away. A thought chills 
           him. He jumps onto his horse and follows the riderless horse 
           as fast as he can.

           Naconi storms into the forest and reaches the runaway horse, 
           brings it to a stop. Stupefied with terror he realizes it’s -- 
           Etenia’s horse. 

           A broken arrow is stuck in Etenia’s horse’s back.

           Naconi doesn’t think twice. He turns and storms back towards 
           the foggy area at full speed.

           EXT. PRAIRIE - NIGHT

           Naconi rides fast, scanning the area for Etenia, but the fog 
           makes it difficult to see.

                                 NACONI
                        Etenia!

           No answer. 

                                 NACONI (CONT'D)
                        Etenia!

           He is looking for her desperately, when he hears -- Murmurs. 
           He cautiously approaches, but suddenly -- The murmurs stop. 

           A deadly silence -- Naconi immediately stops his horse. He’s 
           on alert, listening. He suddenly feels threatened. 

           He exhales softly and takes a shallow breath, too scared to 
           make any noise. The kid looks around, when he spots something 
           on the ground --
           A BODY. Naconi jumps off his horse and storms forward to find 
           A NATIVE, dead on the ground, AN ARROW stuck in his neck --

           He recognizes the arrow... It’s one of Etenia’s.

           Controlling panic, he looks around to find --

           The silhouettes of THREE NATIVE RIDERS IN THE FOG. They are 
           all staring at him. One of them is holding Etenia with him on 
           his horse, her mouth covered by his hand. 

           They’re not friendly, and there’s no way he can fight them.

           A moment of breathless horror. Naconi stands frozen with 
           nowhere to go. He waits for any reaction, but they do not 
           move. They stand there like statues, watching him.

           He realizes he must do something -- Naconi races back to his 
           horse, jumps on and takes off -- 

           An arrow hits the horse in its back, but it doesn’t stop. 

           Naconi doesn’t look back. He speeds away as fast as he can, 
           hoping the fog will hide him now.

           He hears the horses following him. The men CHANT as they ride 
           and the sound scares the shit out of Naconi, but he keeps 
           moving, it’s his only way to survive.

           The sound of the men slowly fades into the distance. But 
           Naconi doesn’t stop... He keeps running for his life.

           EXT. TEMPORARY CAMP - DAWN

           First light over the camp as Naconi rides at full speed. 

           INT. CHIEF’S PIT - MOMENTS LATER

           Naconi storms in. They’re still asleep. 

                                 NACONI
                        Father!

           His father quickly wakes and sits up.

                                 NACONI (CONT'D)
                        They took her!

                                 CHIEF
                        What? Who?

                                 NACONI
                        Etenia! They took Etenia.
           The Chief looks towards Etenia’s bed but it’s empty. He jumps 
           to his feet and leaves the tipi. 

           Naconi’s mother is awake now and staring at Naconi in panic. 
           Naconi follows the Chief out of the tipi.

           EXT. TEMPORARY CAMP - DAY

           A group of fifteen warriors ride away from the camp. Among 
           the warriors, we can distinguish The Chief, Quan, Yapa, 
           Tenewa and Naconi. The rest of the tribe look on, worried.

           EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

           The fog has lifted. Quan pulls Etenia’s arrow from the body 
           Naconi found on the ground. All the warriors look at it.

                                 QUAN
                        Tonkawas.

           The Chief and Quan share a look of concern.

                                 QUAN (CONT'D)
                        We will find her.

           They quickly go to their horses.

                                 TENEWA
                            (To Naconi)
                        What were you doing this far from 
                        camp?

           Naconi tries to ignore the question, but then realizes 
           they’re all waiting for an answer.

                                 NACONI
                        My sister and I were racing each 
                        other.

                                 TENEWA
                        You were racing a kid?

                                 CHIEF
                        This is no place for racing.

                                 NACONI
                        I did not know. When we got into 
                        the fog, I lost her. I tried to 
                        find her, but then I found the 
                        body. That is when I saw them take 
                        her.

           Naconi realizes his father is not convinced by his answer, 
           but they are interrupted by an approaching rider... It’s 
           Yapa.
                                 YAPA
                        I found tracks.

           This is not the time to put Naconi on trial. They mount their 
           horses.

                                 TENEWA
                            (To Quan)
                        Is it true they are man-eaters?

           Quan doesn’t answer. He kicks his horse and rides away, the 
           rest of the group follows.

           EXT. PRAIRIE - LATER

           The group rides fast across the vast prairie. Naconi pushes 
           hard to keep up with the other riders. 

           EXT. VALLEY - HOURS LATER

           Yapa, leading the group, stops riding. The others do the same 
           -- Ahead, they see SMOKE RISING from behind a small hill.

           They continue up the hill, slowly now, until they can see 
           beyond: A small native camp -- IS BURNING -- 

           They stop and look on in shock. There’s A HUGE STAIN on the 
           ground beside the camp. From their position, it’s difficult 
           to tell what it is.

           They continue forward to get a closer look and see what the 
           stain on the ground is --

           A HUNDRED HORSES, ALL DEAD FROM GUNSHOTS. 

           Chief’s face hardens as they cross trough this sea of dead 
           toward -- 

           EXT. TONKAWAS’ CAMP - DAY

           Our war party arrives to find the site of a massacre. 

           All the Tonkawa men are dead. The few women who survived the 
           attack are struggling to care for the injured. They do not 
           worry about the new riders passing through their camp. 

           Naconi wanders through the bloody dead, confused.

           Tenewa is deeply disturbed by the scene, she wasn’t prepared 
           to see this carnage.

           Meanwhile, Yapa watches a group of crying children seated 
           beside their mother. He appears to be pondering his own 
           newborn child back home.
           Naconi spots a familiar man, dead on the ground -- 

                                 NACONI
                        He was one of them.

                                 CHIEF
                            (To all of them)
                        Find her.

           They all dismount immediately and search the area. The Chief 
           sees a woman dragging a dead man. 

                                 CHIEF (CONT'D)
                            (To the woman, in the 
                              Tonkawa language)
                        We are looking for one of our 
                        children. Your people captured her.

           The woman doesn’t seem to understand that the Chief is 
           speaking to her, so deep is her grief.

           Naconi moves to help the woman.

                                 CHIEF (CONT'D)
                            (To Naconi)
                        Leave her. We are not welcome here. 

           Naconi ignores the order and goes to the woman anyway. 

           He tries to help her lift the body, but the woman pushes him 
           away, hard, and yells at him.

           Naconi stares at her, confused, as the grieving woman screams 
           at him. She then goes back to the body and continues on her 
           way.

           Naconi looks up at his father who levels a long, accusing, “I 
           told you” stare. 

           The Chief looks to Quan who is speaking with a woman.

           Quan finishes with the woman and approaches the Chief.

                                 QUAN
                        She says a group of white men 
                        attacked them. They killed all 
                        their horses and took a group of 
                        women prisoner. 
                            (Regretfully)
                        Etenia was among them.

                                 CHIEF
                        Took them where?

           Quan doesn’t want to say, but --
                                 QUAN
                        Out of the territory.

           The Chief considers his options for a long BEAT, and then --

                                 CHIEF
                            (To his people)
                        Let’s go back.

           Naconi turns to him in shock.

                                 NACONI
                        We have to find her.

                                 CHIEF
                        I can not risk all of my warriors.

                                 NACONI
                        Please! Do you not realize what is 
                        going happen to her? We need to 
                        find her!

                                 CHIEF
                        We are going back.

                                 NACONI
                        Is that why you had children? To 
                        turn your back on them? 

           An awkward silence. That hit the Chief hard. 

           The Chief grabs Naconi and throws him to the ground. He then 
           steps over Naconi and pushes his face down into the mud. 

           The Chief’s frustration is overtaking him.

           Naconi can’t breathe. He struggles but the Chief is much 
           stronger than he is. There’s nothing Naconi can do.

           The other warriors watch the Chief, slight worry on their 
           faces, but nobody moves to break it up.

           The Chief releases Naconi. The boy rolls onto his back in the 
           mud and breathes deeply.

                                 CHIEF
                        When I say we go, we go!

           EXT. TONKAWAS CAMP PERIPHERY - LATER

           Naconi is covered in mud. He walks through the field of dead 
           horses. The others ride ahead of him, slowly. 

           Tenewa leads Naconi’s riderless horse by rope.
           They ride in silence. The Chief is in front of the group, his 
           eyes steady. He is furious and intense. Quan approaches the 
           Chief.

                                 QUAN
                        If you give me a small group, I 
                        will go find her.

                                 CHIEF
                        You want to join my son on foot?

                                 QUAN
                        We are going hungry because white 
                        men killed the buffalo. Many tribes 
                        lost their homes because white men 
                        forced them to leave. Look at what 
                        they did to their own friends. 

                                 CHIEF
                        White men have no friends. They are 
                        weak, and the weakness of our enemy 
                        is our strength.

                                 QUAN
                        Weak? They can take the daughter of 
                        our Chief and do what they please 
                        with her.

           The Chief keeps moving, pretending he didn’t hear that.

                                 QUAN (CONT'D)
                        It is a time of war. This could be 
                        one of many battles, or it could be 
                        our last one.

           The Chief sighs, tired, exasperated.

                                 CHIEF
                        Nobody will cry for Etenia more 
                        than I will.

           The Chief continues moving in silence, but suddenly, he 
           realizes that he’s riding alone. 

                                 QUAN (O.S.)
                        To cry for her is to cry for us 
                        all.

           The Chief stops and turns his horse to find the group stopped 
           behind him. 

           They are all looking at him in a way that seems to indicate 
           that -- Quan is the leader now.
                                 QUAN (CONT'D)
                        We have to show our people that we 
                        are still the most powerful nation. 
                        We all need that, you need that.

                                 CHIEF
                            (Irritated)
                        You do not tell me what I need, 
                        brother.

                                 YAPA
                            (To the Chief)
                        If you allow me, I will join Quan.

           That takes the Chief by surprise.

                                 CHIEF
                        We need you in camp.

                                 YAPA
                        We found buffalo herd. Our families 
                        can hunt and sustain themselves on 
                        that meat for a month at least... 
                        We will be back before that.

                                 CHIEF
                        You have a newborn to care for.

                                 YAPA
                        The more reason to fight for our 
                        people.

                                 QUAN
                        We need our pride back.

           An awkward BEAT as the Chief looks at Quan. He realizes this 
           is a battle he will lose.

           The Chief takes control of the plan --

                                 CHIEF
                        Go east. I will send Tadan to join 
                        you. He walked that territory long 
                        ago. Wait for him when the sun 
                        falls.

                                 QUAN
                            (To one of the riders)
                        You come with us.

           The Chief shows Quan he’s the one making decisions --

                                 CHIEF
                        No, you will take Tenewa.

                                 TENEWA
                        Why me?
           The Chief doesn’t answer, he just stares at her. She 
           immediately joins the small group.

                                 CHIEF
                        We are of The People.

                                 QUAN
                        We are of The People.

           And with that -- Quan, Tenewa and Yapa ride away. 

           Naconi looks at them as they ride off.

                                 CHIEF
                        You asked why we have children, we 
                        have them because we hope they will 
                        survive us to accomplish what we 
                        cannot.

           Naconi eyes his father. Takes a moment to let this sink in.

                                 CHIEF (CONT'D)
                            (To Naconi)
                        Can you do this?

           Naconi breathes. He understands what’s going on. Then mounts 
           his horse quickly.

                                 CHIEF (CONT'D)
                        Do not come back without her.

           Naconi looks at his father, suddenly feeling a cold breeze of 
           fear. Can he shoulder this responsibility? 

           Naconi gives a barely perceptible nod and takes off.

           It takes a while for Naconi to reach the group of riders. He 
           joins them in full gallop, all headed toward the unknown.

           A moment later, Naconi looks back at the Chief and others 
           riding in the other direction.

           They are on their own now. Off Naconi, adrenaline surging, 
           trying to hide his fear --

           EXT. PLAIN - LATER

           The daylight grows stronger. Warm beams of sunlight break 
           through the dense greenery above intermittently.

           Our group is riding hard in complete silence. They have been 
           going for hours without stopping.

           They’re tired but Naconi seems to be the only one showing it. 
                                 NACONI
                        I need water.

           He looks exhausted. Silence. No one responds. Naconi is about 
           to collapse, but his pride won’t let him quit.

           He eyes Tenewa, she also looks tired but won’t complain. 
           Naconi closes his eyes for a second and tries not to think 
           about how tired he is. 

           The group continues its course.

           EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

           They are all resting now. 

           Naconi stares at Quan, who is straightening his arrows.

                                 NACONI
                        We need water.

                                 QUAN
                        No. You need to be stronger.

           Quan looks at Tenewa.

                                 QUAN (CONT'D)
                        Do you want water?

                                 TENEWA
                        No.

           Quan looks at Naconi with a smile. Naconi stays in silence 
           for a moment and then --

                                 NACONI
                            (To Quan)
                        Why do you not respect my father 
                        anymore?

                                 QUAN
                        I would die for him.

                                 NACONI
                        It does not seem that way.

                                 QUAN
                        It is not how it seems, it is how 
                        it is.

                                 NACONI
                        You want to be the Chief.

                                 QUAN
                        I want our people to have a future.
                                 NACONI
                        A future that you can rule?

                                 QUAN
                        A future where we are not all dead.

                                 NACONI
                        Do you not think that he can give 
                        us that?

                                 QUAN
                        Do you? Do you think your father 
                        can protect us from the white men?

           A BEAT. Naconi doesn’t know the answer.

           Frustrated, Quan gets to his feet and walks away, leaving 
           Naconi to wonder about his intentions.

           EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - CONTINUOUS

           Quan walks through the forest, then stops. He breathes deeply 
           while looking across the moonlit forest. It’s a quiet and 
           beautiful night.

           He then hears -- FOOTSTEPS approaching. Quan draws an arrow 
           and readies himself to attack. He spots two people coming 
           towards him --

           It’s YAPA. TADAN, the medicine man, is with him.

           Tadan spots the arrow loaded in Quan’s bow.

                                 TADAN
                        If you think an old man like me is 
                        a threat, you have not seen the 
                        real darkness yet.

                                 QUAN
                        I have survived nights darker than 
                        this one, but I am sure I will not 
                        survive another one of your farts.

           Tadan smiles and continues on his way.

                                 TADAN
                        And knowing that, you choose to 
                        spend the night next to me?

           EXT. FOREST - LATER

           Our group sits in a circle around a campfire.  We join them 
           in the middle of a ritual. 
           Tadan is seated at the top of a circle. Next to him are Quan 
           and Yapa, then Tenewa and Naconi. 

           Tadan prepares his pipe.

                                 TADAN
                        Once there was a badly wounded man 
                        walking across a prairie. He walked 
                        and walked but fell into a wallow 
                        and died. There were many buffalo 
                        on the prairie that day watching 
                        the man. Then, a buffalo bull who 
                        was the leader, noticed the man 
                        lying dead. The buffalo needed to 
                        protect the wallow, so they made 
                        Puha to revive the man. This gave 
                        the man the power to cure bullet 
                        wounds. He returned to his people 
                        and passed the buffalo Puha around 
                        to the others. 

                                 TENEWA
                        I want that Puha.

                                 TADAN
                        First, you will need a man.

                                 TENEWA
                        I do not want a man.

                                 YAPA
                        Then marry yourself a buffalo 
                        instead.

           They all laugh, but Tenewa didn’t like the joke. 

           Tadan takes a pipe, inhales, and draws four puffs of smoke.  
           He then prays.  Tadan, Yapa and Quan share the pipe between 
           them.

                                 YAPA (PRE-LAP) (CONT'D)
                        The tracks head east.

                                 TADAN (PRE-LAP)
                        How many of them are there?

           EXT. SUMMIT - DAWN

           Our group stands on a hill looking towards the rising sun. 

                                 YAPA
                        Around fifty on horseback, with six 
                        wagons and their slaves on foot.
                                 QUAN
                        We have to hurry. If they get to 
                        where they are going, we will have 
                        a thousand more of them to fight.

                                 TADAN
                        We cannot even fight fifty.

                                 NACONI
                        Maybe we do not have to.

           Surprised, they all turn to face Naconi.

                                 NACONI (CONT'D)
                        We can sneak into their camp when 
                        they are sleeping and rescue her.

                                 QUAN
                        We do not know our enemy. We do not 
                        know how they sleep.

                                 YAPA
                        The kid is right. If we are killed, 
                        Etenia will be a slave forever.

                                 TADAN
                        We can follow them for a couple of 
                        days and study them. We will travel 
                        at night and rest during the day.

                                 QUAN
                            (To Tadan)
                        So you have decided to be the 
                        leader now?

                                 TADAN
                        Common sense is leading us now.

           They all head down the hill. 

                                 TENEWA
                            (To Yapa)
                        How do you know how many they are?

                                 YAPA
                        The ground has a story to tell, you 
                        have only to pay attention to what 
                        it says.

           EXT. FOREST - CONTINUES

           They continue downhill when Quan stops suddenly, frozen, 
           sharing a look of concern with Yapa -- 

           Something is happening and they both know it.
           They immediately ready their weapons and move quickly.

           From a distance they spot--

           One of their horses is lying dead on the ground with its 
           throat slashed.

           They are all terrified by the sight of the murdered horse.  

           They look closer and see -- 

           The silhouette of a native man with his back turned to them 
           is standing beside the dead horse. 

           CLOSER -- the horse killer is dressed as a Tonkawa Warrior 
           and wearing a dirty, torn Confederate jacket over his 
           shoulders.

                                 TONKAWA WARRIOR
                            (In Tonkawa)
                        All horses must die.  We will lie 
                        with them and become seeds again.

           He is about to stab the animal with a knife, when Quan shots 
           an arrow into the Warrior’s shoulder.  The Warrior drops his 
           knife and takes off running.

           Tenewa chases him.

           The rest rush forward and find that it is Yapa’s horse that 
           has been killed. 

           Yapa falls to his knees in despair. For him, it’s like losing 
           a close friend.

           They all look devastated.

           Yapa lies on the ground beside his dead horse.

           Tenewa arrives having captured the Tonkawa Warrior.  She 
           pushes the horse killer to the ground.

           Quan faces the Tonkawa Warrior.

                                 QUAN
                        Why did you do this to us?

                                 TONKAWA WARRIOR
                            (In Tonkawa)
                        I did not do anything to you, I did 
                        it to all things. I will move like 
                        an snake, traveling through this 
                        world until all the horses are 
                        dead.
                                 TENEWA
                            (To Quan)
                        What did he say?

                                 TONKAWA WARRIOR
                            (In Comanche)
                        All horses must die.

                                 TENEWA
                        Did you kill all the horses in your 
                        camp?

                                 TONKAWA WARRIOR
                            (In Comanche)
                        The white men did.  They killed all 
                        the horses, but before they did 
                        that, they murdered my father, my 
                        mother and my wife.  They tied my 
                        little son to a horse and dragged 
                        him until his body turned to dust. 

           A long BEAT.

                                 TONKAWA WARRIOR (CONT'D)
                        And for a moment, I saw the horse 
                        who pulled my son laughing at me.  
                        They are evil animals.  In order to 
                        rid the earth of this horror, all 
                        the horses must die. 

           The Tonkawa Warrior begins to sing.

           Quan draws an arrow back, ready to shoot the warrior...

           But Tadan signals him not to do it.

                                 QUAN
                        He is going to get us all killed.

                                 TADAN
                        If you kill someone who is cursed 
                        with sorcery, you will free the 
                        ghost and it will haunt you to your 
                        grave.

           Quan pushes the Tonkawa with his foot, sending him tumbling 
           to the ground.

                                 QUAN
                        Get out of here, you mad animal.

           Quan feigns as if he is going to hit him again.

                                 QUAN (CONT'D)
                        Leave!
           The Tonkawa is visibly scared.  He gets to his feet and runs 
           away.

                                 QUAN (CONT'D)
                            (To Tadan)
                        If I see him again, I will kill 
                        him.

           Quan goes to Tenewa.

                                 QUAN (CONT'D)
                            (To Tenewa)
                        You will give your horse to Yapa 
                        and wait here for us.

           Tenewa looks at him in shock, then goes to her horse.

                                 TENEWA
                        It is my horse.

                                 QUAN
                        We are on a mission.

                                 TENEWA
                        It was my father’s. It is all that 
                        I have left of him.

                                 QUAN
                        You father is dead, but Etenia is 
                        alive. You will wait here.

           Tenewa can’t believe what she is hearing. 

           Quan turns to the others.

                                 QUAN (CONT'D)
                        We leave at sundown.
                            (to Tadan)
                        Do you agree old man?

           Tadan nods, “yes.”

           Tenewa stays there, searching their faces for compassion, but 
           finds none. 

           Tadan walks away.  Yapa is focused on saying good bye to his 
           old friend.  Finally, Naconi doesn’t know what to do.

           EXT. FOREST - DAWN

           Naconi is sitting with Tadan. They watch Quan keep look out 
           while mending a hole in his coat, this simple task is his way 
           of tempering his anxiety. 

           Tenewa is making dinner with Yapa. 
                                 NACONI
                            (to Tadan about Quan)
                        When I grow up, I will not be like 
                        him.

                                 TADAN
                        Every man has to follow their own 
                        path.

           Naconi looks at Tadan, considering his words.

                                 TADAN (CONT'D)
                        His heart is broken.

                                 NACONI
                        Does he have a heart?

                                 TADAN
                        He was in love when he was your 
                        age. I do not remember her name, 
                        but she was taken away by the white 
                        men. He never saw her again. Some 
                        wounds never heal.

                                 NACONI
                        Quan in love? 

                                 TADAN
                        We all have our tragedies

                                 NACONI
                        I cannot imagine that.

                                 TADAN
                        That is because you see yourself 
                        when you look at him.

                                 NACONI
                        I am nothing like him.

                                 TADAN
                        Can you imagine yourself in love, 
                        then?

           Naconi doesn’t know the answer. Tadan stares at him for a 
           moment, smiles and then moves away.

           Naconi stays there, confused. Then lies down, thinking. 

           He turns and watches Tenewa and Yapa preparing food together. 

           Suddenly, Tenewa catches Naconi watching her and Naconi looks 
           away nervously. 

           She stares at him for a moment and then turns around, giving 
           him her back.
           Naconi stays there, lost in thought. 

                                 TENEWA
                            (to Yapa)
                        Do you not miss your son?

           Yapa doesn’t answer, he’s not sure what to say.

                                 TENEWA (CONT'D)
                        The women said you were afraid to 
                        be a father.

           Yapa looks at her in shock.

                                 TENEWA (CONT'D)
                        They said that is the reason that 
                        you leave camp whenever you can.

                                 YAPA
                        Those fools! I leave to find them 
                        food! 

                                 TENEWA
                        Are not you afraid?

           Yapa loses patience.

                                 YAPA
                        Go bother someone else, I am busy 
                        here.

           Tenewa walks away with her head hung low as Yapa tries to go 
           back to cooking, but he’s so upset he can’t concentrate.

           LATER

           All sleep except for Quan, who lies against a tree keeping a 
           lookout.

           He turns suddenly alert and worried. It’s too calm.

           Tadan open his eyes, also made nervous by the suspicious 
           calm. 

           Yapa also wakes up with them. He shows a silent look of 
           concern...

           Then, they hear a FOOTSTEP. Tadan wakes Naconi and Tenewa. 
           They all load their bows and take cover in the trees. 

           They wait in suspense for a while. Naconi is breathing 
           quickly from nerves and tries hard to calm down.

           Deep in the forest. Between the trees -- they wait in agony.

           Quan hears more FOOTSTEPS. He raises his bow and waits, ready 
           for whatever might emerge from the trees.
           Panic causes Naconi to aim erratically in all directions.

           Whatever is coming could attack from any side. The sound of 
           footsteps gets closer, approaching without hurry. 

           They wait in suspense.

           Tenewa turns pale from fear. She bites her lip. Her hands are 
           shaking and she tries to control them.

           The footsteps come closer -- Then pass and continue.

           QUAN steps out to spot --- A SOLDIER walking slowly. Quan is 
           behind him and the soldier doesn’t see. Quan looks at his 
           bow, thinking. He takes a deep breath and aims at the 
           soldier’s back, when --

           A shadow steps out from behind the trees --

           ANOTHER SOLDIER. Quan lowers his bow. In panic, they listen 
           to the other soldier approach, then another, and another. 

           There are A HUNDRED SOLDIERS, on foot, crossing twenty yards 
           away.

           Our group stands stone still behind the trees, taking silent 
           breaths. If they make a noise, they’ll be killed.

           Tenewa’s hands shake more and more from nerves. The bow 
           wobbles wildly in her grip. She’s in the middle of a panic 
           attack.

           She brings the bow to her chest and hugs it in an effort to 
           feel safer. 

           Tadan stares at Tenewa, who is having a panic attack. She 
           catches Tadan watching her and turns, trying to hide it--

           But her feet shift on the ground as she moves -- Bad idea -- 
           The sound echoes across the forest.

           One of the soldiers turns in Tenewa’s direction. He waits to 
           spot any movement, or hear another sound -- But it doesn’t 
           come. He continues his march, but then stops and looks again. 

           On second thought -- the soldier decides to check. He slowly 
           walks towards where our group is hidden.

           They all hear the footsteps approaching. 

           Out of the corner of his eye, Naconi sees Quan load an arrow 
           into his bow.

           All realize there’s gonna be a fight. 

           The soldier gets to one of the trees, about to look around 
           it, when --
           They hear the Tonkawa Warrior Singing. The Soldier turns 
           quickly. All the soldiers ready their guns.

           Where is that singing coming from? They do not know, but it 
           scares the shit out of the soldiers.

           The soldiers follow the sound until they see the Tonkawa 
           Warrior --

           The Tonkawa Warrior stands on a big rock, holding his arms 
           open, singing his song with all his heart.

           The soldiers aim their guns at him.

                                 SOLDIER
                            (In English)
                        It is an ambush!

           They immediately turn and aim their guns in every 
           direction... waiting.

           But nothing happens.

           Then a GENERAL lifts his rifle, goes toward the Tonkawa 
           Warrior, and aims --

           BANG! He fires. The shot echoes across the forest and the 
           Tonkawa Warrior’s singing stops forever.

           The Tonkawa Warrior falls to the ground, dead.

                                 GENERAL
                            (In English)
                        It was just that one bastard.

           He turns to his Soldiers and --

                                 GENERAL (CONT'D)
                            (In English)
                        We will camp here.

           They start to set up camp, as our heroes freak out in panic. 

           EXT. FOREST - DAY

           It’s been hours. Our heroes are all standing still against 
           the trees. Naconi’s legs shake from exhaustion. His lips are 
           so dry that they are bleeding.

           Most of the soldiers are sleeping. Some stay awake, standing 
           guard. 

           Tenewa’s eyes are fading.  Yapa notices.  She’s far too weak. 

           A soldier comes running.
                                 SOLDIER
                            (In English)
                        We found five horses, but one of 
                        them is dead with its throat cut. 
                        There are reds in the area.

           Naconi turns to Quan.

                                 NACONI
                        They found the horses.

           Tenewa breathes, trying to regain control of her body. She 
           throws a look towards Yapa. He can see that she is not okay, 
           and then, -- she faints. The sound of her fall echoes across 
           the whole forest.

           Quan stares at her, he can’t believe it. Yapa quickly rushes 
           to Tenewa’s tree, picks her up and hides behind it, as --

           Quan sees two guards coming to check on the noise. 

           Naconi doesn’t know what to do. Quan readies his axe. Tadan 
           raises his hand, signaling Quan not to attack, but -- 

           Quan quickly steps out from behind the tree. He grabs the 
           guard and cuts his throat with his axe blade. 

           Now they’re forced to attack. Tadan shoots his arrow into the 
           other guard before they can make a noise. 

           Quan goes to Tenewa, throws her body over his shoulder, and 
           takes off running, when --

           BANG! A bullet hits Yapa in his abdomen. 

           All hell brakes lose. 

           In a matter of seconds, A HUNDRED SOLDIERS are chasing them.

           Yapa gets to his feet. He can still run. 

           They shoot arrows, killing as many soldiers as they can but 
           there are too many, they have to retreat.

           They run, following a ravine to a river. 

                                 QUAN
                        We cannot leave the horses!

                                 TADAN
                        We do not have a choice

           Bang! Another bullet hits the ground near them. 

           Quan was right, they have no choice --
           They quickly shoot all their arrows into the trees on the 
           other side of the river... they can’t let the arrows get wet.

           Tenewa is still unconscious. Quan holds her tight, and 
           without hesitation, jumps into the river. 

           The rest follow Quan, jumping into the water behind him.

           The soldiers arrive and fire as many bullets as they can, but 
           our group is out of range. 

           IN THE RIVER

           Tadan holds onto Yapa, who is losing a lot of blood.

           Quan loses his grip on Tenewa. The current takes her and she 
           is floating away from him.

           Naconi swims hard for Tenewa. He’s a way better swimmer than 
           Quan. He’s about to get to her when a bullet hits the water 
           beside him. 

           Naconi swims underwater.

           Tenewa continues to float with the current, her body being 
           pushed towards the bank where the soldiers are. 

           BANG! Another bullet hits the water. 

           Our group retreats.

           One of the soldiers jumps in the water, swims toward Tenewa 
           and grabs her. He pulls her back to the beach.

           Quan, Naconi, Tadan and Yapa reach the far bank and climb out 
           off the water.

           The soldiers lift Tenewa and carry her away.

           Quan pulls an arrow from a tree, raises his bow and loads it. 

           He aims... following the soldier carrying Tenewa and waiting 
           for the perfect moment --

           Quan shoots. The arrow goes through the soldiers eye and 
           drives deep into his head. The soldier briefly tries to pull 
           the arrow out, but dies, and falls like a sack of grain. 

           Tenewa falls to the ground.

           In the corner of his eye, Naconi spots other soldiers headed 
           towards Tenewa.

           Quan shoots another arrow, killing another of the soldiers.

           Naconi jumps to the water and swims as fast as he can towards 
           the other side.
           Tadan and Quan cover him with counter fire.

           Naconi arrives on the opposite shore just as another soldier 
           meets him there.

           Naconi draws his axe and stabs the other soldier in the 
           stomach. 

           Naconi pulls Tenewa to her feet and brings her to the water 
           with him. 

           Naconi spots the Soldier’s pistol on the ground. He takes it 
           with him, keeping it hidden.

           The stabbed Soldier tries to stop Naconi by grabbing Tenewa 
           by the arm.

           Naconi stabs the soldier again and frees Tenewa. Naconi swims 
           toward the other side, bringing Tenewa with him.

           Two more soldiers jump into the river and swim after Naconi 
           and Tenewa, but Quan and Tadan kill them with the arrows 
           before they can reach Naconi.

           Naconi arrives on the other side with Tenewa in tow.

           They’re safe -- for now.

           EXT. FOREST - LATER

           Tenewa wakes up disorientated.  Naconi gives Tenewa water 
           from his leather canteen and she drinks it desperately.  Quan 
           is beside them.  Tadan is nearby taking care of Yapa.

                                 NACONI
                        I saw the soldiers crossing the 
                        river.  We have to go now.

           Yapa gets to his feet.

                                 QUAN
                        We have to get the horses back. 
                        Without them we are nothing. 

                                 TADAN
                            (to Quan)
                        You should have thought about that 
                        before you attacked them.

                                 NACONI
                        A fight for our horses is a fight 
                        we will lose.  Yapa is wounded. Do 
                        you really think he can fight now?
                                 QUAN
                        He’s still more of a warrior than 
                        you or her...
                            (Pointing at Tenewa)
                        You are just useless kids.

                                 NACONI
                        You are right: Three warriors, one 
                        of them wounded, and two useless 
                        kids against how many of those 
                        white soldiers? You said it 
                        yourself, without horses we are 
                        nothing. 
                            (beat)
                        My father always says you have to 
                        choose your battles. 

                                 QUAN
                        Well, your father is not here. I 
                        say we go back.

           They don’t seem to agree with him.

                                 QUAN (CONT'D)
                        I will not abandon my horse.

           Tadan starts walking away.

                                 TADAN
                        We have no horses anymore.

           The others leave with Tadan while Quan remains there, lost in 
           thought, devastated by the idea of leaving his horse behind.

           Finally, there’s no other option for Quan but to go with his 
           people.

           MOMENTS LATER

           They all move in silence. Tadan stares at Naconi for a 
           moment, and then --

                                 TADAN (CONT'D)
                            (To Naconi)
                        You already possess all that is 
                        necessary for greatness.

           With that, Tadan steps away.  

           Naconi shares a look with Tenewa but she doesn’t liked what 
           she heard. 

                                 TENEWA
                            (To Naconi)
                        If you expect me to thank you for 
                        saving my life in the river, it 
                        will not happen.
           She walks away, leaving Naconi alone. 

           He then follows the group. 

           EXT. SUMMIT - DAY.

           It’s been days and they all look exhausted.

           Then, something in the distance causes them to panic --

           Eight thousand Apaches are on a forced march.  Heavily armed 
           soldiers guard them. The Apaches look exhausted. Some of them 
           fall down, dehydrated, but they are forced to continue or 
           die.

           Our group appear horrified by what they see. 

                                 TENEWA
                        Where are they taking them?

           No answer. 

                                 NACONI
                        We have to do something.

                                 QUAN
                        Now you want to do something?

           Naconi turns to look at Quan.

                                 QUAN (CONT'D)
                        These are the white men you admire? 
                        They take our people and turn him 
                        into a herd.

           Naconi looks to Tadan, waiting for his support, but --

                                 TADAN
                        There is nothing we can do for 
                        them.

           Naconi stays there for a moment, heartbroken, as he watches 
           the Apaches march on through exhaustion.

                                 TENEWA
                        Yapa needs to rest.

                                 TADAN
                        Not here.  We will find someplace 
                        safe.

           EXT. FOREST. NIGHT

           Tadan is nursing Yapa’s wound. Tenewa is helping him.
                                 TADAN
                            (to Tenewa)
                        How are your hands?

                                 TENEWA
                        There is nothing wrong with my 
                        hands.

                                 TADAN
                        Have you ever killed a person?

           She does’t answer.

                                 TADAN (CONT'D)
                        Maybe you are not meant to do it.

                                 TENEWA
                        You know nothing about me.

           They continue working in silence, then --

                                 TADAN
                        Do you know why we never retrieve 
                        an arrow which has taken an enemy’s 
                        life?

           She doesn’t know the answer, but she would never admit that.

                                 TADAN (CONT'D)
                        Because in death, we are all 
                        equals. In order to take an enemy’s 
                        life, you are first cursed with the 
                        power to become your own enemy. 
                            (Then)
                        No one deserves such a curse.

           They continue working in silence as Tenewa thinks about this.

                                 TENEWA
                        There is nothing wrong with my 
                        hands.

           She moves on as Quan arrives.

                                 QUAN
                        We found the place.

           EXT. OKLAHOMA CITY - PERIPHERY - NIGHT

           They stand on the outskirts of the big city. Soldiers are 
           everywhere. Our heroes are terrified by what they see. 

           Naconi is amazed by the size and modernity of the place, but 
           it seems he is not the only one --
                                 YAPA
                        How many years of work did it take 
                        to build this?

                                 TADAN
                        This is the home of the spirit who 
                        brings the winter. 
                            (Then)
                        Last time I came into a place like 
                        this, it was a trap. They killed 
                        Spirit Talker along with thirty 
                        warriors, three women and two 
                        children. 

                                 QUAN
                        I am not scared of them.

                                 TADAN
                        You do not need to be scared in 
                        order to be killed. 

                                 QUAN
                            (To Yapa)
                        Are you sure she is in there?

                                 YAPA
                        This is where the tracks led us.

                                 QUAN
                        I will look.

                                 TENEWA
                        I will go with you.

                                 QUAN
                        I cannot carry a woman every time 
                        she faints. You stay behind to 
                        nurse Yapa’s wounds.

           That hits Tenewa really hard. Quan looks at Naconi.

                                 QUAN (CONT'D)
                        You are coming with me.

                                 TADAN
                            (to Quan)
                        We need a plan.

                                 QUAN
                        We are tired of your plans old man.

           Naconi is confused, but joins Quan.

                                 TADAN
                        If they spot you, they will kill 
                        you. Let’s think this through.
                                 QUAN
                        We will be back before sunrise.

                                 TENEWA
                        What if you are not?

                                 QUAN
                        Wait until nightfall, again, and go 
                        back in to find her.

           Quan turns towards the city. Naconi follows Quan.

           EXT. STREET, OKLAHOMA CITY - NIGHT

           Quan and Naconi walk quietly through the streets of the town. 
           Both know that if they are spotted, they’ll be killed. 

           The city appears desolate. It seems as if everyone must be 
           sleeping, but they hear something --

           Quan spots a SOLDIER lying in the street, very drunk. The 
           soldier struggles to get on his feet but clearly can’t do it.

           They continue on their way, ignoring the poor bastard. They 
           pass a tavern. Music plays inside.

           Naconi peeks in through a window -- A group of drunken men 
           party with prostitutes.

           Quan grabs Naconi by and forces him to continue walking.

           They are startled by a loud whistle and rush to hide. From 
           their hiding spot, they can see an enormous metal structure 
           cut across the land... 

           It is the first time they’ve ever seen A TRAIN. But Naconi 
           has heard of them --

                                 NACONI
                            (In English)
                        A train...

           People spill out of the tavern.

           Quan and Naconi rush to an alley and look for a better place 
           to hide.

           The train stops and people disembark.

           Quan can’t believe his eyes. What is this enormous thing? 
           Naconi can’t hide his surprise either. 

           Naconi spots something -- Men are loading a dozen, chained 
           and bound, Indian women into one of the train cars.
           Naconi leaps up to see if he can spot Etenia among the women 
           prisoners. He moves closer to have a better look and spots a 
           little girl. Could be Etenia, but Naconi can’t see her face.

           Naconi keeps walking, trying not to lose sight of the girl.

                                 NACONI (CONT'D)
                        I see her.

           But Quan stops him.

                                 QUAN
                        They will kill you. This is not the 
                        way.

                                 NACONI
                        We need to rescue her. 

           Naconi draws the pistol that he stole from the soldier on the 
           riverbank. 

                                 NACONI (CONT'D)
                        We can use this.

                                 QUAN
                        Where did you get that?

                                 NACONI
                        It does not matter. Let’s go!

           But Quan reacts with rage. He grabs Naconi by the neck and 
           shoves him into a wall. Quan disarms Naconi and throws the 
           pistol onto the ground.

                                 QUAN
                        You bring shame on our people.

                                 NACONI
                        Because I want to rescue my sister? 
                        At least I am not doing this to 
                        look like a savior.  

           A BEAT.

                                 NACONI (CONT'D)
                        That is right, you only want to 
                        rescue Etenia to prove you are the 
                        next in line to be chief. 

           A BEAT.

                                 QUAN
                        Why did you come back that night?

           A BEAT. Naconi spots the train. They are closing the door.
                                 NACONI
                        They are leaving...

                                 QUAN
                        I saw you. You left the camp. Why 
                        did not you go for good?

           A long BEAT. Naconi didn’t expect Quan to know that.

                                 NACONI
                        Because of my sister. Because I do 
                        care about her.

                                 QUAN
                        No. You do not care about her, you 
                        do not care about your father, or 
                        your family or your people. You 
                        only care about yourself.

           Quan drops Naconi onto the ground.

                                 QUAN (CONT'D)
                        They almost killed all our people 
                        and you just ran away?

           Naconi doesn’t know how to answer.

                                 QUAN (CONT'D)
                        You dragged your sister into this. 

                                 NACONI
                        She followed me, it was not my 
                        fault.

                                 QUAN
                        She followed you because she 
                        trusted you and you betrayed her. 
                        Imagine the most terrible things 
                        men do. That will all happen to 
                        her, if it has not already. And for 
                        what? 

           A BEAT.

                                 QUAN (CONT'D)
                        Yes, you are right. I want to rule 
                        the tribe if only to make sure that 
                        you do not destroy us.

           Naconi looks at Quan for a long time in shock, when --

                                 SOLDIER (O.S.)
                            (In English)
                        Hey...

           Naconi and Quan turn to discover that two drunken soldiers 
           are watching them, shocked by what they are seeing. 
           In the blink of an eye, Quan raises his bow and shoots an 
           arrow through the neck of one of the soldiers, killing him.

           The other soldier breaks into a run. Quan sprints after the 
           soldier, catches him and brings him to the ground. Quan draws 
           his axe and --

                                                             WE CUT TO:

           EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

           Yapa lies on the ground. Tadan puts a buffalo tail into his 
           mouth and then blows on Yapa’s wound.

           Tadan burns the spines of a prickly pear cactus and splits it 
           in half. He presses the split surface of the cactus against 
           Yapa’s wound and binds it tightly.

           Tenewa watches the ceremony, totally absorbed by it.

           Tadan stands and looks at something in the distance, as if he 
           heard something. Tenewa does the same but can’t see anything.

                                 TADAN
                            (To Tenewa)
                        You need to trust your ears.

           Tenewa spots something moving toward them. She raises her 
           bow, when they spot the soldier that Quan attacked in town.

           Then Quan and Naconi appear behind the soldier. The soldier’s 
           hands are tied to a wooden stick and his mouth is gagged.

           Tenewa and Tadan wait until Quan, Naconi and their prisoner 
           arrive. Tadan looks up, confused.

                                 TADAN (CONT'D)
                        The white men will look for him and 
                        find us. 

                                 QUAN
                        Old man, you spend so much time 
                        thinking about the white men that 
                        you are becoming like them.

           Quan forces the soldier to the ground, draws his axe.

                                 TADAN
                            (To Quan)
                        What are you doing?

                                 QUAN
                        I am doing what has to be done.

           Quan looks up at all of them.
                                 QUAN (CONT'D)
                        Now, listen. I know you do not like  
                        it, but this is the way we have 
                        fought for centuries and it is the 
                        way we will fight now. 

           Quan moves to scalp the soldier and looks back at Naconi --

                                 QUAN (CONT'D)
                        Ask him where she is.

                                 NACONI
                        I do not speak their tongue.

                                 QUAN
                        No? Then we will kill him right 
                        here.

           Quan is about to kill him.  

           Pressure on Naconi is building when --

                                 NACONI
                            (In English)
                        What is your name?

           Silence. They all look at Naconi in shock.

                                 QUAN
                            (To Naconi)
                        So many lies.

           Naconi ignores Quan and goes to the Soldier.

                                 NACONI
                            (In English)
                        What is your name?

           The Soldier looks up at Naconi.

                                 SOLDIER
                            (In English)
                        Jimmy.

                                 NACONI
                            (In English)
                        We look for a girl. She captured. 
                        She is here.

                                 JIMMY
                            (In English)
                        If she’s ‘ere, red, her body and 
                        soul belong to CAPTAIN FOSTER now.

                                 QUAN
                        What is he saying?
                                 NACONI
                        That a Captain owns her now.
                            (To Jimmy, in English)
                        Where are they taking her?

                                 JIMMY
                            (In English)
                        New York. That’s the worst place 
                        someone like you could go, red. Far 
                        as I know, no Indian touches that 
                        city outside of a cage.

                                 QUAN
                        What did he say, now?

                                 NACONI
                        They are taking her to another 
                        village called New York. That is 
                        were my mother was born.

           Quan kicks Jimmy to the ground.

                                 QUAN
                        He will take us there.

                                 NACONI
                            (In English)
                        You will take us there.

                                 JIMMY
                            (In English)
                        You retarded or what?

                                 TENEWA
                            (To Naconi)
                        What did he say?

                                 NACONI
                            (In English, ignoring 
                              Tenewa)
                        We will not let you go until we 
                        find her.

                                 JIMMY
                            (In English)
                        It will take months, you dumbass.

                                 TENEWA
                            (To Naconi)
                        What is he saying!?

                                 NACONI
                        He said it will take us months to 
                        get there.

                                 QUAN
                        He is lying.
                                 NACONI
                        Maybe. They are not using horses 
                        anymore. They ride on a train, and 
                        we do not know-

                                 TADAN
                            (Interrupting him)
                        A train?

                                 NACONI
                        The big metal beast. It moves 
                        faster that a hundred horses. We 
                        saw one in the village. Ask Quan, 
                        he saw it too.

           They all look to Quan, waiting for confirmation.

                                 QUAN
                        It is a trap. 
                            (Pointing at Jimmy)
                        If we go there, his people will 
                        catch us and lock us in a cage.

                                 TADAN
                        I think we have reached the end of 
                        this journey.

                                 QUAN
                        We are far from the end.

                                 TADAN
                        This is a test. If we continue, our 
                        hearts will become as hard as stone 
                        and we will lose all recognition of 
                        ourselves. 

                                 QUAN
                        We are not doing this for 
                        ourselves.

                                 TADAN
                        Who are you doing it for, if not 
                        yourself? Do you want to rescue her 
                        or do you want revenge?

                                 QUAN
                        We can have both.

                                 TADAN
                        Now you are the one talking like a 
                        white man. Etenia’s spirit may be 
                        broken already. If we do manage to 
                        rescue her, her mind might already 
                        be lost forever.

                                 QUAN
                        We did not come this far to quit.
                                 TADAN
                        There is one truth: we have 
                        traveled too far. 

                                 TENEWA
                        I remember Etenia running around, 
                        smiling, even when we were all 
                        devastated by death. She is a 
                        strong girl. We all need her, and 
                        because of that, the Great Spirit 
                        will protect her.

           They all feel the same way. 

           Naconi looks at them, they are all confused. He looks to 
           Jimmy.

                                 NACONI
                            (In English)
                        How long takes to go to New York 
                        with train?

                                 JIMMY
                            (In English)
                        C’mon, that’s even more stupid!

                                 NACONI
                            (In English)
                        How long?

                                 JIMMY
                            (In English)
                        Four days! 

           Naconi turns to his team.

                                 NACONI
                        The train will take us there in 
                        four days. 

                                 QUAN
                        This is madness.

                                 NACONI
                        Yes, it is madness. But you said we 
                        have to show our people that we are 
                        the most powerful nation. Are you 
                        planing to do that by being afraid 
                        of a train? 

           Quan doesn’t like being called a coward. He looks at Naconi 
           in silence.

                                 TENEWA
                        I am not afraid of a train.
                                 TADAN
                        Because you are young and dumb.

           Quan looks at Yapa, unconscious on the ground.

                                 QUAN
                        What about Yapa?

                                 NACONI
                        At least he will be forced to stay 
                        still for four days. We can nurse 
                        him back to health.

           They all remain silent as they contemplate their options.

           INT./EXT. TRAIN CAR - NIGHT

           Our group is standing in front of a train car. Jimmy is with 
           them, his mouth gagged. They don’t know what to do. 

           Naconi and Tenewa touch the train car, trying to understand 
           how the gate opens, but they can’t figure it out. They keep 
           pushing everything lever they can find. Finally, frustrated, 
           they start hitting the metal beams but all seems useless.

                                 QUAN
                            (Pointing at Jimmy)
                        Ask him.

                                 NACONI
                        He will scream if we take off his 
                        gag.

           Then Tenewa pushes something and the gate slides open. She 
           jumps up inside a cargo train car. She grabs Jimmy and lifts 
           him inside the cargo car with her.

           Yapa gets into the train car also... When suddenly it starts 
           to move.

           Tadan, Quan and Naconi rush to get in as the train speeds up. 

           Naconi is the last one out. He runs after the train car but 
           it’s leaving him behind. He runs faster.

           Tenewa reaches out for Naconi from the open train door. 
           Naconi runs faster and just barely manages to grab Tenewa’s 
           hand. She pulls him inside. 

           Naconi lies on the floor, exhausted.

           They all sit quietly. There are boxes piled around them, but 
           they have plenty of space to rest. 
           There’s an awkward silence in the air. For the first time, 
           they are not in control. They do not know where they’re 
           headed or what’s going to happen. 

           Nobody wants to say it, but they are all thinking the same 
           thing -- they’ve crossed a threshold into the unknown.

           EXT. TRAIN/PLAINS - DAY

           The Train moves at full speed across the peaceful landscape.

           INT. TRAIN CAR - DAY

           It’s been days. They all look tired and dehydrated. Quan 
           smokes his pipe.

                                 QUAN
                        I wonder if someone is feeding my 
                        dogs.

                                 TADAN
                        Everyone loves your dogs, even when 
                        they shit all over the camp.

                                 QUAN
                        That does not mean they will feed 
                        them.

                                 TADAN
                        Do not worry, as long as there is 
                        dried meat to eat, no one is going 
                        to eat dogs.

           Quan shoots an angry look at Tadan who is now laughing. 
           Naconi turns to Jimmy.

                                 NACONI
                            (In English)
                        Tell more about Captain Foster.

           Jimmy considers, and then --

                                 JIMMY
                            (In English)
                        He’s a British military officer.

                                 NACONI
                            (In English)
                        British?

                                 JIMMY
                            (In English)
                        British! From England. Don’t you 
                        know what England is?
           Naconi doesn’t answer, he doesn’t know. Jimmy appears 
           frustrated.

                                 JIMMY (CONT'D)
                            (In English)
                        Jesus Christ! It’s an island all 
                        the way across the fuckin’ ocean. 
                        ‘Far I know, Foster’s advising the 
                        States on the removal of... 
                        Indians. That’s all I know.

                                 NACONI
                            (In English)
                        Removal?

                                 JIMMY
                            (In English)
                        They’ve been relocating you fellas 
                        to a place where you’ll be safe.

           Tenewa goes to one of the crates in the train car. She tries 
           to open it, but it’s sealed with nails.

           She tries harder and manages to open the box. She steps back 
           in horror when she sees what’s inside --

           Dozens of Indian scalps. Tenewa empties the box onto the 
           floor. The rest look on in shock.

                                 NACONI
                            (To Jimmy, in English)
                        A place where we are safe?

                                 JIMMY
                        Jesus! You are the savages who 
                        started scalping people. We do it 
                        ‘cause you did it first. You ain’t 
                        got to pretend you’re nice because 
                        I’ve seen what you done to the 
                        other red niggers.

                                 QUAN
                        What is he saying?

                                 NACONI
                        He is asking us to spare his life.

                                 QUAN
                        He does not look like he is 
                        begging.

                                 NACONI
                            (To Jimmy, in English)
                        You begging, right?

           Jimmy looks at Quan and lowers his head.
                                 TENEWA (O.S.)
                        This does not look good.

           Tadan turns to find Tenewa next to Yapa. Yapa lies on the 
           ground, drenched in sweat. Tadan goes to Yapa’s side and 
           looks at his wound --

           It looks really bad. Tadan takes a madstone from his bag and 
           places it over Yapa’s wound. 

           Tadan takes his FIRE DRILL and places over a small rag. He 
           sprinkles some gun powder on the rag. 

                                 JIMMY
                            (In English)
                        That useless shit can’t do nothing. 

                                 TADAN
                        We need to find prickly pears.

                                 QUAN
                        We are not going to jump off this 
                        thing.

           Tadan spins the stick between his palms until he makes fire. 
           He then lights his pipe.

                                 TADAN
                        He will die. We do not even have 
                        water to give him.

                                 NACONI
                            (To Tadan)
                        There is nothing else you can do?

                                 TADAN
                        I am doing all I can. 

           Tadan raises his pipe, draws on it, and exhales the smoke 
           onto Yapa’s wound.

                                 YAPA
                            (Hallucinating)
                        My wife, I see my wife. Where is my 
                        son? Quan, where is my son?

           Quan doesn’t know what to say. He’s really worried about 
           Yapa. Naconi rushes to Yapa’s side.

                                 NACONI
                            (To Yapa)
                        He is fine, your son is fine.

           LATER

           They are all quiet. Naconi is seated next to Yapa, lost in 
           thought, when he realizes Yapa is waking up.
                                 NACONI (CONT'D)
                        How are you?

           A long beat.

                                 YAPA
                            (To Naconi)
                        Am I a good father?

           Naconi looks at Yapa. He appears a little better and seems 
           conscious now.

                                 NACONI
                        Of course you are.

           Yapa takes a stick and bends it into a circle. He strings 
           some white beads onto the stick and covers it like a collar. 

                                 NACONI (CONT'D)
                        You have to rest.

           Yapa ignores Naconi. He ties a bird’s claw to the stick and 
           gives it to Naconi.

           Naconi doesn’t know what to do.

                                 YAPA
                        I need you to do something for me.
                            (a beat)
                        Take my Puha.

           Naconi doesn’t know what to do.

                                 YAPA (CONT'D)
                        This claw will protect you from 
                        bullet wounds. That is why I am 
                        still alive. 

                                 NACONI
                        I... I cannot take this.

           Yapa grabs Naconi’s hand.

                                 YAPA
                        It will become your Puha. It has 
                        been mine for many years and now we 
                        will share it.

                                 NACONI
                        I am sorry. I do not believe in... 

                                 YAPA
                        It will come to you when you are 
                        ready. Not before or after. Please, 
                        take it. I can now see the eternal 
                        home beyond the sun. 
                            (a beat)

                                 (MORE)
                                 YAPA (CONT'D)
                                 YAPA (CONT'D)
                        You are my only option here. I need 
                        you to give it to my son. Quan and 
                        Tadan have their own Puha and I 
                        can’t give it to Tenewa. If I die, 
                        he will not be protected.

           Naconi hesitates, then takes it.

                                 YAPA (CONT'D)
                        You will feel the call, I know you 
                        will. When that happens, find a 
                        lonely place. The further you are 
                        from others, the clearer your 
                        vision will be. Every man can be 
                        his own priest and his own prophet, 
                        Naconi. Listen carefully and you 
                        will become someone new. 

           Naconi looks at the claw for a while, then turns to Yapa, who 
           is now looking at the ceiling.

                                 YAPA (CONT'D)
                            (Murmuring)
                        You will become someone new...

           Naconi stays there, worried. Then shares a look with Tadan. 
           He returns his look with something that could loosely be 
           considered a smile, then --

           Tadan starts to sing --

                                 TADAN
                            (Singing)
                        Going away tonight;
                         Be gone a long time.

                                 QUAN
                            (To Tadan)
                        Of all the medicine men, you have 
                        the ugliest voice I have ever 
                        heard.

           Tadan smiles and sings even louder.

                                 TADAN
                            (Singing)
                        While I am gone;
                         I will be thinking of you.

           They are startled by a LOUD WHISTLE. Tadan stops singing.

                                 JIMMY
                            (In English)
                        Welcome to hell.
           Naconi stands and crosses to the gate. He slides it open a 
           little to see what’s going on outside -- The train has 
           finally arrived at the wildest place on the new continent: 
           New York City.

           Naconi looks at the city and is both amazed and overwhelmed 
           by the sight of it.

                                 JIMMY (CONT'D)
                            (In English)
                        Not only will you never find the 
                        girl, God as my witness, you won’t 
                        leave this city alive.
                            (To Naconi)
                        Tell them! Tell them you just 
                        killed them all, you stupid savage.

           That thought sends chills down Naconi’s spine. Maybe the 
           American’s English doesn’t need translation because the whole 
           group is thinking the same thing.

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY, RAILROAD - CONTINUES

           The train crosses the Big Apple, still under construction, 
           until it stops at the terminal.

           INT. TRAIN CAR - DAY

           Naconi peeks outside. There’s no one around their train car. 
           They are far from the passenger platform, stopped in an area 
           for freight cargo.

                                 NACONI
                        I will find a way to escape.

           Naconi opens the gate.

                                 TADAN
                        Take Tenewa with you.

           EXT. TRAIN STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Naconi and Tenewa jump out of the train car. They close the 
           door behind them and walk away.

           They circle the train car but stop when they see a group of 
           soldiers in the distance -- They have to find another way to 
           get out of here. 

           They go to the next freight car and hide. From there, Naconi 
           spots an abandoned building.
                                 NACONI
                        We should check inside and see if 
                        we can hide there until nightfall.

           They both go toward the building to check.

           INT. TRAIN CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Quan moves toward Tadan and Yapa.

                                 QUAN
                        Is he going to live?

                                 TADAN
                        It looks as if the Great Spirit 
                        wants to take him soon.

           Quan lowers his head, devastated, when -- The door slides 
           open and -- Five heavily armed soldiers and one Commander 
           look inside the train car.

           As soon as Jimmy spots them --

                                 JIMMY
                            (In English)
                        Help! Help!!!

           The soldiers immediately ready their guns. Quan, Tadan and 
           Yapa don’t stand a chance.

           Jimmy rushes toward the soldiers. They grab him and take him 
           away from the Comanches.

           Quan reaches for his bow, but a soldier spots him and points 
           his gun.

                                 COMMANDER
                            (In English)
                        Don’t move!

           Quan doesn’t have to speak English to understand the threat.

                                 COMMANDER (CONT'D)
                            (In English)
                        Get out!

           The Comanches exit the train car at gunpoint.

                                 COMMANDER (CONT'D)
                            (In English)
                        Get out!

           Tadan and Quan jump out of the train. 
           Jimmy runs away immediately. One of the soldiers spots Yapa 
           on the floor. The soldier jumps inside the train car and 
           drags Yapa to the door, then throws him out of the train. 

           Tadan goes to help Yapa, but the Commander quickly raises his 
           gun and -- 

           SHOOTS Tadan in the chest, killing him instantly. His 
           lifeless body falls onto the mud as the remaining Comanche 
           stare on in shock.

           A long moment of cold silence. It happened so fast, they 
           didn’t even have the time to react.

           Quan draws his axe, lunges forward and attacks the Commander, 
           but -- He’s out numbered and badly beaten. 

           SOLDIER 2 checks on Yapa.

                                 SOLDIER 2
                            (In English)
                        He’s almost dead.

                                 COMMANDER
                            (In English)
                        Shoot him.

           The Soldier 2 readies his gun and points it at Yapa. He’s 
           about to shoot, when --

                                 NACONI
                            (In English)
                        Step back!

           They turn to find Naconi pointing his gun at Soldier 2. 

           Tenewa has her bow and arrow aimed at the others. 

           In horror, Naconi and Tenewa look at Tadan’s dead body on the 
           ground. They are utterly devastated. 

           Tenewa looks at her own hands, they begin to shake. She tries 
           hard to steady herself and aims the arrow at the Soldier.

           One of the Soldiers turns his pistol on Naconi, but Tenewa 
           shots an arrow, killing him instantly. 

           She’s killed a person for the first time. In less than a 
           second, Tenewa has loaded another arrow and is ready to shoot 
           again. Her hands, now, are as firm as a stone.

           Quan slowly gets to his feet and goes to Tadan’s body. He is 
           definitely dead. Quan contemplates his dead friend lying on 
           the ground, and then -- 

           Quan draws his axe and moves toward the Commander. The 
           Commander takes a step back, scared of Quan.
                                 NACONI (CONT'D)
                            (To Quan)
                        Wait!

           Quan stops. He levels a long accusing stare at Naconi.

                                 NACONI (CONT'D)
                            (In English)
                        Where is Captain Foster?

                                 COMMANDER
                            (In English)
                        What?

           Quan grabs the Commander, then draws his axe and slices the 
           Commander’s arm off with one single blow.

           Quan pushes the Commander against the train, his axe to the 
           Commander’s neck.

                                 NACONI
                            (In English)
                        Where is Captain Foster?

                                 COMMANDER
                            (In English)
                        I... I... Don’t know where he is 
                        staying, he’s waiting for his boat, 
                        it’s named The Silvia. That’s all I 
                        know.

           Quan looks to Naconi. 

                                 NACONI
                        We have the information.

           Quan cuts the Commander’s throat with the axe.

                                 NACONI (CONT'D)
                            (In English)
                            (To the other soldiers)
                        Get in!

           The soldiers climb inside the train car. Naconi closes the 
           door and locks it from the outside.

           Quan carries Tadan’s body and Naconi carries Yapa. They move 
           away from the rails.

           We see, in the distance, Jimmy coming toward the train car... 
           He is leading a fresh group of soldiers.

           The soldiers arrive and find the dead. They then spot our 
           group crossing the rails. The soldiers charge, ready to shot, 
           when a train crosses between the Comanches and the soldiers.
           The soldiers are stuck. Our group has been given an 
           opportunity to escape.

           INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - LATER

           Naconi, Quan and Tenewa enter. Quan and Naconi are carrying 
           Yapa’s unconscious body and Tadan’s dead body. 

           There’s a deadly silence in the air.

           They lie the bodies on the ground. Nobody speaks. They’re all 
           still in shock.

           They sit in silence for a long time. Then Quan gets on his 
           feet and moves toward Tadan’s body. He looks through Tadan’s 
           bag and finds -- The red paint. Quan uses it to paint Tadan’s 
           face. Naconi and Tenewa watch Quan as he works.

           When Quan finishes, he looks for something inside his own 
           bag. He finds a blanket and wraps Tadan’s body with it. Then, 
           he lifts Tadan’s body onto his shoulder and leaves the room.

           Naconi and Tenewa stay there in silence for a while.

                                 TENEWA
                        Maybe we should have gone back.

           Naconi doesn’t know what to say. Then he spots Tadan’s bag on 
           the floor. He takes it and looks inside.

           INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           Naconi and Tenewa are sleeping on improvised mattresses 
           beside Yapa, when Quan enters the warehouse carrying his 
           leather canteen.

           He moves toward Naconi and wakes him up. Naconi looks at him, 
           confused. Quan gives Naconi the canteen. Naconi doesn’t think 
           it twice -- He gulps as much water as he can. 

           Tenewa wakes and drinks some water as well.

                                 QUAN
                        We will have to hide here and move 
                        only at night.

           Naconi nods in agreement.

                                 QUAN (CONT'D)
                        We have to think like they do. The 
                        Great Spirit will guide us. He is 
                        looking after us.

           Quan walks away. Naconi and Tenewa are a little worried about 
           him. 
           LATER

           They are all sleeping. Naconi opens his eyes. He quietly 
           stands, goes to the door and leaves the building.

           EXT. NEW YORK, STREET - NIGHT

           Naconi walks out onto the street. There’s no one around. He 
           looks at the buildings and streets in amazement, unable to 
           believe his eyes. 

           He takes something from his bag -- AN OLD ROLLED  
           DAGUERREOTYPE. It’s a picture of his mother from when she was 
           a teenager. In the photo, she is standing in front of a 
           house. 

           Naconi looks around, trying to find his mother’s house, but 
           it’s useless. It could be anywhere. 

           Naconi hears a MAN’S VOICE. He quickly looks for a place to 
           hide and spots a building with a flight of stairs in back. He 
           goes to the stairs and climbs up.

           A GUY appears. He is walking with a WOMAN who is dressed like 
           a prostitute.

                                 GUY
                            (In English)
                        A whore is a whore.

                                 WOMAN
                            (In English)
                        It’s not who I am, It’s what I do.

           The Guy grabs the Woman, presses her against a wall and 
           starts to kiss her. She laughs.

           The Guy grabs her breast and lifts her skirt. Naconi spots 
           TWO OTHER MEN moving toward them.

           The Guy is too busy to notice them. 

           Naconi realizes one of the approaching men is holding a 
           knife. The two men reach the couple and one of them stabs the 
           Guy in the neck.

           The Woman quickly backs off. The Guy presses his hand against 
           his neck, futilely, trying to stop the bleeding. Then he 
           falls to the ground, writhing in agony. 

                                 WOMAN (CONT'D)
                            (In English)
                            (to the two men)
                        You took too long.
           They get down on their knees and steal all they can from the 
           Guy as he dies.

           One of the men takes the victim’s shoes. When there’s nothing 
           else to steal, they rush off, leaving the Guy half naked and 
           dead on the ground.

           In shock, Naconi continues looking at the murdered man.  

           Suddenly realizes that there’s a SHIRTLESS GUY looking down 
           at him from a window.

                                 SHIRTLESS GUY
                            (In English)
                        Hey! What are you doing here?

           Naconi immediately backs off, but --

                                 SHIRTLESS GUY (CONT'D)
                            (In English)
                        There’s an Indian over here!

           Naconi is about to run out into the street when he spots the 
           Two Guys and the Woman turning back towards him.

                                 SHIRTLESS GUY (CONT'D)
                            (In English)
                        Everybody! There’s an Indian over 
                        here!

           Naconi, now in a panic, tries to find another way to escape. 
           He spots an open window and jumps inside to --

           INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Naconi falls onto the floor inside an apartment. He quickly 
           jumps his feet and tries to find a way out, but doesn’t see 
           one.  

           There’s a closed door in the corner, but he doesn’t know what 
           it is or how to use it.

           Naconi goes to a wood paneled wall and hits it hard, trying 
           to break through. 

           He stops in shock when he sees a KID staring at him from a 
           doorframe.

           Naconi hits the wall again, but stops when the kid starts 
           moving toward him. Naconi is panicking. 

           The Kid walks to the door, twists the handle and opens the 
           door, showing Naconi how to use it.

           Naconi stays there for a moment, thinking what to do... 
           Then quickly grabs a coat and storms out the door.

           EXT. NEW YORK, STREET - LATER

           Naconi walks the streets wrapped in the stolen coat. 

           A carriage comes barreling towards him.  Naconi quickly jumps 
           out of the way and turns down an alley, trying to avoid being 
           seen by anyone.

           INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - LATER

           Naconi enters, they are all sleeping.  He’s still wearing the 
           stolen coat. 

           Naconi goes to his mattress and lies down on it, when he 
           spots Yapa looking up at him. 

           Naconi ignores Yapa and tries to sleep, but he can’t. There’s 
           so much spinning around in his head. 

           Then Naconi turns to see Tadan is still looking at him, but 
           there’s something strange about his look. His eyes don’t move 
           at all. 

           Naconi approaches Tadan slowly. Is he dead? He moves his hand 
           to Yapa’s face, when Tadan looks at Naconi.

                                 TADAN
                        Where are we?

           Naconi breaths again with relief. 

           EXT. NEW YORK - DAY

           Days have passed.

           The buildings are huge masses of concrete and wood. The 
           streets surrounding them are paved with cobblestones. 

           It is the heart of the New World.

           The Hudson River harbor is crowded with the tall masts of 
           sailing ships.

           And then... SNOW begins to fall.

           EXT. HARBOR, ROOFTOP - SUNSET

           Tenewa and Yapa are hidden on the roof of a building, 
           watching the harbor. Yapa seems completely recovered now. 
           They look at the ships sailing in the river. 
           The sun has nearly set and it’s so cold they can barely 
           breathe. 

           They wear stolen clothes. But their disguises are not warm 
           enough for the brutal winter weather.

           Yapa looks to see an enormous ship is arriving.

                                 YAPA
                        What is the point of building 
                        something like that if it is only 
                        used for transporting slaves?

           Tenewa can’t answer that.

                                 TENEWA
                        What if they are already gone?

                                 YAPA
                        We are doing what we can.

                                 TENEWA
                        Do you not want to go back?

           A long beat. Of course he wants to go back.

                                 TENEWA (CONT'D)
                        This place is too cold.

           Yapa takes off his coat and offers it to her, but she refuses 
           it.

                                 TENEWA (CONT'D)
                        If you can stand this weather, I 
                        can also.

                                 YAPA
                        This is not a competition, you 
                        could die.

           Tenewa looks toward the horizon. The sun is setting and night 
           is coming on. 

                                 TENEWA
                        It is time to look at the ships.

           Tenewa puts it on her hat and her disguise is complete.

           EXT. PIERS, HUDSON RIVER - NIGHT

           Tenewa and Yapa walk beside the ships. They are looking for 
           one in particular, but there are so many.

           Then Tenewa stops, she’s spotted something. Yapa stops to 
           look as well. He compares the name of this ship to the poorly 
           written text on a piece of cloth -- THE SILVIA.
           This ship, though, is called -- THE SLOAN. 

                                 YAPA
                        This is it.

                                 TENEWA
                            (Pointing at the letters on 
                              the cloth)
                        No, this is different.

           Yapa compares the texts again and moves on, frustrated.

                                 YAPA
                        I have seen you looking at Naconi.

           A long beat.

                                 YAPA (CONT'D)
                        There is no shame in looking after 
                        a man. A woman can be both a 
                        warrior and a wife.

                                 TENEWA
                        I like you better when you are 
                        quiet.

           Yapa smiles. They both continue on their way. The snow 
           continues to slowly paint our heroes and the streets in cool 
           white.

           INT. ALLEY - NIGHT

           Naconi and Quan walk past the alley. They cover their bodies 
           with the stolen cloth. 

           Naconi moves to a trash can and looks inside.

                                 QUAN
                        I will die before eating something 
                        from there.

                                 NACONI
                        When was the last time you ate 
                        anything at all?

           Quan doesn’t answer, maybe he can’t even remember. Quan is 
           staring at Naconi who moves to the trash can.

                                 QUAN
                        Is this the place you dreamed of?

           Naconi turns to Quan.

                                 NACONI
                        One day we will die, but these 
                        buildings will live forever. 
                                 QUAN
                        A big cage is still a cage. White 
                        men have a great hunger for rotten 
                        places.

           A beat.

                                 QUAN (CONT'D)
                        Where were you planning to go when 
                        you left us?

                                 NACONI
                        I do not know.

                                 QUAN
                        What were you expecting to find?

                                 NACONI
                        I do not know!

                                 QUAN
                        You thought the white men were 
                        going to accept you? That they 
                        would give you a name? That they 
                        would treat you as an equal? White 
                        men are a terror.

                                 NACONI
                        Everyone is a terror to someone.

                                 QUAN
                        You are a terror to your own 
                        people.

           A beat.

                                 NACONI
                        Why did you not try to find the 
                        girl you were in love with?

           Quan looks at Naconi in shock.

                                 QUAN
                        What?

                                 NACONI
                        Tadan told me about her.

           A long beat. Quan tries to process this.

                                 NACONI (CONT'D)
                        If you care so much about your 
                        people, why did you abandon her?

                                 QUAN
                        Such talk will put a curse on you.
                                 NACONI
                        But I do not believe in curses. 
                        Were you afraid?

           Quan loses patience with Naconi --

                                 QUAN
                        They killed her in front of me. 
                        They did it because I tried to save 
                        her. I was young and scared, I 
                        accept that, but I did not abandon 
                        her.

                                 NACONI
                        I did not know that.

                                 QUAN
                        There are so many things you do not 
                        know, but you still talk as if you 
                        know the beginning and end of every 
                        story. 

           A beat.

                                 QUAN (CONT'D)
                        Tell me Naconi, do you know the end 
                        of this story? Are we going to find 
                        your sister before all these empty 
                        places fall apart?

           A beat.

           INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           Naconi lies on the mattress, trying to sleep. He spots Quan, 
           awake and staring out the window. He looks at Tenewa, she 
           can’t sleep either.

           Yapa is on the other side of the room smoking from his pipe.

           They are all falling apart.

           A thought forms in Naconi’s mind. A crazy thought...

           EXT. HARBOR, ROOFTOP - NIGHT

           Yapa watches the harbor. It’s so cold he can’t move.

           Quan is standing ten yards away from him. He stands on the 
           edge. His mind is somewhere far away, then he spots something 
           in the street --

           It’s a three legged dog, standing there like a statue. He 
           stays there for a long moment, when -- 
           Tenewa arrives.

                                 TENEWA
                        We want to show you something.

                                 YAPA
                        Did you find the ship?

                                 TENEWA
                        No. But come.

           Yapa doesn’t know what to do. He looks to Quan who is still 
           lost in his thoughts.

                                 TENEWA (CONT'D)
                            (To Quan)
                        Quan! Come, you will like this.

           No answer. 

                                 TENEWA (CONT'D)
                        Yapa?

           Yapa, hesitates, his eyes on Tenewa. He then walks towards 
           her and they head off, leaving Quan alone.

           Looking back at the street, the dog is gone.

           EXT. HARBOR ALLEY - LATER

           Tenewa walks with Yapa in silence. Yapa stops, frozen in 
           surprise by what he sees ahead of him --

           It’s Naconi. He has FOUR HORSES with him.

                                 NACONI
                        Where is Quan?

                                 TENEWA
                        There is something wrong with him.

                                 YAPA
                        What is this?

                                 NACONI
                        You will see.

           Naconi gives a horse to Yapa. Yapa doesn’t understand what’s 
           going on. 

                                 NACONI (CONT'D)
                        Wait here.

           Naconi takes one horse and leads it away.
                                 YAPA
                        What is going on?

           INT. HARBOR, CARGO BAY - MOMENTS LATER

           A hand hits a padlock with a metal rod repeatedly until the 
           padlock breaks away.

           WIDER -- Naconi is the one doing this. He removes the 
           shattered lock and opens the door.

           EXT. HARBOR, ALLEY - SIMULTANEOUSLY

           Tenewa looks behind some wooden crates and finds what she has 
           hidden there -- YAPA’S BOW AND ARROWS. Tenewa tosses them to 
           Yapa. He takes the weapon -- Still in the dark about what’s 
           going on.

           INT. HARBOR, CARGO BAY - SIMULTANEOUSLY

           Naconi stares at the open door. The inside is so dark that we 
           can’t see what’s happening there.

           Naconi hits the wall with the metal rod -- There’s a noise 
           growing louder -- Naconi hits the wall again.

           EXT. HARBOR / ALLEY - SIMULTANEOUSLY

           Yapa stares at his arrows. Looks up to the cargo bay, still 
           trying to understand. 

           Tenewa quickly mounts her horse.

           INT. HARBOR, CARGO BAY - SIMULTANEOUSLY

           Naconi hits the wall again -- This time he hears a huge noise 
           coming, something we have heard before, it’s the sound of --

           Hooves churning up the earth --

           EXT. HARBOR / ALLEY - SIMULTANEOUSLY

           -- Yapa gets it. He quickly mounts his horse. 

           He looks towards the open door and spots Naconi jumping out 
           of the way as -- A herd of buffalo charge the place in full 
           flight. 
           We already know that the sound of a buffalo stampede rumbles 
           across the sky, but this time there’s something happening 
           that we haven’t seen before -- 

           The herd is moving into New York City.

           Yapa can’t believe his eyes. Tenewa shares a look with him 
           and returns the smile.

           Naconi jumps on his horse and without saying a single word -- 

           The hunt begins. 

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY, STREETS - MOMENTS LATER

           It’s chaos as the huge animals barrel through the city. 

           For a moment -- Our heroes feel at home once again. Naconi, 
           Yapa and Tenewa have caught up with the buffalo. 

           They all ready their first arrows, but the streets are so 
           narrow that it’s really difficult to get the distance that 
           they need to shoot well.

           Naconi is about to fire an arrow, when a bull swipes his 
           horns at him.

           This time -- Naconi quickly dodges. He’s learned some things 
           since the last hunt.

           The herd reaches the end of the street and is forced to turn 
           right. 

           Naconi approaches Yapa.

                                 YAPA
                        We have to open a gap.

           Yapa aims and shoots at the back of a buffalo. The bull tacks 
           to its left, forcing another two buffaloes to break from the 
           herd. 

           This is the opportunity they’ve been waiting for... 

           Tenewa and Yapa form a wall and force the two buffaloes away 
           from the herd.

           The two buffaloes charge into an alley -- 

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY, ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           Naconi speeds his horse while aiming at the buffalo. 
                                 TENEWA
                        Get closer!

           Naconi moves closer to the buffalo. He aims and shoots --

           But misses. Naconi loads another arrow. He moves in and 
           shoots -- This time the buffalo falls. A perfect shot. His 
           first kill.

           Naconi can’t believe his eyes. But he doesn't stop. He speeds 
           up to help Yapa and Tenewa while they hunt the other buffalo.

           For the first time in his life, Naconi feels part of a team, 
           and he’s enjoying it. 

           INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           They’ve built a big fire inside. 

           Naconi, Yapa and Tenewa celebrate around the fire, feasting 
           on fresh meat. 

           It reminds us of their camp. Their tribe on The Great Plains. 
           This time Naconi laughs, enjoying the celebration. They all 
           know that they needed this.

           Tenewa is preparing the meat. Yapa and Naconi are dancing 
           around the fire.

           Naconi breaks away from the fire and looks around for Quan, 
           but he’s nowhere to be found. Naconi returns to the 
           celebration. It’s an amazing night for them.

           LATER

           Naconi lies on his mattress trying to fall asleep. He turns 
           and spots Tenewa -- She’s watching him from where she lies 
           her bed.

           They look at each other for a long moment. Tenewa opens her 
           blanket and Naconi can see her naked body beneath.

           Naconi doesn’t move. He’s considering what to do. Tenewa 
           covers herself again and turns away in frustration, giving 
           him her back.

           Naconi looks at her, confused, and then -- He gets to his 
           feet and goes to her. He climbs under her blanket and kisses 
           her neck. She turns to face him and --

           They kiss passionately.
           EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           The smoke from the fire spills out of the warehouse windows 
           and dissipates into the dark sky.

           It’s an amazing night in the center of the wild white world.

           EXT. HARBOR, ROOFTOP - NIGHT

           Yapa and Tenewa watch the harbor in silence for a while. 

                                 YAPA
                        I want to see my son grow up. 
                            (beat)
                        What is the point of having a son 
                        if you are not around to see him 
                        become a man?

           A long beat.

                                 YAPA (CONT'D)
                        I think it is time to go back.

           Tenewa moves to the edge, ignoring what Yapa said.

           She spots something in the distance -- A ship entering the 
           harbor.

                                 TENEWA
                        That is the third ship today.

                                 YAPA
                        Did you hear what I said?

           Of course she did, but --

                                 TENEWA
                        Let’s take a closer look.

           EXT. HARBOR, CARGO BAY - LATER

           Yapa and Tenewa sneak the ships, looking at each. 

           They see the new ship that they spotted from the roof of the 
           warehouse. They see its name --

           THE SILVIA

           An ocean steamer, embodying the highest level of naval 
           technology realized by mankind. 

           That is the one they’ve been waiting for!
                                 YAPA
                        This is it.

                                 TENEWA
                        This is it.

           There’s a deadly silence in the air. Yapa suddenly stops and 
           looks around. Tenewa does too.

                                 TENEWA (CONT'D)
                        There is something wrong.

           Yapa looks at Tenewa. He’s proud of her.

                                 YAPA
                        We are being watched.

           A long beat.

                                 YAPA (CONT'D)
                        Find a place to hide. Do not go 
                        back to the warehouse until you are 
                        sure no one is following you.

                                 TENEWA
                        What are you going to do?

           Yapa spots the shadow of a person moving quickly in the 
           darkness. Then another one. There’s obviously something going 
           on.

                                 YAPA
                        I will find my way out. There is no 
                        time. Go!

           Yapa and Tenewa part ways.

           Yapa moves fast without running. He crosses the cargo bay 
           then stops -- 

           He turns to check if he is being followed -- But sees 
           nothing. He looks left and right, then vanishes around a 
           corner. 

           EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Yapa is running through a crowd of pedestrians and trying not 
           to show his face.

           It’s very risky but there’s no other way. Then, he hears a 
           horse. He turns around and spots a couple of soldiers on 
           horseback moving towards him. 

           Now he is sure he’s being followed. They’ll be on him in a 
           few seconds. He turns down another street, but --
           Sees a SOLDIER there. Yapa picks up into a half-run, then 
           turns another corner, when --

           BANG! A bullet hits just inches away from him. He freezes and 
           turns to find he is surrounded by ARMED SOLDIERS.

           One of them goes to him and removes his coat, revealing the 
           Comanche he is.

           The soldiers move on Yapa.

           We see the silhouette of a person watching from his hiding 
           place in the shadows --

           IT’S TENEWA. She watches in shock as the soldiers take Yapa 
           away with them. She moves toward them, when she spots more 
           soldiers. She is forced to hide.

           INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           Naconi is asleep on the mattress. Tenewa enters the warehouse 
           and wakes Naconi.

           Naconi wakes up with a start.

                                 TENEWA
                        They took Yapa.

                                 NACONI
                        Who did?

                                 TENEWA
                        The soldiers.

           Tenewa realizes that Quan is already awake and watching them.

                                 TENEWA (CONT'D)
                        I followed them. They took him to a 
                        house. 
                            (pause)
                        There is more.

           Naconi stares at her. Waiting.

                                 TENEWA (CONT'D)
                        The ship has arrived.

                                 NACONI
                        The Silvia?

                                 TENEWA
                        Yes, but, they knew we were there.

                                 QUAN
                        Of course they did. 
           They turn to find Quan who is sitting on the ground in the 
           darkness.

                                 QUAN (CONT'D)
                        What did you think was going to 
                        happen when you freed all those 
                        buffaloes into the street? 

           A beat. Maybe he is right.

                                 TENEWA
                        If they know about us now, they 
                        will be waiting for us

                                 NACONI
                            (To Yapa)
                        Do you think Etenia is in this 
                        house?

                                 TENEWA
                        Yapa is in there, that is something 
                        I know for certain. What can we do 
                        now?
                            (to Naconi)
                        I rely on your wisdom.

                                 NACONI
                        My wisdom? I am just a kid.

                                 TENEWA
                        There are no kids in this room. I 
                        will do as you say.

           Naconi steps away, trying to think of what to do. He looks at 
           Quan, who stares back at him.

                                 QUAN
                            (To Naconi)
                        Have you surrendered already?

                                 NACONI
                        I will surrender when I am dead, 
                        but not before.

                                 TENEWA
                        Then we know what we have to do. 

           EXT. CAPTAIN FOSTER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           A two-story wooden house in Yorkville, built in the Federal 
           style. The house is being guarded by two soldiers. Everything 
           is covered in fresh snow.

           Naconi, Tenewa and Quan are watching Foster’s house from 
           their hiding place -- a building that’s under construction. 
           Quan raises his pipe, draws in, and exhales the smoke towards 
           the moon.

                                 QUAN
                        Mother, if it be your will, let 
                        these men bring Yapa back alive.

           Tenewa takes a puff from the pipe, then offers it to Naconi. 
           Naconi hesitates, but he too finally draws on the pipe. They 
           all wait for a long moment, and then --

                                 NACONI
                        We are of The People.

                                 QUAN AND TENEWA
                        We are of The People.

           Our heroes move silently from roof to roof until they reach 
           Foster’s house. They climb down to an open window and slowly 
           enter, one by one.

           We stay there for a long moment without knowing what’s going 
           on inside. 

           INT. CAPTAIN FOSTER’S HOUSE, STAIRS - NIGHT

           The place is quiet. The people inside must be asleep. Naconi, 
           Tenewa and Quan walk down the hallway and then part ways:

           Quan goes downstairs. Naconi breaks to the right and Tenewa 
           to the left. They make no noise as they walk.

           Slowly, we move though a hallway with many doors.

           Naconi opens a door quietly -- and finds an empty room. He 
           moves on towards another room -- and opens the door to find:

           INT. CAPTAIN FOSTER’S HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           -- A couple sleeping inside. Naconi slowly moves toward them, 
           when the SLEEPING MAN hears his footsteps and jumps out of 
           bed.

           Naconi immediately raises his bow and aims his arrow at the 
           man.

           It’s a man in his 40s. And his name: JACOB E. FOSTER. They 
           stare at each other in silence.

                                 CAPTAIN FOSTER
                            (In English)
                        So it’s true...
                                 NACONI
                            (In English)
                        Where is Yapa?

                                 CAPTAIN FOSTER
                            (In English)
                        ... The myth of the Comanches 
                        coming to the white world. 

                                 NACONI
                            (In English)
                        Where is he?

                                 CAPTAIN FOSTER
                            (In English)
                        How long have you been following 
                        me?

                                 NACONI
                            (In English)
                        Foster?

                                 CAPTAIN FOSTER
                            (In English)
                        Captain Foster to you.

                                 NACONI
                            (In English)
                        You have my sister too.

                                 CAPTAIN FOSTER
                            (In English)
                        She’s not your sister anymore, 
                        she’s mine. Her and your friend 
                        too.

           The woman lying in the bed wakes up and backs away, visibly 
           terrified by Naconi.

           Naconi draws his arrow back.

                                 NACONI
                            (In English)
                        Where are they?

                                 CAPTAIN FOSTER
                            (In English)
                        You think I’ll get on my knees and 
                        beg for my life? To a savage like 
                        you? I’m not afraid. Your weak 
                        arrows can’t kill me. I’ll cut off 
                        your head and hang it on my wall.

           Captain Foster takes a step toward Naconi. Naconi is now 
           slightly intimidated by Foster. 
           They hear a noise -- A door being opened. Naconi turns to 
           spot a little girl, CAPTAIN FOSTER’S YOUNG DAUGHTER (8), 
           coming in from the room next door.

                                 CAPTAIN FOSTER’S DAUGHTER
                        Father?

                                 CAPTAIN FOSTER
                            (To his daughter)
                        Go back to your room.

           She doesn’t move.

                                 CAPTAIN FOSTER (CONT'D)
                        Go back now.

           And then -- Two GUN SHOTS are fired downstairs. Naconi is 
           momentarily distracted by the sound. 

           Captain Foster takes advantage of this distraction and finds 
           the Colt Walker on his bedside table. 

           Naconi shoots the arrow, hitting Foster in his arm. Foster 
           returns fire before Naconi can take cover. 

           BANG! Foster misses. Naconi realizes he can’t win this fight. 
           He runs from the room as another of Foster’s bullets cracks 
           into the wall beside Naconi.

           Foster walks to the door with the arrow still stuck in his 
           arm. He fires after Naconi until the pistol is empty. Foster 
           returns to his bedside table for another cylinder of bullets.

           INT. CAPTAIN FOSTER’S HOUSE, BASEMENT - SIMULTANEOUSLY

           Tenewa is frozen in shock by what she sees in front of her:

           Yapa hanging by his neck. Dead. Badly beaten and covered in 
           blood. 

           Tenewa looks at Yapa, heartbroken, then moves quickly for 
           him. She raises his axe, cuts the rope and takes Yapa down.

           Then Quan enters. He spots Yapa’s dead body and can’t believe 
           it.

                                 QUAN
                        Get Naconi.

           Tenewa doesn’t move. 

                                 QUAN (CONT'D)
                        Get him now!

           Tenewa leaves immediately. Quan heaves Yapa’s body onto his 
           shoulder and moves toward the door when -- 
           A KNOCK -- Quan turns his head to spot another door -- A 
           LOCKED DOOR -- Another KNOCK --

                                 QUAN (CONT'D)
                            (Calling out)
                        Who is in there?

           And then -- Many people start knocking at the door and 
           calling for help.

           All of them speak in different native languages.

           Quan looks at it in shock. He leaves Yapa, rushes to the door 
           and tries to open it, but there’s a big lock. Quan hits the 
           door.

                                 QUAN (CONT'D)
                        Etenia?

           But there are so many people calling from inside that he 
           can’t distinguish a single voice or even a single language.

           Quan hits the lock, trying to open it, but it is useless. He 
           looks around for something to use to break the padlock, but 
           can’t find anything.

           Quan rushes to Yapa, grabs him and leaves the basement --

           INT. CAPTAIN FOSTER’S HOUSE, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Quan rushes into another room, looking desperately for 
           something he can use to break the lock.  

           He passes a dead soldier lying on the ground.

           INT. CAPTAIN FOSTER’S HOUSE, 2ND FLOOR - SIMULTANEOUSLY

           Naconi hides behind a wall as Captain Foster looks for him. 
           Naconi waits for a moment, and then -- he storms downstairs. 

           INT. CAPTAIN FOSTER’S HOUSE, FIRST FLOOR - SIMULTANEOUSLY

           Naconi arrives downstairs. Looks up to find Tenewa looking 
           back at him, when -- 

           BANG! A bullet hits Tenewa in the abdomen. 

           Naconi turns to see the soldier who fired the gun.

           In the blink of an eye, Naconi loads an arrow into his bow 
           and fires it through the soldier’s heart, killing him 
           instantly.
           They take cover and stay there in silence while Naconi tries 
           to think of a way to escape.

           The entire house is stone silent now.

           INT. CAPTAIN FOSTER’S HOUSE, BASEMENT - SIMULTANEOUSLY

           Quan grabs a metal jar, maybe he can break the lock with it. 
           He turns back towards the basement, when a soldier steps in 
           front of the door, blocking Quan’s way. 

           The soldier shoots at Quan, forcing him to find a place to 
           hide. The soldiers are getting closer.

           Quan realizes that he won’t be able to go back into the 
           basement prison. He decides to leave the basement behind. He 
           spots a pistol next to a dead soldier and takes it --

           INT. CAPTAIN FOSTER’S HOUSE, FIRST FLOOR - SIMULTANEOUSLY

           Naconi opens the front door and looks outside --

           There’s no one around. Quan runs through the house and stops 
           beside them in the doorway.

           Naconi and Tenewa spot Yapa’s dead body. Naconi can’t move, 
           he can’t even breathe. He stays there in shock, his guard 
           down. It’s as if time had stopped.

                                 QUAN
                            (To Naconi)
                        Take Tenewa with you. There are 
                        people locked in a room 
                        underground. Maybe Etenia is in 
                        there with them.

                                 TENEWA
                        We will not leave you.

                                 NACONI
                        We have to leave now.

                                 QUAN
                        We have to free them.

           BANG! A bullet hits Naconi in the back of his shoulder -- 

           He falls to the ground.

           Naconi is wounded but alive. The bullet only scratched his 
           skin. He drags himself to away and takes cover.

                                 NACONI
                            (to Quan)
                        We have to go.
           Quan turns and fires the gun at Captain Foster, forcing 
           Foster to take cover. 

           Naconi grabs Tenewa. He and Quan storm out of the house.

           EXT. CAPTAIN FOSTER’S HOUSE - SIMULTANEOUSLY

           -- Quan runs from the house with Yapa’s body on his back. But 
           Yapa is so heavy that Quan loses his footing and falls to the 
           ground. 

           Quan spots a couple of soldiers rushing towards Foster’s 
           house. Quan fires the gun at them, driving them back. Naconi 
           covers Quan.

           Then they spots more soldiers coming. Captain Foster charges 
           out of the house.

           Quan thinks about what to do. He’ll be surrounded in matter 
           of seconds. He leaves Yapa’s body and rushes into an alley.

           INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - LATER

           Naconi and Tenewa enter. They are completely devastated.

           Naconi helps Tenewa down onto the mattress. Naconi tries to 
           control Tenewa’s bleeding. The wound on her abdomen looks 
           really bad.

           A moment later, Quan enters.

                                 NACONI
                            (To Quan)
                        I need your help!

                                 QUAN
                        We have to go back now.

                                 NACONI
                            (To Quan)
                        Tenewa needs your help, Quan!

                                 QUAN
                        We are going to lose her again.

                                 NACONI
                        There is nothing we can do right 
                        now, but we can save her.

                                 QUAN
                        You cannot save her. You are like 
                        an evil spirit that destroys 
                        everything you touch.

           Quan draws the pistol and points it at Naconi.
                                 NACONI
                        I thought you did not like white 
                        men’s guns.

                                 QUAN
                        You do not deserve an arrow of 
                        mine.

                                 TENEWA
                        Quan, stop.

           Quan looks down at Tenewa.

                                 NACONI
                        We failed.

                                 QUAN
                        No. You failed your people. Your 
                        sister is trapped in that house.

                                 NACONI
                        Did you see her?

           A beat. Quan doesn’t answer.

                                 NACONI (CONT'D)
                        Did you actually hear her voice? We 
                        are chasing a ghost that will turn 
                        us into ghosts ourselves.

                                 QUAN
                        We will not give up. It is either 
                        victory or death.

                                 NACONI
                        How many more people have to die 
                        for this?

                                 QUAN
                        All that are necessary. 

                                 NACONI
                        You cannot go back to that house.

                                 QUAN
                        No. I will go to the ship instead.

                                 NACONI
                        Do you have any idea where that 
                        ship is going?

                                 QUAN
                        I will follow it to the eternal 
                        home beyond the sun.

           Naconi realizes Quan has lost his mind. This is a waste of 
           time.
                                 NACONI
                            (To Tenewa)
                        Let’s go home together.

                                 QUAN
                        You do not have a home. You are not 
                        welcome with my people. If I find 
                        you there, I will kill you.

           Naconi doesn’t move.

                                 QUAN (CONT'D)
                        Just because we share blood does 
                        not mean I will not spill yours. Do 
                        not go back there. 

           Quan looks at Tenewa. He stays there for a quiet moment, and 
           then -- Quan runs off.

           Naconi remains there, like an statue condemned to stillness 
           for all eternity.

           LATER

           Tenewa is lying on the ground. Naconi is next to her, very 
           worried.

           She looks at him but doesn’t seem to recognize him. Naconi 
           spots the wound on her abdomen, it looks really bad.

                                 TENEWA
                        Father?

                                 NACONI
                        No.  It is me, Naconi.

           She doesn’t answer. She just lowers her head again. She 
           doesn’t have the strength.

           Naconi looks at her in shock --

           She’s dying. He takes something from his bag -- it’s the 
           pipe. He tries to start a fire, tries and tries, but he’s so 
           anxious he can’t get it to work.

           He tries again and again, but can’t do it.

                                 TENEWA
                        I want to die in our home, not 
                        stuck behind these walls.

           Naconi looks at her, he’s clearly heartbroken.

                                 NACONI
                        You are not going to die, Tenewa.
           Tenewa coughs. Naconi is horrified to see blood coming from 
           her mouth.

                                 TENEWA
                        Where is the moon mother? 

           Naconi tries hard not to cry.

                                 TENEWA (CONT'D)
                        I cannot see it.

                                 NACONI
                        She is there, outside.

                                 TENEWA
                        Where?

           Naconi doesn’t know what to say. He is so devastated.

                                 TENEWA (CONT'D)
                        Where, Naconi?

           Then Naconi gets to his feet and steps away. 

           We stay with Tenewa, lying on the floor, delirious.

           Then Naconi comes back carrying a rope. He goes to Tenewa and 
           wraps the rope around her back. With that we:

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE, BACKSTAIRS - NIGHT

           Naconi climbs up. Tenewa is holding onto his back, her body 
           tied to his.

           It’s as hard as it sounds. It appears nearly impossible for 
           Naconi to climb all the way up with Tenewa on his back.

           Tenewa spots the moon.

                                 TENEWA
                        I can see the moon.

                                 NACONI
                        We are almost there.

           Naconi continues his incredible task. Every step up is a 
           nightmare, but this kid will not give up.

           And against all odds -- he makes it to the top.
           EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE, ROOFTOP - NIGHT

           Naconi climbs onto the rooftop with Tenewa. He unties her 
           quickly.

           She looks at the moon in silence and smiles.

                                 TENEWA
                        I feel that I am with my people 
                        now.

                                 NACONI
                        You are with them. We are all 
                        looking at the same moon mother 
                        together.

           Naconi looks at her for a while. He then takes the collar 
           Yapa gave him and ties it around her neck.

                                 NACONI (CONT'D)
                        I share my Puha with you. I know 
                        you wanted to have it.

           She looks at him for a while and smiles. He tries not to cry, 
           but he can’t stop himself.

           She then lies down in his lap to rest. Naconi stays there, 
           looking at the moon. It is magnificent. It’s clear why they 
           think it is a goddess.

           Naconi looks down at Tenewa to discover that she’s not 
           breathing.

           A deadly silence. He waits for a long, long moment, then --

           He opens the bag and finds Tadan’s red paint. He starts to 
           paint her face with it.

           LATER

           Tenewa is wrapped in cloth, burning atop a funeral pyre.

           Naconi watches. He can’t hide his severe sadness. He stays 
           there, in silence, trying to think of what to do.

           He doesn’t move for a long time, he doesn’t even have the 
           strength to try.  Then he spots something --

           A BIRD flying overhead.

           Naconi stares at the bird as it crosses the sky.  He follows 
           it with his eyes until it disappears behind the clouds. 
           EXT. HARBOR - NIGHT

           THE SILVIA is enormous and imposing.  It appears deserted 
           except for A COUPLE OF SAILORS visibly standing guard.

           Naconi climbs up a rope that hangs down from the stern of the 
           ship. He reaches the top and boards the vessel unnoticed.

           EXT. THE SILVIA - NIGHT

           Naconi moves slowly across the forecastle looking for a place 
           to hide. He knows he needs to pick a spot where no one will 
           ever find him.

           Naconi reaches a staircase to the main entry point --

           INT. THE SILVIA - CONTINUOUS

           Naconi walks down a hallway when he hears voices. He slips 
           into a room and hides until A COUPLE OF SAILORS pass.

           Naconi continues down the hallway and finds another 
           staircase. He takes it downstairs --

           INT. THE SILVIA, ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Naconi searches the engine room for a hiding place, until he 
           gets to --

           INT. THE SILVIA, THE BILGE - CONTINUOUS

           The lowest level of the ship’s hull, beneath the waterline.

           It’s dark and far away from any populated areas on the ship. 
           To Naconi, it looks like a good place to hide. 

           Naconi just sits down on the floor and waits. He touches the 
           wound on the shoulder and looks at his hand --

           BLOOD. We see Naconi’s wound for the first time. The bullet 
           didn’t hit him head on, it only skimmed his shoulder, leaving 
           a deep slash in his skin. The wound is painful but not 
           severe...

           ... And there’s nothing he can do about it.

           DAYS HAVE PASSED

           Naconi lies on the ground, asleep. He is awoken by the sound 
           of people. He jumps to his feet and goes to a wall to find 
           cover. 
           A group of sailors walk around the bilge. One of them enters 
           the area where Naconi has been hiding. 

           Naconi waits in agony as the sailors pass by without seeing 
           him. Then he hears a whistle, a big whistle and -- 

           The ships begins to move. 

           Naconi looks around with fear in his eyes. His future is 
           uncertain and he can’t hide how scared he is at that moment.

           And then water begins to come inside the bilge. Naconi steps 
           back from the dark water, realizing it wasn’t a good idea to 
           hide there after all. Still, he has nowhere else to go.

           He looks on in shock as the room slowly fills with water.  
           Fortunately, as the water enters, a pump activates and pushes 
           it out. The room will never completely fill with water. But 
           it’s not going to be a nice trip.

           EXT. THE SILVIA - DAY

           Naconi, hidden, watches in panic as the ship pulls away from 
           port.

           EXT. THE SILVIA, DECK - DAY

           The sky is very blue and the sun is bright. The Silvia, 
           looking majestic, sales away from port and moves into the 
           open sea. 

           INT. THE SILVIA, THE BILGE - NIGHT

           Naconi is freezing. He looks at the water inside the room. It 
           is dirty and horrible. 

           EXT. THE SILVIA, DECK - NIGHT

           The Silvia cuts through the waves in the vast night. It’s 
           late and very cold. There are no sailors around. 

           Naconi walks slowly across the deck. He’s weak and about to 
           collapse. He’s gone days without water or food. He finds a 
           bucket with water inside but it’s stagnant and smells 
           horrible

           Naconi finds a piece of sailing canvas that has collected a 
           puddle of rainwater. He smells it -- it seems fine.  He 
           drinks the water and it’s so good! Then he hears someone 
           coming. He hides, but realizes it’s only A LITTLE GIRL.

           More accurately -- It’s CAPTAIN FOSTER’S YOUNG DAUGHTER. We 
           recognize her from the shootout at Foster’s house.
           Then Naconi spots Captain Foster walking with her. 

                                 CAPTAIN FOSTER
                        I told you it was cold outside.

                                 CAPTAIN FOSTER’S DAUGHTER
                        I just wanted to see the stars, 
                        father.

           Foster and his daughter leave the forecastle. Naconi slips 
           out of his hiding place, when he spots something in front of 
           him --

           A BIRD is perched on the railing. Maybe this is the same bird 
           he saw flying above the Hudson River...

           Naconi can’t believe his eyes. He stares at it, as if it were 
           a ghost. What is a bird doing here?

           The bird alights and flies high up towards the mast.

           Naconi follows the bird with his eyes. Then he goes after it. 
           He spots the bird perched on the crow's nest. Naconi looks 
           around to make sure nobody is watching. 

           Naconi contemplates what he’s about to do, and then -- He 
           starts to climb. When he is halfway up, his foot slips --

           He’s about to fall, but he manages to hang on. He is very 
           weak and nearly loses his grip. He looks down -- It would be 
           a deadly fall. He tightens his grip and then -- Naconi 
           continues his climb --

           EXT. THE SILVIA - CROW'S NEST - NIGHT

           Naconi makes it up the main mast. He sees the bird perched 
           there, as still as a statue, it’s eyes looking away. It 
           doesn’t appear to be scared of Naconi. 

           Naconi is so weak, he has to lie down on the floor of the 
           crow’s nest. He doesn’t know what in the hell he is doing up 
           there. 

           The bird is still there -- Looking at the horizon...

           Naconi stares at the bird for a while. He processes this and 
           then -- Naconi reaches inside his bag. He finds -- Tadan’s 
           pipe. Naconi looks up at the bird again, and it flies away.

           Naconi stays there, thinking. Then he looks at the pipe again 
           and puts it down on the floor. He finds Tadan’s FIRE DRILL 
           inside the bag and starts working with it to build a fire. He 
           tries and tries but can’t get it to light. 

           He tries again and again until the fire takes. He smiles to 
           himself and then lights the pipe. 
           He gets to his feet, looking for the bird, but he can’t see 
           it anymore. Was it only his imagination? 

           But he knows what to do now -- He takes a puff of smoke and 
           blows it into the air. He looks up as the smoke drifts toward 
           stars. 

           There’s newfound determination in his eyes. He touches his 
           wound again and looks at his hand -- 

           Blood. He then takes a puff and blows it onto his back, 
           aiming the smoke at his wound. 

           We watch Naconi. He is high up on the main mast, surrounded 
           by an amazing array of stars, performing a ritual that he 
           never thought he would do in his life:

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THE SILVIA, THE BILGE - DAY

           Naconi is sleeping on the floor. The dirty water splashes his 
           face and wakes him up. He sits up and waits.

           Then he remembers something. He touches the wound on his back 
           and looks at it -- NO BLOOD anymore. He’s still weak, but 
           he’s recovering.

           EXT. NORTH ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT 

           The Silvia sailing across glorious, open waters.

           EXT. THE SILVIA, DECK - NIGHT

           Looking for water, Naconi crosses the deck towards the sail 
           he drank from before.  There’s some water there and he 
           drinks. He starts to leave, when something comes to mind.

           He returns to the sail and decides to hide there and watch.

           Naconi waits and waits. He starts to hear people coming and 
           he runs off.

           ANOTHER NIGHT

           Naconi is hidden, waiting beside the canvas -- Nothing 
           happens.

           INT. THE SILVIA, THE BILGE - DAY

           Naconi stands in the dark water that’s collected in the 
           bilge. He is trying to catch a fish caught inside the ship. 
           He shoots it with an arrow and starts eating it immediately. 
           He’s starving.

           EXT. THE SILVIA, DECK - NIGHT

           Naconi is hidden, watching the puddle of water in the sail. 

           When he spots something... A person moving in the shadows 
           toward the sail canvas. 

           The person is Quan. Once there, Quan quickly fills his 
           leather canteen with some water and rushes off.

           Naconi quietly follows Quan to the ship's lifeboats. Each 
           rowboat is stored on the deck, nested one atop the other in a 
           stack. 

           Quan climbs inside one of the ship’s boats and Naconi follows 
           him in.

           INT. THE SILVIA, LIFEBOATS - CONTINUOUS

           Naconi spots Quan climbing into a hatch. 

           INT. THE SILVIA, LIFEBOATS, CABIN - CONTINUOUS

           Naconi enters to find Quan siting on the ground. He looks up 
           at Naconi, deeply confused. 

                                 QUAN
                        Where is Tenewa?

           A long beat.

                                 NACONI
                        She died.

           Quan looks at him for a while, then he lowers his head.  He 
           knew this moment was coming.

                                 NACONI (CONT'D)
                        I know it was all my fault.

           A long silence, and then --

                                 QUAN
                        I found her.

           Naconi looks at Quan, even more confused.

                                 QUAN (CONT'D)
                        I found Etenia.
           Naconi can’t believe what he’s hearing.

                                 QUAN (CONT'D)
                        They have her in a cage. She did 
                        not recognize me.

                                 NACONI
                        Where is she?

                                 QUAN
                            (Looking at his hands)
                        These hands have won many wars, but 
                        they are different now. Will Father 
                        Sun not recognize me anymore, 
                        either? What have they done to me? 

           Quan stares at Naconi, waiting for an answer, but --

                                 NACONI
                        Where is she?

           INT. THE SILVIA, CARGO BAY - NIGHT

           Naconi finds a locked grate in the floor. He looks through 
           the grate and finds dozens of natives inside. They all lie on 
           the floor, all lacking the strength to stand.

           Naconi looks for Etenia but can’t see her.

                                 NACONI
                        Etenia...

           Nothing. Some of them wake up and look at him.

                                 NACONI (CONT'D)
                        Etenia...

           Someone steps forward from out of the dark --

           It’s Etenia. She is staring at him in amazement.

           Naconi looks at her in shock. He can’t believe she’s standing 
           there. He’s been waiting for this moment for a long time. 
           They stay still, staring at each other in silence. Neither 
           says a single word. Just then, he hears a noise --

           Someone is coming. But he doesn’t want to leave her alone 
           again. He doesn’t know what to do. More people are coming. 
           Now he hears people running. There’s something strange 
           happening. 

                                 NACONI (CONT'D)
                        I will be back. I promise I will.
           He has no other option. He runs off, leaving Etenia behind. 
           She stares at the grate where she last saw Naconi, 
           motionless.

           INT. THE SILVIA, LIFEBOATS, CABIN - NIGHT

           Naconi enters the cabin to find Quan very agitated. There’s 
           something strange happening and Naconi knows it.

                                 QUAN
                        I know how we can force them to 
                        give Etenia back. Then she will 
                        remember who we are.

           Naconi doesn’t understand. Then Quan reaches for a piece of 
           cloth that’s covering something he’s been hiding. He pulls 
           the cloth back to expose --

           CAPTAIN FOSTER’S YOUNG DAUGHTER is there, gaged. She is so 
           scared, she can’t even move.

           The image chills Naconi and the color drains from his face.

                                 QUAN (CONT'D)
                        We will trade for Etenia.

                                 NACONI
                        What have you done? They are going 
                        to kill us all, Quan.

                                 QUAN
                        We will not let them. 

                                 NACONI
                        Have you seen where we are? There 
                        is nowhere left to run.

                                 QUAN
                        We will not run away. We are the 
                        strongest people in the world. They 
                        are nothing compared to us.

           Naconi, in shock, realizes that there’s no point in arguing 
           with Quan.

           They hear yelling all over the ship. The crew is looking for 
           the little girl.

           Naconi moves toward the girl, but Quan stops him.

                                 NACONI
                        We have to release her.

                                 QUAN
                        I will not let you do that.
           Naconi pushes Quan away and begins to untie the girl. Quan 
           grabs Naconi by the neck and pushes him back against the 
           wall. 

           But this time, Naconi hits back. Naconi continues to untie 
           the little girl.

                                 NACONI
                            (In English)
                        We are not bad.

           Quan hits Naconi with the back of his axe, sending Naconi to 
           the ground.

                                 QUAN
                        Do not make me kill you.

           Naconi stares up at Quan. He knows Quan is capable of killing 
           him, but even still --

           Naconi moves for the girl again. Quan grabs Naconi. Naconi 
           kicks Quan really hard and the axe falls to the floor.

           Naconi takes the axe and raises it.

                                 QUAN (CONT'D)
                        You are too much of a coward to do 
                        it.

           Naconi thinks about what to do.

                                 QUAN (CONT'D)
                        You are a weak fool.

           Naconi drives the axe, with all his might, into -- The floor 
           beside Quan’s head.

                                 NACONI
                        I will not let you drag me into 
                        your misery. If you want to die, do 
                        it yourself.

           Naconi kneels beside the girl again, leaving Quan lying on 
           the floor, devastated, when --

           A blast of light fills the room.

           Naconi looks up and sees a group of sailors climbing down 
           into the room.  Before Naconi can react, one of the soldiers 
           kicks him in the head and jumps on top of him.

           In matter of seconds, Quan and Naconi are captured by the 
           sailors.
           EXT. THE SILVIA, DECK - DAY

           Naconi and Quan are on their knees, tied up. A group of 
           sailors is watching them.

           Someone approaches -- It’s CAPTAIN FOSTER, full of rage. He 
           is holding Quan’s bow and arrows.

           Naconi sees the expression on Foster’s face and realizes this 
           is the end. 

                                 QUAN
                            (To Naconi)
                        You are a great warrior.

           Naconi looks at Quan in disbelief, he can’t believe his ears.

                                 QUAN (CONT'D)
                        You are...

                                 CAPTAIN FOSTER
                            (In English)
                        English! 

           The Captain loads an arrow into the bow and aims at Quan.

                                 QUAN
                            (To Naconi)
                        Take care of my dogs.

           Naconi looks at Quan in panic.  Quan turns his face to the 
           sun.

                                 QUAN (CONT'D)
                        Father Sun, have pity on me. 

           Then the Captain releases the arrow and -- Fires at Quan, 
           hitting him in the chest. 

           Naconi tries to move towards Quan, but the Sailors grab him 
           and pull him back.

                                 NACONI
                        Quan!

           Quan is still alive.

                                 QUAN
                        May I ride in the valley ten 
                        thousand fold longer and wider than 
                        home.

           The Captain pulls the arrow from Quan’s body, then steps back 
           and aims at him again.

           Quan raises his head and stares at the Captain.
                                 QUAN (CONT'D)
                        I am of The People.

           The Captain fires. The arrow rips into Quan’s chest once 
           again.

           Quan can’t speak. But he’s still breathing.

           The Captain moves towards Quan again and pulls the arrow free 
           of his body again.

           Naconi can’t look. He can’t even breathe.

           The Captain shoots Quan again. This time, Quan falls dead on 
           the deck.

                                 CAPTAIN FOSTER
                            (In English)
                        In my house, you speak English.

           The Captain pulls the arrow from Quan’s body once again, 
           loads it into the bow and aims it at Naconi.

           He waits and waits. Naconi speaks in Comanche language -- 

                                 NACONI
                        I am not afraid.

           The Captain remains there, waiting. He didn’t understand what 
           Naconi said, but still --

           He lowers the bow.

                                 CAPTAIN FOSTER
                            (In English)
                        Those sounds you made mean nothing 
                        anymore, but my words will stay in 
                        your mind for the rest of your 
                        miserable life. 
                            (beat)
                        Doesn’t that tell you who won this 
                        fight?

           The sailors grab Quan’s lifeless body to throw him overboard.  
           Naconi lurches forward, trying to stop them, but it’s 
           useless. 

                                 CAPTAIN FOSTER (CONT'D)
                            (In English)
                        A man can’t change the shape of the 
                        sea.

           Quan’s body vanishes beneath the waves.
           INT. THE SILVIA, CARGO BAY - DAY

           The sailors put Naconi in chains. His hands are bolted to the 
           wall and his ankles to the ground. The gauge is tight and he 
           can’t even sit down.

           They are inside the room where the other natives are kept. 
           All look on in shock at what’s happening to Naconi.

           The sailors then leave the room and lock the grate behind 
           them.

           Naconi can’t move. His entire body is shivering. He spots 
           someone approaching him -- It’s Etenia.

           She nears him and touches his skin, as if checking that this 
           isn’t a dream. When she realizes that her brother is actually 
           there, she takes him in her arms.

                                 NACONI
                        I am sorry. I am sorry. I am sorry.

           EXT. RIVER THAMES / PORT OF LONDON - DAY

           The Silvia sails into the port of London. The majestic city 
           skyline towers beyond.

           EXT. PORT OF LONDON - NIGHT

           A group of soldiers receive Captain Foster. They escort him 
           and his family off the Silvia. 

           A WELL DRESSED MAN joins Captain Foster.

                                 WELL DRESSED MAN
                        How was the trip, Captain?

                                 CAPTAIN FOSTER
                        It was a nightmare. I’ll never set 
                        foot in that savage land again.

           The group of natives steps out of the ship in chains.

                                 SOLDIER
                            (To the Natives)
                        Move, move!

           It looks like an illegal operation. The soldiers keep an eye 
           out, making sure no police are watching.

                                 WELL DRESSED MAN
                            (Looking at the Natives)
                        I see you brought company. A little 
                        risky these days.
                                 CAPTAIN FOSTER
                        In two weeks we’ll take them to 
                        Portugal where there is still a 
                        healthy slave market for these 
                        savages.

           They load all the natives into a large carriage.

           INT. BARN, CAPTAIN FOSTER LONDON’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Naconi lies on the ground looking at Etenia, who sleeps next 
           to him. The other Natives are sleeping around them.

           Everyone there is wounded in some way. So much suffering.  
           Naconi lies there while infinite sadness devours his soul.

           Naconi can’t believe that he’s found her, but is also 
           heartbroken that he couldn’t save her. He remains there, 
           contemplating her for a long time.

           Then, he hears something. He turns to see the barn door is 
           being slowly opened.

           He sits up, watching the door and trying to understand what’s 
           going on. 

           Then he sees it -- It’s Captain Foster’s Daughter. She looks 
           around the barn, trying to find something or someone -- 

           When she spots Naconi. She waits there for a moment, and then 
           she leaves the barn.

           Leaving the door open behind her. Naconi looks at the door, 
           considering this. Is it a trap? He keeps his eyes on the open 
           door as he processes this.

           Finally, he can’t wait anymore. He turns to Etenia and wakes 
           her up.

                                 NACONI
                            (To Etenia)
                        We have to go.

           She doesn’t understand. Naconi gets to his feet and pulls her 
           up. He moves quickly towards the door and leaves the barn 
           without looking back.

           We stay there as the other natives start to realize what is 
           going on. One of them gets to his feet, goes to the door and 
           leaves.  The others decide to stay, too scared to risk it.

           EXT. CAPTAIN FOSTER LONDON’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Naconi leaves the barn with Etenia. He spots Captain Foster’s 
           daughter entering her house.
           Then he spots a couple of arrows stuck in a tree. Foster has 
           been practicing. Naconi grabs one of the arrows. 

           He looks at the house again.

                                 NACONI
                        He is in there.

           Naconi looks at Etenia severely.

                                 NACONI (CONT'D)
                        Go hide. I have something to do.

           Naconi starts toward the house when Etenia grabs his arm. 
           Naconi stops and looks at her.

           She doesn’t say a word, but her grip is very tight and she 
           won’t let go.

           Naconi looks from her hand to her eyes, he appears painfully 
           conflicted.

                                 NACONI (CONT'D)
                        He must suffer for what he has 
                        done.

           She doesn’t let go. He isn’t quite sure about what to do 
           next. Naconi can see in her face that she’s scared to lose 
           him again. 

           Naconi nods vaguely, and then -- He takes her hand and they 
           walk off, leaving Captain Foster’s house behind.

           But we stay there, watching the house. We know something is 
           going to happen --- And then, it does --

           The front door opens and Captain Foster comes out carrying a 
           shotgun. He sees that the door to the barn is open. He rushes 
           to it and locks it again.

           He looks back at the house to find his daughter standing in 
           the doorway with her mother.

                                 CAPTAIN FOSTER
                        You will pay for this.

           He then turns and goes into the forest to track Naconi and 
           Etenia down.

           EXT. FOREST - MOMENTS LATER

           Naconi and Etenia move slowly between the trees. They stop 
           suddenly and look around. Naconi still holds the arrow he 
           took from the tree.

           Then, they hear a footsteps behind them.
           Naconi quickly grabs Etenia and carries her behind a tree. He 
           hugs her, shielding her with his body when --

           BANG! A bullet blasts the tree.

           They stay there, immobile. They hear Captain Foster load the 
           shotgun and move toward them, then -- 

           BANG! Another bullet hits the tree. They hear his footsteps 
           and the sound of him loading the shotgun again. 

           Captain is getting closer.

           Naconi looks at the arrow, considering what do to. They hear 
           him draw nearer.

                                 NACONI
                        Do not move.

           BANG! Another bullet. 

           Captain Foster begins to load his gun again. But this time, 
           Naconi grabs Etenia and pushes her tightly against the tree. 

           Naconi turns and charges Captain Foster.

           We stay with Etenia, she tries not to move. She hears 
           fighting, then the sound of them falling to the ground...

           BANG! A shotgun blast. Then more fighting --

           BANG! Another bullet is fired. She hears someone and then --

           Silence. 

           Etenia stays there, paralyzed with fear. She hears footsteps 
           approaching slowly. She doesn’t want to look, but she knows 
           she has to. 

           She peeks to find --

           Captain Foster, covered in blood. He lunges for her, trying 
           to grab her.

           She steps back, terrified. She looks around desperately for 
           Naconi, when -- Naconi appears and stabs Foster with the 
           arrow one more time.

           Foster falls to the ground, dead. Naconi remains standing 
           behind him, still holding the arrow. Them he goes to his 
           sister. He is not hurt. 

           He hugs her, then he takes her hand. He picks up the shotgun 
           and they run off together, leaving Captain Foster’s dead body 
           behind.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.
           INT. OCEAN STEAMER, THE BILGE - DAY

           Etenia lies on the floor alone, asleep.

           After a moment, Naconi enters carrying a canteen. Foster’s 
           shotgun is tied to his back. He wakes Etenia and gives her 
           some water. She drinks it.

                                 NACONI
                        Do not drink all of it. We will 
                        need it.

           She stops drinking. Naconi sits next to her.

                                 NACONI (CONT'D)
                        Why do you not speak anymore?

           She doesn’t answer. He thinks of what to say, and then --

                                 NACONI (CONT'D)
                        Do you want to hear a story?

           She doesn’t react.

                                 NACONI (CONT'D)
                        A long time ago, there was a badly 
                        wounded man walking across a 
                        prairie like the one where our home 
                        is. 

           Etenia looks at him, suddenly interested.

                                 NACONI (CONT'D)
                        The man walked and walked, but he 
                        was so weak that he fell into a 
                        wallow and died. There were many 
                        buffalo on the prairie that day 
                        watching the man. 

                                 ETENIA
                        Why were they watching him?

           A beat. Naconi smiles as he hears her voice. 

                                 NACONI
                        Because... Because he was a 
                        stranger to them. Then, the 
                        leader... The buffalo bull who was 
                        the leader, told the others they 
                        needed to protect the wallow.

           EXT. GREAT PLAINS - DAY

           A vast, virgin American landscape. As colorful and tranquil 
           as we have ever seen. It reflects so much calm.
                                 NACONI (O.S.)
                        So they made a Puha to revive the 
                        man and it gave him the power to 
                        heal bullet wounds. He returned to 
                        his people and shared the buffalo 
                        Puha with all the others. And they 
                        told this story to their sons, and 
                        those sons passed it on to their 
                        own children, and now you know it. 
                        Now you are part of us all.

           A HORSE approach at a walk, moving slowly across the prairie. 

           The rider is Naconi. Etenia is siting on the mount behind 
           him. The ride quietly for a long time. Then Naconi stops. 

                                 ETENIA
                        I like how this place smells.

                                 NACONI
                        I like how it smells too.

           The wind blows, we can almost smell the fragrance of the 
           prairie.

                                 ETENIA
                        Are we far from home?

           He takes the shotgun and throws it onto the ground. 

                                 NACONI
                        We are already home.

           They ride in silence toward the vast horizon as the sun 
           shines across the great plain.

           They cross the vast prairie into a beautiful sunset which 
           seems to say goodbye.

           A place where nature and divinity become one.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

                                 - THE END -
