         “These rural homesteads have always filled me with a certain 
         horror. Look at the lonely houses behind their fences. Think of 
         the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness going on in 
         such places, year in and year out, with none the wiser..."

           EXT. CUL-DE-SAC - NIGHT

           Nightfall on a quiet suburban cul-de-sac. The street is 
           lined with Craftsman homes, picket fences, lush trees.

           We drift through darkness. Watchful. Silent. Toward one 
           particular cozy little home... and a first-floor window. 

           It's always a first-floor window.

           The Bowens live here. And The Bowens, well, they're about to 
           become famous. They just don't know it yet.  

           INT. SAMANTHA BOWEN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Tight on a framed photo: 2 girls, both age 15, in Halloween 
           costumes. A shy redhead in a modest GHOSTBUSTERS jumpsuit, 
           and a brash punk in a "SEXY STAY PUFT MARSHMALLOW MAN" get-
           up. Best friends, thick as thieves, smiles frozen in time. 
           The picture gets TAKEN OFF THE WALL as we REVEAL--

           SAMANTHA BOWEN

           The redhead, older now: 18, smart, wallflowery. Bubble-wraps 
           the pic, in the middle of packing her room into suitcases. 
           PURDUE COLLEGE ORIENTATION PAPERS on her desk.

           As she packs, our focus drifts to the WINDOW. That window.

           It's OPEN just a bit... cool breeze ripples curtains...

           ...and then -- for just a second -- something MOVES PAST.

                                 ELAINE (O.S.)
                        Sam honey?

           Samantha looks back as her mother ELAINE BOWEN (40s, tiger 
           mom) appears in the doorway, holding up couple of WINTER 
           COATS that resemble Reagan-era sleeping bags.

                                 ELAINE
                        Which one do you like?

                                 SAMANTHA
                         ("neither")
                        ...the one on the left?

                                 ELAINE
                        Pack 'em both. Winter in Indiana 
                        is a nightmare. 

           Elaine hands the bulky coats off to Samantha and exits. 
           Samantha starts stuffing them into a box as...

           ...our focus drifts BACK TO THE WINDOW...

           ...and we see something that Samantha misses entirely.
           A SET OF HANDS REACHING IN...

           ...PUSHING the window up, silently, inch by inch, when...

           CREAK. Samantha FREEZES. Piano-string tension...

                                 SAMANTHA
                         (doesn't turn around)
                        Nice try, dummy. 

           She turns to the window, forces it open, revealing...

           LILA WAKEFIELD -- the other girl in the photo. 18. Habitual 
           line-stepper, envelope-pusher, shit-stirrer, the insouciant 
           devil perched on Samantha's shoulder. You might notice she 
           and Sam have matching VINE TATTOOS on their wrists, though 
           Samantha's barely peeks out of her long sleeved shirt. 

                                 LILA
                        Ok ok, so I know your mom said 
                        you can't go out tonight--

                                 SAMANTHA
                         (whispers)
                        --will y'keep it down?--

                                 LILA
                        --and you're getting up at 6 for 
                        the big drive and blah-blah-blah--

                                 SAMANTHA
                        --she is literally gonna bite 
                        your face off if she sees you, 
                        she's already pissed you talked 
                        me into the tattoo--

                                 LILA
                        It'll grow on her! Or she'll, 
                        y'know, hate it forever. Either 
                        way, not your problem. Because 
                        you are a grown-ass lady who can 
                        do what she feels like.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Oh, is that what I am--

                                 LILA
                        Yes. And what you feel like doing 
                        is sneaking out with me. 'Cause I 
                        got you a going-away present.
                         (off her look)
                        C'mon, it's your last night in 
                        town. Tell her you gotta return a 
                        library book or some shit, I'm 
                        not taking no for an answer--
                                 SAMANTHA
                         (folds her arms)
                        No.

                                 LILA
                        Did you not hear what I just--

                                 SAMANTHA
                         (trying not to laugh)
                        No.

                                 LILA
                        Yes. Yes. Yes.

           Samantha's resolve is crumbling, same as it always does in 
           the face of Lila's rambunctious spirit. MUSIC TAKES OVER--

           EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           --as VROOM! Lila's hand-me-down Crown Victoria BLASTS down 
           the lonely highway, radio cranked, Lila and Sam singing with 
           the music. Young, free, at home in each other's company.

           In a better world, their story would end here.

           EXT. PIKE'S POINT - NIGHT

           Looking down from above, we find the two girls on a picnic 
           blanket atop a LOOKOUT POINT, Crown Vic parked down the hill 
           by the road 100 feet behind. In the distance, their hometown 
           is a spark in the vast darkness.

                                 LILA (PRE-LAP)
                        Open sesame.

           WITH LILA AND SAMANTHA

           Lila hands Sam a LITTLE SQUARE GIFT BOX from her purse.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Why do I feel like this is going 
                        to be a giant nug of weed? 

                                 LILA
                        What would history suggest?

           Samantha opens the box, and takes out a pair of RETRO-HIP 
           BANGLE EARRINGS. She lifts them, touched by the gesture.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        You. You are amazing...
                         (puts them on)
                        How do they look?
                                 LILA
                        Way better than those Michelin 
                        Man winter coats your mom packed 
                        for you. Here--

           Lila hands her Gift Number 2: a larger box with a bow. Sam 
           opens it, revealing A CAKE featuring a grumpy stick figure 
           indignantly pointing towards the door and the letters GTFO.

                                 LILA
                         (lifts her Solo cup of 
                          champagne)
                        Cheers, dummy.

           They toast Solo cups. And sit there, sipping their bubbly 
           and eating the GTFO cake, enjoying the quiet intimacy...

                                 LILA
                        ...thanks for coming out. I have 
                        no idea when we're gonna have a 
                        night like this again. 
                         (off her look)
                        You'll be off at college... 
                        meeting interesting people and 
                        doing cool shit... and then you 
                        and me will start texting less 
                        and less... then, eventually...

           Samantha's stung by the implication.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        That's not fair--

                                 LILA
                        --it's not you; it's just the 
                        natural order of things. Changing 
                        of the seasons, y'know?...

                                 SAMANTHA
                        You're making it sound like that 
                        movie where Joaquin Phoenix falls 
                        in love with his phone and I'm 
                        the phone.

                                 LILA
                        I'm not wrong.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        You're 100% wrong. Here's what's 
                        gonna happen...
                         (refills her own cup)
                        I'm gonna go to school...
                         (fills Lila's cup)
                        ...and you're gonna go to New 
                        York and discover awesome bands 
                        that no one's ever heard of--
                                 LILA
                         (snorts)
                        Yeah, right--

                                 SAMANTHA
                        --and next thing you know, you'll 
                        be running your very own badass 
                        little record label... 
                         (raises her cup)
                        ...then we'll meet back here over 
                        the holidays and freak out about 
                        how amazing we've both become. 
                        That's the plan, sound good?

           It does sound good to Lila. Better than good. But before she 
           can say anything...

           ...a phone RINGS.

                                 LILA
                        Shit. Probably your mom.

                                 SAMANTHA
                         (frowns)
                        It's not my phone.

           Lila holds up her phone.

                                 LILA
                        Not mine either.

           RING goes the phantom phone.

           Coming from somewhere nearby.

           They glance at each other. Then Lila looks around....

           ...and sees a GLOW from the weeds a few yards away. She 
           starts to get up--

           --Sam grabs her arm. Bad vibes suddenly in the air.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Leave it. Let's just go--

                                 LILA
                        It's right over there--

           Lila's already heading off to the find the phone. Samantha 
           sighs and follows after her...

           EXT. PIKE'S POINT, IN THE WEEDS - CONTINUOUS

           Lila moves through the weeds, ringing getting LOUDER--

           --she digs around and finds it: A SMARTPHONE -- some cheap, 
           off-brand burner phone WITH A SMILING EMOJI on the case.
           The number on the screen: unknown.

           RING goes the phone, before--

                                 LILA
                         (answers it)
                        Hello?

           For a second, there's nothing on the other end.

           Just silence. Maybe the faintest trace of a breath.

           Lila's about to hang up when--

                                 MAN'S VOICE (PHONE)
                        Hi there.

           A MAN'S VOICE comes through. Confident. Relaxed. Maybe even 
           a little stoned.

                                 MAN'S VOICE (PHONE)
                        I'm pretty sure you have my 
                        phone.

                                 LILA
                        Pretty sure you're right. You 
                        left it up at Pike's Point.

                                 MAN'S VOICE (PHONE)
                        Wow. All the way up there? Out in 
                        the middle of nowhere?

                                 LILA
                        Yeah, I found the poor little 
                        thing shivering under a tree.

                                 MAN'S VOICE (PHONE)
                        That's funny. You're very funny.

                                 LILA
                         ("okay, weird")
                        ...thank you?

                                 MAN'S VOICE (PHONE)
                        No, thank you. You are my 
                        personal hero. My savior. A 
                        veritable saint.

           He's wandering a little. Lila grins at Samantha. She puts it 
           on speaker so Samantha can hear.

                                 LILA
                        Ok, professional curiosity: how 
                        high are you?

                                 MAN'S VOICE (PHONE)
                        I'm actually as lucid as I've 
                        ever been in my life right now.
                             LILA
                     Not even a little?

                             MAN'S VOICE (PHONE)
                     I have to be. It takes immense 
                     concentration to do what I do.

            Lila snorts back a laugh, Samantha nudges her to be quiet.

                             LILA
                     And what do you do?

                             MAN'S VOICE (PHONE)
                        (cold statement of fact)
                     You're both about to find out.

            CLICK! The line goes dead. The girls pause, freaked...

                             SAMANTHA
                        (quiet)
                     ...how'd he know there's two of 
                     us?

            They look at each other, blood running icy. What was fun 
            moments before has gone dangerous and creepy in a blink. 
            Samantha grabs the phone, CHUCKS IT AWAY--

                             SAMANTHA
                     Let's go. Now. 

                             LILA
                        (yells to the woods)
                     Hey asshole! You out there?!

            She peers into the darkness. No answer. 

            Samantha's outta here. She grabs Lila's purse, fishes out 
            the CAR KEYS as she makes for the Crown Vic parked 100 feet 
            down the hill, calling over her shoulder as she goes--

                             SAMANTHA
                     C'mon, I got your keys, let's get 
                     the hell outta here--

                             LILA
                        (yells into the woods)
                     Hey fucker, y'got something to 
                     say??

            No response from the dark woods.

            Except... did something move in there?

            Lila's eyes narrow. 

            What the hell did she just see?
           Chill running down her spine, she turns to run after 
           Samantha, picking up speed as--

           100 FEET AWAY, AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL

           --Samantha beats a path toward the shadowy turn-off where 
           Lila's car is parked, yelling up the hill to her--

                                 SAMANTHA
                        C'MON!

           She turns to the car 10 feet ahead, her trembling thumb 
           TRIGGERS THE KEY FOB--

           --the Crown Vic BEEPS and its headlights FLASH, illuminating 
           the blackness for just a second--

           --and in that moment, Samantha's fear-blown pupils see HIM.

           A DARK FIGURE. WEARING A YELLOW SMILEY EMOJI MASK.

           Blocking her path to the car, moving straight toward her. 
           Holding a GNARLED TREE BRANCH like a nightstick.

           Up the hill, Lila sees it--

           --the breath catches in her throat as--

           CRACK! Smiler takes Samantha down with a HARD SWING OF THE 
           BRANCH. Then grabs her by her hair and drags the shrieking 
           girl into the car, ripping the keys out of her hand as--

                                 LILA
                        SAM!

           Lila SPRINTS FULL TILT, panicked breath sawing in her lungs, 
           brain motormouthing no-no-no-no-NO as--

           SMILER

           --pins Samantha to the passenger seat as he climbs behind 
           the wheel, slamming the door shut as--

           LILA

           --rushes hell-for-leather down the hill towards the car--

           VROOM! The Crown Vic roars to life.

           CLICK! Its high-beams turn on, BLINDING HER--

           Then, with a guttural ENGINE GROWL, the car LURCHES AHEAD.

           STRAIGHT TOWARD HER. Lila turns to DIVE OUT OF THE WAY, but-- 

           CRUNCH! The CROWN VIC PLOWS STRAIGHT INTO HER--

           --she SMASHES INTO THE WINDSHIELD, CRACKS IT, BOUNCES OVER--
           --TUMBLES to the ground behind it with a sickening CRUNCH.

           The car SCREECHES TO A HALT a few feet in front of her. 
           Smoke billowing from the tailpipe as the engine RUMBLES.

           Is it gonna reverse back and run her over??

           Lila lies there, trying to move. Trying to Get Up. She 
           barely manages to lift up to her elbows to see--

           --Samantha, bleeding, battered, trying to crawl into the 
           back seat, SMASHING at the back window. SCREAMING.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        LILAAA--

           A BLACK GLOVED HAND GRABS HOLD of Samantha and she's SUCKED 
           AWAY from the window, out of view, as the CAR FISHTAILS out 
           of the turn-off and onto the road. Leaving Lila for dead.

           We find ourselves DRIFTING up and away, wraith-like... Lila 
           receding in our vision as we float to the lookout point...

           ...and down to the PHONE dropped on the ground. The phone 
           with the SMILING EMOJI CASE.

           We DESCEND into the grinning mouth, until...

           EVERYTHING GOES PITCH BLACK.

           And in the blackness, we hear...

                                 WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Close your eyes... and think 
                        about what you want from your 
                        life.

           INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - MORNING

           FADE IN on Lila, eyes shut. We linger on her subtle scars 
           from the accident, her face drawn and pale, like some piece 
           of her soul's been sucked out. She's harder. Tougher. Wounds 
           masked by layers of gallows humor and nihilistic swagger.

                                TWO YEARS LATER

           Across from her is MAUREEN COLGAN, 40s, her court-ordered 
           therapist. She's used to seeing all sorts of malcontents; 
           Lila won't be the first or last to try to bullshit her. 

                                 LILA
                        I want peace. And... tranquility. 
                        And I wanna get my, y'know, bad 
                        habits under control. And just...  
                        stay on the straight and narrow. 
                                 MAUREEN
                        And get your court paperwork 
                        signed as quickly as possible.

                                 LILA
                        I didn't say that.
                         (digs out COURT-ORDERED 
                          THERAPY paperwork)
                        But I mean, if you're offering--

                                 MAUREEN
                        I'm not.  

                                 LILA
                        No rush.

                                 MAUREEN
                        Tell me something: if what you 
                        really want from your life is 
                        "peace" and "tranquility"... why 
                        did you break Brett O'Shea's jaw?

           A flash of something. Anger on Lila's face. Quickly buried.

                                 LILA
                        I didn't. It got dislocated when 
                        he fell off his bar stool--

                                 MAUREEN
                        --after you punched him.

                                 LILA
                        Which he 100% deserved. 

                                 MAUREEN
                        Ok, what he said was 
                        reprehensible. But I didn't ask 
                        why you wanted to punch him. I 
                        asked why you did.

           That throws Lila a little.

                                 LILA
                        ...come again?

                                 MAUREEN
                        Brett's an asshole. We know that. 
                        He's an asshole to 20 people a 
                        day. But out of those 20, you're 
                        the one who took a swing. Why?

                                 LILA
                        It just happened. But I promise I 
                        don't see myself punching Brett, 
                        or anyone else, ever again--
                                 MAUREEN
                        --what about breaking and 
                        entering into Mr. Mapes' house?

                                 LILA
                        You make it sound like I was 
                        wearing a ski-mask. 
                         (when joke doesn't land)
                        Gimme a break, my doc put me on 
                        Percoset, I had a little too much 
                        to drink, and I went into the 
                        wrong house. And Mapes didn't 
                        seem to mind.

                                 MAUREEN
                        His wife did. And you're avoiding 
                        the questions.

                                 LILA
                        Which are?

                                 MAUREEN
                        Why did you punch Brett?

                                 LILA
                        Because he said the guy who 
                        kidnapped Samantha was "lucky to 
                        snatch such a hot piece of ass."

                                 MAUREEN
                        Again, not why did he deserve it. 
                        Why did you hit him?

                                 LILA
                         (getting riled up)
                        What do you want from me--

                                 MAUREEN
                        Answers. Why'd you hit Brett? 
                        Why'd you WANT to hit Brett? What 
                        are you really looking for in 
                        your life?

                                 LILA
                        Revenge.

           She didn't mean to say that last part, it just popped out. 
           And she wants to shove it back down, like it never existed.

                                 MAUREEN
                        You're never gonna get that. Will 
                        Halforth committed suicide in 
                        jail. The guy who did this to 
                        Samantha is dead. And if you 
                        can't get it from him, who's 
                        left? Who are you really trying 
                        to get revenge on?
           Lila's silent. Jaw clenched. Stonewalling against the answer 
           she can't bring herself to face. And we SMASH TO:  

           EXT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY

           CLICK! Lila lights a smoke before she's even out the door.  
           Looks out at the main street of...

                             COTTAGE GROVE, OREGON

           Pop 3,192. Squint and it's still 1950. Today's Halloween 
           morning, everything's a riot of fall colors. 

           Lila gazes at all the happy costumes and decor poking fun at 
           a dark, scary world. But it's not fun to her, because she 
           knows what happens when the world pokes back. 

           She makes for the sidewalk... and suddenly pauses. Eyes on 
           an APPROACHING CAR. On the PASSENGER...

           ...who has long red hair...

           SAMANTHA. Staring back at her. 

           Then Lila blinks... 

           ...and it's just some other girl. The car drives past. Lila 
           shakes her head. Gotta stop doing that. And we CUT TO:

           EXT. COTTAGE GROVE DRUG STORE - DAY

           A small town five-and-dime, decked out for Halloween. The 
           windows are filled with costumes, and a window-banner 
           indicates "Trick or Treat Yourself!"

           INSIDE

           Lila works the front counter, wearing one of those lame red 
           vests and a button that says "How can I assist you today?" 
           She looks completely Over It already.

           The store's costume aisle is mostly sold out, last minute 
           shoppers desperately searching for digs among the dregs on 
           the Halloween aisle. Quick shots of her day:

           A MOTHER holds up a Ninja Turtles costume.

                                 MOTHER
                        If I could just exchange it, 
                        y'know, for another one...

                                 LILA
                         (takes it, sniffs it)
                        Did someone pee in this?
                                 MOTHER
                        I think it came that way.

           Lila stares at her -- sure it did. CUT TO:

           A BRATTY TWEEN WHINES:

                                 BRATTY TWEEN
                        There's nothing here. Do you have 
                        anything sexy, like a sexy 
                        witch's costume? Or a sexy cat 
                        outfit?

                                 LILA
                        How about a sexy skeleton mask? 
                        Or a sexy zombie face?

           Lila lifts the 2 not-sexy masks. The tween glares. CUT TO:

           AN ATTRACTIVE WIFE IN A COP OUTFIT:

                                 WIFE IN COP OUTFIT
                         (quiet, embarrassed)
                        ...ok, so this outfit came with 
                        handcuffs? And the key's kind of 
                        not working? And my husband would 
                        very much like to take them off?

                                 LILA
                        I got ya. Watch and learn...

           Lila takes a set of cuffs from an accessory bin, works the 
           stem of a pen into the lock and -- Click! -- it pops open.

                                 WIFE IN COP OUTFIT
                         (excited, hurries off)

           She hears SNICKERS. Turns to see some YOUNG MEN laughing at 
           her. Ringleader's BRETT O'SHEA. Yes, that Brett O'Shea. He 
           sets down a 30-rack of cheap beer on the counter, smirking.

                          assist you?" button)
                        I don’t feel like I’ve been 
                        assisted. Maybe I should talk to 
                        your manager. Maybe I should get 
                        you fired.

                                 LILA
                        Maybe you should go fuck yourself-

                                 BRETT
                        Keep talking. Just remember I'm 
                        in college and you're working the 
                        register in some shithole store. 
                         (tosses $25 at her)
                        Keep the change.

           Brett takes the beer, exits. She stares daggers at his back.

           INT. COTTAGE GROVE DRUG STORE, BACK ROOM - AFTERNOON

           WHUMPH! Lila loads boxes of OVERSTOCK COSTUMES into a cart, 
           working alongside a couple other EMPLOYEES and her manager 
           ZACH (late-20s, party animal), mid-speech...

                                 ZACH
                        ...alright, we'll load out the 
                        last of the Halloween shit and 
                        drop it at storage in the AM. Not 
                        too early, 'cause tonight's gonna 
                        be the rager to end all ragers...

           As Zach rambles on about the party he's throwing, Lila 
           pushes her cart out through the back of the store--

           INTO THE REAR PARKING LOT 

           --and out towards her car. And strangely enough...

           ...it's the same Crown Vic that she was driving the night 
           Samantha was kidnapped. Windshield still cracked. 

           A psychologically healthy person wouldn't drive this thing 
           if you paid them.

           She opens her trunk, the box tilts and spills monster masks 
           to the ground. She bends to grab them. STOPS COLD. Because 
           in the pile, grinning up at her...

           ...is A SMILEY EMOJI MASK. Out of place, almost as if 
           someone snuck it in there just for her. 

           The hairs on the back of her neck rise...
           BANG! The back door OPENS and Lila WHIPS AROUND to see Zach 
           wheeling out overstock carts with the other employees--

                                 ZACH
                        --makin' a MASSIVE vat of Green 
                        Zombie Juice with, like, actual 
                        glowstick fluid in it--
                         (sees her)
                        Yo Lila, you swinging by tonight?

                                 LILA
                        Sorry, can't.

                                 ZACH
                        C'mon, it's like stumbling-
                        distance from your house!

                                 LILA
                        I'm watching my niece and nephew, 
                        gotta keep it G-rated.

                                 ZACH
                        Children ruin everything.

           She tosses her store-keys to Zach, then gets in her car...

                                 ZACH
                         (re: the Crown Vic)
                        Hey, uh... isn't that thing like 
                        evidence or whatever?

                                 LILA
                        Was. Cops recovered it, dusted 
                        it, found jack shit, so...
                         (slaps the peeling roof)
                        ...this beauty's all mine again. 

                                 ZACH
                        Ever think about trading it in?  
                        Must feel sorta icky rolling 
                        around in a... crime scene.

           Lila looks at him. She does feel "icky" in this thing, and 
           that's the point: it's her way of punishing herself. 

                                 LILA
                        Why would I trade it? It's mine.

                                 ZACH
                        Y'should at least get that 
                        windshield fixed.

                                 LILA
                        I'll think about it. 

           THUNK -- she closes the door, and the conversation. CHIRP! 
           Gets a text from someone named BARRY: Don't forget dinner.
           INT. GROCERY STORE - AFTERNOON

           Lila picks up dinner supplies at the grocery store. Rolls up 
           to the butcher's section, where in the back room, A BIG MAN 
           with a doughy face AUTOPSIES A HUNK OF COW, expertly SLICING 
           it into cuts. This is DEVIN THE BUTCHER.

                                 LILA
                        Hey Devin.

                                 DEVIN
                        Right wit'cha.

           SLICE. SLICE. SLICE. He walks over. Tosses steaks into the 
           display. Wipes the blood onto his STAINED APRON.

                                 LILA
                        Pound of hamburger?

                                 DEVIN
                        Chuck or round?

                                 LILA
                        What's the difference?

           He points with the knife, "fileting" her with his gestures.

                                 DEVIN
                        Chuck's here. Round's the butt 
                        down here. Chuck's got more fat, 
                        but that's where all the flavor 
                        is. 

                                 LILA
                        Poor cow died without ever 
                        knowing how delicious it was.

                                 DEVIN
                        Cows. Plural. Mix a bunch 
                        together when you grind 'em. Most 
                        people don't know they're eating 
                        a whole family at once. 

           Her look -- Jesus, dude. He winks, wraps some hamburger up 
           for her and she turns to walk it over to her cart...

           ...but as she approaches, she pauses. Her CARTON OF EGGS HAS 
           BEEN SMASHED. Yellow goo drips through the cart like pus.  

           Lila looks around... and catches a glimpse of a HAGGARD 
           WOMAN eyeing her from down the aisle. We recognize her...

           It's ELAINE BOWEN. Samantha's mom. Looking decades older 
           than we last saw her. Sleep-starved face. Disturbing glint 
           in her eyes. A loaded beat, then...

           ...Elaine storms out, leaving behind her grocery cart full 
           of HALLOWEEN CANDY BAGS. Off Lila, rattled...
           CUT TO A TRASH CAN BY THE BATHROOM ENTRANCE

           SPLAT! Lila dumps her smashed carton of eggs in the trash.

                                 NICK (O.S.)
                        Well, that's 12 less eggs getting 
                        thrown at someone's house 
                        tonight.

           She looks to see a uniformed DEPUTY approaching -- NICK 
           FOLSOM, mid-20s, getting a headstart on a dad-bod. Put-upon 
           wiseass, the butt of most of his own jokes. Lila's been 
           nursing a bit of crush on him since way back when.

                                 LILA
                        Count your blessings, huh Nick?

                                 NICK
                        I do count them. I have three. 
                        3.5 on a good day. And most of 
                        the time I can't remember what 
                        they are. 

                                 LILA
                         (sees his handbasket 
                          full of RED BULL)
                        Ninety-nine problems but lack of 
                        caffeine ain't one. 

                                 NICK
                        Long night ahead. Not sayin' that 
                        Halloween in this town is a total 
                        shit-show, it's just that there 
                        are so many people who need 
                        arresting.

                                 LILA
                         (re: the eggs)
                        Can y'start with lady who did 
                        that?

                                 NICK
                        I'll plant an egg on her, say she 
                        pulled first.

           Lila laughs. First time she's done that all day. 

                                 NICK
                        ...you hanging in there? 

                                 LILA
                        There are days where I feel like 
                        I could kill several nuns for 
                        some Percocet, but other than 
                        that I'm peachy. 

                                 NICK
                        Atta girl.
                                 LILA
                        Say hi to your mom for me?

                         (nods, a painful 
                          subject)
                        Sure thing.

           As they part ways, Nick calls after her...

                                 NICK
                        Oh, in case you forget? Your 
                        house is at the END of the cul-de-
                        sac--

                                 LILA
                         (laughing)
                        You prick. You. Prick.

                                 NICK
                        --in case you get confused and 
                        break into Mr. Mapes' house again-

           They're both laughing now as we CUT TO:

           EXT. LILA'S STREET - EVENING

           As the sun descends over Cottage Grove, Lila pilots her 
           Crown Vic through her neighborhood, onto...

           PARKVIEW DRIVE

           ...the peaceful slice of Americana she grew up on. The cage 
           she can't bring herself to leave. Drives into her CUL-DE-
           SAC, passing a dozen or so houses, watching the neighbors 
           coming home from work, or out doing their Halloween prep...

           --There's the PARTY HOUSE, a frat without a college, home to 
           kids who never left town. Zach and some guys crack beers as 
           a shirtless dude digs a waist-deep hole for a fire pit.

           --A HAUNTED HOUSE. Demons and monsters adorn a maze of black 
           plastic leading into the backyard. Decorating it are 40-ish 
           local dentist JIM PERKINS and his wife KIM -- an 
           unsettlingly cheerful couple who are way too into Halloween. 

           --A RUN-DOWN HOUSE. Weed-choked lawn. A DOG barks somewhere 
           in the backyard. You can't see through the windows because 
           they're blocked by STACKED BOXES. A hoarder lives here.

           --Lila pulls into her driveway, next to A TOW-TRUCK, with a 
           BARRY'S AUTO SERVICES logo on the side. About to climb out, 
           she hears a HAMMERING coming from across the street...

           ...where Elaine Bowen stands at a phone pole with a staple 
           gun. Over a faded, weathered MISSING POSTER, she hangs a 
           fresh one: SAMANTHA'S SMILING YEARBOOK PIC. 
           A reward & phone number at the bottom. CLICK-CLACK! She 
           staples the fresh missing poster in place, then makes for 
           her tidy Tudor home. 

           Lila waits until Elaine's door shuts before getting out of 
           the car and bee-lining for...

           INT. LILA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           ...her home: well-worn and cozy, with a few hints of an 
           overprotective dad (i.e. the RING CAMERA system set up 
           around the place.) As Lila enters, we hear COMMOTION...

           ...and 2 KIDS FLY DOWN THE STAIRS. TROY (8, a tad ADHD, very 
           into Transformers) & MEGAN (4, loves crocodiles and 
           princesses.) Troy chases Megan with a toy robot. 

                                 LILA
                        Monsters!

           They MAUL LILA WITH HUGS, two little Godzillas attacking.

                        been smoking again.

           The kids stop, glare at Lila -- so disappointed.

                        your lying noses? Put these in 
                        the kitchen--

           She hands the grocery bags to the kids, heads off into...
           THE LAUNDRY ROOM, where her older brother BARRY (30), clad 
           in t-shirt & boxers, yanks clothes from the dryer. Permanent 
           5-o'clock shadow, considered to be a lovable grouch by just 
           about everyone (except the wife who recently divorced him.)

                        One, it's not even your house--

                                 BARRY
                        Is until Mom and Dad get off  
                        sabbatical.

                                 LILA
                        That the new term for "driving 
                        around the country in an RV 
                        having freaky old-people sex?"

                                 BARRY
                        You are literally the grossest 
                        person I know. 

                                 LILA
                        At least I'm wearing pants.

           Barry rolls his eyes as he pulls on his freshly-dried TOW 
           TRUCK DRIVER'S UNIFORM, then huffs off into--

                                 BARRY 
                        Alright, you two...

           --THE KITCHEN, where the kids put away groceries with zero 
           regard to where refrigerated items are supposed to go.

                                 BARRY
                        --gimme a hug, dad's heading out. 

                                 MEGAN
                        For how long?

                                 BARRY
                        Back before you know it. 
                        Tonight's gonna be good for us, 
                        Halloween's like Christmas for 
                        tow truck drivers.

                                 TROY
                        What's that mean?
                                 BARRY
                        May you never find out.

           He hugs the kids. Then takes Lila aside, talking quiet...

                                 BARRY
                        Call me if you guys need 
                        anything. If I don't pick up, 
                        leave a message. Don't just hang 
                        up like you normally do. 

                                 LILA
                         (salutes)
                        Yes sir.

                                 BARRY
                        Troy starts getting a reaction--

                                 LILA
                         (lifts an INHALER)
                        Copy that.

                                 BARRY
                        And don't mess with my speakers.

                                 LILA
                        Wouldn't dream of it.

           As Barry heads for the door, we hear CCR's "BAD MOON RISING" 
           starting to blast from...

           INT. LILA'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           ...Barry's SOUND SYSTEM (a Sonos knock-off with speakers in 
           every room of the house.) Lila uses an app on her phone to 
           CRANK 'EM UP TO 11 IN MULTIPLE ROOMS.

           LIVING ROOM: Raucous dance party with Lila and the kids, 
           before the song takes us into--

           KITCHEN: where Lila fries up "Halloween Burgers" (patties 
           with Jack-O-Lantern faces cut in them) for Troy & Megan, as-

           THE BATHROOM: Lila does Megan's scary scary costume makeup 
           (she's a hybrid Princess-Alligator.)

           BEDROOM: Lila helps scatterbrained Troy locate his costume 
           in his INSANELY MESSY ROOM. And as he triumphantly FINDS HIS 
           OPTIMUS PRIME MASK, the chorus of the song kicks in--

           EXT. LILA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           BAM! The front door SWINGS WIDE, as Lila and a FULLY 
           COSTUMED TROY AND MEGAN exit the house, out into...

           THE NEIGHBORHOOD HALLOWEEN FESTIVITIES
           ...the street alive with TRICK-OR-TREATERS romping from door 
           to door. 8TH GRADE HOOLIGANS cutting loose. 20-SOMETHINGS 
           pile into cars and jet off to parties. Everyone raised on 
           Amblin dreamed their Halloween would be like this. 

                                 LILA
                        Where do you guys wanna--

                                 MEGAN
                        THERE!

           Megan pulls their linked hands across the cul-de-sac toward--

           THE PERKINS' HAUNTED HOUSE

           --a long line of TRICK-OR-TREATERS waiting to get into the  
           spookshow, serenaded by CANNED SCREAMS from cheap speakers 
           all over the black-tarp maze leading into the backyard. 
           Megan drags Lila and Troy towards the line, but Lila eyes it 
           dubiously (this thing is too scary for young kids.) 

                                 LILA
                        ...line's kinda long here. Let's 
                        go get some candy, okay?

           Lila leads them away from the Haunted House and--

           QUICK SHOTS: The kids hit doorbells. Doors open. Candy gets 
           shoveled into bags. Rinse and repeat. Then they're by--

           THE FOLSOM HOUSE

           --where there's a bowl of candy with a sign reading "TAKE 
           ONE PLEASE." As the kids ransack the bowl, Lila glances 
           through the front windows around the door at...

           NICK FOLSOM

           ...double-timing between his police radio and trying to feed 
           dinner to a catatonic old woman in a wheelchair: CYNTHIA 
           FOLSOM, his mother. 

           As he coaxes her into eating, Lila watches him through the 
           window, caught by the sweetness of the scene. Then she 
           realizes the kids are heading toward--

           THE RUN DOWN "HOARDER" HOUSE

           --the windows dark, but the PORCH LIGHT is on. Upstairs, 
           just for a second, Lila spots a HULKING SILHOUETTE lumbering 
           past the window -- KOVITCH. We'll meet him later. 

                                 LILA
                         (steers them away)
                        ...yeah, we're skipping that 
                        place.
                                 MEGAN
                        Why?

                                 TROY
                         (whispers, spooking 
                          Megan)
                        A hoarder lives there.

                                 LILA
                         (tries to cut him off)
                        Troy--

                                 MEGAN
                        What's a hoarder?

                                 TROY
                        His house is like a MAZE OF 
                        TRASHBAGS piled ten feet high! 

                                 MEGAN
                        Gross!

                                 LILA
                         (still trying)
                        Okay, that's enou--

                                 TROY
                        --and he's got an army of hungry 
                        RATS in his attic!

                                 MEGAN
                        Eww!

                                 LILA
                        ENOUGH, okay?
                         (to Megan)
                        Despite what this weirdo tells 
                        you, a hoarder is someone who 
                        just... holds onto too much 
                        stuff.

                                 MEGAN
                        Why don't they throw it away?

                                 LILA
                        ...they don't know how to. 

           Lila can relate. Troy grabs Megan's hand and they rush to 
           the next house. Lila lets them run ahead, because it's...

           ELAINE BOWEN'S HOME

           ...Lila hangs back on the shadowy sidewalk. Troy and Megan 
           romp up to the door to collect their candy from Elaine. She 
           looks out toward Lila, who avoids her gaze, as--

           WE CUT TO THE OTHER HOUSES IN THE CUL-DE-SAC
           --THE PARTY HOUSE: where tipsy 20-somethings TAKE SELFIES 
           with Lila, Troy and Megan as they hand out candy.

           --DEVIN THE BUTCHER'S HOUSE: Devin's in a cow costume. His 
           wife sports a "SEXY PIG" get-up with a snout and tail. 

           --PRINCIPAL MAPES' HOUSE: where the kids collect their 
           treats, and a lascivious Mr. Mapes leaves Lila with:

                                 MR. MAPES
                        Barbara's out of town. If you 
                        feel like breaking in here again-

           BAM! Lila shuts the door in his face. She turns to depart 
           with the kids--

           --and STOPS. Sees TROY -- hunched in the walkway, WHEEZING: 

                                 TROY
                        ...hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhuuuhhh... 
                        huuuuuuuuuhh...

           His short, panicked breaths get LOUDER, like he's trying to 
           suck oxygen through a straw. Asthma attack. Lila searches 
           her pockets, realizes she left the inhaler at home-

                                 LILA
                        Shit--

           INT. LILA'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           BOOM! The door flies open, Lila CARRIES TROY in, making for-

           THE ASTHMA INHALER & CHAMBER ON THE KITCHEN COUNTER

           FSSH! Lila puts the chamber over his mouth, and -- FSSSSHT! 
           Gives him a hit of Albuterol. Nothing. 

           FSHHHT! She hits it again. Nothing. But she waits, finger on 
           the trigger when---

           His breathing SLOWS. Almost imperceptibly. Then his body 
           relaxes slightly. Color returns to his face. 

                                 LILA
                         (removing chamber)
                        There you go... that better?

           He gives a nod, then... 

                                 TROY
                        ...can I eat my candy now?

           Lila almost laughs as we--

           CUT TO THE LIVING ROOM
           Candy wrappers scattered across the coffee table. TV plays a 
           black-and-white horror movie (with an alien making the same 
           sounds as Troy's asthma attack.) Pan over to the couch...

           ...where Lila lounges with Megan & Troy, the kids slowly 
           dozing off beside her, crashing from adrenaline and sugar.

           Troy's candy-sack open before them. Lila reaches out and 
           steals a Reeses out of the bag. 

           Eats it with her eyes on the TV. Reaches in for another...

           ...as on the TV, the old movie's score WHINES WITH DREAD...

           ...she pulls out A STRANGE SMILING CANDY. 

           Not a normal brand either, some 80's knock-off called SWEET 
           SMILES. Slogan: "BEHIND EVERY SMILE IS SOMETHING SWEET!" The 
           grinning logo looks almost like the Smiler mask.

           A chill runs through Lila...

           Then she notices THE WRAPPER'S LOOSE. Like someone's taken  
           it off and rewrapped it. SOMETHING PURPLE ON IT. 

           She UNFOLDS it. Finds a MESSAGE WRITTEN ON THE OTHER SIDE. 

           CHILDISH, FEMININE HANDWRITING. PANICKED PURPLE CRAYON SCRAWL.

                                 I'VE BEEN KIDNAPPED
                              GOING TO KILL ME 

           Lila's face: "Is this a joke?" 

           Then: "that's a pretty fucked up joke"...

           She dumps the bag -- everything else is normal -- Snickers, 
           M&Ms, Skittles, etc. 

           Dumps out Megan's bag next, searches through it. Seeing only 
           normal Halloween treats.

           Eyes the note again, the jagged KINDERGARTEN HANDWRITING...

                                 TROY
                        What's that?

           Troy's watching. Lila FLIPS the wrapper, hiding the words. 
           Holds up the smiling-face-side for them to see.

                                 LILA
                        Where did you get this candy?

           Troy and Megan exchange a dumbfounded look...

                                 TROY
                        A house?
                                 LILA
                        Which one?

                                 TROY
                        Dunno.

                                 LILA
                        Megan?

                                 MEGAN
                         (eyes on alien on TV)
                        What are we watching?

                                 LILA
                        Guys, focus. This came from one 
                        of the houses we visited. Which 
                        one?

           A beat. The kids shake their heads. No idea. She thinks... 
           then digs out her PHONE, as we CUT TO:

           INT. BARRY'S TOW TRUCK, MOVING - NIGHT

           Lila's brother Barry picks up his ringing phone. He's 
           driving his tow truck along a remote highway, heading toward 
           FLASHING EMERGENCY LIGHTS around a CAR CRASH ahead. 

                                 BARRY (INTO PHONE)
                        Please tell me everybody's still 
                        got roughly the same number of 
                        fingers and toes as when I left.

                                 LILA (FROM PHONE)
                        Listen, Troy had an asthma 
                        attack. He's fine now, but I 
                        found this weird thing in his 
                        candy bag...

           Out on the road, A COP is waving Barry over to the car 
           crash. And it's a bad one -- an SUV, flipped on its side. 

                                 BARRY
                        Look, is this an emergency?

                                 LILA
                        I don't know--

                                 BARRY
                        'Cause I got an emergency to deal 
                        with here. Call y'back, okay?

           He hangs up and gets out of the truck as we CUT TO-- 

           LILA: phone in hand, jaw tense. A beat, then...
                                 LILA
                         (goes into living room)
                        You guys wanna go on a field 
                        trip?

           INT. LANE COUNTY SHERIFF'S STATION - NIGHT

           Deputy Nick Folsom was right: Halloween IS a shit-show in 
           this town. Sheriff's station is a madhouse. DUI TINKERBELL 
           SOBS as she's lead to the drunk tank. BAR BRAWL MARIO & 
           LUIGI in cuffs. A guy wearing nothing but a THRILLER JACKET-

                                 LILA (O.S.)
                        Oh God. Don't look. Stop looking.

           Lila tries to steer Troy and Megan away from the pantsless 
           King Of Pop, covering their eyes as she bee-lines toward a 
           harassed DEPUTY WIGGINS (50s) working the front desk--

                                 LILA
                        Excuse me, I--

                                 WIGGINS
                        Have a seat, I'll get to you.

                                 LILA
                        I just need to talk to--

                              WIGGINS
                     Have. A. Seat.

             He doesn't even look at her. So she reaches over and--

                                 LILA
                        Oops.

           --tips his coffee, spilling it across his reports.

                                 WIGGINS
                         (leaps up as she passes)
                        Hey! Hey-- hold it goddammit--

                                 NICK (O.S.)
                        Keep your shirt on, Joe. 

           And there's Nick Folsom, on his way out of his office, 
           already looking like he's had a helluva night. Nick can tell 
           from Lila's face that something's up as we CUT TO:

           INT. SHERIFF'S STATION, NICK'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Close on the Sweet Smiles wrapper in Nick's hand. Widen to 
           him and Lila in his office. Troy and Megan sitting in chairs 
           outside his door, watching YouTube on a phone. 
                                 NICK
                        ...look, do you have any idea how 
                        many calls we get all night 
                        because of practical jokes?

                                 LILA
                        What if it's not a joke?

                                 NICK
                        C'mon, unpack it for a second. 
                        Who abducts someone and then 
                        spends all night opening their 
                        door to people, handing out 
                        Snickers Bars? And how would a 
                        kidnap victim even get a note 
                        into the candy bowl? 

                                 LILA
                        I don't know, ok?
                         (quiet)
                        What if it's the same guy who...

           She doesn't finish the words "took Samantha." She doesn't 
           have to -- he reads it on her face.  But...

                                 NICK
                        ...then we got a zombie problem 
                        on our hands, 'cause the dude who 
                        took Sam is dead. Trust me on 
                        this, I saw the cell after he--

           Nick makes a slit-throat motion. Lila hesitates, then--

                                 LILA
                        Will Halforth never admitted to 
                        it. He confessed to kidnapping 
                        and killing all those girls along 
                        I-5, but he always claimed that 
                        he had nothing to do with 
                        Samantha.

                                 NICK
                        Sometimes criminals lie. That's 
                        one of the big things they teach 
                        you in Cop School, right up there 
                        with the Miranda Rights and what 
                        type of moustache you're required 
                        to grow.   

                                 LILA
                        Doesn't change the fact this note 
                        could actually be fucking real.

                                 NICK
                        Lila, seriously, the odds of you 
                        having A SECOND run-in with a 
                        kidnapper, who just happens to  
                        live on your street? 
                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        That's like getting eaten by a 
                        shark while getting hit by 
                        lightning.
                         (calms)
                        Look... we get a call about a 
                        missing kid? I'll have every 
                        badge between here and Portland 
                        banging on doors. But until then, 
                        we gotta go with the most likely 
                        answer. Which is this is a prank. 
                         (then)
                        C'mon... we're talking about our 
                        neighbors. We know these people.

           Off Lila, stymied...

           INT. LILA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           CLICK! The front door opens, Lila ushers the kids inside.

                                 LILA
                        You two go brush your fangs and 
                        get ready for bed, okay monsters? 
                        I just gotta make a quick call...

           As the kids head up to the bathroom, Lila calls Barry again. 
           Goes to straight to voicemail. Out of range. Shit.

           CLICK! Lila ends the call. Screen switches to her wallpaper--

           --which is an old selfie of her and Samantha, smiling at the 
           beach, Lila's arm around her... 

           Lila looks at the photo. Pulls THE NOTE from her pocket...

           ...and looks out her window at her street -- all the houses 
           there. It's only one block. Then, finally...

           Makes a decision.

           QUICK SHOTS

           --Lila tucks in Megan and Troy, who are already nodding off 
           to sleep.

           --Sets up a nanny-cam in their room, links it her phone.

           --Fires off a text to Barry: CALL ME.

           CUT TO HER CAR: she pops the trunk and starts digging 
           through the BOX OF OVERSTOCK COSTUMES she put in there...
           EXT. LILA'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Identity concealed under a cheap costume (A DOLL MASK 
           designed to look "shattered" and glued back together, along 
           with a BLACK CLOAK), Lila exits her house. 

           Takes in the neighborhood before her. It's almost 9 PM, lots 
           of trick-or-treaters still out. 

           She scans the block, eyes narrow...

           Sees young kids having fun, with no idea what danger is 
           seething beneath the surface of this pleasant world. No one 
           the wiser. No one but Lila...

                                 LILA
                         (whispers)
                        ...where are you?...

           She's gonna have to retrace her steps. She heads into...

           THE STREET

           ...and into the throng of trick-or-treaters; she can pass 
           for a young teenager if you don't look too carefully.

           And as she makes her way from house to house, spying on her 
           neighbors from behind her mask, things that seemed playful 
           and normal earlier now carry a sheen of menace...

           ...like at DEVIN THE BUTCHER'S HOUSE, his truck in the 
           driveway with a grinning, knife-wielding pig for a logo. And 
           the vague Wickerman-vibe she gets from seeing Devin and his 
           wife dressed up like livestock when they open the door...

                                 DEVIN
                        Happy Halloween!
                         (to Lila)
                        Spooky mask. What are you 
                        supposed to be, young lady?

           Lila doesn't respond. Just roots around in the bowl, looking 
           for SWEET SMILES... and doesn't find any. 

           Moves on with the Trick-Or-Treaters to the NEXT HOUSES...

           --DOORS OPEN, one after another. 

           --CANDY BOWLS, one after another. Lila's hand rustles 
           through...  finding only normal Halloween treats.

           --THE FACES of the people answering the doors, one after 
           another -- masks and ghoulish makeup. 

           Everything feels off... corrupted, rotten, perverse, as we--

           WHOOSH TO LILA
           --back on the street, moving along, paranoid...

           ...past a PACK OF TEENAGERS IN GLOW-IN-THE-DARK SKELETON 
           SUITS, one of them craning his neck to watch her as she 
           walks away, his rictus grin fixed on her...

           ...we move with Lila, as she senses she's being WATCHED, 
           looks back as the Skeleton Mask turns away...

           Fights off a shiver, moves on...

           ...looks in PARKED CAR'S WINDOW REFLECTION to see if she's 
           being followed, when suddenly--

           SPLAT! A GUSH OF RED ERUPTS ACROSS THE WINDSHIELD. 

           Then sees... it's a water-balloon loaded with fake blood.

           And right then, SPLAT! She catches the next balloon in the 
           face courtesy of some SHITHEAD 8TH-GRADE BOYS speeding past 
           on their BMXs, laughing their asses off.

                                 8TH GRADE SHITHEADS
                        Yeah!/BOOM!/Toldja she takes it 
                        in the face!

           And off Lila's stormy expression we CUT TO:

           EXT. SIDE OF A HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           In the shadows alongside a house, Lila pulls off her doll 
           mask, using her sleeve to clean the fake blood off. When 
           from behind her she hears...

                                 MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Aren't you a little old for trick 
                        or treating?

           She spins a 180 to see JIM PERKINS, watching from next door 
           in the front yard of his home, dressed up as a spooky 
           carnival barker. His friendliness feels... off-putting. 

                                 LILA
                         (playing it cool)
                        How's your Halloween going, Jim? 
                        Your place looked busy tonight.

                                 JIM
                        Would you like to see it?

           He points to his HAUNTED HOUSE set-up leading into the 
           backyard. Things have calmed down over there; no line left 
           to get in. No trick-or-treaters at the door. Just... Jim. 

                                 LILA
                        Depends. Will there be treats?
                                 JIM
                        There will be.

                                 LILA
                        What kind?

                                 JIM
                         (trace of a smile)
                        All kinds.

           He motions her toward the Haunted House entrance.

           Lila pauses. Looking into the cave-like mouth of the maze 
           leading into the backyard. Is she walking into a trap?

           Looks at Jim. Who motions: go ahead.

           Lila moderates an internal debate. Then... decides. 

           Makes for the entrance. 

           FROM OUT ON THE STREET

           ...we're in SOMEONE'S POV. Silently watching Lila as...

           INT. JIM PERKINS' HAUNTED HOUSE, MAZE - CONTINUOUS

           ...she goes into the black tarp maze of the Haunted House... 

           ...past words fingerpainted in blood red... HELP US... 

           ...past the FACES OF LEERING GHOULS painted on the maze 
           walls, their eyes seem to follow her as she passes, when--

                                 VOICE
                        AAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!

           A FACE LUNGES OUT AT HER WITH A SCREAM! And then... turns 
           into CREEPY LAUGHTER as it (actually a mask attached to a 
           motion-activated machine arm) retracts.

           She shakes it off. Continues past a FLICKERING BLACK & WHITE 
           IMAGE of medieval people being tortured in a dungeon... 

           ...and as she passes the projection screen, we glimpse a 
           SHADOW following her on the other side, before...

           ...she moves into a narrow, dark tunnel leading out to...

           THE BACKYARD

           ...where there's an outdoor CHICKEN WIRE ENCLOSURE the size 
           of a carport. Inside the enclosure is the CANDY BOWL.

           She eyes it a beat... 

           ...then walks in, makes for the bowl...
           --and her face falls. Because it's filled with BUSINESS 
           CARDS. There's A SMILING VAMPIRE MOUTH WITH A CAVITY ON ONE 
           FANG. The card reads: "PERKINS DENTAL - POST HALLOWEEN 
           SPECIAL 10% OFF" and "FANGS A LOT!"

                                 LILA
                        ...gotta be kidding...

           And right then she steps on a PRESSURIZED FLOORBOARD and 
           THWACK! THE CAGE DOOR SLAMS SHUT BEHIND HER. 

           She turns to it. Grabs it. It won't budge. This auto-locking 
           cage is the coupe de grace of the Perkins' haunted house.  

                                 LILA 
                        Hey-- Jim?

           SCREEAAAAAAMMMMM! A cacophony of shrieks from the haunted 
           house speakers. FLASH! She's HIT WITH STROBELIGHTS.  
           EVERYTHING GOES FLASHING WHITE. She's NIGHT-BLINDED. 

           Then just like that, it all STOPS. Her eyes slowly adjust...

                                 LILA
                        Jim, seriously, this isn't--

           SCREEAAAAAAMMMMMMMMMMM-FLASH! Another blast of NOISE and 
           STROBES. Somehow LOUDER. EVERYTHING WHITE and--

           CLICK! It all stops. And as Lila's blown pupils adjust to 
           the darkness of the backyard, she turns, looking around... 

           ...and can make out something that terrifies her...

           A FIGURE. Twenty feet behind the cage, staring at her.

           A figure in a yellow mask.

           A yellow SMILER MASK.

           SCREEAAAAAAMMMMMMMMMMM-FLASH! Another blast of noise and 
           strobes. Everything fades from white to...

           The figure is standing 10 feet behind the cage.

           SCREAAAAAAMMMMMMMMMMM! FLASH! Blinded, Lila stumbles to the 
           locked door, GRABS IT, THRASHES, straining to get out. 

           CLICK! It all stops. She spins. 

           As her eyes adjust to the darkness...

           Smiler is NOWHERE TO BE SEEN.

           Breath staccato, she turns in a slow circle, eyes wide--

           --where the fuck did he go? WHERE THE FUCK IS HE??
                                 MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hello Lila.

           She SHRIEKS and whirls around, seeing SMILER IS RIGHT BEHIND 
           HER OUTSIDE THE CAGE, LEERING IN AT HER--

                                 SMILER 
                        Having FUN?

                                 LILA
                         (stumbles back, 
                          terrified)
                        What do you want?!?

                                 SMILER
                        I'm getting exactly what I want.
                         (leans in)
                        You in your place.

           Lila stops cold... because she's sensing something, 
           something we might also be sensing...

                                 LILA
                         (a whisper)
                        Say again?

                                 SMILER
                        I said "You in your--OW! OW FUCK-

           He SCREAMS because Lila's reached through a slat in the door 
           and GRABBED SMILER BY HIS JUNK. Squeezing. HARD. 

                                                  LILA
                      SMILER
           FUCK-OH-GOD-OH-FUCK-LET GO! 
           AAAAAAAH!
                                       Take it off. The mask is 
                                       wrong! Your voice isn't his. 
               (writhing)
                                         (squeezes harder)
           JESUS OW GOD-- PLEASE! OKAY! 
           OKAY!
                                       Take off the mask or I take 
                                       your balls.

           Smiler YANKS off the mask (which we now notice is cheap 
           plastic, different from the one we saw in the beginning) and-

           --we reveal it's our old pal Brett O'Shea. Mouth open, 
           making an absolutely indescribable noise, as his BUDDIES 
           react from their hiding spot in the shadows.

                                 BRETT
                        I'm-sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. 
                        Leggo! Leggo!

                                 LILA
                        Let me guess: you were 
                        embarrassed about a little girl 
                        breaking your jaw, so you decided 
                        to scare the shit out of her? 
                        Learn to take a fucking L, Brett. 
                         (to one of his pals)
                        Open the door. Now.
           One of boys rushes over, fumbles for the latch, pulls opens 
           the door. She gives a final SQUEEZE, Brett HOWLS and 
           crumples to the ground. Lila walks out, his buddies backing 
           away as if from a feral dog, as she stares down at Brett...

                                 LILA
                        Asshole.

           CRUNCH! Lila steps on Brett's plastic Smiler mask. Walks on-

           --past a worried Jim Perkins approaching from the house--

                                 JIM
                        What's going on out here?

           She makes it to--

           THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE

           --and stops, hands shaking. Coming down off the fear that -- 
           for a second -- she thought she was facing you-know-who...

                                 LILA
                        ...Jesus...

           After a moment, she pulls it together as--

                                 JIM
                         (exiting backyard)
                        The heck happened to that guy?

                                 LILA
                        Migraine. Are you actually 
                        locking people in a cage as part 
                        of your haunted house?

                                 JIM
                        It's not a cage, it's an escape 
                        room!

                                 LILA
                        Kiiiinda seemed like a cage! 
                        Also, giving out business cards 
                        instead of candy? Foul play, bro.

                                 JIM
                        Hey, I'm giving the gift of 
                        scares. At least I'm not handing 
                        out expired sugary crap like 
                        everybody else.

           She pauses. That word "expired" dings for her. She reaches 
           into her pocket and digs out the SWEET SMILES wrapper. 

                                 LILA
                        ...like this? 
                                 JIM
                         (points across street)
                        Elaine's been handing out that 
                        dollar-store junk all night.

           Lila takes that in...

                                 LILA
                        Thanks, Jim.

           Then pulls on her broken doll mask and bee-lines for Elaine 
           Bowen's house as we CUT TO:

           EXT. ELAINE BOWEN'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           We move with Lila toward Elaine's house. Pauses by the 
           "MISSING" POSTER of Samantha on the phone pole outside. 

           Up close, there's something disturbing about the poster. 
           Slightly askew. Certain words in all-caps ("darling 
           DAUGHTER") betraying the frayed mind that wrote them. The 
           phone pole is GOUGED and SPLINTERED, COVERED IN OLD STAPLES. 

           Lila glances to Elaine's house, then back to the poster...

                                 LILA
                         (a whisper)
                        ...what'd she do, Sam?... Did she 
                        take someone to replace you?

           Samantha, smiling in the photo, gives no answer. No 
           indication of what her grieving mother is capable of. 

           INT./EXT. ELAINE BOWEN'S HOUSE, FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

           Ding-Dong! A doorbell rings inside the dim confines of 
           Elaine's home. Elaine approaches the door. No costume, just 
           in the same clothes she's been wearing all day. Opens up--

                                 TRICK-OR-TREATERS (O.S.)
                        Trick-or-treat!

           The group of trick-or-treaters at her door is a marginally 
           older crowd at this later hour; Fortnite characters and 
           rappers with Sharpie-tattooed faces...

           ...and at the back of the group, Lila The Porcelain Doll. 

                                 ELAINE
                        Take as much as you like... there 
                        you go... enjoy...

           And as the other trick-or-treater's depart, it's Lila's turn 
           to step up to the door. 
                                 ELAINE
                        Oh my. That's quite the 
                        costume...

           Elaine holds out the bowl... and sure enough, Lila sees its 
           full of OLD OFF-BRAND JUNK... including SWEET SMILES. 

                                 ELAINE
                        Go ahead. Dig in.

           Lila pretends to look for a specific candy, all while subtly 
           peering past Elaine, trying to see into the house...

           ...sees only a dim room in need of housekeeping. Early 
           stages "Grey Gardens." On a wall: a photo of Sam, smiling.

                                 ELAINE
                        Decisions, decisions...

           Lila picks some candy. Nods a thank-you. Turns to go--

                                 ELAINE (O.S.)
                        Is there something you'd like to 
                        say to me, Lila?

           Lila freezes. How does she know it's me?? Elaine approaches 
           her, motions to the VINE TATTOO crawling up Lila's wrist.

                                 ELAINE
                        Same tattoo you talked Samantha 
                        into getting. 

           Elaine lifts Lila's mask, revealing the scared girl beneath.

                                 ELAINE
                        ...why don't you come inside? 

           INT. ELAINE BOWEN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           A lit stove burner licks the bottom of a large POT OF STEW 
           simmering on the stove. Way too much for one person.  Lila, 
           standing awkwardly in the kitchen entrance...

                                 LILA
                        Expecting company? 

                                 ELAINE
                        I like to cook. Keeps my mind 
                        occupied. 

           Elaine lifts a KITCHEN KNIFE, chops carrots. Lila peruses 
           the room... sees a table crowded with FLYERS; Samantha's 
           "missing" posters. Duct tape, staplegun, tacks, pliers...

                                 LILA
                        That's good. Keeping yourself 
                        busy. 
                                 ELAINE
                        I've got a lot of hours to occupy 
                        now. Nothing else to do.

           Lila tries a conversational gambit, dangles a piece of bait.

                                 LILA
                        I'm sorry. I know I've said it 
                        before. But I really am. I know 
                        what you must be feeling.

                                 ELAINE
                        "I know what you must be 
                        feeling." I hear that a lot. From 
                        everyone. But they don't. Not 
                        really.  And I find myself 
                        wishing I could show them what it 
                        really feels like.

           Lila freezes.

                                 LILA
                         (quiet)
                        ...you mean... what it feels like 
                        to lose someone? To be alone? 

                                 ELAINE
                        Is that what you think I feel? 
                        Alone? 
                         (a little manic)
                        Would you like to know what I 
                        feel, Lila? What I really feel? 
                        What the worst is for me?

           Lila waits for Elaine's next move, jaw tight. Elaine's hand 
           tightly gripping that very sharp knife as it starts cutting 
           fleshy mushrooms. Knifework gaining intensity...

                                 ELAINE
                         (chop-CHOP-CHOP)
                        It's not that she was never 
                        rescued.
                         (chop-CHOP-CHOP)
                        It's not that her body was never  
                        found in a ditch somewhere...
                         (CHOP-CHOP-CHOP)
                        It's not even having to smile. To 
                        pretend like you're some normal 
                        human being like everyone else--

           She GASPS. She's just SLICED open a finger. She holds it up, 
           staring at the blood welling out. 

                                 ELAINE
                        No. It's the not knowing. It's 
                        the not knowing what was done to 
                        her. Not knowing if it was quick. 
                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        Or if her screams were for her 
                        mother at the last moment. It's 
                        the not knowing what happened.

           Blood dribbles to the floor. The stew pot BUBBLES FASTER...

                                 ELAINE
                        But what I do know? It was your 
                        idea to sneak her out that night. 
                        It was your idea to go up on that 
                        hill. It was you who answered 
                        that phone. It was all your 
                        choices, and yet it was my sweet 
                        girl who paid for them.

           Elaine STEPS FORWARD, knife gripped tight, looming over her.

                                 ELAINE
                        I have something for you. 

           The stew boils over. Abruptly Elaine TURNS, takes the pot 
           off. Sets the knife down as she rifles through a drawer as--

           --Lila STARES AT THE KNIFE from the cutting board -- should 
           I grab it? Then Elaine turns around, holding--

           --nothing more than A FRAMED PHOTO. The one from our 
           opening. Lila & Samantha on Halloween years ago. 

                                 ELAINE
                        I don’t want it in the house, but 
                        I couldn’t bring myself to throw 
                        it away.

           Lila realizes she was misreading the situation; this isn’t a 
           killer, just a woman shattered by grief. Elaine notices...

                                 ELAINE
                        You're shaking...

           Lila's hand is, indeed, trembling with adrenaline.

                                 ELAINE
                        I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare 
                        you. I sometimes scare myself 
                        these days, to be honest... 
                         (eyes far away, quiet)
                        ...there are times when I think I 
                        hear her... calling for me... I 
                        hear her voice in my head, and...

           Elaine trails off, fighting back hot tears.

                                 LILA
                         (puts a hand on her)
                        It's ok...
                                 ELAINE
                        You should go.

                                 LILA
                        I understand--

                                 ELAINE
                        I'm sorry. About all of this.
                         (dries her eyes)
                        And for smashing your eggs.

           Those last words trigger something in Lila... we see a flash 
           of it, earlier at the grocery store, Elaine storming out, 
           leaving her cart full of Halloween candy behind.

                                 LILA
                        You left your candy in your cart 
                        at the store tonight.

                                 ELAINE
                        Yeah. Had to borrow some from 
                        next door. 

           Motions over to KOVITCH’S HOUSE next door... 

           ...Lila puts it together: the kids got the Sweet Smiles from 
           the Bowen’s, but the candy itself came from Kovitch. 

           As Lila backs out of the house, Elaine picks up the bloody 
           knife, rinses it, then starts chop-chop-chopping... 

           EXT. LILA'S STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Lila walks over to the old, rusting WROUGHT IRON FENCE and 
           GRIPS the BARS, peering through them up at--

           KOVITCH'S CREEPY HOARDER HOUSE

           -old, unkempt, paint flaking. Structure sagging from 
           disrepair. Barren front lawn. Fenced-in backard. The front 
           of the house like a malformed face looking back at us. 

           In a far side-window, there's a FLICKERING -- the glow of 
           someone watching TV. 

           Lila drifts, trying to get a better look... but the side 
           window is too smudgy to see much. So she sneaks...

           AROUND THE HOUSE

           ...along the exterior of the backyard fence...

           ...and stands on tippy-toes, peeking over at the rear-
           windows, at the TV-lit glow of the living room, when--

                                 PITBULL
                        ROWROWROWROWROW!!!
           BAM! A PITBULL SLAMS INTO THE FENCE, JAWS SNAPPING AT HER--

           Lila FALLS BACK as the dog THROWS ITSELF AGAINST THE WOOD, 
           ROCKING THE WHOLE RICKETY STRUCTURE--

           --HOWLING, paws SCRAPING, dying to break through and gut 
           her. This thing isn't a dog; it's a mobile bear-trap.

           Catching her breath, Lila looks back up at the house to see-

           --A HUGE SILHOUETTE suddenly APPEARS at the window, peering 
           out. Does he see her?

           Instinctively, she slips deeper into the shadows. Watching 
           the dark shape as it remains, then... eventually... 

           ...turns and disappears back into the house.

           Jesus. Fucking. Christ.

           The dog paces back and forth behind the fence like a caged 
           hyena, searching for a way out, snarling, as--

           --Lila backs down the street... then makes a decision. 

           Takes out her phone and makes a call as we SMASH TO:

           EXT. CUL-DE-SAC, JEAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Nick Folsom stands before a house that's been vandalized 
           with EGGS and FAKE BLOOD WATER BALLOONS (courtesy of the 8th 
           Grade Shitheads who splatted Lila earlier.) He's talking to 
           an OLD LADY (JEAN) who doesn't have to dress up because 
           she's already a witch every day of her life. 

                                 JEAN
                        Are you understanding me? I want 
                        you to find who did this and 
                        arrest them.

                                 NICK
                        And how would you like me to do 
                        that?

                                 JEAN
                         (as if it's obvious)
                        Check the eggshells for 
                        fingerprints.

                                 NICK
                        You want me to... fingerprint the 
                        eggshells.

                                 JEAN
                        Yes.
                                 NICK
                         (a beat, deadpan)
                        No problem, I'll just have CSI 
                        dust for prints and cross-index 
                        them with the vast database of 
                        6th graders' fingerprints we keep 
                        at the station. 

                                 JEAN
                        Thank you.

                                 NICK
                         (as his phone rings)
                        Excuse me.
                         (answers the phone)
                        This is Nick-- What? Are you 
                        kidding me?
                         (eyes Jean)
                        You know, sure. Yeah, I can come 
                        over. I can absolutely do that.

           Anything to get away from this lady. We hear:

                                 LILA (PRE-LAP)
                        I'm telling you, it's him...

           EXT. HOARDER HOUSE - NIGHT

           Nick with Lila, standing by his cruiser by Kovitch's house.

                                 NICK
                        So that's your theory? Boo Radley 
                        did it?
                         (off her look)
                        From "To Kill A Mockingbird"--

                                 LILA
                        I know who the fuck Boo Radley is-

                                 NICK
                        --and just because he's weird, 
                        you automatically think it's him? 
                        The guy can't even hold down a 
                        bagging job at Safeway. How the 
                        hell is that dude gonna kidnap 
                        someone and not get noticed?  

                                 LILA
                        What if you're wrong? What if 
                        that note is real, and he's 
                        holding someone in there, and you 
                        don't do anything about it? That 
                        shit's gonna haunt you forever.

           He stares at the house for a moment, then...
                                 NICK
                        ...if I get fired for this, I'm 
                        gonna haunt you forever.

           With that, he opens the iron gate and walks through the 
           front yard. Beyond the backyard gate, the pitbull BARKS.

                                 NICK
                        Hey, hey, hey-
                         (whistles)
                        Come on. Come on...

           The dog GROWLS through the wooden gate-boards as he moves up 
           the creaky front porch to the door. He KNOCKS.

           Back at the cruiser, Lila watches as... 

           The door opens. Inside she can see him: KOVITCH. 

           A mountain of a man. With a face that's all wrong angles. 
           Eyes like polished stones.   

           Nick talks to him, one hand resting on his gun.

                                 NICK
                        Sorry to bother you tonight. 
                        Listen, we got a report...

           ON THE STREET

           Lila spies from the shadows. Watching as Nick talks... then 
           Kovitch nods, and takes a reluctant step back to let him in.

           Nick shoots a glance back - here goes nothin' - and goes in.

           Kovitch pauses in the doorway. Peers into the darkness. Like 
           he can sense her out there too. Then closes the door as-- 

           --Lila's out of the shadows, moving closer, watching through 
           front windows. Behind the fence, the pitbull GROWLS...

           INSIDE

           Nick moves past windows. Hand near his holstered gun. 

           He goes from room to room, obscured, only briefly visible as 
           he goes. Kovitch leads sometimes, follows others...

           As they head to the back of the house, Lila follows along 
           the fence, peeking through slats as the pitbull paces her, 
           throat rumbling, separated by a half inch of rotted wood...

           ...eyes locked on KOVITCH'S WINDOWS. Searching for Nick. 
           Trying to keep track of him. To make sure he's safe.

           Nick moves past a window. Kovitch FOLLOWS.

           And then... nothing. They're just gone. 
           They don't appear at the next window. They don't come back.

           She waits... And waits...

           Nervous now. Trying to see through the fence slats. She 
           grabs a lawn chair. Climbs atop to peer over the fence. 

           The pitbull paces. GROWLS. She watches, but nothing. Then--

           Kovitch and Nick appear upstairs. Moving through the house.

           She lets out a breath of relief. Nick searches the last few 
           rooms, and then she can see it--

           Nick's whole posture RELAXES. There's nothing there. He 
           warms up to Kovitch. Grins sheepishly. And they head down.

                                 LILA
                        Shit.

           EXT. HOARDER HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Nick shakes Kovitch's hand. As Kovitch closes the door and 
           goes in, Nick heads out of the gate, walking up to Lila--

                                 NICK
                        Well, I've earned my overtime 
                        tonight, thank you very much. 
                         (off her look)
                        Is the dude creepy? Yes. Is his 
                        house so gross I think it should 
                        be nuked from orbit? Also yes. Is 
                        the Health Department gonna shit 
                        a cinderblock when I tell 'em 
                        about this? Abso-fucking-lutely. 
                        But, is there a kidnapped kid in 
                        there? No. I looked in every room-

                                 LILA
                        Every room? You sure? What if 
                        he's got one you don't know 
                        about?

                                 NICK
                        Like a "secret torture cave" or 
                        something? The guy who can barely 
                        tie his shoes built a Jigsaw 
                        dungeon in his house? And the 
                        kid's not gonna be screaming for 
                        help?

                                 LILA
                        What if the kid's tied up and 
                        gagged? Or unconscious? Or dead 
                        and stuffed in the freezer?
                                 NICK
                        I didn't check the freezer. Want 
                        me to go back and check the 
                        freezer?

                                 LILA
                        I'm serious.

                                 NICK
                        Lila...

           And Nick seems torn, on the fence, when suddenly his radio 
           CRACKLES. It’s SHERIFF BETANCOURT.

                                 SHERIFF BETANCOURT (FROM RADIO)
                        Folsom, come in, you copy?

                                 NICK
                        Talk to me, Sheriff--

                                 SHERIFF BETANCOURT (FROM RADIO)
                        Good news, pancho... found out 
                        who's pulling that bullshit with 
                        the notes.

           Interesting. Nick and Lila share a look...

           EXT. PARTY HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Nick's cruiser pulls up to a home at the end of the block-- 
           the PARTY HOUSE, where costumed revelers stumble about, 
           hooting the mating calls of the young and intoxicated. 

           In the driveway, SHERIFF BETANCOURT (older, wiser, and 
           tireder than Nick) motions Nick and Lila over--

                                 SHERIFF BETANCOURT
                        Neighbor called in a complaint. 
                        Apparently these idiots have been 
                        handing out candy with messages 
                        inside. Found half a dozen in 
                        their bowl...

           He holds up a bunch of candies, and a couple of wrappers 
           with messages scrawled inside. Nick reads them. Snorts.

                                 NICK
                        "Help they're trying to sodomize 
                        me with a Baby Ruth bar." Spelled 
                        sodomize with two D's. Any idea 
                        which of these Rhodes Scholars 
                        did it? 

                                 SHERIFF BETANCOURT
                        No one's fessed up. Best I can do 
                        is a noise violation.

                                 SHERIFF BETANCOURT (CONT’D)
                        Makes me long for the days when 
                        we could just beat 'em with the 
                        Yellow Pages...  

                                 NICK
                        Simpler times. 

           Betancourt nods g'night as he climbs into his cruiser and 
           departs. Nick approaches Lila, holds up the wrappers...

                                 NICK
                        That's it I guess.
                         (off her silence)
                        You okay?

                                 LILA
                        I'm just... 
                         (laughs)
                        ...wrapping my head around how 
                        stupid I must look right now.

                                 NICK
                        Hey. Cut that out. 
                         (quietly)
                        Weird as it sounds, I wanted you 
                        to be right. I wanted this to end 
                        with us kicking down the door and 
                        saving the day. Because there's 
                        no one I know who needs a win 
                        more than you. 
                         (then)
                        But sometimes... life's just 
                        simpler than we want it to be. 

           He hands her the wrappers. She flips through them. Messages 
           scrawled in purple. Just a horrible, horrible prank.

                                 LILA
                        ...I guess so.
                         (beat)
                        Thanks.

                                 NICK
                        I gotta get back to patrol. But I 
                        won't be far. Need anything, you 
                        know my number.

                                 LILA
                        Nine-one-one, right?

           Nick cracks a smile -- Lila's still Lila. He gets in his 
           cruiser, gives her a wave, drives out of the cul-de-sac.

           Lila starts walking back to her house...

           ...looks up at KOVITCH'S HOME as she passes... 
           ...then eyes Samantha's photo on the wreath on the phone 
           pole across the street from her house... 

           ...before she finally walks inside.

           INT. LILA'S HOUSE, KID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Lila heads up the creaky stairs into THE KIDS' BEDROOM. Troy 
           shifts in his bed and wakes up, tired.

                                 TROY
                        Lila?

                                 LILA
                        Shhhh.

                                 TROY
                        I heard you on the stairs.

                                 LILA
                        It's okay. Go back to bed.

           He drifts back to sleep. She pulls a kicked-away blanket 
           over Megan in the bottom bunk... 

           ...then heads back down the stairs; only this time, she's 
           careful to step over the squeaky steps.

           INT. LILA'S HOUSE, DOWNSTAIRS - NIGHT

           CLICK! Lila flips on the kitchen light.

           BZZZZ. Her cell phone lights up -- Barry. She sighs. Answers-

           INT. BARRY'S TOW TRUCK, MOVING - SAME (INTERCUT AS NEEDED)

           Barry's towing a smashed up car down a dark road.

                                 LILA
                        Hey. How's it going out there?

                                 BARRY
                        "Tonight's car accident has been 
                        brought to you by Jose Cuervo, 
                        author of such thoughts as 'fuck 
                        that cop' and 'I think I'll cut 
                        my own hair.'" How's things at 
                        home? Said something about a 
                        note?

           Lila pauses. Holds up the note on the Sweet Smiles wrapper. 

                                 I'VE BEEN KIDNAPPED
                              GOING TO KILL ME 
           Does she tell him about her night? Fuck no.

                                 LILA
                        It was nothing. Everything's 
                        fine. Totally fine...
                         (then)
                        Kids're asleep. All good.

                                 BARRY
                        Sure? You sounded frazzled 
                     earlier.

                              LILA
                        Under. Control.

                                 BARRY
                        Ok well, I got two more cars to 
                        tow. Be back in a coupla' hours.

                                 LILA
                        I'll leave the light on for you.

           Click. She hangs up. Everything is quiet. CUT TO:

           INT. LILA'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           CLICK! Lila turns on the kitchen TV. Flips through horror 
           movies. Pillages kids' pumpkin-buckets, sugar-medicates. 

           On TV: the floorboards of a haunted house CREAK under a 
           terrified girl's feet as the movie's sound drains away, 
           priming the audience for a motherfucker of a jump-scare...

           A second CREAK of a floorboard. 

           Lila pauses -- that creak sounded weirdly like it was coming 
           from inside her house, not on the TV.

           She looks behind her, scans the room. Sees nothing. 
           Everything as it should be.

           Looks back to the TV. And as she does so...

           A DOOR HINGE SQUEAKS BEHIND HER

           Skin suddenly rippling with gooseflesh, Lila turns...

           ...and sees the PANTRY DOOR is slightly ajar. 

           What the fuck?...

           BANG!  Lila damn near jumps out of her skin -- but it's a 
           noise from the TV, a trapdoor EXPLODES OPEN and up comes a 
           LUMBERING SHAPE WITH A SHRIEKING BUZZSAW.

           CLICK! She turns off the TV. All goes silent.
           Looks back to the pantry. At its slightly-open door.

           The floorboards beyond the door emit a barely audible CREAK.

                                 LILA
                        Troy? Megan?

           No response. 

           Knees trembly, Lila makes for the pantry door.

           Pushes it open. 

           A shaft of light cuts a wedge through the darkness. 

           Nothing inside here. Just food and kitchen supplies. 

           But... in the very back of the pantry, something glints in 
           the black. Lila squints and sees it's...

           Eyes. Staring at her. 

           SAMANTHA'S FACE emerges from the murky depths of the pantry. 
           Her skin is purplish-white and her eyes are full of erupted 
           veins, like she's been choked to death. Her voice rattles...

                                 SAMANTHA
                        ...behind every smile is 
                        something sweet...

           WHAM! A GLOVED HAND slams around Samantha's mouth and she's 
           SUCKED BACKWARDS INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE PANTRY as--

           A CRY flies out of Lila's mouth as-

           INT. LILA'S HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS - NIGHT

           LILA'S EYES SNAP OPEN. She JOLTS up from the couch from 
           where she was... sleeping.

           She takes it in. It was all just a dream. Still--

           --she stumbles into the kitchen-- throws the light-switch 
           and YANKS open the pantry, which is, of course-- 

           Empty. 

           Just her trauma-bruised mind playing tricks on her. 

           Lila can't suck air fast enough, flees out of the pantry--

           --into the living room, looking around for threats both real 
           and imagined. Seeing nothing. 

           Nothing but the CANDY on the coffee table. 

           Samantha's words on her lips...
                                 LILA
                         (a whisper)
                        "Behind every smile is something 
                        sweet"...

           She takes out the Sweet Smiles wrappers. Re-reads them... 

           Her expression changes to a FROWN. Flips through them again. 
           And again. Something's wrong.

           ...the original has feminine handwriting... purple scrawl... 

           She puts the original wrapper next to the ones that came 
           from the Sheriff, and we notice at the same time as her...

                                 LILA
                         (whispers)
                        ...the handwriting's different...

           And it is. Subtle... but different. Harder, blockier.

           She runs a finger over the old one -- it's crayon. But when 
           she rubs one of the new ones, it SMEARS. They're NOT WRITTEN 
           IN CRAYON, BUT PURPLE MARKER. DIFFERENT PEOPLE CLEARLY WROTE 
           THESE. They're decoy notes, made to throw her off the scent.

                                 LILA
                         (whispers)
                        ...holy shit...

           She looks from the candy wrappers to her WINDOW, staring out 
           at... KOVITCH'S HOUSE. And we SMASH TO:

           EXT. KOVITCH'S HOUSE, SIDEWALK - NIGHT

           Lila sneaks towards Kovitch's house...

           ...looks up to a window... sees the TV flickering... 

           ...and through another window, Kovitch on his chair...

           How the hell is she gonna get in there?

           Then-- the sound from behind her. A PORTABLE SPEAKER playing 
           MUMBLE RAP. She turns--

           --and sees the source: the 8th-grade shitheads on their BMXs 
           cruising past on the cross-street, heading for...

           THE PARK ACROSS THE BLOCK

           Lila watches them, wheels turning, and we CUT TO: 
           EXT. PARK - NIGHT

           A lighter ignites and roasts some weed inside a beer can 
           refashioned as a marijuana pipe. WIDEN TO--

           --the 8th Grade Shitheads, smoking up on the playground of 
           this big wooded park. As one of them pulls in a MASSIVE HIT-

                                 LILA (O.S.)
                        Smile, douchebags.

           CLICK! They're blinded by the flash of an Iphone camera. 
           Lila's just shot a picture of them as she approaches.

                                 KID (SCOTTY)
                         (coughing up smoke)
                        The fuck--

                                 LILA
                        Hi, Scotty. Hi, Scotty's Gross 
                        Friends. How's your Halloween 
                        going? Finding lots of fun shit 
                        to throw at people?

                                 SCOTTY
                        What do you want?

                                 LILA
                        Remember when your stepdad caught 
                        you with a cigarette? You spent 
                        every Saturday sweating your ass 
                        off doing yardwork for a year?  
                         (lifts the phone-pic of 
                          him smoking weed)
                        Whaddya think he'll do when he 
                        finds out you're smoking weed and 
                        smashing out lights in the park?

                                 SCOTTY
                         (confused)
                        We didn't smash any--

           She WHIPS a rock at a park light. SMASH. It goes out.

                                 SCOTTY
                         (stares)
                        ...you're crazy.

                                 LILA
                        100%. So do what I say and don't 
                        fuck with me.

           And before Lila can tell them her demands, we SMASH TO:
           INT. KOVITCH'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           We're in Kovitch's living room, focused on his TV set -- an 
           old tube job with bunny ears, playing a sitcom. 

           The show's laughtrack CACKLES. In his armchair, Kovitch 
           remains silent. Eats a popsicle, tosses the stick away when--

           SPLAT! A waterballoon filled with fake blood ERUPTS across 
           the window behind the TV, the room now cast in a crimson 
           glow from the streetlight outside, as-- 

           --Kovitch just sits in his armchair. Unfazed.

           EXT. KOVITCH'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Hidden in the shadows of the front yard, Scotty and the boys 
           HURL WATER BALLOONS AND EGGS at Kovitch's place. 

           SPLAT! SPLAT! One after another. Lila watches from her 
           hiding spot in the front, checking for lights to come on.

                                 LILA
                        ...c'mon... c'mon...

           Nothing. Kovitch isn't coming. The kids look to Lila.

                                 SCOTTY
                        What now?

           Lila thinks. Hears the PITBULL barking in the back. Beat...

                                 LILA
                        Get on your bikes and ride as 
                        fast as you can.
                         (off their "What?" 
                          looks)
                        GO.

           Right as Lila UNLATCHES THE GATE AND USES IT TO CORNER 
           HERSELF AS SHE SWINGS IT OPEN--

           --and ERUPTING OUT OF THE BACKYARD COMES THE PITBULL.

           The kids BOLT FOR THEIR BIKES -- oh shit, oh shit-- 

           Riding like the wind away from the house--

           --Kovitch's dog CHASING AFTER THEM, BARKING ITS HEAD OFF as-

           INSIDE KOVITCH'S BEDROOM

           --he hears the barking in front of his house, moving away at 
           a rapid clip. CLICK! He shuts off the TV as--

           OUTSIDE THE HOUSE
           A moment later, the front door OPENS. Kovitch steps out. 

                                 KOVITCH
                         (calls for the dog)
                        Boonie! Here, boy!

           The dog doesn't come. Kovitch lumbers down the front step to 
           go retrieve his pet as we PULL BACK...

           ...to find Lila stealthing her way through his backyard...

           ...to the porch's DOGGY DOOR. She breathes in DEEP and 
           wedges into the tight space... Slithering INTO THE HOUSE...

           INT. KOVITCH'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT

           ...and FINDS A RAT eating out of the DOG BOWL by her face. 

           She swallows a SCREAM, SCAMPERS back and away, eyes 
           adjusting to the gloom, hyperventilating...

           CLICKS on her cell phone flashlight...

           RATS SCAMPER into HOLES IN THE WALLS, disappearing, as...

           ...she sees the kitchen is a fucking haz-mat disaster area. 
           Stacked plates of DECAYING FOOD everywhere. 

           She holds her light over a MILKY GLASS, she can see 
           SOMETHING SWIMMING INSIDE it. MOSQUITO LARVAE. Jesus.

                                 LILA
                         (looks around)
                        Hello?!?

           Nothing. Eyes round and wide and scared, trying to X-ray her 
           way through the darkness, she moves...

           THROUGH THE KITCHEN

           ...notices the refrigerator door is ajar... She hesitates. 
           After her Nick conversation, does she check the freezer?

           She pulls it open. No body. But it's stacked floor-to-
           ceiling with popsicle boxes. Nothing else. Opens the fridge--

           --and GAGS from the stench: the fridge side is so CRAMMED 
           WITH ROTTING FOOD that the door will barely close.

           Lila stuffs the door shut and moves on...

           DEEPER INTO THE HOUSE

           ...past his armchair in the living room, which is surrounded 
           by a lake of DISCARDED POPSICLE STICKS. Ants crawl all over 
           them. It's like the carpet is moving. 
           Lila grimaces and moves on...

           ...through a MAZE OF STACKED BOXES AND SHELVES, like an 
           unholy mix between a museum and funhouse. 

           -On one shelf are OLD DOLLS. BARBIES. RAGGEDY ANNE'S. 
           ANTIQUE PORCELAIN with heavy lidded eyes. One fucked-up doll 
           is huge, as big as a 3-year old kid. Smiling at us.

           -And the next shelf? Used McDonald's cups. 100's of them.

           --She passes a PAINTED CLOWN COLLECTION smiling its dead-
           eyed smile. MASKS on walls like some TRIBAL nightmare.

           -A pile of vintage WORN PLAYBOYS opened near an OVERFLOWING 
           BUCKET OF USED TISSUES. The women's faces are scratched out. 

           Lila almost gets sick at the sight of that. She looks 
           away... and then STOPS COLD. 

           Because she hears something. A tiny, faint, distant voice.

                                 DISTANT VOICE
                        ...heeeeeeeeee...

           She stops. Did she hear SOMETHING? There it is again:

                                 DISTANT VOICE
                        ...heeeeeeeeeeeeelp...

           Is that a person? Or the wind?  

                                 LILA
                        Hello? I'm here to help! Is there 
                        anyone here?
                         (off the silence)
                        Hello!

           She turns, trying to place it. Looks to a window. Seems like 
           the noise came from this direction. 

           She approaches it slowly. Breath held. Silent.

           Then... a LOUD SHRIEK makes her jump out of her skin. 

           But as she looks out the window, she sees it's just the 
           sound effects from THE HAUNTED HOUSE next door. 

                                 LILA
                         (a whisper)
                        ...goddammit...

           She turns and moves onward...

           UP THE STAIRS

           ...on old carpet worn thin to the smooth wood underneath.
                                 LILA
                        Hello? Anyone? 

           As she reaches...

           THE SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY

           ...MORE rats scurry from the light. They SLITHER in the 
           walls, CHITTERING within the ceilings above her...

           ...through the CEILING ACCESS DOOR TO THE ATTIC, she can 
           hear what sounds like a DEAFENING SYMPHONY of squeaking 
           rats. The central hive, teeming with unseen swarms. 

           She HURRIES into...

           A BEDROOM 

           ...the one room that's not cluttered with shit, perhaps 
           because this room is more like a museum. 4 poster-bed with a 
           dusty floral bedspread. Perfume bottles on the wall.

           Pictures of AN OLD WOMAN who doesn't smile, and her SON, a 
           younger, unhappy version of Kovitch. And there's a cut-out 
           OBITUARY. "Local seamstress passes away at 73." 

                                 LILA
                        Hello? HELLO? 

           And then, at last, she sees HER. The SILHOUETTE of a BLONDE 
           LITTLE GIRL across the LAST ROOM.

                                 LILA
                        Hello...? I'm not going to hurt 
                        you... 
                         (approaches, cautious)
                        I got your message... I'm here to 
                        help.

           She touches the girl... who TOPPLES over. 

           Just a STYROFOAM HEAD with a WIG on it. 

           As she shines the light, she sees MORE on shelves around 
           her. The room is filled with sewing machines. Bolts of old 
           fabric. And then--

           WOOF! WOOF!

           She flicks off the light as--

           OUT THE WINDOW

           --she can see KOVITCH coming home. Dragging the PITBULL by 
           the collar. And it's BARKING at kids as they pass.

           WITH LILA
           --panic rising in her, she SCRAMBLES to get out of the room. 
           Heads to the stairs as-- 

           KA-CHUNK. The front door OPENS and KOVITCH enters. 

           Lila pulls back on the top landing so she can't be seen.

                                 KOVITCH
                        Easy, boy. Easy.

           He pets it. Calms it. Releases it. It bolts into the house. 
           She WAITS atop the stairs to see which way Kovitch goes.

           He pauses for a second, as if sensing for something. Then 
           shakes it off, heads...

           BACK TOWARDS THE LIVING ROOM

           ...where he takes his seat, and turns the TV back on.

           But the pitbull heads to the doggie door in back, and STOPS. 

           SNIFFS the entrance. Catching HER SCENT on the plastic as-

           BACK ON THE STAIRS

           Lila creeps down the SQUEAKY STEPS, covered by the sound of 
           the TV, heading to the front door. Trying to get out, as--

           --the pitbull sniffs through the house. Tracking her. 

           Both moving towards the SAME DOOR, on a collision course. 

           As she reaches the landing it appears, feet away. 

           She FREEZES. If it turns, she's dog food. It sniffs, then... 
           FOLLOWS her scent into the OTHER ROOM.

           She BACKS up the stairs. Slowly. Carefully. Then... SQUEAK. 
           A floorboard creaks under her foot. 

           The pitbull FREEZES. Turns. Heads for the stairs and finds--

           Nothing.

           Lila's up on the landing, hurrying back down the hall, into--

           THE LAST ROOM

           --where she HIDES BEHIND THE BED. But the dog has her scent 
           now. And it's fresh. It's SNUFFLING ALONG, coming fast-

           -as it ENTERS she SLIPS UNDER the BED, holding her breath as-

           ...click-click-click...

           Dog feet PAD PAST HER FACE, inches away. 
           And she realizes: she's NOT the only one HIDING UNDER HERE.

           RATS shrink back from the animal, trying to get away. 

           One SLITHERS ACROSS LILA'S arm. She stifles a scream.

           The DOG SNUFFLES at the bed's edge, right next to her so-

           Lila GRABS the RODENT and SHOVES it out. It SQUEAKS and RUNS-

           --and the PITBULL gives chase.

           Relieved, Lila turns to go and then realizes what the rats 
           were eating...

           ...Candy. Sweet Smiles candy. They pulled a bag under here.

                                 LILA
                        Motherfucker.

           She gets out from the bed. There's a PAINED SQUEAK as -- in 
           the next room, the PITBULL KILLS the rat. 

           She creeps up. It turns to see her and--

           SHE CLOSES THE DOOR, locking it in. It BARKS, THROWING 
           itself at the door, but--

           DOWNSTAIRS

           --Kovitch hears the scrambling upstairs.

                                 KOVITCH
                        QUIET!

           He turns up the volume on the TV. 

           UPSTAIRS

           Lila looks at the Sweet Smiles wrapper in her hand. Then 
           sees SEWING EQUIPMENT back in the room she just left: 
           needles, thread, stitch removers, and LOTS of SCISSORS. 

           ...takes her pick. Tries a couple on for size, feeling their 
           weight. Then finds one she really likes: a GIANT BOWIE KNIFE-
           SIZED PAIR. Razor sharp. She heads back...

           DOWN THE STAIRS

           ...creeping down. Making the landing. Sees Kovitch with his 
           back turned, watching TV.

           She stalks him. Scissors ready. 

           Closer. Closer. Closer. When suddenly...

           BUZZ goes her phone. She darts into a SIDE ROOM as Kovitch 
           turns. She silences the phone just as he SILENCES THE TV.
                                 KOVITCH
                        Boonie?

           He can hear the dog barking upstairs. 

                                 KOVITCH
                        Boonie?!

           Silence. Lila looks at her phone. The call reads HOME. 

           Kovitch growls, and walks past, heading up to see what the 
           fuck is wrong with his dog.

           As he SQUEAKS up the stairs, her PHONE VIBRATES AGAIN. A 
           SECOND CALL. She puts the phone to her ear...

                                 LILA
                         (whispers)
                        Troy?

                                 MAN'S VOICE (THROUGH PHONE)
                        No.

           Lila's blood runs cold. She knows this voice. It's the one 
           that lives in her nightmares. The VOICE she heard on the 
           phone the night Samantha was taken.

                                 MAN'S VOICE (THROUGH PHONE)
                        You've got a bad habit, Lila.

           Lila hears Kovitch talking upstairs at the same time.

                                 KOVITCH (O.S.)
                        How'd you get the fucking door 
                        closed? Fucking mutt...

           Shit. Whoever her masked psycho is, it ain't Kovitch. 

                                 MAN'S VOICE (THROUGH PHONE)
                        You're always poking around where 
                        you shouldn't be... leaving the 
                        people you care for alone.

           CLICK! The call disconnects. Lila's lips part as she 
           realizes the implications of the caller's final words.

                                 LILA
                         (whispers)
                        No. No-no-no-no-no--

           TAP! She opens the Ring Camera app. Looks at the grainy 
           footage inside her house. And in the LIVING ROOM CAM--

           --and something suddenly fills the frame: a SMILER MASK. One 
           of Smiler's gloved hands reaches up, as if it might come 
           through the phone and take hold of her throat--

           --and SWITCHES THE CAMERA OFF, LEAVING HER SCREEN BLACK.
           ALL AT ONCE

           Lila BOLTS out through the FRONT DOOR into--

           EXT. KOVITCH'S HOUSE - SAME

           --the street where she can see her house in the distance. 

           And she SPRINTS. Running on pure, lung-gnawing panic--

           --BEE-LINING TOWARDS HER FRONT DOOR.

           INT. LILA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           BAM! Lila bursts inside. Breath sawing, head on a swivel, 
           eyes scanning. Still gripping the scissors, she runs for--

           THE STAIRS

           --the floorboards CREAK under her feet as she moves up them, 
           into the upstairs hallway, and through the door to--

           MEGAN AND TROY'S ROOM

           --where she stops cold. Clasps a hand over her mouth. 

           Because... THE BEDS ARE EMPTY.

           Blankets strewn aside. No sign of the children. 

           Heart bruising her ribcage, scissors trembling in her hand, 
           she turns in a slow circle through the room--

           --mind swirling with a thousand panicked thoughts--

           --grabs her phone, calls 9-1-1.

                                 9-1-1 OPERATOR
                        9-1-1 emergency please hold--

           Behind her, the bedroom door SWINGS SLOWLY shut REVEALING 
           SMILER. The REAL one this time, holding A STAINLESS STEEL 
           SURVIVAL AXE (a hatchet with a curved grin for a blade).

           He stalks slowly behind her as she moves through the 
           upstairs room, scissors like a knife in front of her.  

                                 9-1-1 OPERATOR
                        --9-1-1, what's your emergency?--

           Squeak. The creaky floors in the old house give him away. 

           She DUCKS as the AXE whistles through the air above her. 

           She spins as he LUNGES towards her, SCREAMS, drops the 
           phone, and SLASHES at him with the scissors. 
           He dodges, FALLS BACK, and she races past-- 

           --but he GRABS HER LEG. She tumbles ass over teakettle. 
           Loses the scissors, but gets away. Kicking, scrambling as-- 

           --he crawls after, trying to grab her as she backs into--

           BARRY'S BEDROOM ACROSS THE HALL

           --kicking him in the face and just managing to shove the 
           door SHUT, LOCKING IT. Presses her back against the door.

           RATTLE. Someone on the other side tries the locked handle.

           FOOTSTEPS walking away. 

           Then silence. For a beat. And another. And another. Then--

           SUDDEN HEAVY FOOTFALLS APPROACHING AND--

           CRACK! The AXE SPLITS the old thin-wooden door RIGHT NEXT TO 
           HER HEAD. She screams, scrambles away as--

           --Smiler WAILS on the door like a lumberjack. The door is 
           tissue paper. Gonna be through in seconds. 

           Lila SPINS toward Barry's BEDSIDE TABLE. She yanks open a 
           drawer, revealing--

           --his HANDGUN. She grabs it, turns toward the door--

           --where the AXE hacks through the wood, seconds from cutting 
           out the section with the locked doorknob. 

           She steels herself, raises the gun, finger scrabbles at the 
           trigger and--

           --nothing happens. 

           There's a TRIGGER LOCK on the gun. Shit! 

           She WHIPS back to the bedside table, digs in the drawer... 

                                 LILA
                         (whispers)
                        --c'mon, keys, keys, keys--

           Some loose bullets, but NO KEYS. Shit! And right then--

           THWAK! A HAND GRABS HER ANKLE.

           Scream caught in her throat, she JOLTS--

           --and sees it's TROY. Having just crawled from his hiding 
           spot under the bed, Megan next to him, scared shitless. 
           Barely a few seconds for them to communicate, as--

           AT THE DOOR
           THUNK! The section of door with the doorknob is finally cut 
           free and hit the floor. WHAM! The door's kicked open and--

           --Smiler steps in. Sees the empty room before him...

           Beelines for the BED, looks under -- nothing.

           Looks to the floor-to-ceiling curtains. WHOOSH! Pulls them 
           aside with the survival axe -- nothing.

           Then looks to the MASTER BATHROOM. Door open an inch. Moves 
           toward it. And as he goes, we REVERSE POV TO REVEAL...

           INSIDE THE WALK-IN CLOSET

           ...Lila and the kids are hiding behind hanging clothes. 

           Trapped in here. Listening to Smiler stalking into the 
           bathroom just mere feet away, hunting...

           Through their terror, everyone does their damndest to be 
           silent. Hands clamped over mouths. Eyes bulging.

           Then... Troy makes a noise. A familiar sustained WHEEZE. 
           Tries to fight it, but he can't...

           Lila looks down and realizes: he's having an asthma attack. 

           Her face: oh dear god not now, please, not now... 

           IN THE MASTER BATHROOM

           WHOOSH! Smiler yanks back the shower curtain. Nothing.

           But then he pauses. Hears something. 

           Little ripples of staccato breath. Coming from back in 
           Barry's bedroom...

           INSIDE THE WALK-IN CLOSET

           Our heroes hear Smiler's boots approaching...

           ...step by horrible step... thump, thump, thump...

           ...Troy fighting like hell not to wheeze, holding his 
           breath, body wracked with tremors...

           ...thump, thump, thump... Smiler's boots exit the bathroom 
           and beeline across the bedroom for the closet door...

           ...nowhere to run, hiding spot about to be breached...

           ...we tighten on Lila... 

           ...and see an idea form in her eyes... she looks to Megan 
           and Troy, eyes silently communicating: get ready...
           ...and then we see it: she's holding her PHONE, open to 
           BARRY'S SPEAKER APP. Her shaking thumb uses the controls to 
           prime every speaker in the house to maximum volume...

           ...and just as the footsteps arrive at the closet door...

           ALL AT ONCE

           BOOM! Lila hits play and the room is BLASTED WITH EAR-
           SPLITTING MUSIC -- CCR'S "BAD MOON RISING" BLARES AS--

           SMILER 

           --jolts a 180 toward the noise coming from the BEDROOM 
           SPEAKERS behind him, just as--

           LILA

           --KICKS OPEN THE CLOSET DOOR WITH ALL HER MIGHT--

           --CRACK! Straight into Smiler's back, knocking him forward--

           --the axe goes spilling out of his hands onto the floor and 
           he lunges to grab it, as behind him--

           --Lila hauls Megan into her arms and bolts toward the 
           bedroom door with Troy, fleeing into--

           THE HALLWAY

           --straight toward the stairwell, Troy's lungs SEIZING UP as 
           they sprint, Lila pulling him along--

           --off Megan's SCREAM, Lila looks back to see--

           SMILER

           --emerging from Barry's room, axe in hand, giving chase--

           DOWN THE STAIRS

           --our heroes get to the front door, RIP it open--

           --and NICK FOLSOM steps in, gun drawn--

                                 LILA
                        He's inside-- He's inside-Right 
                        behind us--

                                 NICK
                        STOP!

           --Nick shoulders past them, aims his pistol and BANG! FIRES 
           his gun at Smiler at the top of the stairwell--

           --but Smiler FALLS back and the shot barely misses as--

           BANG-BANG-BANG! More bullets whiz past him--
           --SPRAYING PLASTER off the walls--

           --but Smiler's gone, vanished somewhere upstairs.

                                 NICK 
                        Go to the street and don't stop 
                        until you see another cop--

           Lila keeps moving with the kids, digging out Troy's inhaler 
           to stop his asthma attack, as--

           WE MOVE ALONG WITH NICK

           --racing up the stairs, service pistol aimed--

           --moving through the rooms. Covering the angles. Breath 
           heavy. Scared. Searching. 

           Finally, he gets to Barry's room...

           ...and sees an OPEN WINDOW, curtain blowing in the wind.

           Smiler's gone.

           EXT. LILA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The street is bathed in the FLASHING LIGHTS OF COP CARS. The 
           block's been shut down, trick-or-treaters banished indoors, 
           some adult LOOKY-LOOS hanging around their front yards.

           Barry's TOW TRUCK is parked out in front of the house. Lila 
           sits on the curb with Troy & Megan as Nick talks to Barry, 
           filling him in. After a beat, Barry comes over, angry.

                                 BARRY
                        You thought there was a kidnapper 
                        in the neighborhood... snatching 
                        up children... and you left my 
                        kids at home alone?

                                 LILA
                        It wasn't like that--

                                 BARRY
                        I don't know what the fuck is 
                        wrong with you--

                                 LILA
                        Barry--

                                 BARRY
                        --but enough. I don't want you 
                        around my kids ever again.

                                 LILA
                        Hold on--
                                 BARRY
                        Get the fuck out. Tonight. 
                        Understand? OUT.

                                 LILA
                        Where am I supposed to go?

                                 BARRY
                        Not my problem. 

           Barry picks his kids up, holding them tight. He doesn't look 
           at her again, but their scared eyes watch her as he carries 
           them into the house and closes the door. Off Lila, hurt...

           OVER WITH THE COPS

           Sheriff Betancourt has Nick and four other OFFICERS (TOBLER, 
           SHERMAN, ROTHERT, and CALHOUN), gathered around...

                                 SHERIFF
                        Jones, Tobler -- street patrol. 
                        Every block between here and the 
                        highway. Rothert, Calhoun -- 
                        you're on checkpoints. Folsom... 

           A BEAT LATER, OVER WITH LILA

           Nick heads over to her...

                                 NICK
                        Well, here's the good news: 
                        you're officially in protective 
                        custody. 

                                 LILA
                        Perfect timing, considering I 
                        just became homeless.

                                 NICK
                        Let's get you indoors before you 
                        get busted for vagrancy.

           That'd normally get a laugh from her. But not tonight.

           She glances over at Kovitch's across the street. Defeated.

                                 LILA
                        ...I thought it was him.

           She eyes her neighbors, watching quietly from their yards...

           ...Elaine Bowen, Jim Perkins, Mr. Mapes... Devin the 
           Butcher, watching her with a flat, neutral face. On the 
           porch of the party house, Brett O'Shea smirks and goes 
           inside. Nick kneels down before her, voice quiet...
                                 NICK
                        We're gonna catch this fucker. 
                        Okay? That's a promise. And I'm 
                        sorry I doubted you. I was wrong, 
                        you were right. You wanna record 
                        me saying that and use it as your 
                        ringtone, I'm cool with that.  

           And finally that gets a little laugh out of her. As they 
           rise and head for his house, we CUT TO: 

           INT. NICK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           They go inside. Nick's mom sits in her wheelchair, blanket 
           on top of her, drooling as she watches TV. He walks over, 
           gives her a smooch on top of her head.

                                 NICK
                        Need anything, ma?

           She doesn't respond. He takes a cup, gives her a sip of 
           water. She accepts it. He wipes her lips. Comes back over.

                                 LILA
                        That's gotta be hard.

                                 NICK
                         (shrugs)
                        One time when I was five, I peed 
                        in her jewelry box, so I guess 
                        taking care of me wasn't exactly 
                        a picnic. I need a beer, you need 
                        a beer? 

                                 LILA
                        Like a fish needs water. 

           He heads for the fridge, nods to her dirty clothes...

                                 NICK
                        Wanna' borrow a change of clothes 
                        to sleep in?

           She nods, as we CUT TO:

           POV SHOT - From outside the house. Someone watches them from 
           the darkness, through the windows.

           INT. NICK'S HOUSE, BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Fresh from the shower and clad in a towel, Lila wipes fog 
           off the bathroom mirror. Stares at herself. She looks raw. 

           BEDROOM: she finds the clothes Nick laid out for her. Pair 
           of running shorts, flannel shirt. She changes into them...
           ...and discovers that she likes the way his shirt smells on 
           her. A certain subliminal intimacy at play...

           INT. NICK'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Lila pads into the kitchen, barefoot. Nick looks up. The 
           sight of her legs in running shorts have an effect on him.

                                 NICK
                        Uh... hey. Beer?

           She takes the bottle. Sits on a stool.

                                 LILA
                        Thanks. 
                         (toasts her bottle)
                        Here's to tonight: may it get 
                        fucked forever.

                                 NICK
                         (clinks it)
                        Face down on a gravel road.

                                 LILA
                        It's weird...
                         (takes a drink)
                        ...you ever feel like you're a 
                        car crash just waiting to happen? 
                        Like you're barely held together, 
                        and all it's gonna take is one 
                        good hit and you'll explode?

                                 NICK
                        Sounds like me on one of my 
                        better days.

                                 LILA
                        You're a good guy, Nick.

                                 NICK
                         (tired)
                        People seem to think so.

           She considers him. Their faces close. Electricity.

           She KISSES HIM. 

           And suddenly they're all over each other. 

           She claws at his belt. His cop-gear slides to the floor -- 
           thunk. She reaches for his zipper--

                                 NICK
                         (panting)
                        Hang on. Hang on.
                         (nods to bathroom)
                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Be right back, kinda drank my 
                        weight in Red Bull tonight. 

           He kisses her again, then heads into the bathroom. She can 
           hear him start to pee. 

           There's a bowl of candy next to her. She takes a Tootsie 
           Roll, eats it. Sets the wrapper down...

           ...and pauses. 

           There's a PURPLE MARKER on the counter.

           She stares at it.

           Then... at the open TRASH CAN next to her. 

           A HALF-DOZEN CRUMPLED WRAPPERS inside. 

           Her blood runs cold. What if?...

           She hesitantly fishes them out. Unwraps them and... 

           ...finds messages scrawled on the inside. 

           Half written, over and over -- like someone practicing, 
           trying to get the handwriting right.

           The same harder, blockier handwriting she found on the decoy 
           notes, written in purple marker.

           It hits her: Nick wrote the decoy notes.

           Her heart's like a boxer trying to pummel out of her chest.

           The TOILET FLUSHES. 

           Her eyes DART down to Nick's police belt. Rushes for it--

           --but there's no gun. The holster is empty. Oh shit.

           OVER WITH NICK

           He comes down the hall and around the corner--

           --and Lila's back where she was before. Trying to play it 
           cool. To pretend like she's okay. Nick picks up his beer.

                                 NICK
                         (smiles)
                        So... where were we?

                                 LILA
                        I... uh... I shouldn't have done 
                        that. It's been a crazy night...
                         (beat)
                        I should just go to bed. Before I 
                        do anything I might regret...
                                 NICK
                        I would be thrilled to be one of 
                        your regrets--

                                 LILA
                         (cuts him off)
                        I'm sorry. I should just go.

           Nick stops. Eyes her. He's a cop, used to people lying to 
           him. He can smell it a mile away, and he smells it now.

                                 NICK
                        Not sure your brother's gonna be 
                        ready to talk yet...

                                 LILA
                        He's got an Irish temper.

           She looks past him, toward the door. He's blocking her path.

                                 NICK
                        Planning on bringing your clothes 
                        with you? Your shoes?

           She looks down -- realizes she's shoeless. 

           Nick examines her for a beat...

           ...then spots the purple marker left out on the counter. Oh. 
           He immediately Gets It. Smiles. 

           And the mask is lifted. His softness evaporates like breath 
           off a mirror, and the real him appears. 

                                 NICK
                        Looks like I fucked up.

           He takes a step closer to her. She plays innocent...

                                 LILA
                        What are you talking about?

                                 NICK
                        Can plan for just about 
                        everything. But something always 
                        slips past.

                                 LILA
                        I don't--

                                 NICK
                        Come on, Lila. You're smart. 
                        That's what I've always liked 
                        about you. It makes you fun. It 
                        makes you a challenge.

           She backs away as he closes in. Pulse throbbing...
                                 NICK
                        I had you there for a second. 
                        Think of all the places tonight 
                        could've gone. We both could've 
                        had fun...

           On his next words, his voice drops an octave. Becoming the 
           voice from the phone that night. 

                                 NICK
                        ...instead it'll just be me.

           He reaches into his jacket... and pulls his pistol--

           But Lila did grab something off his belt: his MACE CAN.

           FSSSHT! She sprays it point blank into his face--

                                 NICK
                        AAAAAAH!!!

           He CLAWS his face as SHE RUNS. 

           Winds through the house, past the drooling old lady. 

           Nick stumbles after. She rips the door open-- 

           RACES OUTSIDE

           --into the waiting arms of KOVITCH.

           Who TASERS HER IN THE THROAT. She goes down twitching. 

           She looks up with swimming eyes and sees..

           ...Kovitch and Nick looming over her, pulling her inside.

           FZZZT! She's zapped again. BLACKNESS.

           INT. FOLSOM'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Lila drifts in and out of consciousness: Nick and Kovitch 
           are carrying her through Nick's house. Drift to blackness.

           INT. BASEMENT STAIRS - NIGHT

           Awake again. Down the basement stairs, into a corridor...

           ...there’s a dimly-lit TUNNEL connecting Kovitch and Nick’s 
           houses under the street. 

           Dirt floor, wooden planks holding up the ceiling, lit by gas 
           lanterns. A haphazard piece of construction work, done by 
           passionate amateurs. 

           We drift to BLACKNESS. 
           INT. MURDER CAVE - NIGHT

           Lila wakes up. Shifts. CLINK. Finds herself HANDCUFFED to a 
           bar on the wall. She panics and SITS UP as we REVEAL...

           ...she's in an UNDERGROUND ROOM, with CINDERBLOCK WALLS, and 
           layers of SOUNDPROOFING. Gas lamps HISS, throwing shadows 
           across the floor. Scared, she YANKS on the cuffs--

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                         (a whisper)
                        ...won't help.

           Lila spins. Across the room is a DARK CORNER.

           A HAND reaches out of the shadows... also cuffed to a bar. 
           Lila stares, lungs clenched in terror...

                                 LILA
                        ...who... who are you...?

           Clink. The person steps toward the light... 

           ...is it Samantha?...

           No -- it's a girl named KRISTEN. 15. Voice hoarse. Clothes 
           streaked in grime, sweat, blood. Been here a while -- days, 
           maybe weeks. Zombie-like with fear and trauma. 

                                 LILA
                        You... you're the one who wrote 
                        this...

           She pulls the ORIGINAL NOTE from her pocket. The girl nods. 
           Seeing it, here, crushes her last glimmering hope of escape.

                                 KRISTEN
                        I tried... didn't matter... 
                        they're gonna kill us like they 
                        did the others...

                                 LILA
                        Others? 

           Lila follows her gaze to a ROW OF SHELVES. She didn't notice 
           at first, but now she realizes...

           ...there's something on the shelves.

           She moves toward them, cuffs sliding along the bar, slowly 
           getting closer. Closer. Closer. And finally--

           CLINK. The bar runs out. But she's CLOSE ENOUGH...

           Close enough to see JEWELRY across the shelves: Bracelets. 
           Rings. Necklaces. A dozen pieces. 12 victims. It's a SHRINE. 
           A collector's treasures.
           And among them... a familiar pair of earrings. Lila 
           realizes: it's the BANGLE EARRINGS she gave to Samantha on 
           their last night together.

           Lila can't help it; A SCREAM escapes her mouth. 

                                 KRISTEN
                        Don't. It only makes them 
                        angrier. I've been screaming for 
                        days, no one hears anything.

                                 LILA
                        I did. I did. I heard... in his 
                        house, I...

           And she realizes... Kovitch is the only one who'll hear. 
           From somewhere above, she hears a BOOM. Like a door opening.

           Kristen's face fills with fear. She retreats into shadows.

           Footsteps. Two sets. Getting closer.

           Lila backs up as far as she can go. Waits, as...

           ...Nick and Kovitch enter. Nick's eyes still red from the 
           mace. In the flickering gaslight, he looks demonic.

                                 NICK 
                        Good. You're awake.

           Kovitch grabs a chair to sit. Nick TAKES IT FROM HIM. Gives  
           a warning look, like an Alpha Dog over his dog bowl. And 
           strangely, Kovitch looks away, cowed...

                                 NICK 
                        Did you know bootleggers used to 
                        build hidden tunnels to smuggle 
                        their hooch? That's where I got 
                        this idea. Benefits of being a 
                        cop: besides being able to hide 
                        the evidence, you learn all the 
                        tricks.

                                 KOVITCH
                        We should do it. Do it now. I 
                        want her now.

           Kovitch is practically drooling, twitching hands reaching 
           towards his pants.

                                 NICK
                        Down boy.

           WHACK! Nick CUFFS him across the head. Kovitch shrinks back. 
           Like a naughty kid caught, and now ashamed. The difference 
           between the two? Nick's all ego and control. Kovitch is a 
           child, barely-controlled id. Nick lifts a hand to hit him 
           again, Kovitch flinches away...
                                 NICK
                         (to Lila)
                        That's his problem. He's 
                        impulsive. Doesn't think things 
                        through.
                         (to Kovitch, re: 
                          Kristen)
                        Like when you gave our guest a 
                        piece of candy and didn't notice 
                        she snuck a fucking note into the 
                        bowl. 

                                 KOVITCH
                         (quiet)
                        It's Halloween. I like Halloween--

           WHACK! Nick backhands him. Kovitch cowers, shielding his 
           head. Nick looks back to Lila, with a look that seems to say 
           "See what I'm working with here?" 

                                 LILA
                         (stares, whispers)
                        ...the fuck is wrong with you?...

                                 NICK
                        Better question, Lila, what the 
                        fuck is wrong with you? Anyone 
                        else would've left town after 
                        what happened to you. But you 
                        didn't. You stuck around. You 
                        never even got rid of the car. 
                         (off her stare)
                        The way you tortured yourself... 
                        I found it inspiring, honestly. 

           She stares at him, jaw trembling.

                                 LILA
                        ...why... why do you... do this?

                                 NICK
                        Same reason people climb Everest, 
                        drop acid, walk to Meccca.
                         (lifts up Smiler mask)
                        Looking into a girl's eyes, when 
                        she realizes this face is the 
                        last thing she's ever gonna see?  
                        Get one taste of that, all you 
                        want is more. I've gone looking 
                        for it everywhere...
                         (re: Kristen)
                        Had to drive all the way to 
                        Washington to find it this time. 

           He goes over to the trophy shelf and, almost reverently, 
           lifts Samantha's bangles...
                                 NICK
                        Still trying to figure out what 
                        happened that night? 

           Kovitch is getting excited. Shifting back and forth. 
           Breathing getting heavier... 

                                 NICK
                        Found a murdered prostitute in a 
                        truck stop bathroom up off the 
                        82, coupla' years back. 
                         (looks to Kovitch)
                        Didn't take me long to track it 
                        back to this fine specimen here. 

           If Kovitch detects Nick's sarcasm, it doesn't show.

                                 NICK
                        Could've put him in jail, but 
                        there was just so much raw talent 
                        there. So we started working 
                        together. Brains and brawn. 

                                 LILA
                        There were two of you... that 
                        night up on the point...

           FLASH -- Nick watching Lila and Samantha from the forest. 

                                 LILA
                        And in the house...

           FLASH -- in the house, Nick CHOPS at the door. Kovitch comes 
           up the stairs -- Nick hands the axe off, pulling off his 
           mask, heading down the stairs...

                                 NICK
                        You were getting too close. We 
                        needed to throw everyone off-- 

                                 LILA
                        --so you could blame it all on 
                        someone else. Like you did with 
                        Will Halforth. For Sam's death.
                         (off his stare)
                        ...why her?

                                 NICK
                        Could've been anyone. But 
                        personally, my theory?...

           He puts Samantha's bangle earrings down on a little 
           pedestal, just out of reach...

                                 NICK
                        I think it was fate. I think it 
                        was God rewarding us with a gift.  
                                 LILA
                         (dripping with venom)
                        She was my friend. Yours too. 

                                 NICK
                        And we saw how that worked out 
                        for her. She was the second-most 
                        disposable person I've ever met. 
                         (smiles)
                        Any guesses who the first one is?
                         (to Kovitch)
                        Hold her down.

           Kovitch rises, unleashed, excited. Heads towards her. Lila 
           tries to back away... but she can't. She fights. He pins her 
           down with his huge, powerful arms.

                                 NICK
                        Start with her mouth. 

           Kovitch uses one big meaty paw to open her mouth. Nick grabs 
           a pair of PLIERS, reaches them inside...

           ...and clamps down on a tooth. 

           She HOWLS IN AGONY as he works the tool back and forth.

           Kristen grinds her face into her hands in a silent scream.

           The pliers in Lila's mouth PULL A TOOTH FREE as--

           INT. LILA'S HOUSE, GARAGE - NIGHT

           THUNK! A key twists in a lock and a car trunk UNLOCKS as we  
           reveal Barry with Megan and Troy in the garage, loading 
           hastily packed suitcases into the trunk of his sedan...

                                 BARRY
                         (mid-spiel)
                        ...it's gonna be an adventure, 
                        alright? We're gonna find a nice 
                        hotel to stay in until the house 
                        gets fixed up. How's that sound?

                                 MEGAN
                         (ignores the question)
                        Is Lila really not coming back?

                                 BARRY
                        We'll talk about that in the 
                        morning, okay? 

                                 TROY
                        You said you didn't want her to 
                        ever see us again.
                                 BARRY
                        Kiddo, your Aunt Lila has a lotta 
                        things she needs to work out--

                                 MEGAN
                        I don't want her to go away.
                         (beat)
                        And you were mean to her.

           Barry looks to his kids. Coming to grips with how he feels 
           like shit about how he blew up at Lila as we CUT TO: 

           INT. MURDER CAVE - NIGHT

           Lila's BLOODY TOOTH, held in Nick's fingers, gets set down 
           on the trophy shelf. Lila seethes in pain, hand to her 
           mouth, red leaking from between her fingers... 

           ...as Nick kneels down before her. Watching her keen.

                                 NICK
                        There you are. There's my pretty 
                        girl.

           She SPITS BLOOD into his face. 

                                 LILA
                        You're fucking weak.
                         (off his look)
                        You're big and strong when you've 
                        got your gun, and your mace, and 
                        your badge, and your fucking 
                        monster to hold women down. But 
                        without them, you're fucking 
                        weak, and pathetic, and small. 
                        You like hurting women because 
                        you don't stand a chance against 
                        anyone else.

                        didn't I?

           Kovitch looks angry and hurt at the same time.

                                 LILA
                        I'd like to see how long you last 
                        down here, Nick. I bet you'd 
                        break in seconds. I bet you'd cry 
                        and beg and piss yourself.

                          scalpel)
                        Cut something off. Something fun. 
           DING-DONG! They freeze. A DOORBELL CHIME on a speaker...

                                 NICK
                        Fuck.

                                 KOVITCH
                        We don't have to answer.

                                 NICK
                        Yes. We do. I'm already gonna 
                        have to lie my ass off about why 
                        she's disappeared.
                         (a beat, then)
                        FUCK. Watch her.

           He puts the scalpel down on the shelf, then exits, leaving 
           Kovitch behind.

           EXT. NICK'S HOUSE, FRONT ENTRY - NIGHT

           Barry waits outside Nick's door. Nick opens the door, 
           yawning, looking sleepy, like he's just woken up.

                                 BARRY
                        Hey, sorry-- can I talk to Lila?

                                 NICK
                        I wish. She took off, probably 
                        six shots deep at Maloney's by 
                        now.

                                 BARRY
                        Thought she was in protective 
                        custody?

                                 NICK
                        Thing about protective custody 
                        is: you have to want to be in 
                        protective custody.
                         (off his "what?" look)
                        She's gone. You told her you 
                        didn't want her coming back. I 
                        think she took it kinda hard.

                                 BARRY
                        Oh Jesus...

                                 NICK
                        Now I told her that you'd change 
                        your mind. That you'd probably be 
                        fine in the morning. But she said  
                        you were right. That she always 
                        hurts the people she cares about.

                        Kinda bender she's goin' on? Be 
                        glad she's on foot. Besides, 
                        y'really think she wants that 
                        around her tonight? That reminder 
                        of what happened?

                                 BARRY
                         (pales)
                        Oh fuck. Oh fuck me. 

           As Barry looks away, Nick's mask slips. We can see him 
           enjoying the pain he's causing.

           INT. MURDER CAVE - SAME

           Kovitch watches them. Lila meets his eyes. He looks away.

                                 LILA
                        You don't like it when people 
                        look at you. When they see what 
                        you're doing.

           He won't meet her eyes. Bingo.

                                 LILA
                        He's not your friend. He's not 
                        your buddy. He's not like... 
                        what's your dog's name? Boonie? 
                        You're sweet with him. Like you 
                        really care about him.

                                 KOVITCH
                        He's my dog.

                                 LILA
                        You're nice to him. I've seen it. 
                        But that asshole upstairs? He 
                        treats you worse than a dog.

                                 KOVITCH
                        He saved me... he coulda put me 
                        away...

                                 LILA
                        He's using you. He treats you 
                        like you're worthless.
                         (reaching)
                        I know what that feels like. To 
                        be seen as worthless.

           Kovitch meets her eyes. She's getting through to him.

                                 LILA
                        You know how people see me here. 
                        How they think of me. How they 
                        think of us...
                                 LILA (CONT’D)
                                 LILA (CONT’D)
                         (still reaching)
                        You think Nick's keeping you 
                        around because he's your friend? 
                        No. Nick's keeping you around 
                        because he's going to use you as 
                        a patsy.

                                 KOVITCH
                        That's not true--

                                 LILA
                        Think about it. When the cops get 
                        too close, who better than the 
                        creepy hoarder-- 
                         (quickly, off his hurt)
                        --not my words, that's what he'll 
                        say. Who better than you to take 
                        the fall when things go wrong? He 
                        already did it once with Will 
                        Halforth. Probably killed him in 
                        jail so he could blame all his 
                        sick shit on him. Why not do it 
                        to you too? He doesn't care about 
                        you.

                                 KOVITCH
                        He does, I know it, he--

                                 LILA
                        He doesn't CARE.

                                 KOVITCH
                        NO!

           He raises a fist to come after her. She shrinks back... 

           ...and tries a gambit on him. Something we recognize from 
           her therapy session this morning. 

                                 LILA
                        What do you really want from 
                        life? No... really. Close your 
                        eyes. And think about what you 
                        want.

           Kovitch hesitates...

                                 LILA
                        Just try it. We're not going 
                        anywhere. What can it hurt?

           And then... he does. He closes his eyes.

                                 LILA
                        Now imagine the future...

           Lila looks around. Sees the pedestal. The bangle earrings. 
           Tries to reach it with her hand...
                                 LILA
                        ...do you want to be his dog? Or 
                        do you want to be free? Do you 
                        want kindness? Do you want people 
                        to like you... to love you?

           Kovitch's face smooths. Like a stormy ocean calming on a 
           placid day as...

           ...Lila's hand can't quite reach...

           ...so she looks at KRISTEN. The pedestal is closer to her. 

           Gives her a look. 

           Kristen shakes her head; please, no, you'll get us killed. 

                                 LILA
                        Imagine people smiling at you. 
                        You're the one who saved 
                        everyone. Don't you want that?

           Kovitch has no answer, but there are TEARS flowing down from 
           his tight-shut eyes. Kristen sees it...

           ...and overcomes her fear. Reaches with her leg. Just BARELY 
           manages to touch the pedestal with her foot. Applies 
           pressure. TIPS IT... silently begging for the earrings to 
           slide off toward Lila's outstreched hand...

                                 LILA
                        Imagine people applauding for 
                        you...
                         (the earrings start to 
                          slide a bit)
                        ...imagine... beautiful women 
                        calling your name... 
                         (and a little bit more)
                        ...imagine them... imagine them 
                        in love with you. 

           The bangles FALL off toward the floor....

           ...and Lila's fingers PLUCK THEM FROM THE AIR. A glance 
           between her and Kristen -- holy fucking shit. Lila, shaking 
           hands holding the bangles, keeps talking...

                                 LILA
                        Imagine women... wanting you... 

           Lila silently works an earring into the lock, trying to pick 
           it like we saw before... 

                                 LILA
                        They want you... inside them...

           Twisting, turning, tugging... Kristen watching with wide 
           eyes, breath frozen in her throat...
                                 LILA
                        They want you to do whatever you 
                        please with them...

           It POPS OPEN. She's free. Then Lila creeps along, inching 
           toward the SCALPEL on the shelf, almost in reach...

           ...gets her hands on the blade...

                                 LILA
                        They want you to die.

           Confused, he opens his eyes and--

           SHE LUNGES AT HIM.

           SLASH! SLICES his throat open. He clutches at his wound, 
           horrified. BLOOD COMES SHEETING OUT THROUGH HIS FINGERS--

                                 LILA
                         (swings the scalpel)
                        You sick FUCK--

           HE COMES BARRELING AT HER. Trying to hold his throat closed 
           with one hand, grabbing at her with the other as--

           --Lila backs away, SLASHING with the scalpel, locked in a 
           gruesome two-step -- nicking his fingers, forearm, face--

           --but Kovitch SLAMS INTO HER, shoving her back--

           --she drops the scalpel, it skitters away--

           WHAM! He's pinning her against the wall, forcing her to a 
           sitting position-- 

           --forearm smashed against her throat, his neck wound GUSHING 
           onto her, his breath coming out in SLURPS--

           --Lila's face starts to go PURPLE--

           --SHE CLAWS AT HIS HANDS, LOSING CONSCIOUSNESS WHEN--

           SHUNK! He suddenly has a SCALPEL STICKING OUT OF HIS EAR. 

           Kovitch pauses. STIFFENS. And we reveal...

           KRISTEN 

           ...standing behind him, at the very end of her strained-to-
           the-max chain. She backs away as--

           Kovitch twitches. Blinks. Focuses on Lila...

           ...who winds her hand back and--

           BAM! Hits the scalpel handle with her palm, like a hammer to 
           a nail. BAM! BAM! Until half of the scalpel's handle 
           disappears into his skull. Then...

           WHUMPH! He falls back and COLLAPSES in a heap. Dead.

                                 LILA
                         (gasping for air)
                        ...holyshit...holyshit...

           She rises, an angel in crimson... nods a thank-you to 
           Kristen, who nods a freaked-out one back...

           ...then Lila takes Samantha's other bangle earring and uses 
           it to pick the lock on Kristen's chain.

           EXT. NICK'S FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

           Nick finishes up talking to Barry...

                                 NICK
                        ...look, don't beat yourself up. 
                        I'm sure you'll hear from her.

                                 BARRY
                        Yeah... I, uh...

                                 NICK
                        I'm sure she'll forgive you. You 
                        just wait for that call... Okay?

                                 BARRY
                        Thank you... I uh... I gotta go.

                                 NICK
                        Of course.

           From across the street, they hear a SCREAM. But it's just 
           the pre-recorded bullshit from Jim Perkins' Haunted House.

                                 BARRY
                        I'm gonna tear that fucking thing 
                        down. G'night.

           He pats Barry on the shoulder. Notices... a tiny bit of 
           blood gets on Barry's shirt. Shit. 

           But Barry's too broken to notice. He heads back to his 
           house. Nick watches him go as--

           INT. MURDER CAVE - NIGHT

           CLICK. Kristen's shackles come off. Lila looks at the 
           earrings and whispers....

                                 LILA
                        Thank you, Sam.
           She puts them in a pocket. Picks up a hammer. Holds 
           Kristen's hand in hers.

                                 LILA
                        I'm gonna get you out of here.

           They go out of the room, up the stairs...

           ...but it SPLITS outside the room. Which way? 

           With no idea, they just take one, heading up one set of 
           stairs. There's a SOUNDPROOFED door at the end. 

           They open it to reveal...

           INT. NICK'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           ...NICK FOLSOM'S HOUSE. We realize: what looked like a 
           bookshelf was actually a secret entry down to the tunnel.

           They peer through the crack. But see nothing.

           Panicked breaths, and then... one, two, three...

           ...they creep out of the door. 

           Heading towards the front when--

           A MOAN.

           They turn to see CYNTHIA FOLSOM, Nick's mother, in her 
           wheelchair. Staring at them.

           For a moment, they worry she'll give them away. The old lady 
           raises a HAND and--

           CLINK. We see it's HANDCUFFED to her wheelchair. 

           A RATTLING SOUND emerges from her damaged vocal cords, her 
           wide eyes wordlessly begging for help, when--

           --they DART INTO HIDING as Nick appears, carrying a 
           breakfast tray with a BOTTLE OF MEDICINE and a SYRINGE.

           Nick's mom frantically tries to push it away.

                                 NICK
                        Hold still. 

                                 CYNTHIA FOLSOM 
                         (a raspy croak)
                        ...leggo... lemmego...

                                 NICK
                        Hold. Still.
                                 CYNTHIA FOLSOM 
                        ...stop... please...

           She looks past Nick, to them for help. But he INJECTS her, 
           and we watch her whole body collapse.

           Consciousness FADES from her. She looks like a stroke victim 
           again. And then--

           Nick SEES them watching in the reflection of the window.

           He spins. The women run. The only way they can, back into--

           THE STAIRWELL

           Nick races to follow. But Cynthia grabs onto his belt. He 
           struggles to get away, SLAPS HER--  

           She doesn't let go. He hits her again, and again-- it's her 
           last defiant moment -- she CLINGS ON STUBBORNLY until--

           He grabs a HEAVY STONE SCULPTURE and CAVES IN the side of 
           her head. She goes down. Dead.

           But she's bought our heroes time. They run down...

           THE UNDERGROUND PASSAGE

           Nick hits the stairs, but they're already running up the 
           OTHER SET OF STAIRS. WHAM! They hit the door to--

           INT. KOVITCH'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           --Kovitch's house. She pulls Kristen along as she races for 
           the front door--

                                 LILA
                        Follow me.

           --weaving through the HEDGE MAZE OF PILED TRASH. 

           Her bare feet get PUNCTURED by bits of glass and sharp 
           debris on the floor. She hisses in pain, wincing back tears-- 

           --and keeps rushing ahead as--

           UPSTAIRS, the pitbull still BARKS, trapped in the room.

           They hit the front door. But it's got all those locks on it. 
           Lila tries to tear them free, but Nick is right behind them, 
           charging around the corner--

           --barely a second to spare, nowhere else to go--

                                 LILA
                        RUN.
           UP THE STAIRS THEY GO

           Nick grabs a KITCHEN KNIFE from one of the plates. Follows 
           them up the stairs to...

           THE UPPER LEVEL

           Lila and Kristen run for their lives. Lila can hear the DOG 
           BARKING and the rats scampering in the ceiling...

           ...what sounds like HUNDREDS OF THEM contained by the thin 
           membrane of drywall above her...

           As Nick comes up the stairs toward them...

           ...Lila's eyes settle on something we don't yet see, a plan 
           forming in her mind...

           ...then she spins to face him and--

           WHOOSH! She throws her hammer at him--

           --HE DUCKS. IT MISSES! THUNKS INTO THE DRYWALL by his head.

           Nick, grinning, looks from the hammer over to her--

           --and the grin vanishes off his face as she GRABS THE CORD 
           TO THE ATTIC ACCESS DOOR IN THE CEILING, YANKS IT -- WHAM! 

           Pouring out of the attic comes AN AVALANCHE OF RATS, coming 
           down the sloping access door, dumping like rain down onto--

           NICK

           --who SCREAMS as he falls back, covered in a plague of flesh-
           hungry rodents. 

           Swats at them as one BITES HIS FACE, takes a chunk of cheek. 
           He rips it free and SMASHES IT INTO THE WALL--

           --STOMPING others until they're squashed hairy blood-bags.

           Then STORMS after our heroes, down the hall as--

           BOW-WOW-WOW-WOW! The pitbull throws itself into the door, 
           trying to get out, hearing the sounds outside as--

           --Lila turns the handle, letting the door loose, then darts 
           into the next room, shutting the door as--

           --the pitbull LEAPS again, and the door SLAMS open, and the 
           dog lands, attacking the first thing it sees -- Nick.

           Nick STABS the dog. It YELPS. STABS it again. Kicks it away, 
           the dog scampers off with his KNIFE still in its body as--

           --Nick reaches into his pocket for a new weapon as--
           IN THE NEXT ROOM

           Lila pushes Kristen out onto the roof. 

                                 LILA
                        Go! Go!

           She climbs out as-

           --THUNK! A hypodermic needle smashes into Lila’s back. 
           Courtesy of Nick, using his mom's “medicine” against her. 

           Lila’s legs give out--

           --and she's sent rolling off the roof, taking Kristen with 
           her, as they go flying off the ledge into...

           THE NEIGHBOR'S YARD

           ...crashing through wooden slats and chicken wire--

           --slamming hard into the ground. WHAM! A door SLAMS SHUT 
           across from them as they realize they’ve fallen into...

           EXT. JIM PERKINS' BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           ...THE AUTO-LOCKING CAGE IN THE PERKINS' HAUNTED MAZE.

           The hypodermic needle's still sticking out of Lila's back. 
           The plunger never got depressed. Thank God. Wind knocked out 
           of her, she PULLS it free and tosses it away with shaking 
           hands. Tries to scream out to the neighborhood--

                                 LILA
                        ...heeeeelp...
                         (getting her wind back)
                        HEEEEEELP!!!

           But there's just another SCREAM from the sound effects 
           around her. No one reacts. No one comes to help.

           They try to tear the cage open when--

           WHAM! Someone does appear -- Brett O'Shea, everyone's 
           favorite, coming over from the party house next door, 
           entering through the side fence. 

                                 BRETT
                         (bemused)
                        The hell y'doing out here, Lila, 
                        they shut everything down--

                                 LILA
                        --help us-- open the door--
                                 BRETT
                         (sees Kristen, to Lila)
                        Are you, like, babysitting or 
                        something?

                                 LILA
                        BrettLOOKOUT--

                                 BRETT
                        What?

           GUSH! Nick, wearing the Smiler mask, appears behind Brett 
           and stabs him between the shoulder blades.

           Brett stumbles around, scream caught in his throat. Face to 
           face with the killer he was merely pretending to be earlier.

                                 BRETT
                         (a wheezy whisper)
                        ...what the... fuck--

           SLASH! Nick GUTS BRET, pelvis to sternum. As Brett drops to 
           the ground, insides spilling out--

           Nick approaches the cage. Pulls open the door.

           Backs Lila into the corner, ignoring Kristen, intent on 
           killing the one who's caused him so much trouble.

           But Kristen sees the hypodermic needle on the ground. 

           She grabs it--

           --and STABS his leg with it. Depresses the plunger.

           Nick falls, yanks the needle out as--

           --they race past him--

           He comes after, stumbling a little now as...

           ...our heroes make it OUT INTO THE STREET...

           ...and LILA sees it: her CAR, parked across from them. Her 
           Crown Vic with the cracked windshield. 

                                 LILA
                        Come on--

           She grabs Kristen, and they race to the car. Lila digs her 
           car keys out of her pocket, gets in. Ditto Kristen.

           FIRES UP THE ENGINE, and--

           WHAM! Nick SLAMS into the side, lunging through the window, 
           CLAWING at her face -- drugged but not down for the count-- 
                                 NICK
                        You can't get away from me.

           --she fumbles the car into drive, SCREECHING away--

           He YANKS the rear door open, and DIVES INTO the rear seat, 
           hooking an arm around her neck from behind--

           Kristen SCREAMS as Lila STRUGGLES, BENT BACK, GAGGING--

           --HER FOOT INADVERTENTLY STOMPS on the gas and they SPEED 
           OUT OF CONTROL, Nick's open door flopping wildly--

           --and hit the intersection, FLYING over the curb into--

           THE WOODED PARK

           --the Crown Vic CRASHING through BUSHES, MOWING down 
           SAPLINGS, TREE LIMBS SCRAPING the roof, BRANCHES SEVERED 
           CLEAN OFF TRUNKS, and then--

           --she CLIPS a tree, and they SPIN OUT OF CONTROL-- and Nick 
           TUMBLES out, the car SLIDING TO A HALT.

           She stares out the cracked front window as Nick rises, 
           standing in her high-beams, chest heaving. Mask broken on 
           his face -- showing half Nick, half Smiler.

           He GRINS at her.

           Lila stares at him. And then GRINS BACK. Past and present 
           blur as WHAM! Lila throws it into DRIVE, slams the gas--

           --Nick's face turns to OH SHIT-- he tries to dodge, but Lila 
           beelines straight at him--

           PLOWS INTO HIM-- THWACK! He SMASHES INTO THE WINDSHIELD-

           --SPLINTERS IT INTO A MASS OF CRUSHED ICE, BOUNCES OVER--

           --TUMBLES to the ground behind it with a sickening CRUNCH.

           The car SKIDS TO A HALT a few feet in front of him. Smoke 
           billowing from the tailpipe as the engine GROWLS. 

           Is it gonna reverse back and run him over?? Nick lies there, 
           trying to move. Trying to Get Up. 

           Manages to lift up to his elbows to see the car door open. 
           Lila pads back towards him. He can barely move or speak.

                                 NICK
                        ...kill you... gonna fuckin' kill 
                        you...

           On the ground, there's A HEAVY, GNARLED TREE BRANCH severed 
           from its trunk by the crashing Crown Vic. Lila picks it up. 
           Grips it tight. Looks to Kristen in the car.
                                 LILA
                        What's your name?

                                 KRISTEN
                         (barely a whisper)
                        ...Kristen...

                                 LILA
                        Look away, Kristen.

           Kristen does as told, and... BAM! LILA SWINGS THE BRANCH AT 
           NICK'S HEAD. We DRIFT UP from the bloody scene, SPIRALING 
           INTO THE DARKNESS ABOVE, into the FULL MOON, as we CUT TO:

           INT. MURDER CAVE - NIGHT

           Nick's eyes open. He's on the floor, chained to the wall 
           inside his TORTURE CAVE. Face smashed from the branch and 
           the windshield impact. Rat bites all over. 

           WHAM! He's rolled onto his back. Groans. Looks up to see... 
           Lila. Taking a seat in his chair.

                                 NICK
                        Kovitch! KOVITCH!

                                 LILA
                        Took him upstairs. The cops have 
                        his body. Everything you've done 
                        tonight, they think he did it.

                                 NICK
                        ...you're not gonna get away with 
                        this... they'll come looking for 
                        me...

                                 LILA
                        They'll never find you. Because 
                        they'll be searching out there... 
                        and you're down here.
                         (smiles)
                        And you hid this place so well, 
                        didn't you?

                                 NICK
                        What do you want?

                                 LILA
                        Tell me what you did to my 
                        friend. Everything. Every last 
                        detail.

                                 NICK
                        What... you wanna know that I 
                        broke her bones? Cut her fingers 
                        off? 
                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Kept her alive for months as I 
                        took every little piece of what 
                        made her human? You sure that's 
                        what you wanna hear?

           She gets up and walks along the wall, looking at all of the 
           tools that are sitting there.

                                 NICK
                        You think you can scare me? You 
                        think you can do anything to me? 
                        I know you. You don't have it in 
                        you. You're not like me.

                                 LILA
                        You're right.
                         (turns)
                        I'm not like you. I'm not that 
                        angry. Not with you. Not him. Not 
                        even me, anymore. Because what 
                        you are? Nobody can plan for 
                        that. You're just a disease. An 
                        infection. A sudden illness. A 
                        mistake in the universe. So no, 
                        I'm not angry.
                         (comes close)
                        But I know someone who is.

           The door behind her, which was ajar, opens fully now. To 
           reveal Elaine Bowen. Samantha's mother. 

           She steps in like a cold winter's wind. Clear that this 
           woman heard EVERYTHING he just said.

           Colors drains from Nick's face. Gut-shredding TERROR.

                                 LILA
                        Mrs. Bowen?...

           Lila hands her the same PLIERS that Nick used on Lila. 

                                 LILA
                        Happy Halloween.

           And with a shared look of understanding between the two 
           women, Lila heads for the exit. Elaine makes for Nick.

                                 NICK
                        Don't... please please oh GOD NO--

           Nick's words become gibberish as Elaine put the PLIERS into 
           his mouth. He SCREAMS as she goes to work.

           Lila shuts the door behind her. Leaving us only with Nick's 
           garbled screams of agony as we SMASH TO BLACK.

                               SIX MONTHS LATER
           INT. LILA'S HOUSE - BEDROOM

           Tight on a suitcase. Clothes get put in. Widen to Lila 
           packing her bags. She picks up the picture of her and Sam,  
           the one that Elaine gave her.

           She packs it. Then... puts on some earrings. The ones she 
           gave to Samantha. Dinged and damaged, but intact.  

           Stares at the mirror. Likes what she sees for a change.

           EXT. LILA'S HOUSE - DAY

           Megan and Troy tag along as Barry helps Lila get her bags 
           into her NEW CAR. The old Crown Vic is long gone. 

                                 BARRY
                        You sure you're ready for this? 
                        New York's a big jump.

                                 LILA
                         (a nod; for Samantha)
                        I'm ready.

           He's quiet. Guilt-ridden. Gives her a hug. Tight. 

                                 BARRY
                        I'm sorry about everything. You 
                        don't have to leave--

                                 LILA
                        No. I do.
                         (kindly)
                        You're a good dad. And a good 
                        brother. And we're alright.

           He hesitates, then nods. Ok.

                                 BARRY
                        See you over the holidays?

                                 LILA
                        Any one but Halloween.

           She looks around the community for one last time. Eyes Nick 
           Folsom's old house. A FOR SALE SIGN out front.

                                 BARRY
                        Can't believe they're trying to 
                        sell that house. Who the hell's 
                        gonna buy that thing?

                                 LILA
                        Nobody.

           Some KIDS come down the sidewalk, warily watching the house 
           as they pass it, keeping their distance. Troy, watching them-
                                 TROY
                        My friends talk about that place. 
                        They say on quiet days, if you 
                        listen just right, you can hear 
                        ghosts of dead people in there...

                                 LILA 
                        Y'got some weird-ass friends.

                                 TROY
                        Not as weird as you.

                                 LILA
                         (ruffles his hair)
                        No one is. 

           She hugs the kids goodbye and heads for her car.

                                 TROY AND MEGAN
                        Bye Aunt Lila!/Love you!/Have fun 
                        in New York!

                                 LILA
                        Love you, monsters! Be good! 

           She blows them kisses as she drives off. Watches her family 
           get smaller in her rear-view mirror. Then looks over at...

           NICK FOLSOM'S HOUSE as she passes it.

           Slows down to a stop. Idles. 

           Rolls down the window and... listens.  

           Then a trace of a SMILE forms on her face. 

           She rolls up the window. Drives off. Leaving us behind.

           Then, slowly, slowly... we push in on the house.

           The ambient sounds of pleasant suburbia rise, louder...

           Faint, almost inaudible... perhaps it's just the wind...

                                 NICK (O.S.)
                        ...heeeeeeeellllpppp 
                        meeeeeeeee....

           And we SMASH TO BLACK.
