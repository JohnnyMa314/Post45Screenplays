           Subtle sounds of the morning quiet. Crickets chirping. 

           TITLE CARD: GEORGIA, USA, 1802

           EXT. BELMONT PLANTATION - MORNING

           Just before dawn. Everything is still. Fog hovers over a 
           large cotton field. The field seems to go on forever until we 
           arrive at an impressive home, the Big House, with a large 
           porch facing a tall oak tree. 

           Rows of small wooden cabins. Subtle sounds of slaves asleep. 
           Light snoring. A toss or turn. We arrive at the window of one 
           cabin in particular.

           INT. SLAVE CABIN - NIGHT

           We push in to the window. A white fabric, a curtain perhaps, 
           falls into frame. 

           We find GRACE (30, dark skinned), asleep. 

           THUMP.

           Grace slowly opens her eyes; they move upward towards the 
           sound.

           That white fabric, is in fact a nightgown. We discover a 
           young girl, LENA (11, brown skinned) is levitating, asleep, 
           high above Grace. 

           Grace gasps. 

           She quietly stands up and extends her hand toward Lena. Lena 
           is just out of Grace’s reach. 

           Grace freezes at the sound of people waking and getting 
           dressed in the next room. Someone could walk toward the front 
           door and easily see Lena.

           Grace quickly grabs a chair. She steps onto the chair, places 
           one hand above Lena’s belly and the other below her back, and 
           slowly guides her floating body to their cot on the floor.

           Grace, now on her knees, looks over Lena as she remains 
           asleep, simply turning over toward her mother. 

                                 (O.S.) EDITH
                        What you doin’?? 
           Grace stifles a jump, and looks toward the loud whisper. 

                                 EDITH
                        Sun’ll soon be up now. 

           EDITH (30s, dark skinned) is standing there, dressed, holding 
           an empty canvas bag. 

           Grace studies Edith’s face. It doesn’t seem like Edith saw 
           anything.

                                 GRACE
                        We comin’.

           Edith exits. Grace exhales as she looks back at her sleeping 
           daughter. She kisses Lena’s forehead in an effort to wake 
           her. 

           Lena opens her eyes. 

           The stress on Grace’s face melts. She smiles.

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        Nightmare?

           Lena nods.

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        C’mon little one. Hurry up and get 
                        dressed. 

           Lena sleepily complies. 

           EXT. BELMONT COTTON PLANTATION - MORNING

           Field slaves fill the rows of the cotton field. Brown fingers 
           picking cotton. A pregnant woman, HATTIE (35) pulls weeds in 
           the hot sun. 

           One BOY (12) picks cotton cautiously, his fingertips are 
           starting to bleed. 

           Grace picks with great focus and experience compared to the 
           boy. 

           Grace keeps an eye on Lena, who struggles to carry a large 
           bucket of water for the field slaves. Behind Grace is an 
           overseer, JOHN (white, 30), who watches the slaves closely on 
           his horse.
           EXT. BELMONT COTTON PLANTATION - AFTERNOON

           Lena plays with a FIVE YEAR OLD BLACK GIRL who wears nothing 
           but a tattered shirt. Their bodies zip past the stalks. 

           Lena grins with her playmate as they play in the soil. 

           The adult field slaves are waiting in line, having their 
           cotton weighed. They look exhausted. Grace is amongst them. 

           The pregnant woman, Hattie, looks toward the Big House. 
           Something has grabbed her attention. She drops her bag of 
           cotton and starts running. 

           Grace’s eyes follow her as a fellow MALE FIELD SLAVE (20s) 
           grabs Hattie before she can reach where she’s headed. Hattie 
           screams and pleads as a light-skinned LITTLE GIRL (7) and 
           LITTLE BOY (6) are placed in the back of a cart. 

           MASTER HENRY (30s, white, wealthy) calmly walks down from the 
           porch. Hattie’s eyes follow him, pleadingly. 

                                 HATTIE
                        Please Massa, please don’t take my 
                        babies, please please....

                                 HENRY
                            (as if he didn’t hear her, 
                             addresses the Slave 
                             Trader)
                        Come on now I told y’all to be gone 
                        before the hands come back, now go 
                        on. 

                                 SLAVE TRADER
                        Sorry Sir, had to feed the horse 
                        before we went on our way. 

           The SLAVE TRADER (40s, white man), tilts his cap and offers a 
           discomforting smile. He lifts his reigns, and the horse and 
           cart move to leave the plantation. 

           Lena stops playing at the sound of Hattie’s weeping. She 
           moves toward Grace.

           Lena watches her mother’s eyes follow a distraught Hattie 
           being comforted and lead by a GROUP OF FIELD SLAVE WOMEN 
           toward the cabins. 

           Lena’s eyes follow Master Henry as he calmly walks back 
           inside the Big House. 

           Lena looks at Grace, still standing there watching her worst 
           nightmare.
           EXT. BELMONT PLANTATION - NIGHT

           Grace walks toward the Big House, holding Lena’s hand. It 
           looms over them as they approach the back door.

                                 GRACE
                            (to Lena)
                        Stay close to me. 

           INT. KITCHEN - BIG HOUSE - NIGHT

           A few of the house slaves are seated at a table near the back 
           door, eating cornmeal mush out of wooden bowls and spoons. 
           They’re more formally dressed than Grace and Lena, who look 
           out of place, but Grace still looks poised and focused. This 
           space seems warm, jokes being exchanged. Smiles.

           ALICE (late 50s, light skinned, grey hair, tough but kind 
           expression) is stirring a meat stew over a fire. She looks up 
           when Grace and Lena enter, and bends down in search for 
           something. Alice places a large empty pot on the counter. 

                                 GRACE
                        Evenin’ Alice.

                                 ALICE
                        Evenin’. 

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                            (To Lena)
                        Hi baby.

           Lena smiles, leaning on her mother. Alice looks back at 
           Grace.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                            (in a knowing tone)
                        Keepin’ her close tonight, hm?

           Grace nods. Alice nods back, spooning some cornmeal mush into 
           the large pot. There’s friendly banter going on amongst the 
           house slaves. 

           We gradually hear muffled yelling coming from the next room. 
           The banter halts.

           The sound of china or glass breaking. 

                                 FEMALE VOICE
                        Look what you’ve done!

           The sound of a slap. 
           Grace, ahead of things, quickly moves to grab the pot in an 
           effort to leave when-

           ELIZABETH (30s, white) enters the kitchen holding HELEN (19, 
           caramel skinned) by the ear. Helen has one hand over her 
           cheek. Elizabeth forcefully releases her. 

                                 HELEN
                        I’m sorry Missus Elizabeth I was 
                        only trying to show you that...

           Elizabeth grabs the metal spoon Alice has been stirring the 
           hot stew with and brings it to Helen’s face. 

           The slaves’ eyes widen as Helen cries out.

                                 ELIZABETH
                            (voice drops)
                        ...SHOW me? 

           Elizabeth holds the spoon to Helen’s face as it sizzles 
           against her skin. 

           Elizabeth’s face holds an eerie focus. 

           Grace looks on. A bowl and spoon near her shakily levitates. 
           It catches her eye. 

           Grace looks at Lena, frozen with eyes locked on Helen and 
           Elizabeth, doesn’t notice the quivering items.

           Grace keeps her eyes on the people in the room. 

           As the scene holds everyone’s attention, Grace subtly pushes 
           the items back down. 

           Grace takes hold of Lena’s hand and caresses it with her 
           thumb. 

           The quivering kitchenware relaxes. 

           Elizabeth walks back toward the swing door from whence she 
           came. Her eyes meet Lena’s. 

           There’s a quick moment of Lena watching Elizabeth, Elizabeth 
           studying Lena. Elizabeth leaves. 

           The group exhales and a few move to check on Helen. 

           This is a different room now. 

           Grace lifts the heavy pot and nudges Lena to follow her. Lena 
           follows but can’t take her eyes off Helen, who’s being tended 
           to. 
           EXT. SLAVE CABINS

           Grace places the large pot on a stump outside. There are 
           field slaves with wooden cups and bowls, ready to get 
           themselves some of the cornmeal mush. Grace pulls two small 
           wooden bowls from her pockets and serves herself and Lena 
           before walking back toward the rows of slave cabins. 

                                 GRACE
                            (her voice drops)
                        I’d rather be in them fields fo’ 
                        the rest of my days then spend one 
                        night in that house.

                                 LENA
                        Why would she-

                                 GRACE
                        Some people just have so much mean 
                        in they heart they gotta spread it 
                        around. You steer clear of Missus 
                        at all time. You hear me?

           Lena nods.

           EXT. BELMONT COTTON PLANTATION - MORNING

           It's another day in the fields. Brown hands picking. Backs 
           curling. Backs stretching. Faces grimace. 

           Hattie, the woman who lost her children yesterday, is out 
           there picking too. Numbly. 

           We find Grace's face. Grace alternates from focusing on 
           picking and keeping an eye on Lena. Lena is struggling with a 
           wooden bucket full of water and a gourd, bringing water to 
           the field slaves. 

           John the overseer moves through the rows on his horse like a 
           vulture. LUKE, (30s, muscular, handsome, dark skinned man) 
           pauses from his work. 

                                 LUKE
                        Lena! Come over here with that 
                        water girl!

           Lena smiles as she waddles with the wooden bucket over to 
           him. 

           Grace has a small smile at this and continues with her 
           picking. 

           Lena smiles at Luke as he sips from the gourd.
                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        That bucket is as big as you is, 
                        how you carryin’ that around?

                                 LENA
                        I ain’t that big yet but I’m as 
                        strong as you!

           Luke grins a gorgeous smile.

                                 LUKE
                            (laughing)
                        Oh yeah? We’ll see about that. 
                        We’ll wrestle arms tonight!

           As Luke hands Lena back the gourd we hear the hooves of a 
           horse. 

                                 JOHN
                        That's enough Luke, get back to 
                        work. 

                                 LUKE
                        Just gettin’ a drink o water Sir. 

           CRACK!

           Lena and Luke jump. 

           Grace looks toward the sound.

           But John had only whipped it into the air. Luke hastily gets 
           back to work while Grace waves Lena over to her. 

           Lena walks back over to her mother. She looks back at Luke's 
           smile-less face. 

           EXT. BIG HOUSE PORCH - AT THE SAME TIME

           Elizabeth sits on the porch sipping out of a crystal glass. 
           She watches Lena and Grace.

           EXT. COTTON FIELD - AT THE SAME TIME

           Grace feels eyes on her, she turns and peers toward Elizabeth 
           on the porch. 

           Elizabeth continues to sip, watching. 

           Grace looks away, and continues picking. 
           EXT. BLACKSMITH’S CABIN - LATE AFTERNOON

           Grace and Lena enter JAMES (Black, 23) the Blacksmith’s 
           Cabin. Grace carries a small amount of veggies in her arms. 

           James is hammering a horseshoe. 

                                 JAMES
                        Stand back now. Don’t want these 
                        sparks to getcha.

           Lena looks around at all the tools and shelves. The glowing 
           fire pit. She watches James cool the horseshoe, and hang it 
           up with a line of others. 

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Let me get those pots for you 
                        Grace. 

                                 GRACE
                        Thank you James. Some things from 
                        my garden. 

                                 JAMES
                        Best garden on this side of 
                        Georgia!

           James grabs two homemade pots hanging and places them on a 
           worktable when John the overseer enters. 

           Lena watches John enter the cabin with discomfort. 

                                 JOHN
                        My horse needs those new shoes now 
                        James. 

                                 JAMES
                        Yes suh.

           James take the roots and vegetables from Grace one by one 
           into his arms.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                            (to Grace)
                        I’ll take those yams. Thank you-

                                 JOHN
                            (raises his voice)
                        NOW James.

           Lena jumps at John’s raised voice.

                                 JAMES
                        YES suh, right away suh.
           Grace looks up and one of her pots are floating high in the 
           air. 

           John exits. 

           Grace quickly grabs Lena’s body and lifts her in the air. 
           Lena instinctively grabs the pot. 

           James turns around, sees Grace holding Lena awkwardly holding 
           the pot like some circus act. 

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Nice huh? Been sellin’ em in town 
                        when I can. I bes’ get back to 
                        work. 

           James double takes. 

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        You got a strong little girl there 
                        Grace.

           Grace forces a smile. 

           James rushes out.

           Grace puts Lena down. 

           They both exhale. Lena starts laughing. Grace does not.

                                 GRACE
                        There was nothing funny about that. 

           INT. GRACE’S CABIN - NIGHT

           Lena lies in bed, holding a doll made of twigs. Grace get in, 
           she adjusts the blanket over herself and Lena. Grace strokes 
           Lena’s hair.

                                 GRACE
                        What do you think would have 
                        happened if James saw what happened 
                        today? 

           Lena sighs. 

                                 LENA
                        Mama, James is nice. He wouldn’t 
                        say nothin’.

                                 GRACE
                        How you know that? 
                        (pause)
                                 (MORE)
                                 GRACE (CONT'D)
                        And what if it was Mistuh John? Hm? 
                        You think he wouldn’t say nothin? 

           Lena considers this. 

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        Black or white it don’t matter. If 
                        anyone catch you they will hurt 
                        you. Take you away from me.

           Lena listens. Looks up at her mother. 

                                 LENA
                        What’s wrong with me mama? 

           Silence.

           Grace thinks on her words. 

                                 GRACE
                        I don’t know baby.

           More silence. Lena thinks; looks up at her mother.

                                 LENA
                        I won’t show no one. I promise. 

           Grace kisses Lena on the forehead.

                                 GRACE
                        Thank you. Let’s go to sleep. 

           Grace closes her eyes. Lena’s eyes remain open, in her 
           mother’s embrace. 

           She starts to doze when-

           There's a KNOCK at the door. Grace, concerned, rises to 
           answer it.

           Grace opens it and it's CLARA (Black, 20s), one of the house 
           girls. 

           Lena sits up. She hears whispering between them but we cannot 
           hear what is being said. She hears her mother raise her voice 
           slightly. 

           INT. CABIN DOORWAY - CONTINUOUS

                                 GRACE
                        Can’t this wait till mornin’?
           CLARA (20s, black), dressed in house girl uniform, stands 
           outside the door.

                                 CLARA
                            (Shakes her head)
                        Missus says bring her now. 
                            (pauses)
                        I’ll wait out here.

           Grace shoots her a look. 

                                 CLARA (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry but I can’t go back empty 
                        handed. 

           INT. CABIN - CONTINUOUS

           Lena senses something is wrong, after a few moments the door 
           squeaks shut. 

                                 LENA
                        Who was that Mama?

           Grace sits down at their small handmade wooden table, she 
           interlocks her fingers tightly and presses her hands against 
           her lips. Takes deep breaths and scans the room. 

           Lena studies her mother's expression. 

                                 GRACE
                            (looking away)
                        You're going to move into the Big 
                        House, to be a house girl. 

           Lena thinks to herself. 

                                 LENA
                        Why?

           Grace manages to bring her eyes to Lena.

                                 GRACE
                        That don't matter. Dis what lie 
                        before us. 

           Grace finally looks at Lena. She walks toward her, takes the 
           doll out of her hand and sets it down.

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        Put yuh shoes on. 
                                 LENA
                        I don't want to go I want to stay 
                        with you. 

                                 GRACE
                        It's not up to you, it’s not up to 
                        me. 

           Grace takes her hand and leads her to the door. Lena resists.

                                 LENA
                        But I don't know nobody in there! 
                        Please mama, please don't make me 
                        go. 

           As Lena panics, the bed starts vibrating. 

                                 LENA (CONT’D)
                            (louder now)
                        Please mama...

           The bed slightly jerks to the right. The doll skakily rises 
           into the air.

           Grace grabs Lena’s shoulders.

                                 GRACE
                        Stop it! Stop it right now.

           Grace takes Lena’s hands in hers, caressing them with her 
           thumb. 

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        (speaking gently)
                        Lena, look at me. This, can't 
                        happen. You've got to-

                                 LENA
                            (glancing at the rising 
                             doll)
                        -control your feelins. 

           Lena squeezes her eyes shut. Takes a deep breath. 

           The doll gently falls to the ground. We stay with the doll as 
           Grace and Lena exit the cabin.

           EXT. BELMONT COTTON PLANTATION - CONTINUOUS

           Clara walks ahead of Grace and Lena. Grace searches for 
           words.
                                 GRACE
                        Trust nobody. Everyone is just 
                        tryna survive this place. You hear? 

                                 LENA
                        Yes Mama. 

           They continue walking.

                                 GRACE
                        Stay to yourself. Stay quiet. Know 
                        yuh best is never enough. Don’t let 
                        anyone see what you can do. Not 
                        anyone. Not ever.

           Grace and Lena walk in silence. Lena takes her mother’s hand. 

           There’s still something else heavy on Grace’s mind. 

           Clara enters the back door, then Alice appears in the 
           doorway. Helen stands behind Alice, the scar from the hot 
           spoon still large and fresh on her cheek. 

           Grace kneels down, eye-level with Lena.

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        Baby...

           Grace looks into Lena’s big, curious, brown eyes. She opens 
           her mouth to speak, looks up at Alice who towers over them, 
           then sighs. Words failing her again. She looks back at Lena.

           Grace kisses her forehead.

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        Forgive me. 

           Lena looks at her mother.

                                 ALICE
                            (to Lena)
                        Come on. 

           Lena looks up at Alice and steps into the doorway.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                            (to Grace)
                        Yo mama looked out for me. I'll be 
                        lookin’ out for her. 

           Grace gives a grateful nod. 

           Lena and Grace keep eyes on one another until the door closes 
           on Grace.
           INT. BIG HOUSE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Lena turns and looks around at the unfamiliar faces. Alice 
           has one hand on her shoulder. 

                                 ALICE
                        This is Lena everyone. She’ll be 
                        with us from now on. 

           MARY (Black, late 30s, attractive) offers a small smile to 
           Lena, whose discomfort is evident. 

                                 MARY
                        My name is Mary, I’ll be showing 
                        you how we do things at first 
                        light. 

           Lena nods. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        You’ve met Clara, there’s Ben

           BEN (40s, Black, tired but kind face) gives a extra-
           gentlemanly bow that makes Lena smile a little.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        and Helen.  

           Helen only looks at Lena with a piercing gaze before looking 
           away. 

           INT. BIG HOUSE ATTIC - NIGHT

           House slaves are sleeping on small beds in what looks like an 
           attic. It’s packed, not much personal space for anyone. We 
           fall on Lena whose eyes are wide open. 

           INT. BIG HOUSE LIVING ROOM- EARLY MORNING

           The house girls, including Lena, stand attentively in a line 
           in a lavish living room. They all wear similar dresses in a 
           shade of olive green. Lena’s looks a bit big on her.

                                 MARY
                        Helen, you’ll start in the bedrooms 
                        and living room and show Lena how 
                        we do things. 

           Helen nods. 

           Lena looks around the living room. Its yellow walls, 
           chandelier, the rich red fabric of the couch. 
           A painting of a white family hangs on the wall. She 
           recognizes a young Elizabeth in it. 

           On the table, Black and white photographs of white faces of 
           past.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                            (to Lena)
                        When you speak to Missus Elizabeth 
                        it’s “yes Missus, no Missus, of 
                        course Missus”. Never look white 
                        folk in the eye when you talk to 
                        them neither. But it’s best not to 
                        talk ‘les you have to. Understand?

           Lena looks back at Mary. Nods. 

           Mary continues giving her orders for the day... 

           INT. BIG HOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING

           Lena and Helen change the sheets of a bed. Helen doesn’t 
           speak to Lena. Lena studies Helen, looks for something to 
           say, but doesn’t. 

           INT. BIG HOUSE FOYER - MORNING

           Lena sweeps in the foyer. A CREAK comes from the Master’s 
           study. 

           Lena looks toward the sound to find the door to the study 
           slightly cracked. She sees Clara slide a pair of scissors 
           into her apron. Clara catches Lena watching her. 

           Lena looks away and returns to her sweeping when the front 
           door opens. Helen enters the foyer. 

           Clara leaves the study and moves past Lena and Helen.

           Lena continues sweeping and notices Helen’s eyes follow Clara 
           hastening from the foyer.

           INT. BIG HOUSE HALLWAY - MORNING

           Lena sweeps past Elizabeth, who sits at her writing table. 

                                 ELIZABETH (O.S.)
                        Oh Lena! Come here won’t you?
           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Lena enters with hesitance.

           Elizabeth’s hand pulls open a small drawer. She pulls out a 
           simple, red ribbon. 

           Elizabeth smiles. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I saw this while I was in town and 
                        thought of you. 

           Elizabeth hands it to Lena. Lena only holds it in her hand. 

                                 LENA
                            (pauses)
                        What you like me to do with this 
                        Missus?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Wear it of course! Go on. 

           Elizabeth turns her around, and attempts to tie the ribbon in 
           Lena’s hair. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Think of it as a welcome gift. 

           Lena gives a small, slightly uncomfortable, smile. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        It’ll be nice to have some new 
                        blood around here. Someone I can 
                        train from young. To do things 
                        right. 
                            (completes her ribbon)
                        There you are. 

           Elizabeth turns Lena’s body to face the vanity mirror. 
           Elizabeth’s smiles as Lena looks at the lush red ribbon in 
           her hair. Lena gives Elizabeth a small smile.  

           INT. BIG HOUSE SEWING ROOM - AFTERNOON

           Helen and Lena are making clothes. Mary sits in the corner of 
           the sewing room, breast-feeding a white baby boy, JOSEPH (8 
           months old).

           Lena can’t help but stare. 

           His blue eyes open and close, falling asleep as he sucks on 
           Mary’s dark brown nipple. 
           Mary finishes and gently holds the baby in her arms and 
           carries him into the next bedroom.

           INT. BABY’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Mary gently lays the baby down in her crib, kisses him on the 
           forehead, and adjusts the blankets around him. She exits. 

           INT. BIG HOUSE SEWING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Mary re-enters the sewing room. Helen sews a blue dress in 
           the corner. It’s beautiful handiwork. 

           Lena attempts to make stitches on the sleeve of a suit 
           jacket. Mary stands over her, looking at her work. 

                                 MARY
                            (to Lena)
                        That’s it. Not too tight now. Don’t 
                        want it to pop at the swish of an 
                        arm. 

           Helen, fixated in her work, looks up at a KNOCK. Ben pokes 
           his head in the doorway.

                                 BEN
                        Missus wants us all downstairs. 
                        Now. 

           Mary sighs. 

           INT. BIG HOUSE FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

           The house slaves stand in a line. Mistress Elizabeth walks 
           down the line. Lena stands next to Helen, whose eyes look 
           forward, but her breath is quick.

           Lena notices Master Henry standing in his study. He observes 
           the scene, then closes the door.

           Mistress Elizabeth paces down the line. She looks into their 
           faces.

           They all keep their eyes forward.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        A pair of scissors have gone 
                        missing.

           Lena keeps her head down, but her eyes fall on Clara, who 
           remains composed.
           Lena looks at Helen, who is difficult to read.

           Elizabeth continues down the line.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Fine then. That’s 5 lashes for each 
                        of you. Tonight. 

           There’s a shift in the room upon hearing this. 

           Elizabeth basks in the thick silence. Studies their faces, 
           expressions slightly changed.

           Lena looks at Clara. Uncertain. When-

           Helen’s index finger rises. Pointing right at Clara.

           Clara’s stoicism breaks upon hearing this. She looks at Helen 
           wide-eyed.

           Lena tries to keep her eyes forward.

           Elizabeth takes in this information. We stay with Elizabeth 
           as she turns to charge at Clara with a hard SLAP. We hear a 
           small thud as Clara meets the ground.

           Lena jumps at the sound of it. She looks dizzy. 

           A painting behind Lena starts to shake. Lena’s eyes widen as 
           the edges of the frame vibrate against the wall. She closes 
           her eyes and takes deep breaths.

           Clara shakes her head “no”, pleadingly. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you dare lie. 

                                 CLARA
                        Irene in the fields was having a 
                        baby and I took the scissors and a 
                        bucket of hot water to help.

                                 ELIZABETH
                            (eyes locked on Clara)
                        Is this true Helen?

           Silence. 

           Helen nods.

           Lena opens her eyes. 

           The painting stills. 
                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                            (to Clara)
                        Then why were they not returned? 
                        Where are they now? 

           Clara pulls the scissors out of her apron pocket and slowly 
           holds them out to Elizabeth who takes them from her, examines 
           them, turns them around so that the blades are pointed toward 
           Clara’s neck. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you ever take from me again. 
                            (pauses)
                        Alice. 

           Alice looks toward Elizabeth. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                            (casually)
                        No meals for her for two days. 

                                 ALICE
                        Yes Missus. 

           Elizabeth rubs her temple. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Just go. 

           Everyone disperses. 

           Lena sees Clara give a loaded look to Helen before turning to 
           follow Alice to the kitchen.

           Lena, Helen, and Mary return to the sewing room. Mary closes 
           the door behind them. 

           Lena stares curiously at Helen, who sits in her chair. Helen 
           looks up and Lena looks away.

           Mary exhales. 

                                 MARY
                        These white folks getting nervous 
                        with that Baylor boy gon’ missin’. 
                        Nothin’ worse than nervous white 
                        folk.

           Helen listens, but says nothing.

                                 LENA
                        Missin’?
                                 MARY
                        Run away. Ain’t no one seen him for 
                        five days. Slave catchers is 
                        everywhere. 

           Lena processes this. 

           INT. BIG HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Brown fingertips carefully plate a dinner plate. Steam rises 
           from a small broiled chicken that is cooked to perfection. 
           Accompanied with neatly sliced yams and a cob of corn. The 
           plate next to it is identical. Alice scans the presentation 
           of each plate. 

           Helen places a steamy pie onto the counter. There is a 
           beautifully braided crust, and meticulously layered sliced 
           apples topping the pie. 

           Helen picks up the first plate of dinner, lifts her chin, 
           mutes her expression and elegantly postures her hold of the 
           plate. 

                                 ALICE
                        Okay, Clara now you. 

           Clara does a similar gathering of herself. 

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Lena now you. Watch what the girls 
                        do. When you get to the table, walk 
                        to the left around the table. Give 
                        them they food on they right. 

           Lena works to retain this information. Helen starts through 
           the swing door leading to the dining room. Her hands hold the 
           plate on each side, nearly touching the food. 

           Alice adjusts Lena’s hand to hold the plate from underneath.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Like this. Go.

           Clara goes through the door next. Lena follows.

           INT. BIG HOUSE DINING ROOM - EVENING

           Henry is seated at a medium long wooden table covered with a 
           white tablecloth. The room is candlelit, including a 
           chandelier of candles above. The plates are being placed 
           down. Elizabeth enters the dining room. 
           Lena places a dinner plate in front of Elizabeth, who watches 
           her closely. Clara holds a large fan of feathers, fanning the 
           table. 

           Elizabeth places a napkin on her lap.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Joseph is sound asleep.

           Lena sees Helen standing against the wall, blank expression, 
           with both hands placed politely over her stomach. Lena 
           replicates Helen’s stance. 

                                 HENRY
                            (chewing)
                        Yes, Mary is good with him. 

           Lena watches Elizabeth’s expression that looks as if this 
           stung a little. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        So how’s it going with the 
                        campaign? 

                                 HENRY
                        Until I reign in Baylor and Jackson 
                        it won’t matter how many votes I 
                        get. Too many men wait and watch to 
                        see how they’ll vote and follow 
                        suit. 

           Elizabeth nods. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Well, Tom Baylor and Jackson are 
                        true Southern gentlemen. What they 
                        want to know-- 

                                 HENRY
                        Maybe we should host them here at 
                        the house. Big dinner party, I 
                        think I could get their support 
                        over a glass of whiskey after we 
                        wine and dine them. 
                            (sips his drink)
                        Could you put that together?

           Lena watches Elizabeth force a smile. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Of course. 
           INT. BIG HOUSE KITCHEN - LATER

           The house women are cleaning the kitchen. Alice the cook 
           scrapes scraps into a few small wooden bowls. Mary cleans the 
           dishes, while Lena and Helen bring the dirty dishes from the 
           dining room.

           Lena hands Mary her dishes. 

           She sees Mary notice the red ribbon Elizabeth gave her. 

           Mary signals Clara to look. Clara rolls her eyes mockingly. 

           Lena looks away. 

           INT. BIG HOUSE ATTIC - NIGHT

           Lena and other slaves are asleep in the small attic. Lena 
           wakes at the sound of a creak. 

           It’s Helen. Lena’s eyes curiously follow Helen as she tiptoes 
           in and lies down in her own cot. 

           Lena goes back to sleep. 

           INT. BIG HOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Helen and Lena clean the living room.

           Helen carefully wipes down items while Lena sweeps. 

           Lena glances at Helen every now and then. Who still doesn’t 
           say a word. 

           INT. BIG HOUSE FOYER - DAY

           It’s a hot day. Slaves are doing backbreaking labor in the 
           field. Lena peers through her window to see her mother. 

           She looks happy just to have her eyes fall on her for a 
           moment. 

           Lena turns at the sound of Helen carrying a large basket 
           overflowing with clothes and fabrics down the stairs. Clara 
           enters the foyer when two items fall from Helen’s basket. 
           Clara looks down at them, then walks right past Helen. 

           Lena watches Helen’s face tighten as Clara brushes past her.  
           EXT. BIG HOUSE PORCH - AFTERNOON

           Lena and Helen stand like statues against the wall. 

           Elizabeth sits across from ANNE (20s, white, blonde, 
           attractive) and MARGARET (20s, white, brunette). Henry stands 
           nearby. 

           Elizabeth pads her forehead and upper lip with a cloth napkin 
           as Margaret and Anne sip iced tea. 

           Looks like Henry may be drinking something a bit stronger, as 
           he gives a sigh after a sip. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Henrietta swore she saw him on her 
                        way to her outhouse. 

           Anne says nothing. 

           Elizabeth is engaged by Margaret while Henry’s eyes stay on 
           the plantation before them. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        How could she have seen him when 
                        they found his scraps near the 
                        Tomkin’s property? 

                                 MARGARET
                        Maybe he’s turned around. Or knows 
                        he can’t go no further. 
                            (with a gossipy smile)
                        He’s stuck. 

           Lena listens. 

           Margaret looks at Anne. 

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        I heard Tom is starting to lose it 
                        a bit. 

           Elizabeth notices Anne pause.

                                 ANNE
                        It has been a challenging time.

                                 MARGARET
                        I could imagine! If you can’t keep 
                        your niggers in line, people will 
                        start to think you have no business 
                        owning any. 

           Elizabeth listens. 
                                 HENRY
                        I spoke to Tom,
                            (takes a sip of whiskey)
                        said he’s feeding him to the dogs 
                        as soon as he gets his hands on 
                        him.

           Helen and Lena exchange glances.  

           INT. BIG HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT

           The house women are in the kitchen preparing for dinner. 
           Helen is shucking corn, Lena chops vegetables alongside Alice 
           who is feathering a duck. 

           Clara is focused on her sewing in a wooden chair in a corner. 

           Lena’s demeanor is off. Alice notices. 

                                 ALICE
                        You alright baby?

           Lena takes a deep breath, this question breaks her composure.

                                 LENA
                        I just...I ain’t seen my mama since 
                        I came here. 

           The women nod. Understanding. Lena’s eyes fall on Helen who 
           nods while she shucks. 

                                 LENA (CONT’D)
                        Where’s yo Mama Helen? 

           All the women look up, there’s a pause in the energy of the 
           room. 

           Lena looks around, feeling she’s approached a boundary of 
           some kind. 

           Helen, of course, does not respond. She only looks away, 
           perhaps remembering to herself. 

           Clara, noticing this along with Lena, jumps in. 

                                 CLARA
                        My mother was Lila Davis. She was 
                        born in Virginia. Her mother was 
                        taken in Africa when she was a 
                        little girl. 

           The women are listening intently. 
                                 CLARA (CONT’D)
                        A big boat was down at the edge of 
                        the bay an’ the people was all 
                        excited about it. An’ some of the 
                        bravest went up pretty close to get 
                        a look at it.

           Alice listens with intrigue.

                                 CLARA (CONT’D)
                        The men on the boat told them to 
                        come on board and they could have 
                        these pretty red handkerchiefs. A 
                        lot of them went on board. And the 
                        ship sailed away with them. 

           Lena studies Alice’s strong, slightly wrinkled brown hands 
           pluck a feather from the duck’s flesh. Pluck. 

           Pluck. 

                                 ALICE
                            (voice very low)
                        I ain’t seen my Mama since I was 5 
                        years old. Came here from Alabama.
                            (pauses)
                        Can’t remember what she look like 
                        anymore.

           Alice continues to slowly feather the duck. 

           Helen listens. 

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        All I got now is a feelin’. 

           Lena listens and observes Alice, the monotone of her voice. 
           Her furrowed brow. 

           Mary enters the kitchen with a small pile of clean dinner 
           plates. She looks around, noticing the stillness of the room. 
           Mary places the plates down by Lena and Alice.

                                 MARY
                        What’s goin’ on in here?

                                 LENA
                        Ms. Alice was telling us about her 
                        mama

           Alice shoots Lena a look. 

           Mary pauses at this with a frown. She looks around the room, 
           contemplation on the women’s expressions. 
                                 MARY
                        Ain’t no use thinkin’ on them 
                        things. 

           Mary separates the large plates from the small. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Best put them thoughts away. 

           The women process Mary’s words. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Well finish up here you know we 
                        don’t got long till supper. 

           They all slowly resume their tasks. Mary exits. 

           Lena processes Mary’s response. Clara offers Lena a glance of 
           what could be comfort. 

           INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING

           It’s quiet at the dinner table tonight between Henry and 
           Elizabeth. Elizabeth looks up at Henry. Henry doesn’t notice 
           and continues chewing.

           Helen is fanning the table tonight. She looks exhausted. Her 
           eyes are heavy.  

           Lena watches as Helen nods off a bit, causing the turkey-
           feather fan to slowly drop and brush over Henry’s head. 

                                 HENRY
                            (clears throat)
                        Helen. 

           Helen wakes, and looks mortified. And adjusts her posture. 
           Lena looks worried while the other house women maintain their 
           stoicism. 

           INT. KITCHEN - LATER

           The house women are cleaning up. Lena observes Helen’s 
           fatigue as they polish the silverware. 

           EXT. FOYER - LATER

           Helen and Lena head upstairs when-

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Helen. 
           Shit. Helen turns to Elizabeth, who holds a drink in a 
           crystal glass. 

           Helen walks toward Elizabeth, avoiding eye contact. 

           Elizabeth keeps her voice low and steady. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Why is it that you are incapable of 
                        performing the simplest of tasks? 

           Helen doesn’t answer. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Hm? 

           Elizabeth’s hand comes down on the top of Helen’s head. Helen 
           takes it.

           Camera stays on Elizabeth. Her rage. Her eyes. Her actions.

           Elizabeth continues to strike her head from different angles 
           as she speaks. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                            (while pounding on her 
                             head)
                        Must you...continue...to embarrass 
                        me?  

           Lena looks on at the scene, trying to maintain her stoicism 
           while Elizabeth is reaming into Helen. 

           Details start to move in slow motion. The angry posture of 
           Elizabeth’s moving lips. The anxiety in Helen’s face. 

           Lena’s stoicism is breaking, she massages her forehead. 
           Dizzy.

           Elizabeth’s yelling sounds muffled. 

           Slow motion of Elizabeth’s aggressive gesturing with one 
           hand, a crystal glass in her other hand. 

           Lena’s anxious face. She’s breathes heavily. Eyes locked on 
           Elizabeth. 

           CLOSE ON the glass in Elizabeth’s hand. 

           CLOSE ON Lena's eyes, they squint slightly.

           CLOSE ON Lena’s balled fist.

           CLOSE ON the glass, it SHATTERS. 
           Helen and Elizabeth jump at the sound and sight of the glass 
           shattering in Elizabeth’s hand.

           Lena jumps too.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                            (to herself)
                        Oh! 

           Silence. 

           Elizabeth looks at Helen.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Don’t just stand there get 
                        something to clean this up. 

           Lena stares as Elizabeth carefully shakes the fragments off 
           her skirt, and exits the room.

           INT. BIG HOUSE - NIGHT

           Lena walks upstairs toward the attic, and walks past the open 
           door of the Master Bedroom, where Elizabeth sits in a sofa 
           chair, reading. 

                                 ELIZABETH (O.S.)
                        Lena.

           Lena turns around and stands in the doorway.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Come in here. 

           Lena hesitantly enters. 

           Elizabeth smiles and points to the ground.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Go on. 

           Lena notices the cowhide on the night-stand next to 
           Elizabeth’s chair as she proceeds to sit on the floor. She’s 
           reading a black, leather bound book, the title engraved with 
           gold print that reads: “THE HOLY BIBLE.” 

           Elizabeth opens it in front of Lena. There’s an illustration 
           of two figures at the bottom of the page. A monster: black, 
           grotesque, clawed and snarling. At the top, a pale blonde 
           woman, draped in shimmering white cloth. She’s beautiful, 
           with white wings on her back. 
                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Isaiah Chapter 5 Verse 20: Woe to 
                        those who call evil good, and good 
                        evil; Who substitute darkness for 
                        light and light for darkness; Who 
                        substitute bitter for sweet and 
                        sweet for bitter.

           Lena’s eyes fall back on the illustration, curiously so. 
           Elizabeth notices this, smiles.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        You like the picture? 

           Lena slowly brings her index finger to the creature she looks 
           up at Elizabeth. Elizabeth nods, permitting it. Lena touches 
           its black fur, its snout-like face. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        That right there is the devil. And 
                        this over here,
                            (her white index finger 
                             points to the angel while 
                             Lena’s is on the devil)
                        Is an angel. They are messengers of 
                        God they watch over us and protect 
                        us. 

           Lena stares at the angelic white woman.

                                 LENA
                        She looks like you. 

           Elizabeth takes this observation as a high compliment and 
           smiles. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Why thank you, Lena. 

           Elizabeth pulls the Bible back toward her and continues to 
           read. Lena listens.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        The one who does what is sinful is 
                        of the devil, because the devil has 
                        been sinning from the beginning. 
                        The reason the Son of God appeared 
                        was to destroy the devils work....
           INT. BIG HOUSE ATTIC - NIGHT

           Lena lies down in her cot. It’s been a long day. She brings 
           both her hands in front of her face. Examining them. Her 
           palms. 

           INT. BIG HOUSE KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

           Squeezed out lemon halves lie on the counter. Alice stirs 
           lemonade in a glass pitcher. 

           Lena walks in as Alice places the pitcher alongside two empty 
           glasses on a tray. Hands it to Lena.

                                 ALICE
                        Here baby.

           EXT. BIG HOUSE PORCH - AFTERNOON

           Elizabeth sits on the porch reading. Clara and Helen stand 
           against the house behind her. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Did y’all finish the butter and 
                        jams? And ironin’ the linens in the 
                        guest bedrooom?

                                 CLARA
                        Yes Missus. 

           Lena enters the porch, places the tray down on the table in 
           front of Elizabeth, who doesn’t look up from her reading. 
           Lena pours Elizabeth a glass when she jumps at the sound of 
           the crack of a whip. 

           It’s Luke, being whipped by the overseer. 

           Luke’s face, twisted in pain. 

           Lena, pours the lemonade while glancing at Elizabeth, who is 
           unfazed and reading. 

           Lena hands her the glass of lemonade and Elizabeth takes it, 
           barely looking up. 

           The house girls watch the scene, but then look away.

           MOS: Lena looks up again as Luke winces from the pain.

           MOS: The overseer’s whip rises in slow motion. 
           Lena’s eyes watch the scene. They blink in slow motion. We 
           hear her breath.

           CLOSE ON the whip as it slices the air toward Luke then 
           leaves the Overseer’s grip.  

           The whip flies out of the Overseer’s hand.

           Lena’s eyes widen at this. She looks at Helen and Clara, who 
           have noticed it too. 

           Soundscape returns: The overseer walks over to where the whip 
           landed. Walks back toward Luke and strikes the ground next to 
           him, then moves on.

           Lena stands there. Processing this moment. 

           INT. KITCHEN - LATER

           Helen and Alice are preparing dinner. Helen chops potatoes 
           while Alice feathers a bird. Lena enters the kitchen. 

                                 ALICE
                            (looks up at Lena’s 
                             entrance)
                        Oh good, grab that bucket and head 
                        on to the well so I can boil these 
                        potatoes. 

           Lena grabs the bucket, looks at Alice and Helen who are both 
           focused on their tasks. 

           Lena swipes the wooden cup from the table and places it in 
           her pocket. She walks out the door. 

           EXT. WELL - AFTERNOON

           Lena uses all her strength to pull the rope, bringing the 
           bucket, now filled with water back to the top. She ties the 
           rope so the bucket does not fall as she tries to unhook it.

           EXT. WOODS - AFTERNOON

           Someone’s POV of Lena through the trees as she cautiously 
           looks over her shoulder and walks with the bucket through the 
           woods. 

           Lena stops and places the bucket on the ground. She looks 
           around again.
           She pulls the small, wooden cup from her pocket and places it 
           onto a large rock. She takes a few steps backward from it 
           till there's enough space between them. She extends her arm 
           and fingers toward the cup with great concentration. 

           The cup remains still. 

           She takes a step closer and tries again with this approach. 

           Nothing. 

           She sits down right in front of the rock. Her eyes narrowed 
           in on the cup. She stares at it with intensity. 

           Nothing. 

           Lena gets up, and kicks the dirt on the ground in 
           frustration. The cup twitches to the right just a bit.

           Lena turns around to look at the cup. She thinks to herself. 
           She looks at the cup with serious concentration, it seems 
           like there will be a breakthrough. 

           NOTHING. 

           She yells at the cup and it flies off the rock. She smirks, 
           then walks toward the cup and places it back on the rock. She 
           gathers herself before she yells at the cup even louder. The 
           cup goes flying.

           Lena smiles.

           Shape of a Black woman’s figure, we cannot see who, watching 
           Lena. She exits.

           INT. KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

           Brown hands snapping green beans. These hands are Clara’s. 
           Alice holds a dead chicken. She chops off its head with one 
           swing of a cleaver. 

           Lena enters the kitchen, Clara notices Lena smiling. So does 
           Alice. 

                                 ALICE
                        What you grinnin’ for? 

                                 LENA
                        Nothin’. 

           Lena brings the bucket of water and pours it into the pot 
           over the fire pit.
                                 ALICE
                            (studies her)
                        Mhm.

           INT. BATHROOM - LATER

           Helen bathes Elizabeth. She gently runs a cloth up and down 
           her arm. Helen holds a dutiful expression. Elizabeth’s 
           expression says that everything is as it should be. 

           INT. HALLWAY - AT THE SAME TIME

           Lena brings a small bucket down the hallway. 

           INT. BATHROOM

           She arrives to the bathroom where Elizabeth is being bathed. 
           Lena places it alongside Helen. 

           Lena exits and turns down the hallway. The sound of water 
           being poured. 

           SLAP. 

           Lena pauses. She leans against the wall just outside the 
           bathroom.  

                                 ELIZABETH (O.C.)
                        Don’t you see that’s too hot?

           Helen keeps her eyes down. She looks outside the doorway. 
           Helen senses Lena, who stands out of view outside the 
           bathroom.

           Helen dips the cloth into the water. Waits a moment before 
           bringing it to Elizabeth’s skin. 

           Lena lingers there against the wall, her head turned toward 
           where Helen sits inside. The both of them, sensing one 
           another.

           Lena exits down the hallway.  

           INT. BIG HOUSE ATTIC - NIGHT

           Lena lies down in her cot and closes her eyes when Helen 
           enters the attic, and gets into her own cot.

           At the head of Helen’s cot, Helen finds Lena’s red ribbon. 
           Helen smiles, and lies down. 
                                 LENA
                            (whispers)
                        Goodnight Helen.

           Helen looks up at this. She closes her eyes. 

           INT. BIG HOUSE ATTIC - MORNING

           The other slaves are slowly rising, while Lena is nearly 
           dressed and exits.

           INT. BIG HOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING

           Lena stares at a broom leaning against the wall across the 
           room. 

           She intensely squints her eyes. 

           Nothing. 

           She continues her intense gaze. 

           *CRACK* Lena jumps at the sound of a whip in the fields and 
           the broom shifts to the right, before it falls. The handle of 
           the broom is now cracked. 

           The sound of footsteps headed this way, Lena quickly picks up 
           the broom, hiding the crack with her hands, when Mary enters. 

                                 MARY
                        Everything alright in here? 

                                 LENA
                        Mhm, yes. 

                                 MARY
                        Finish up here and get downstairs 
                        to help Helen wash the linens.

           Lena nods. Mary exits. Lena sweeps and looks out the window.

           EXT. RIVER - LATER

           Lena and Helen are washing clothes at the creek. 

           Lena looks up at Helen, who is focused on her task. She 
           pauses, then splashes Helen. Helen gives her a sharp look. 
                                 LENA
                            (smirks)
                        Sorry. 

           They continue scrubbing. 

           Helen is splashed again. She’s annoyed now. She’s splashed 
           again and finally splashes Lena back. There’s a surprised 
           grin on Lena’s, now wet, face.

           EXTREME WIDE of them splashing each other at the river, their 
           laughter echoing in the woods.

           EXT. WOODS - LATER

           Lena and Helen are walking, each holding a basket of linens, 
           and Lena also has an empty water bucket. 

                                 LENA
                        I’ll go to the well. You go ahead 
                        without me. 

           Helen gives her a suspicious look. 

                                 LENA (CONT’D)
                        That way you can get started on 
                        hangin’ them to dry. I won’t be 
                        long. 

           Helen complies, takes Lena’s basket, and turns left back 
           toward the plantation. 

           Lena watches her walk away, then turns right. 

           EXT. WELL - AFTERNOON

           Lena ropes the bucket from the well, now filled with water. 
           She places the heavy bucket down, looks around, and walks 
           toward the same rock. She pulls the same wooden cup from her 
           pocket.

           Through the trees, as if someone may be watching, we see Lena 
           place it down, and take a few steps backward. 

           She stares at the cup. 

           Nothing. 

           Gives it a quick wave with her hand. 

           Nothing. 
           She thinks to herself, takes a moment, then yells at the cup 
           again, and it flies off the rock and lands at a pair of feet. 

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        What in the world is you doin’?

           Lena goes rigid at the sight of the WOMAN (Black, late 60s, 
           grey, strong expression, curmudgeon energy). 

                                 LENA
                        Nothin’ ma'am. 

                                 WOMAN
                        Show me what you was doin’.

                                 LENA
                        I should be gettin' back to the Big 
                        House. 

                                 WOMAN
                        Yes you should, but not before you 
                        show me what you was doin'. 

           Lena looks for the best way to run. 

           The Woman picks up on that, and sighs as she eyes the cup and 
           raises her index finger casually. 

           The cup steadily levitates back onto the rock. Lena's eyes 
           widen. 

           CUT TO:

           EXT. WOODS - AFTERNOON

           The Woman is walking, with Lena walking behind her with her 
           empty bucket. The Woman pauses, looks around her, then lifts 
           a hidden hatch door in the ground. 

           Lena’s eyes widen at the sight of this as the Woman goes down 
           an interior ladder into the unknown. 

                                 WOMAN
                        Come on.’

           The Woman sees Lena’s hesitation. 

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Trust me. 
           INT. WOMAN’S HATCH - AFTERNOON

           Lena takes the last step down the ladder and turns around to 
           see about 15 square feet of space lit entirely of candles 
           scattered. There’s small cot on the floor, a fire pit, a few 
           wooden planks shoved into the wall to serve as shelves.

           On one of the shelves is a handmade doll made of twigs. 

           Lena smiles in wonder, then pauses. 

                                 LENA
                        What plantation you from?

                                 WOMAN
                        I’m not from any plantation. Not 
                        anymore. 

                                 LENA
                        So...you live in the ground? 

                                 WOMAN
                        Mhm. 

                                 LENA
                        What if it rains?

                                 WOMAN
                        I do just fine. 

           Silence.

                                 LENA
                        But why?

                                 WOMAN
                        Why what?

                                 LENA
                        Why do you live down here?

                                 WOMAN
                        Down here I’m free, up there
                            (points upward)
                        I ain’t. 

                                 LENA
                            (under her breath)
                        Freedom is a lot smaller than I 
                        thought. 

           The Woman looks annoyed, then starts turning in circles, 
           looking for something. 
                                 WOMAN
                            (mumbling to herself)
                        Where did I put that jar?

           Lena glances around, sees it, and moves toward it to hand it 
           to her when- 

                                 WOMAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Ah. 

           The jar floats away from Lena and into the Woman’s hand. 

           Lena watches this effortless control in awe.

                                 LENA
                        You think you could teach me how to 
                        do that? 

           The Woman looks at her. 

                                 WOMAN
                        What you want with learnin' this?

                                 LENA
                        So I can
                            (searches for words)
                        ...be strong.

                                 WOMAN
                        Against who?

           Silence. 

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        You best get back to the Big House 
                        ‘fore somebody come lookin’ for 
                        you. 

           Lena nods, and turns toward the ladder. 

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        You remember how to get here? 

           Lena turns back. Nods.  

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                            (watches her)
                        Okay. Come back in 2 days time, 
                        same time. 

           Lena jumps up in excitement. 
                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        And don’t be practicing out in the 
                        open, you hear? 

                                 LENA
                        Yes, ma’am. Thank you!

                                 WOMAN
                        Get out of here. 

           The Woman’s eyes follow Lena as she giddily exits. 

           EXT BELMONT PLANTATION - DAY

           Clara, Alice and Lena are dyeing fabric out back.

                                 CLARA
                        If you are eating with a mouthful 
                        of food and sneeze, that sho is a 
                        true sign of death. 

           Alice rolls her eyes. 

                                 CLARA (CONT’D)
                        I know that cause last year I was 
                        with Bettie and her son Wylie when 
                        they was eaten and Wylie sneezed 
                        and said “Mama I’m so sorry I just 
                        couldn’t help it the sneeze came on 
                        me so quick”. I just sat there and 
                        looked at him and began to wonder. 

           Lena listens. 

                                 CLARA (CONT’D)
                        Two weeks later, she was dead!

           Lena’s eyes widen. 

                                 ALICE
                        Clara hush with that mess!

                                 CLARA
                        It’s true! If a picture falls off 
                        the wall, someone in the family 
                        will die. 

           Clara works with the maple and pine bark, turning the fabric 
           a lilac color, as she gabbers on. 
                                 CLARA (CONT’D)
                        If you dream about teeth, and one 
                        falls out that’s another sign of 
                        death. 

                                 ALICE
                        Why are all these signs endin’ in 
                        death?

           Lena smirks. 

                                 CLARA
                        It’s not just death. If you left 
                        hand itches you will receive money.

                                 ALICE
                        Hush up now, I’s older than dis 
                        here tree ain’t never seen no money 
                        turn up in-

                                 LENA
                        What about witches?

           The question pauses the women’s playful bickering. 

                                 CLARA
                        Witches?

           Alice looks at Lena. 

           Lena now looks self conscious about her question. 

           Clara thinks to herself.

                                 CLARA (CONT’D)
                        I don’t think I know nothin’ bout 
                        no witches.

           Lena nods casually. 

           Alice observes Lena’s body language. 

           INT. BIG HOUSE - NIGHT

           Activity in the Big House is slowing down for the evening. 

           INT. BIG HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Alice puts out the last candle in the kitchen. 
           INT. BIG HOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Elizabeth reads a book to baby Joseph. Lena is fanning them, 
           enjoying the story as well. 

           Sudden activity can be heard downstairs. Elizabeth looks up 
           at the sound of the commotion when Clara enters the doorway, 
           with a worried expression.

                                 CLARA
                        Missus you better come quick. Miss 
                        Anne is here and she don’t look 
                        good. 

           INT. BIG HOUSE FOYER - NIGHT

           A beautifully dressed white woman, ANNE (20s, attractive) is 
           being held up by Ben. Elizabeth is coming down the stairs 
           while Lena and Clara, who is holding the baby, follow.

                                 ANNE
                            (words slurring a bit)
                        Get your hands off me you filthy...

           Ben gently releases her. Anne crumbles, and Ben catches her 
           again. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Annabelle what in the world is 
                        going on? 

           Anne looks up at Elizabeth and attempts a smile. The corner 
           of her mouth is swollen, her left eye purple, the top of her 
           pale hands bruised. Anne gives a small cackle. 

                                 ANNE
                            (laughter slows)
                        I’m sorry darling I just..uh...
                            (sadness washes over her 
                             expression)
                        I didn’t...I didn’t know where else 
                        to go. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                            (thinking the worst)
                        Did...did a nigger do this to you? 
                        Henry will get the sheriff right 
                        now...

           Anne thoroughly shakes her head no, it’s clear at this point 
           she may be a bit drunk.
                                 ANNE
                        No no no...it was...
                            (looking as if she might 
                             cry)
                        Tom...he just...

           Elizabeth, understanding, keeps her eyes locked on Anne.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Alice get me a hot wet rag.

           Alice nods and heads to the kitchen.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Helen prepare the guest room for 
                        Anne...

           Helen nods and goes upstairs and takes Lena’s hand for her to 
           follow her. Lena watches the spectacle as she ascends. 

           INT. BIG HOUSE GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Helen comes in with a small bucket of water and a rag. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Give it to me.

           Helen looks surprised and hands her the bucket. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                            (without looking at her)
                        Now get out. 

           Elizabeth’s hands wring the rag as steam rises from it. 
           Elizabeth dips the tip of the rag in and brings it to Anne’s 
           swollen cheek. She is tender with Anne. 

           Anne winces. 

                                 ANNE
                        It stings. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Shhh. It’s got a little brine in 
                        it.

                                 ANNE
                        Brine? Like for slaves?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        It helps it heal a little faster. 
           Elizabeth pauses, wrings out a little blood before dipping it 
           back into the bucket. And brings it to Anne’s eye. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        And, if I may: He did beat you like 
                        one. 

           Anne looks at her sharply with her good eye, clearly 
           uncomfortable. 

           Silence.

                                 ANNE
                        Tom’s been unraveling ever since 
                        that nigger boy ran away. Every day 
                        that passes he feels like he’s 
                        losing respect. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        And beating you solves that how? 

           Anne looks away from her, moving her face from the cloth. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. 

           Anne looks at the wall. 

           Elizabeth looks at her, as if debating something. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        After Henry’s father died, he came 
                        home one night. 

           Anne listens.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                            (whispers)
                        He was so drunk he couldn’t find 
                        his ass with both hands in his 
                        pockets.   

           Anne laughs then winces from the pain. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                            (laughing quietly)
                        Sorry sorry...

           Elizabeth returns to bringing the cloth to Anne’s wounds. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Not to sound superstitious but it 
                        was as if the mean old man’s ghost 
                        had possessed him. 
           Anne listens intently. Elizabeth dips the cloth in hot water. 
           Wrings it.  

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        He tried to force himself on me and 
                        slapped me when I wouldn’t go 
                        along.

                                 ANNE
                        What did you do?

           Elizabeth sighs, continuing to dab Anne’s wounds. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I told him that I am a godly woman 
                        and that if he ever laid a hand on 
                        me again I would leave him. 

                                 ANNE
                        You’re a braver woman than I. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Beating is for discipline. For 
                        children. For niggers. 

           Elizabeth gently brings the cloth to Anne’s face.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        And I am neither.

           Anne nods. 

           INT. BIG HOUSE ATTIC - NIGHT

           Alice is asleep and snoring. Mary is asleep too. 

           Lena, Helen, and Clara are getting situated in their cots. 

           Lena looks in Clara’s direction. 

                                 LENA
                        Clara?

                                 CLARA
                        Hm? 

                                 LENA
                        Can you tell me another one of your 
                        stories? 

           Helen looks up and listens. 
                                 CLARA
                        Mhm chile I’m tired, go to sleep. 

           Lena turns toward Clara. 

                                 LENA
                        Please? 

           Helen looks at Clara. 

           Clara sighs. 

                                 CLARA
                        Fine. One.

           Lena giddily turns over toward Clara. Helen rolls over too. 

                                 CLARA (CONT’D)
                        You want a happy story or a scary 
                        story?

           Lena looks at Helen, as if she may have some input. 

                                 LENA
                        Scary!

           Helen rolls her eyes, but takes her blanket and scoots a 
           little closer so she can hear. 

           Clara leans in, with a voice made for storytelling.

                                 CLARA
                        When my daddy was a boy, him and 
                        two more boys run away from the 
                        master ‘cause he whipped ‘em so 
                        bad. They set out and walked till 
                        it got darker, and darker, till 
                        they saw a big old empty house 
                        sittin’ back from the road. Now 
                        this house was 3 or for miles away 
                        from any other house. All by 
                        itself.

           Helen and Lena listen. 

                                 CLARA (CONT’D)
                        So they went in a made a fire, and 
                        laid down ‘cause they was tired 
                        from running from the Patrollers. 
                        Soon, they heard somethin’ say
                         tip...tap...tip...tap...
                        down the stairs it grew louder and 
                        louder

                                 (MORE)
                                 CLARA (CONT’D)
                        Then it said,
                            (switches to a high pitched 
                             eerie voice)
                         “Oh Lordy Master, I ain’t goin’ to 
                        do it no more! Let me off this 
                        time.” 

           Lena and Helen sit closer together now, wide-eyed at the 
           story.

                                 CLARA (CONT’D)
                        After a while they heard this same 
                        noise like a house fallin in. And 
                        they hear the same words. “Oh Lordy 
                        Master, I ant goin do it no more. 
                        Let me off this time.”

                        Them boys got good and scared, they 
                        looked at each other and ran away 
                        from that house jest as fast as 
                        they could go. Nobody knowed why 
                        this old house wuz hanted, but my 
                        daddy believed that some slaves wuz 
                        killed in it. So when you walk past 
                        a house, and you hear tip tap, its 
                        them boys trapped inside.  

           Clara comes out of character a bit, and smirks at how she’s 
           got the girls spooked. She pauses. 

                                 CLARA (CONT’D)
                        You know I remember a story bout 
                        witches now come to think. 

           Lena’s eyes widen. 

                                 CLARA (CONT’D)
                        I once heard, a woman das a witch 
                        come to a house one night and took 
                        her all skin off and went through 
                        de key hole. 

           Helen looks squeamish. Lena’s wide-eyed at this image. 

                                 CLARA (CONT’D)
                        Somebody found de skin an' 
                        sprinkled salt on it an’ when the 
                        witch come out she couldn’t git in 
                        de skin an’ she started saying
                            (witchy voice)
                         “Skinny, Skinny, don’t you know 
                        me?” 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CLARA (CONT’D)
                        The old folks b’lieved that any 
                        house a person died in was 
                        “haunted” and that the dead 
                        person’s spirit was a witch that 
                        would come back at night. They can 
                        do terrible things. 

                                 LENA
                        Like what?

                                 CLARA
                        Some say they boil a black cat and 
                        do things with its bones to make it 
                        so nobody every bother them. So 
                        that people can’t see them. Das all 
                        I know. 

           Lena processes this. 

           Clara studies her. 

                                 CLARA (CONT’D)
                            (to Lena)
                        You think there’s a witch following 
                        you? 

           Helen looks at Lena too.

           The three of them jump at the sound of Mary’s voice.

                                 MARY
                        If ya’ll don’t close them eyes this 
                        instant!

           The girls glance at each other and hurry to their cots. Helen 
           eyes Lena as they all lie down. 

           Mary kisses her teeth and rolls over. They each lie in their 
           cot, smirking as they close their eyes.

           EXT. BELMONT PLANTATION - MORNING

           Morning dew on blades of grass as a carriage pulls in front 
           of the Big House. 

           INT. BIG HOUSE FOYER - MORNING

           Lena watches Elizabeth and Clara help Anne down the stairs, 
           her face much less swollen than the night before.
           EXT. BIG HOUSE PORCH - AT THE SAME TIME

           The horse and carriage is driven by a BLACK MAN (40s) sitting 
           outside in front of the porch. Master Henry and presumably 
           TOM BAYLOR (30s, white, more rugged than Henry), are having a 
           drink. 

                                 HENRY
                        So how are things?

                                 TOM
                            (charming)
                        Things are good...crop’s doin well 
                        this year. I’m doing great. If you 
                        see me wrestling a bear, help the 
                        bear!

           Henry laughs. They clink glasses.

           Elizabeth and Anne arrive at the front door when Anne grabs 
           Elizabeth's hands in hers and looks directly in her eyes. 

                                 ANNE
                        Thank you so much, please tell me 
                        how I can repay you for your 
                        kindness. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Don’t trouble your mind with such 
                        things. 

           Anne eyes holds Elizabeth’s gaze.

                                 ANNE
                        I don’t want to see his face. 

                                 ELIZABETH 
                        No, no. Come on now. You're his 
                        wife. 

           Anne looks disappointed by this response, but complies. 

           Elizabeth escorts her to the porch with a smile. Tom walks 
           toward her, Elizabeth subtly watches the interaction closely. 

                                 TOM
                            (kisses Anne on the cheek)
                        I was so worried about you. 

           Anne does her best to play along.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                            (to Elizabeth)
                        Elizabeth you look lovely as usual. 
           Elizabeth gives him a genuine smile. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                            (to Henry)
                        Darling why don’t you help Anne 
                        into the car?

                                 HENRY
                        Of course. 

           Henry and Anne walk ahead to the carriage when Elizabeth 
           loops her arm in his and walks with him toward the carriage. 
           Her warmth toward him still intact. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Tom.

                                 TOM
                        Hmm?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Do you know Sheriff Samuel Roll? 

                                 TOM
                        Yes, I believe I met him at your 
                        Christmas party last year. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yes! He and Henry are old friends. 

           They’re almost at the carriage. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                            (voice drops)
                        So if you lay another finger on 
                        Annabelle-

           Tom grows uncomfortable with her candor.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        I will make sure you are thrown in 
                        a cell where no one can hear you 
                        holler what you did or did not do. 

           Tom says nothing, Elizabeth takes a step back to allow him to 
           get into the carriage. 

           Henry closes the door and the carriage pulls off. 

           Elizabeth smiles and waves. 
           EXT. BELMONT PLANTATION - DAY

           Clara, Lena, and Helen walk across the yard toward the Big 
           House. 

           Luke crosses their path. 

                                 LUKE
                        Hello Clara!

           Clara cuts eyes at Luke. 

                                 CLARA
                        Hi Luke. 

           The girls continue walking as Luke’s eyes follow her. 

           They giggle as they enter the Big House.

           INT. BIG HOUSE KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

           Alice is in the kitchen kneading bread. Lena enters, grabs 
           the water bucket by the door. 

                                 LENA
                        Gone to get some water for the 
                        house Ms. Alice. 

                                 ALICE
                            (reacts to the initiative)
                        Alright baby. 

           EXT. FIELD - AFTERNOON

           Lena walks across the field past the well, swinging her 
           bucket. 

           EXT. WOODS - AFTERNOON

           She reaches a section of the woods, she looks around her.

           Her feet brush through the grass as she takes a few steps.

                                 LENA
                            (to herself)
                        One...two...three...

           Lena arrives to where she thinks The Woman’s hatch is. She 
           hops above an area. Not it. 

           She takes a couple steps over, she stops. 
           Her feet hop again, definitely landing on more pliable 
           ground. She crouches down, and knocks on the surface below 
           her. She steps off, waits. 

           No answer. 

           She knocks again, harder this time. And steps away. 

           The hatch swings open. Lena jumps back. She climbs down, 
           shutting it behind her. 

           INT. HATCH - AFTERNOON

           The Woman is standing in front of Lena, with a bundle of 
           straw in her hand. 

                                 WOMAN
                        Anybody see you?

                                 LENA
                        No. 

                                 WOMAN
                        Where do they think you are?

                                 LENA
                        Getting water. 

                                 WOMAN
                        So we don’t have much time. 

           Lena offers her a smile, and extends her hand. 

                                 LENA
                        I’m Lena. 

                                 WOMAN
                        Sit down. 

           Lena sits quickly. 

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        If you come here to use this on 
                        other folk you got another thing 
                        coming. 

                                 LENA
                        No ma’am. 

           The Woman stares Lena down, searching for honesty in her 
           eyes.
                                 WOMAN
                        Stick out your hands. 

           Lena extends them out parallel in front of her. 

           WHACK!

           The Woman strikes Lena’s arms with the reed. Lena jumps in 
           shock, looking at the Woman as if she’d been tricked. 

                                 LENA
                        Ow! What you do-

                                 WOMAN
                        Hmm...

           WHACK! Even harder this time. The candles on the shelves in 
           the dirt wall start to shake. 

           Lena tries to pull away but she’s not quick enough. WHACK!

           The candle rises and falls off the shelf and breaks in two. 
           The flame goes out. Before Lena can notice this, The Woman 
           raises the bundle of straw to strike her again. 

           Lena’s brow furrows above her fierce eyes.

           As the Woman brings her hand down, the reed slips through her 
           hand, and remains levitating in the air.

           Lena breathes heavily glaring at the Woman.

           Around Lena and the Woman, are household items floating mid-
           air.

           Lena notices the floating reed, then looks around her, long 
           enough to catch the other items floating in the air: a spoon, 
           the wood from her fire pit, a pot... 

           They all fall to the ground around them. 

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        That right there. Can’t happen. 

           Lena looks at the items on the ground around them. 

           The Woman grabs the wooden spoon. 

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Look. 

           The Woman’s expression is very focused, as a wooden spoon 
           rises from the ground and levitates between her and Lena. 
                                 LENA
                        How you do that so easy?

                                 WOMAN
                        It ain’t easy.

           The spoon slowly and softly returns to the ground. 

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Now you. 

           Lena composes herself. Squints hard at the spoon. 

           The spoon twitches on the ground, but it doesn’t rise. Lena 
           exhales in frustration. 

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Don’t get mad. Try again. 

           Lena refocuses her attention on the spoon. 

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Take all that light. That fire you 
                        feel in ya blood and push it out. 
                        Wrap it around the spoon. And lift 
                        it. 

           The spoon remains still. It twitches. Flips over. Then slowly 
           and shakily rises in front of Lena’s now grinning face. 

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Hold on now, you’re not done. Now 
                        bring it back down. 

           The spoon shakily falls then plops on the ground. 

           Lena quickly throws her self into The Woman’s arms for a hug, 
           surprising the Woman. 

                                 LENA
                        Thank you. 

           The Woman pauses, then embraces Lena in return. 

                                 WOMAN
                        You’re welcome.

           EXT. BELMONT COTTON PLANTATION - LATE AFTERNOON

           Lena walks back toward the Big House.  

           Ben is by the barn, feeding a horse. He watches Lena go by.
           The field slaves are out. Picking in the distance. 

           Lena looks on. 

           Her eyes fall on her mother’s figure. Lena watches her for a 
           moment. Then walks on. 

           INT. BIG HOUSE KITCHEN - DAY 

           Lena is helping Alice make ginger cakes. Alice takes a floury 
           hand and brushes some flour on Lena’s nose. Lena laughs. 

           Clara is sweeping the floor. 

                                 ALICE
                            (to Lena)
                        This here is what I make best. 
                        And the swirl on top lets you know 
                        this is Alice’s ginger cakes. 

           Lena smiles. 

           There’s a knock on the door, it opens. 

           Luke shyly enters, holding something behind his back.  

                                 LUKE
                        Afternoon Ms. Alice, Little Lena.
                            (looks and smiles at Clara)
                        Clara. 

           Lena smirks at Luke’s grin just for Clara. 

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                            (to Alice)
                        Just came to pick up the clothes 
                        for the new hands.  

                                 ALICE
                        Mhm, right in that basket there. 
                        Bring it back in the morning 
                        Mary’ll be wanting it. 

                                 LUKE
                        Sure, sure. Uh, these is for you 
                        Clara. 

           Luke pulls from behind his back a humble but lovely bunch of 
           yellow coneflowers. 

           Clara eyes him, and says nothing. 

           Alice eyes tell Clara not to be rude. 
           Clara takes the flowers. 

                                 CLARA
                        Thank you. 

           Awkward silence.  

                                 LUKE
                        Alright now.

           Luke backs through the doorway from whence he came. The door 
           shuts.  

           The women don’t yet resume their work. 

           The door re-opens, Luke hastily grabs the basket he came for. 

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        Okay bye now. 

           The door closes shut. 

           The women start laughing. 

           Mary enters the kitchen. 

                                 ALICE
                        Girl why won’t you be nice to that 
                        poor man! 

           Clara rolls her eyes. 

                                 MARY
                        Who, Luke? That man has eyes for 
                        Clara since he first seent her!

                                 CLARA
                        Mm-mm! His ears too small. 

                                 ALICE
                        His ears too small?!

                                 CLARA
                        Everybody know that a man with 
                        small ears don’t want nothin more 
                        for himself than food in his belly 
                        and a place to lay his head. 

                                 MARY
                        And a piece of Clara-pie!

           Lena watches as Clara playfully hits Mary on the arm.
                                 CLARA
                        Oh hush!

                                 ALICE
                        “Everybody knows”...don’t nobody 
                        know this foolishness you be making 
                        up!

           Lena laughs along, when a cow bell rings outside. 

           Alice, Mary, and Clara halt. 

           Lena still has a smile on, not knowing the significance. 

           Lena watches them eye one another, put down what they’re 
           doing and head through the house. 

           Lena follows them, confused. 

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                            (under her breath)
                        Lord have mercy...

           Lena, Mary, and Clara and the rest of the house slaves arrive 
           at the porch.  

           EXT. BIG HOUSE PORCH - CONTINUOUS

           Right in front of the house is a gorgeous oak tree. The field 
           slaves are gathered near it. 

           Being tied to that tree is James the Blacksmith, shirtless, 
           torn up pants and no shoes. He has a black eye and already 
           looks badly beaten up. 

           Helen stands next to Lena. Her eyes are fearfully fixed on 
           James.

                                 CLARA
                            (whispers to Mary)
                        Who is that?

                                 LENA
                            (whispers)
                        That’s James.

           Lena looks for her mother in the group of field slaves. She 
           locks eyes with her.

           Luke joins the group, his sweet grin nowhere to be found. 

           CLOSE ON James’ wrists tied above his head. 
                                 CLARA
                        What’d he do?

                                 MARY
                        I don’t kno-

           CRACK! Lena and Mary jump.

           We continue to hear the crack of the whip against James, but 
           observe only the reactions to the scene.

           A Black Face grimaces. 

           A Black Face of indifference. 

           *CRACK*

           Elizabeth takes another sip of her tea. Another. She rises. 

           Lena’s eyes follow Elizabeth as she casually walks inside and 
           signals Clara to follow her. 

           Lena’s eyes fall on a BLACK WOMAN on her knees, who looks on, 
           her body hunched. Is that his mother?

           A Black Face of Numbness. 

           *CRACK*

           A Black Face looks down to the ground. 

           A line of the House Women look on, stoically. 

           Except for Lena. *CRACK* She stifles a jump. 

           Elizabeth’s tea set is next to Lena. Which is now quivering. 

           Master Henry is tiring out. He breathes a little heavier. He 
           holds the whip over to his left, signaling the overseer to 
           take over. 

           The tea set continues to quiver while Lena looks on. The 
           sound of the shaking catches Helen’s eye. She looks at it for 
           a moment when the overseer takes the whip and lands his first 
           lash on James, pulling her attention back to the scene. 

           *CRACK*

           Lena’s eyes follow Master Henry as he uses a handkerchief to 
           wipe speckles of blood off of his face. 

                                 HENRY
                            (to the Overseer)
                        Finish.
           The House Slaves keep their eyes off of him as he passes into 
           the Big House.  

                                 MARY
                        Come on.

           The House Slaves walk back into the house, Helen pauses to 
           notice that the tea set is still again.  

           INT. BIG HOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Lena walks past the living room, where Elizabeth sits in her 
           chair, reading. Lena watches as Henry approaches her. 

           SLOW MOTION:

           Henry stands there, leans forward to give Elizabeth a kiss on 
           her cheek. She smiles at him, places her hand on his chest. 
           His shirt, still speckled with blood. 

           Lena watches this moment with curiosity.

           EXT. BIG HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Alice, Clara, and Helen are doing the dishes. Lena is in and 
           out of the kitchen, coming and going. It would appear that 
           dinner-time wasn’t too long ago. 

                                 ALICE
                        How his Mama holdin’ up? 

                                 CLARA
                        Holdin’ up?
                            (her voice drops down to a 
                             whisper)
                        Massa won’t even let her-

           The dialogue halts as the door opens. It’s only Lena walking 
           in with dirty dishes. 

                                 CLARA (CONT’D)
                            (still in a whisper)
                        Massa won’t even let nobody take 
                        down his body yet.

           Lena hears this, she turns towards the only window; her back 
           to the other house girls. A dark silhouette can be made-out, 
           still hanging from the tree. The stack of plates in Lena’s 
           arms are levitating out of her hands. 

           Lena sees this, and quickly grabs them before anyone sees. A 
           plate slips, they may fall.
           She’s got it.

                                 ALICE
                        Lord have mercy bring those plates 
                        here baby. 

           Helen eyes Lena with suspicion as she brings the plates to 
           Alice. 

           EXT. BELMONT PLANTATION - NIGHT

           Lena stands outside the door that leads to the kitchen. It’s 
           really dark.

           She sees James’ silhouette hanging by his wrists from the 
           tree. His head bowed. 

           Lena holds a bucket of water in one hand. Her other hand 
           fidgets with a small gourd. She takes a step toward James, 
           the ground crinkling underneath her foot. 

           Lena leaps back against the house at the sight of John the 
           Overseer walking past James toward the slave cabin, gulping a 
           bottle of alcohol. 

           Lena thinks to herself, she crouches down to the ground, and 
           scoops the water into the gourd. Lena extends her arm out 
           holding the gourd. It shakily leaves Lena’s hand toward 
           James. 

           The gourd quivers and floats in the air. Lena squints and 
           extends her hand with concentration with the gourd tilts left 
           and spills all the water in it. 

           Lena sighs in frustration and the gourd PLOPS to the ground. 

           EXT. BELMONT PLANTATION CABINS - AT THE SAME TIME

           John the overseer turns back at the sound. 

           EXT. BELMONT PLANTATION - AT THE SAME TIME

           Lena moves in the dark to retrieve the gourd and retreats to 
           the wall of the Big House to refill it. 

           Lena outstretches her arm once again, the gourd leaving her 
           fingertips. The gourd shakily floats across, meeting James. 

           James’ eyes are both swollen shut, he wakes at the touch of 
           the gourd to his cheek. 
           Lena stands in the dark, extending her hands with great 
           focus. 

           James sips with great thirst. After a few moments the gourd 
           sways to the ground. James turns his head to the sound of 
           footsteps. 

                                 JAMES
                        Who’s there?

           Lena picks up the gourd. 

                                 LENA
                        It’s Lena, Mistuh James. 

           Lena looks over James’ bruised and abused face. Yet, you see 
           James looks moved by her gesture. 

                                 JAMES
                        Thank you little Lena. 

           *crunch* Lena looks up at the sound.  

           The ground crunches underneath John’s boots. 

           John re-approaches the area, looking around. 

           He sees no one but James. 

           EXT. BIG HOUSE - AT THE SAME TIME

           The door to the kitchen closes quietly. 

           INT. BIG HOUSE, BABY’S BEDROOM - EVENING

           Elizabeth sits in a sofa chair, reading to baby Joseph, while 
           Lena stands and fans them, listening as well. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        “If a pig wore a wig. What could we 
                        say?

           Elizabeth sees that Joseph is sound asleep. She pauses. She 
           looks up at Lena who is dozing off. She watches Lena for a 
           moment. 

           Elizabeth looks back the book.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Treat him as a gentleman, and say 
                        ‘Good Day’. 
           Elizabeth looks back at Lena, who is now completely asleep, 
           leaning against the sofa chair. Her cheek smushed against the 
           chair, mouth slightly open.  

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        If his tail chanced to fail. 

           Elizabeth places baby Joseph in the crib. She walks over to 
           Lena. 

           Elizabeth stands inches away from Lena, watching her 
           curiously. 

           She lifts sleeping Lena into her arms.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        What could we do?

           In Elizabeth’s arms, Lena’s eyes open, realizing what’s 
           happening. Then her eyes soften, allowing it. 

           Elizabeth gently places Lena in her reading chair. Elizabeth 
           lays a blanket over Lena. Lena sleepily shuffles in the 
           chair, getting more comfortable.  

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Send for a tailoress, to get one 
                        new.” 

           Lena’s sleepy POV of Elizabeth as she walks away, the image 
           blurs as Elizabeth closes the door behind her. 

           INT. BIG HOUSE, BABY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Lena wakes in the reading chair. She looks out the window to 
           see that it’s still the middle of the night. 

           INT. BIG HOUSE ATTIC - NIGHT

           Lena enters the attic of sleeping house slaves. She sees that 
           Helen lies in her cot, the only one awake, staring at the 
           ceiling. Their eyes meet at the sound of the floorboards 
           creaking under Lena’s feet. 

           Lena looks away and gets into her cot. 

           EXT. BELMONT COTTON PLANTATION - MORNING

           The sun has barely reached its height. The field slaves are 
           picking cotton. 
           INT. BIG HOUSE - AT THE SAME TIME

           Elizabeth writes a letter. 

           INT. BIG HOUSE - AT THE SAME TIME

           Henry entertains 2 WELL DRESSED MEN (white, 30s) in his 
           study.

           INT. KITCHEN - AT THE SAME TIME

           Alice is in the kitchen, Helen helps her pickle meats. 

           Lena enters, grabs the bucket and leaves.

           INT. HATCH - MORNING

           The Woman and Lena are sitting in her candlelit hatch. Lena’s 
           hands on her lap, palms up. 

                                 WOMAN
                        What you think of the Big House?

           Lena shrugs and shakes her head.

                                 LENA
                        Everything is fine till it ain’t. 

           Lena thinks to herself, her eyes start to well up. 

           Any item near her is moving away from her body, like the 
           energy around her is pulsating out of her. 

           The Woman eyes this. 

                                 WOMAN
                        What you thinkin' about? 

                                 LENA
                        My mama.

                                 WOMAN
                        Hmm. 
                            (pauses)
                        I want you to take some deep 
                        breaths. In...

           Lena breathes in.

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Out...
           Lena exhales. 

           The items around them start to quiver, less, and less, till 
           they stop altogether.

                                 WOMAN (O.C) (CONT’D)
                        Good.  

                                 LENA
                        So...

           The Woman places a glass bottle on the ground. 

                                 WOMAN
                        Lift and hold. 

           Lena takes a moment to understand what she means. She 
           concentrates on the bottle, using her hand to levitate it. 

                                 LENA
                        How long you lived here?

           The bottle rises. 

           The Woman ignores the question. 

                                 WOMAN
                        Now hold. 

           Lena tries to keep the bottle in one place. 

           The dirty green bottle more so bounces in the air. 

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Concentrate. 

           The bottle bounces. Less...even less...until its still. 

                                 LENA
                        Ha! 

           As Lena exclaims the bottle flies left and breaks. 

           Lena’s face evolves from joy to “whoops”. 

                                 LENA (CONT’D)
                        Sorry...

           The Woman sighs. 

           Lena moves to clean up the pieces. 

                                 LENA (CONT’D)
                        So how long? 
                                 WOMAN
                            (dismissively)
                        I don’t know. A long time. 

           Lena looks annoyed at this response. The Woman notices.

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        I used my power. And someone died. 
                        So I had to run.

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Dinner has just ended. 

           Clara brings dishes in from the dining room.

           Helen brings in more dishes through the swinging door, 
           balancing one too many in her arms. The door bumps Helen’s 
           back ever so slightly. A plate in the pile of dishes shifts, 
           causing the teacup on top of it to turn over and fall. It 
           shatters on the floor. 

           The women look up in alarm, Lena watches panic wash over 
           Helen’s body. Frozen. 

           Lena moves quickly to pick up the pieces. 

           We hear footsteps coming from the dining room. Helen looks 
           terrified. 

           Elizabeth enters through the same swing door. Helen does her 
           best to compose herself. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What was that?

           Helen’s eyes are wide, looking away from Elizabeth.

           Silence. Lena looks at the other women. 

           Lena sees Clara stare down Helen. Clara opens her mouth to 
           speak-

                                 LENA (O.S.)
                        It was me Missus. 

           Lena takes care not to make direct eye contact with 
           Elizabeth.

                                 LENA (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. I was carrying the 
                        dishes and the cup slipped. So 
                        sorry Missus. 
           Elizabeth studies her for a moment. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Don’t let it happen again. 

                                 LENA
                            (head bowed)
                        Yes Missus. 

           Elizabeth exits. 

           The women look at Lena in surprise. Helen gives her a 
           thankful glance. 

           EXT. BELMONT COTTON PLANTATION - NIGHT

           The plantation is quiet. There is a warm light coming from 
           the kitchen window. 

           INT. BIG HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Alice, Mary, Helen, Clara, Ben, and Lena are all in the 
           kitchen. They eat scraps while Lena helps Alice clean.

           Ben tells them a story of something funny that happened in-
           town.

           There’s humorous banter amongst them all. Their laughter is 
           beautiful. Even Helen laughs a bit, which makes Lena smile. 

           INT. BIG HOUSE ATTIC - NIGHT

           Lena is sleeping amongst the other house slaves. She wakes up 
           and quietly gets out of her cot. Alice stirs. 

                                 ALICE
                            (whispers sleepily)
                        Where you goin'?

                                 LENA
                        Outhouse. 

           Alice nods and goes back to sleep. 

           Lena notices Helen isn’t in her cot. 

           INT. BIG HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Lena lights a small oil lamp and walks through the back door 
           of the kitchen. 
           INT. OUTHOUSE - NIGHT

           Lena sleepily squats in the wooden outhouse. There are cracks 
           through the wooden panels, moonlight slices some of the 
           darkness. 

           The oil lamp is on the dirt ground, its orange glow lights 
           her face. One elbow on her knee, Lena’s hand is smushed 
           against her cheek. 

           CRACKLE. 

           Lena jumps as something moves past the outhouse, breaking up 
           the sheets of moonlight. Lena finishes up. She grabs the oil 
           lamp. 

           EXT. BELMONT PLANTATION - CONTINUOUS

           Lena walks toward the Big House, watchful of her 
           surroundings. 

           Her eyes fall on the Blacksmith’s work cabin. 

           The door is ajar. Did she see it move? Lena looks back at the 
           Big House then back at the cabin.

           She walks toward the cabin, careful not to make any noise. 
           She stands in front of the open door for a moment and pauses. 
           She enters, holding the small oil lamp into the darkness. 

           A hand comes in from behind her and covers her mouth. The 
           other hand: a knife to her throat. 

           The lamp’s glow reveals a YOUNG BOY (Black, 14, strong build) 
           with an intense gaze. 

                                 YOUNG BOY
                        I don’t wanna hurt you. But I will 
                        if you make a sound. 

           Lena remains still, wide-eyed. 

                                 YOUNG BOY (CONT’D)
                        Will you? 

           Lena shakes her head no. The Young Boy slowly releases her. 

           The orange glow of her oil lamp and the knife pointed at her 
           take up the space between them. 

                                 LENA
                        You that runaway.
           The boy nods. 

           Silence. They study each other for a moment. 

                                 LENA (CONT’D)
                        You can’t stay here. Everybody is 
                        lookin' for you. 

                                 YOUNG BOY
                        I know. 

           Lena looks down at Koi’s tattered pants. They’re soaked. He 
           has cuts on his face. Hair a mess. He looks exhausted. 

           The boy picks up on Lena’s observation.

                                 YOUNG BOY (CONT’D)
                        The dogs almost caught me. Had to 
                        stay in the river for two days. 

           Lena takes that information in, impressed. But Lena notices 
           his hand is shaky as he holds the knife. His eyes afraid.

                                 YOUNG BOY (CONT’D)
                        You got any food? 

                                 LENA
                            (pauses)
                        They’ll notice if I take anything. 

           Koi nods, understanding. He finally drops the knife.

           Silence.

                                 LENA (CONT’D)
                        I’m Lena. 

                                 YOUNG BOY
                        Koi. 

                                 LENA
                        What kinda name is Koi? 

                                 KOI
                        What kinda name is Lena? Ya Massa 
                        give you that? 

           Lena gives him a sharp look. 

           More silence. 

                                 LENA
                        Why’d you run?
           Koi pauses. Looks at Lena. 

                                 KOI
                        I don’t wanna die here. 

           Lena studies him. 

                                 KOI (CONT’D)
                        I gotta go. While it’s still dark. 

           Silence. Dog barking can be heard faintly in the distance. 

                                 LENA
                        There’s a well 2 miles south from 
                        here. Meet me there at first light. 
                        I know someone who can help you. 

           Koi hesitates.

                                 KOI
                        How do I know you won’t tell? 

           Lena thinks to herself. 

                                 LENA
                        You don’t, I guess. Meet me there. 
                        First light. 

           Koi nods, his eyes follow Lena as she leaves the cabin. 

           INT. BIG HOUSE ATTIC - NIGHT

           Lena returns to the attic. Everyone is still asleep. Lena’s 
           brow furrows at the sight of Helen’s empty cot. 

           Still, Lena quietly lies down and closes her eyes. 

           EXT. BELMONT PLANTATION - EARLY MORNING

           Mist over the fields of the plantation. Just before dawn. 

           INT. BIG HOUSE KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING

           Alice is getting started in the kitchen. Clara, Mary and 
           Helen are there putting on their aprons. Lena enters, 
           watching them. 

                                 LENA
                        Good mornin’ 
                          CLARA
                                                        ALICE
           Good mornin’
                                            Mornin’ baby

                                 MARY
                        Mornin’

           Helen acknowledges her. Lena cooly walks toward the empty 
           water bucket. 

                                 LENA
                        I’ll get this filled up for you 
                        right away Ms. Alice. 

                                 ALICE
                        Mhm.

           Helen’s eyes follow Lena as she exits.

           EXT. BELMONT PLANTATION - CONTINUOUS

           Lena walks hastily toward the woods. Blue light cools the 
           woods.

           EXT. FIELD/WELL - LATER

           Lena approaches the well. There is no one in sight. She 
           approaches carefully, starts to pump the water into the well. 
           She looks around, she stops.

           Rustle in the trees can be heard. Koi emerges. 

           Lena walks toward him.

                                 LENA
                        I said first light. 

                                 KOI
                        I was here. Had to be sure you was 
                        alone. 

           EXT. WOODS - MORNING

           Lena and Koi approach the location of the Woman’s hatch. 

           Lena hops up and down, confirming the hatch’s location. Koi 
           watches as Lena knocks on it and steps off.

           The hatch door lifts and The Woman emerges. Koi’s eyes widen 
           at the sight of this, which makes Lena smirk. 
                                 WOMAN
                        What are you doing here? 
                            (sees Koi)
                        Who is that?

                                 LENA
                        He needs our help. 

           The Woman looks pissed.

                                 WOMAN
                        No.

                                 LENA
                        Please. 
                            (Lena looks pleadingly)
                        They’ll find him for sure. 

           The Woman looks at Lena, then studies Koi. 

                                 WOMAN
                            (massaging her temples)
                        Did anyone see you? 

                                 LENA
                        No. 

                                 WOMAN
                            (to Koi)
                        You gon’ give me trouble? 

                                 KOI
                        I won’t if you won’t. 

           The Woman looks around once more.

                                 WOMAN
                        Get in. 

           The Woman descends.

           Koi doesn’t move. Lena motions him toward the hatch. He gives 
           her a look that says “In there?” 

           Lena nods. Koi walks toward it. 

           INT. WOMAN’S HATCH - CONTINUOUS 

           The Woman paces in the tiny low lit space, near Lena. Koi is 
           standing near the ladder, taking in his new candlelit 
           surroundings.
                                 WOMAN
                            (whispers)
                        It was real foolish bringing him 
                        here Lena. 

                                 LENA
                            (looking at Koi then back 
                             at the Woman)
                        They gon’ kill him if they find 
                        him. 

                                 WOMAN
                        And now they’ll kill me too.

           Lena’s face reveals she hadn’t thought about that.

           INT. BIG HOUSE KITCHEN - DAY

           Lena returns to the kitchen with the bucket. Helen sits in 
           the chair churning butter with Lena’s red ribbon in her hair.

           Clara enters with a basket of vegetables.

                                 ALICE
                        Good, bring that over here quick. 
                        The Missus is in a mood today. 

           Lena obliges. 

           On cue, Elizabeth enters. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Seems like everyone prefers to move 
                        glacially this morning. 

           Elizabeth inspects Alice’s jars of jams. She notices the 
           ribbon in Helen’s hair. 

           She walks over to Helen. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        If you don’t churn faster it will 
                        spoil. 

                                 LENA
                        I couldn’t churn any faster than 
                        that Missus. 

           Alice looks up. Helen looks up. Clara looks up. 

           Elizabeth observes their reactions. 

           *WHACK* 
                                 ELIZABETH
                        You will speak when spoken to. 

           Lena holds the side of her face, looking down. 

           INT. WOMAN’S HATCH - DAY

           Lena enters the hatch. Lena smirks at the sight of Koi 
           sewing. 

           He smiles back and shrugs, glancing at The Woman who has just 
           finished skinning a rabbit. The Woman wipes her hands.  

                                 WOMAN
                        How long we got?

                                 LENA
                         Hour maybe. 

                                 WOMAN
                        Stand there. 

           Lena obeys. The Woman places two glass bottles on the ground 
           in front of her. 

           Lena doesn’t know what to do. 

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        You gon’ lift it. 

                                 LENA
                        Two? Together?

                                 WOMAN
                        Mhm. 

           Lena glances at Koi, whose face says: What is going on right 
           now?

                                 LENA
                        Can’t we do this outside?

                                 WOMAN
                        Not safe. Go on. 

           Lena remains hesitant. The Woman doesn’t change her mind. 

           Lena takes in a deep breath. She uses her hand to signal the 
           bottles’ levitation. She glances at Koi’s furrowed brow. 

           One lifts. Not the other.  
                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Try again. 

           With more concentration Lena’s arm extends. Still only one 
           bottle moves.  

           Lena slices her arm through the air in frustration, and both 
           bottles go flying, barely missing Koi, mouth agape. 

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                            (casually)
                        Hm. 

                                 KOI
                        How did you do that?!

                                 WOMAN
                            (eyes locked on Lena)
                        Not now Koi. 

                                 LENA
                        It works better when I’m mad. 

           The Woman grabs a candle from one of her shelves. 

                                 WOMAN
                        You’re not mad all the time? 

           Koi picks up a piece of glass from the bottle. 

                                 KOI
                            (under his breath)
                        I am. 

                                 WOMAN
                        Look.

           The Woman holds the candle in front of Lena. 

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Right before that bottle flies, 
                        what do you feel?

           Lena thinks. 

                                 LENA
                        Hot. Tingly.

                                 WOMAN
                        That feeling, and this fire. 
                        They’re the same. The same thing. 
                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        You gotta gather all that. That 
                        extra feelin’ you feel in your 
                        skin?
           Lena nods.

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        From your stomach. From your legs. 
                        From your chest. And push it out. 
                        Make it bigger.

           Koi watches Lena. 

           Lena considers this.

                                                        FLASHBACK TO:

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Slow motion:

           Lena watches Elizabeth kissing Henry’s cheek, his shirt 
           speckled with blood. 

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Slow motion:

           Helen’s solemn expression as she runs a warm cloth down 
           Elizabeth’s naked shoulder.

                                                              CUT TO:

           INT. WOMAN’S HATCH - PRESENT

           Lena takes a deep breath. Her eyes fierce. 

           In her eyes’ reflection, we see fire growing. 

           The Woman watches as Lena’s hands surround the candle, the 
           size of the flame is huge.

           Lena releases, the flame returns to its normal size. 

           The Woman smiles, she grabs two bottles, and places them in 
           front of Lena.

           Both bottles lift with ease. 
           Koi’s eyes are wide. Lena looks self-satisfied, though a 
           little tired. The Woman nods. 

                                 WOMAN
                        Good.

           The Woman returns to her skinned rabbit. 

           Koi’s face of disbelief.

           EXT. FIELD - LATER

           Koi and Lena are walking toward the well. The sky holds hues 
           of pink and blue.

                                 LENA
                        I’ve always been like this. I just 
                        didn’t know I could do anything 
                        about it. 

                                 KOI
                        So you’s a witch. 

                                 LENA
                            (snaps)
                        I’m not a witch! 

                                 KOI
                        Sorry. 

           Silence. 

           They continue walking. 

                                 KOI (CONT’D)
                        My papa told me that there’s 
                        powerful women where we come from. 
                        Before the boats. 

           Lena listens. 

                                 KOI (CONT’D)
                        He said they powerful. Could see 
                        things. Know things. Move things. I 
                        can’t remember what they was 
                        called. But maybe you’s like that.  

           Lena nods, appreciating his theory. 

                                 LENA
                        Where’s yo Papa now? 
                                 KOI
                        Dead. 

           Koi’s eyes meet hers. 

                                 LENA
                        Then you ran. 

           Koi neither confirms nor denies.

                        Mines dead too. 

           They arrive to the well, Lena ropes the bucket down. Koi’s 
           eyes stay aware of his surroundings. Lena notices this. 

                                 LENA (CONT’D)
                        You mighty brave to be out here 
                        like this. 

                                 KOI
                        They expect us to run at night. But 
                        I still gotta be careful. But I 
                        needed the air. I don’t know how 
                        that lady does it.  
                            (pauses)
                        What’s her name? 

                                 LENA
                        She never tell me. 

           Lena slowly pulls the bucket up the well.  

                                 KOI
                        I wish I had what you had.

                        Why?

                                 KOI
                        You can do anything! You can bring 
                        that bucket up without even 
                        touching it! Why don’t you? Nothing 
                        can get in your way. 

                                 LENA
                        You know that’s not true. 

           Koi waits for her to go on. 

                                 LENA (CONT’D)
                        You got everybody in the state

                        me?  

           Lena unties the bucket and lifts it from the well.

                                 KOI

           EXT. BELMONT PLANTATION - DAY

           Lena is close to the Big House. A slave is chopping wood on a 
           stump nearby. Near the entrance to the kitchen are two white 
           men on horses. Lena recognizes one of them. 

           Slave Traders. 
           Lena keeps her eyes down, as she tries to move undetected.

           The Slave Trader notices her. 

                                 SLAVE TRADER
                            (to Lena)
                        You girl. Bring that water here. 

           Lena looks at the kitchen entrance, then back at them. She 
           brings the bucket of water over.

           John the overseer approaches them as they take a sip of 
           water. John pulls along a resistant field slave, Hattie, by 
           her arm. She’s no longer pregnant. 

           Lena takes a step back from the scene. Something else catches 
           Lena’s eye. 

           The flutter of a curtain through a window in the Big House. 
           Elizabeth stands there looking on. 

                                 JOHN
                        Paperwork’s done?

                                 SLAVE TRADER
                        Yes, Sir. 

                                 JOHN
                        Good, here ya go. 
           Hattie manages to slip from John’s grip. 

           She runs to the stump where the slave was chopping wood. 
           Grabs his axe. 

           Lena’s eyes widen as we hear a loud *CRACK*. 

           Hattie turns back to John and the Slave Traders. Her wrist, 
           bloody and handless. 

           Tears stream down Hattie’s face.

                                 HATTIE
                        You gon’ sell me now?

           Lena looks on in horror. She looks back up at the window, 
           Elizabeth remains in the window. Watching. 

           EXT. SLAVE CABINS - MORNING

           Lena walks on the plantation. She holds something in a cloth 
           napkin. The Big House is far behind her. Cotton field 
           alongside her. She walks past a clearing where a “church” 
           service is being held by one of the field slaves. The singing 
           of hymns. 

           Lena arrives at a cabin and knocks on the door. A grin 
           emerges on Lena’s face as Grace opens the door. She yanks 
           Lena into her arms.

           INT. GRACE’S CABIN - MORNING

           Lena hands Grace the napkin. Grace opens it, revealing two 
           pieces of fresh bread. 

                                 LENA
                        From Ms. Alice. 

                                 GRACE
                        Thank you baby. Let’s eat it 
                        together. 

                                 LENA
                        No, no that’s for you Mama. 

                                 GRACE
                        Hush. Ain’t nothin’ I’d rather do. 

           Lena and Grace sit at their small wooden table. They savor 
           their first bite of bread. 
                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        So how are you baby? 

                                 LENA
                        I’m good. 

                                 GRACE
                        Has anyone seen your...

                                 LENA
                        No... 

                                 GRACE
                        Lena.

           Lena looks into her mother’s face. 

                                 LENA
                        No mama, no one at the house has 
                        seen me. 

           Grace scans Lena’s eyes. Pauses.

                                 GRACE
                        The Missus ever put her hands on 
                        you? 

                                 LENA
                            (cockily)
                        Once. I’m alright. 

                                 GRACE
                        Don’t get big in there. She is not 
                        to be messed with. 

           Lena nods with a little disregard.

                                 LENA
                        Can I show you somethin?

           Lena takes a deep breath, and extends her index finger. 

           Grace’s eyes watch her piece of bread rise from the table, 
           and twirl. It’s lovely.  

                                 LENA (CONT’D)
                        I can control it now. 

           The bread continues to rise toward their eye-line. It twirls. 

           Lena is smiling, Grace is not. 

                                 GRACE
                        Where you learn to do that?
                                 LENA
                        I been practicin’. 

                                 GRACE
                        Practicin’. Why?  

           The bread falls to the table. 

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        Lena this can get you killed. Don’t 
                        you understand that? 

                                 LENA
                        But Mama I can control it now. 

                                 GRACE
                        I don’t care. 

           Grace’s frustration grows. 

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        Have you learned nothin in that 
                        house? Have you seen nothin?! 

           Grace looks at her child, at a loss for words.

           Lena’s eyes study Grace’s fear. 

           INT. KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

           Helen and Lena are preparing the Master bedroom. Helen 
           notices Lena is a little quiet but says nothing. Helen places 
           a warming pan in the bed. 

                                 LENA
                        Helen

           Helen looks at her. 

                                 LENA (CONT’D)
                        You ever think about...leavin’?

           Helen’s eyes widen at her words and she closes the bedroom 
           door. 

           Lena continues, whispering. 

                                 LENA (CONT’D)
                        Or standin’ up? 

           Helen gives her a look that says “Stop talking!”
                                 LENA (CONT’D)
                        to Missus Elizabeth?

           Helen’s gaze is intense. 

           Mary opens the door. Their eye contact breaks. 

           Mary senses she’s walked in on something. 

                                 MARY
                        Alice is ready for y’all to start 
                        on dinner. 

           Helen quickly exits. 

           Mary looks at Lena. Lena shrugs. 

           EXT. WOMAN’S HATCH - NIGHT

           Lena walks toward the Woman’s hatch. Her head tilts at the 
           sight of the hatch door that’s been left ajar. 

           Lena quickens her pace. She cautiously descends. 

           INT. WOMAN’S HATCH - CONTINUOUS

                                 (O.C.) FEMALE VOICE:
                        You had no right...

           Lena recognizes this voice. Still going down the ladder-

           The voice is Grace’s. 

           Grace and the Woman stand face to face, and appear to be 
           arguing. 

           Koi sits in the corner, engaged but staying out of it. He 
           sees Lena. Grace and The Woman do not.  

                                 GRACE
                            (to The Woman)
                        You had no right-

                                 WOMAN
                        Watch yo mouth. I am still your 
                        mother-

           Lena processes the word “mother”. She looks at the Woman, 
           searches her memory.

                                 GRACE (O.S.)
                        She is MY child!
           Lena examines her peculiar mentor.

                                 LENA
                        Grammy Mabel?

           They don’t hear her. Mabel and Grace are still going at it.

                                 MABEL
                            (to Grace)
                        What was your plan? Hm? 

                                 GRACE
                        It ain’t safe-

                                 MABEL
                        This ain’t somethin’ you hide and 
                        it go away.  

                                 GRACE
                        You know all about hiding.

                                 MABEL
                        Cause you won’t run.

           Lena takes in all this new information.

                                 GRACE
                            (to Mabel)
                        So TEACHIN’ her is yo idea of 
                        fixin?

           Grace looks at Koi. 

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        And him?! Are you crazy? If they 
                        find you or Lena with this boy 
                        you’s DEAD. 
                        You’s dangerous! I don’t want Lena 
                        anywhere near-

           Grace follows Koi’s gaze. She sees Lena. 

                                 LENA
                            (to Grace)
                        How could you not tell me? 

           Koi watches Lena. He eyes Mabel’s house items shaking in the 
           room. 

           Grace moves toward Lena.

                                 GRACE
                        I was just tryna protect you. 
                                 LENA
                        By lying? You told me Gramma was 
                        dead! That there was no one like 
                        me! I thought I was sick! Or...or 
                        evil!

           Lena looks into her mother’s face.

                                 LENA (CONT’D)
                        But you’s the one who’s evil. You’s 
                        the liar. 

           Mabel’s eyes widen.

                                 MABEL
                        Lena- 

           Grace takes a step toward Lena. Lena uses her powers to smash 
           a bottle on the ground between them. 

           This scares Grace. 

           Lena leaves. 

           Grace and Mabel look at one another. 

           EXT. FIELD - CONTINUOUS

           Lena storms across the field. 

           Koi tries to catch up to Lena. 

                                 KOI
                        Lena. 

                                 LENA
                        Go away. 

                                 KOI
                        Come on. I’m sure they got a good 
                        reason- 

           Koi’s body lurches back and is pushed to the ground.

           Lena stands with her hands raised, glaring at him.

                                 LENA
                        Leave me alone!

           Koi sits in the grass, stunned. 
           INT. BIG HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Lena enters. Alice is prepping for tomorrow morning. Lena 
           walks right past her. 

                                 ALICE
                        Where you been? 

           Lena has no response. 

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong with you?

                                 LENA
                        I’m fine. 

           Alice studies her face. 

                                 ALICE
                        Go on upstairs.

           INT. BIG HOUSE STAIRS - NIGHT

           Lena walks upstairs. 

           INT. BIG HOUSE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Lena walks to the bedroom door. Lena pauses. Warm glow of 
           light coming through the crack in the door onto Lena’s face.  

           Lena peers in. Elizabeth is kneeled on the ground in a white 
           night gown. Hair unpinned and down. Head down.

                                 HENRY (O.C.)
                        End of discussion.

           The click of an oil lamp.

           Elizabeth remains there for a moment. In less light. 

           Lena watches her helpless posture. She stares at the ground. 
           She looks to the door. 

           Elizabeth looks up and catches Lena. 

           Lena quickly moves away from the door. 

           INT. BIG HOUSE BEDROOM - DAY

           Lena is sweeping the floor of the baby’s bedroom. A brown 
           hand grabs her arm, it’s Helen.
                                 LENA
                        Ow!

           Helen pulls her forcefully by the arm down the stairs. 

                                 LENA (CONT’D)
                        What is it?

           Lena tries to pull away from her but Helen holds on. 

                                 LENA (CONT’D)
                        Helen!

           They arrive to the doorway that leads to the porch, sunlight 
           falling into the house from it. 

           EXT. BIG HOUSE PORCH - CONTINUOUS

           Through the doorway comes Helen and Lena. Helen finally 
           releases her.  

           Lena’s eyes fall on something in front of her that we cannot 
           yet see. Her eyes widen. 

           Grace, is being loaded into the back of a horse-driven wagon. 
           Her wrists are chained together.

                                 LENA
                        Mama! 

           Grace looks up at the sound of Lena’s voice. Pain in her eyes 
           as she is roughly seated by a SLAVE SELLER (white, male, 30s) 
           into the wagon. Lena runs toward the wagon but Alice grabs 
           hold of her from behind, one hand on each shoulder. 

                                 LENA (CONT’D)
                        Where is she going? Where is she 
                        going?!

                                 ALICE
                        It’s okay baby. It’s okay...

           Lena breathes heavily. Her face desperate. 

           The Slave Seller casually gets onto the horse. We hear the 
           click of his tongue and the wheels of the wagon begin to 
           roll. 

           Grace’s eyes are locked on Lena, like she’s trying to engrave 
           her face in her memory. 

           Lena’s eyes dart around searching for a solution. 
           Lena subtly lifts her hand... 

           One of the wheels of the wagon slowly start to rise from the 
           ground. 

           No one seems to notice this but Grace, who tilts as the 
           wagon’s wheel rises. 

           Grace’s face grows serious. She quickly extends her arm out 
           toward the porch, signaling Lena to stop. 

           Grace’s palm fiercely outstretched toward Lena. Grace slowly 
           shakes her head, “no”. 

           Lena looks at her mother, incredulous. 

           Lena’s stiff fingers begin to soften. 

           Understanding, Lena helplessly lowers her hand.

           She watches her mother grow smaller down the dirt path 
           leading out of the plantation. Smaller. 

           And smaller. 

           Alice tries to console her, but Lena pulls away from her and 
           moves toward the doorway, but not before her eyes fall on 
           Elizabeth, who sits, content on the porch. 

           Elizabeth has not a drop of surprise on her face. 

           This was her doing. 

           Elizabeth casually returns Lena’s gaze. 

           Lena re-enters the house. 

           INT. BIG HOUSE, BABY’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Lena runs upstairs. She enters a bedroom and closes the door 
           behind her. 

           She erratically paces the room. 

           Her breathing quick and deep. 

           She paces back toward the baby’s crib, and finds baby Joseph 
           is sitting up now, awake. 

           Lena stares at Joseph. His blue eyes. His blonde hair. 

           Lena takes a step toward the crib. Her face holds a debate in 
           her head. 
           Lena picks up the baby. And moves to the window. 

           She holds him close, and looks through the window down below. 

           She takes another look at the baby boy. 

           He’s unknowing. No awareness. Still innocent. His blue eyes, 
           look up at her brown face.  

           Lena takes a deep exhale and quickly puts the baby back in 
           the crib. 

           She crouches down, head between her knees, hands squeezing 
           her hair.

           Alice and Helen enter the room.  Alice’s eyes widen. Helen 
           puts her hand over her mouth. 

           Lena is crouched down on the ground against the wall. All of 
           the furniture is levitating around her. The chandelier swings 
           violently above them.

           Including baby Joseph in the crib. 

           Helen looks frightened, she turns to leave, Alice stops her.

           Alice slowly moves toward Lena. 

                                 ALICE
                        Lena...

           Lena is sobbing. 

           Alice cautiously places her hand on Lena’s shoulder. 

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        It’s gonna be alright baby....it’s 
                        gon’ be alright...

           Alice gets down on the ground with Lena, and takes her little 
           body in her arms and rocks her. 

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry baby...shhhh...

           Helen watches as the furniture gets lower and lower. 

           THUD. 

           They finally drop to the ground. Only a chair falls to its 
           side. Loudly. 

           Baby Joseph laughs. 
           Helen is still processing all this. 

           Lena wipes her face and looks up at Alice. Alice looks at her 
           with a knowing. 

           Elizabeth enters. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What was that sound? 

                                 ALICE
                        Sound, Missus? 

           Elizabeth studies the three of them. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Leave us. 

           Alice and Helen make eye contact. They hesitantly exit. 

           Lena stands. Wipes her face. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Shame about your mama. But that’s 
                        just the way these things go 
                        sometime. 

           Lena can barely keep from glaring at the Mistress, she 
           manages not to look directly into her eyes. 

           Elizabeth steps toward her. 

           Elizabeth’s hand reaches to touch Lena’s chin. Lena jumps 
           slightly at her touch. Elizabeth notices this then gently 
           lifts Lena’s chin to look at her.  

           Lena’s eyes meet Elizabeth’s. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        It must be awful to have absolutely 
                        no family here. Even for your kind. 
                        But maybe, in some ways, I could be 
                        your family. I mean, we sleep in 
                        the same house after all. 

           Elizabeth offers her a small smile. Lena does not return it. 
           If anything, she only looks at her like she’s trying to 
           figure her out. 

           Elizabeth drops her hand. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        I do so much to make y’all happy. 
           Elizabeth moves toward Joseph, picking him up. She holds him 
           close. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Alice is downstairs in the kitchen 
                        preparing for my sister’s arrival. 
                        Go’on and help her. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Now.

           Lena glares at Elizabeth. Lena turns to leave. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Lena. 

           Lena turns to look in her direction. 

           Elizabeth looks at the chair, then looks back at Lena. 

           Lena slowly walks to the chair, places it upright. 
           Elizabeth’s eyes follow her and she exits the room.  

           Elizabeth rocks baby Joseph in her arms, she looks up, 
           noticing the chandelier is swaying just a little.

           INT. BIG HOUSE KITCHEN 

           Alice, Clara, Mary, Helen and Lena are preparing dinner 
           silently. Helen is peeling potatoes while Lena chops them 
           alongside her. 

           Helen watches Lena, whose face is vacant. 

           EXT. WOODS - AFTERNOON

           Lena is carrying a wooden bucket, she checks her surroundings 
           and lifts the door to her grandmother’s hatch. 

           INT. MABEL’S HATCH - CONTINUOUS

           Lena is coming down the ladder. 

                                 MABEL
                        Wasn’t expecting to see you today. 

           Koi is in the corner, carving something from wood. He looks 
           up at Lena. 

           Mabel is chopping up roots. Lena just looks at her. 
                                 MABEL (CONT’D)
                            (not looking up)
                        How much time you got?

           Lena says nothing. She shuffles a bit, making Mabel look up 
           from her task. 

           Mabel studies Lena’s face. Koi too. 

                                 MABEL (CONT’D)
                        What is it? 

           Lena takes a long pause. Her eyes searching the air. For 
           answers. For words. For voice.

                                 LENA
                        Mama...she’s...gone. 

           It’s seems Mabel and Koi know what she means by “gone”. Mabel 
           takes a breath. 

           Silence.

                                 MABEL
                            (voice lowering)
                        When?

                                 LENA
                        This afternoon.

                                 MABEL
                        You know where?

                                 LENA
                        I’m not sure. Mary thinks she heard 
                        them say Bullock.

           Mabel nods. Returns to cutting. 

                                 LENA (CONT’D)
                        What do we do? 

                                 MABEL
                        Nothing. 

                                 LENA
                        Nothing? What you mean nothing? 

           Mabel doesn’t answer. 

                                 LENA (CONT’D)
                        What you mean noth-
                                 MABEL
                        What can we do Lena?

                                 LENA
                        Why you been teaching me then? 

           Lena watches Mabel continue chopping. 

                                 LENA (CONT’D)
                        What’s it for?

           Lena’s eyes plead with Mabel’s. Waiting for an answer. Mabel 
           looks away and says nothing. 

           Lena turns around and goes back up the ladder. 

           Koi watches Mabel chopping. Helplessly. 

           EXT. FIELD - CONTINUOUS

           Blue light from the setting Sun while Lena moves across the 
           field. 

           EXT. BIG HOUSE - LATER

           Sunset. 

           Lena is approaching the Big House. 

           INT. BIG HOUSE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Alice is in the kitchen as usual as Lena enters. Lena puts 
           her bucket down, avoids eye contact, and tries to walk past 
           her.

                                 ALICE
                        I remember when your grandma first 
                        showed me what she could do. 

           Lena whips around. 

           Alice takes a seat at the table with a big exhale. 

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        When we were little girls, she 
                        would take these big red 
                        sunflowers, 

                                                        FLASHBACK TO:
           EXT. FIELD - DAY

           Dreamy view of two little girls, YOUNG ALICE (9) and YOUNG 
           MABEL (9) laughing in a flowery field. Young Mabel uses her 
           powers to manipulate the flower. Young Alice looks dazzled by 
           the sight. 

                                 ALICE (V.O.)
                        put em in her hand, and make em 
                        look like they dancin’. 

                                                              CUT TO:

           INT. KITCHEN - PRESENT DAY

           Lena listens. 

                                 ALICE
                        I remember thinkin’, that there was 
                        a little bit of God in her hands. 
                        To do somethin’ so beautiful.

           EXT. BELMONT COTTON PLANTATION - DAY

           18-YEAR-OLD ALICE making eye contact with 18-YEAR OLD MABEL 
           through a Big House window. A red flower rises through the 
           air and taps the window-pane. 

           18-year-old Alice grins, lifting the window and taking the 
           floating flower.  

           Alice is called away by the Missus, and rushedly closes the 
           window. 18-year-old Mabel’s smile fades.

           INT. BIG HOUSE KITCHEN - PRESENT 

           Alice smiles at the memory. 
                                 ALICE (V.O.)
                        But then we got older. Things 
                        wasn’t as simple no more. 

                                                        FLASHBACK TO:

           EXT. BIG HOUSE - PORCH

           30-YEAR-OLD MABEL carries a sack of cotton from the fields. 
           She notices 30-YEAR-OLD ALICE with a black eye, standing 
           behind a different MISSUS (White, 30s, Elizabeth’s mother). 

           30-YEAR-OLD MABEL and 30-YEAR-OLD ALICE make eye contact. 
           Alice looks away. 

                                                              CUT TO:

           EXT. BELMONT COTTON PLANTATION - NIGHT

           An older Mabel we recogonize is walking at night. 

           Sounds of shuffling and whimpering. 

           MASTER GEORGE (white, Elizabeth’s father) overpowering an 
           older Alice against the wall of the Big House.  

           Mabel’s hand being extended. 

           George’s body being raised high into the air. 

           Mabel’s face with rage as she brings her hand down with 
           force. We hear a CRACK.

           Mabel running away, looking back at Alice. George’s limp body 
           between them. 

           Alice looking back at Mabel. Alice’s younger face fading into 
           her older face in the present.

           INT. BIG HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT (END OF FLASHBACK SEQUENCE)

                                 ALICE
                        She saved me. 

                                                              CUT TO:

           INT. BIG HOUSE - NIGHT

           Lena walks with Alice as she puts out all the candles in the 
           house. 
                                 LENA
                        So you knew this whole time?

                                 ALICE
                        No. I wondered though. Then I saw 
                        them plates risin’ from yuh 
                        fingers.

                                 LENA
                        Do you think Helen will say 
                        somethin’?

           They go up the stairs, moonlight hitting their figures.

                                 ALICE
                        I don’t think so. She’s been a 
                        little quiet lately, you notice?

           Alice offers Lena a smile. Lena smiles back.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Just be extra careful round the 
                        Missus. You know dat. 

           Lena nods. 

           INT. ATTIC - NIGHT

           House slaves in their cots. Lena’s face looks fresh from 
           crying. 

           Helen enters, eyes on Lena. Lena turns away from Helen. Helen 
           notices. We stay with Lena as Helen gets in her own cot. 

           INT. BIG HOUSE - LATER

           Lena works in the kitchen with Alice. We hear excited squeals 
           in the distance. 

           INT. BIG HOUSE FOYER 

           Lena and Alice enter the foyer to see the commotion. 

           Elizabeth hurries down the stairs to find ANGELICA (30s, 
           white, blonde) entering the foyer. Ben is behind her carrying 
           her things. 

                                 ANGELICA
                        Hi there little sister!

           The two embrace with warmth and excitement. 
                                 ELIZABETH
                        Come, let’s get you settled in. 
                            (eyes still on Angelica)
                        Helen. 

           Angelica and Elizabeth hold hands and run upstairs while 
           Helen helps Ben with Angelica’s things.  

           INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Henry and Elizabeth and Angelica eat dinner. The house girls 
           lined up against the wall. 

           Angelica and Elizabeth giggling with one another. 

           Helen stands against the wall, she watches Lena fanning the 
           table, numbly. 

           INT. BIG HOUSE BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Lena robotically bathes Angelica in the bathtub. Her hands 
           move up and down her arm. The splash of her cloth dipping 
           into the water. Angelica content being cared for.

                                 ANGELICA
                        My sister tells me you’re new here.

           Lena nods. Keeps washing. 

                                 ANGELICA (CONT’D)
                        This was my father’s plantation you 
                        know. He hoped to have a son to 
                        leave it to. But nope, just us. 
                        Elizabeth’s the oldest, so. 

           Angelica steps out of the wash tub. 

           Lena helps her dry off. She takes a bottle of perfume and 
           sprays Angelica with it. 

                                 ANGELICA (CONT’D)
                        She says you’re her favorite. 

           Angelica offers Lena a smile. Lena only looks at her. 

           INT. ATTIC - NIGHT 

           Lena lies awake in her cot. She grabs a lamp, lights it. 

           She turns to notice once again, Helen’s cot is empty. 
           She goes downstairs.

           INT. BIG HOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Lena walks down the hallway. Strange sounds that make Lena 
           stop. 

           The sound of a bed CREAKING. 

           A man GRUNTING.

           Lena moves to turn around but her footstep makes a loud 
           CREAKING sound. 

           She freezes at the sound of a door opening down the hall. 

           She quickly kills the glow of her oil lamp. 

           It’s Master Henry. He zips his trousers and quietly closes 
           the door behind him. 

           He looks in Lena’s direction. 

           But she’s protected by the dark. 

           Lena watches him walk down the hall into the Master bedroom. 

           Lena waits a few moments then walks to the door from whence 
           he came. Through the sliver of its opening she sees Helen. 

           Their eyes lock. Helen covers herself.

           Lena quietly walks into room. 

           INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Lena stands there looking at Helen. Helen sits there, holding 
           her dress to her chest, shoulders bare, looking at Lena. 

           Lena slowly comes closer to her. She sits down on the bed. 
           They say nothing. 

           Helen looks away. 

           Lena watches Helen, processing what we all know just 
           happened. Putting together what’s been happening. 

           EXT. FIELD - MORNING

           Walks away from the well, bucket full of water. A figure runs 
           towards her.
           Lena turns at the sound. It’s Koi. 

                                 KOI
                        Lena.

           Lena continues walking. 

                                 KOI (CONT’D)
                        We’re leaving. 

           Lena stops. 

                                 KOI (CONT’D)
                        Both of us. 

                                 LENA
                        Why you tellin me for? 

                                 KOI
                        Cause you’re coming with us. 

           Lena pauses. 

                                 LENA
                        No. 

                                 KOI
                        Your mother would want you-

                                 LENA
                        My mother would want me to stay 
                        put. Stay quiet. I didn’t do that. 
                        And now she’s gone. 

                                 KOI
                        If you’re free you can find her. If 
                        you’re here, you know you’ll never 
                        see her again. 

           Lena processes this. 

                                 KOI (CONT’D)
                        Come on, with the three of us, I 
                        know we can make it North. We can 
                        leave tomorrow. 

           Silence.

                                 LENA
                        Tonight. 

           Koi looks at her surprised. 
                                 LENA (CONT’D)
                        It has to be tonight. Massa’s havin 
                        a big dinner party for all the 
                        white folks in town. They’re mind 
                        will be elsewhere. 

           Koi nods. 

                                 KOI
                        Okay. Tonight. I’ll tell the old 
                        lady...Maybe you can come and tell 
                        her?

           Lena looks away.

                                 LENA
                        You tell her. When it’s all dark 
                        I’ll meet you here. 

           INT. BIG HOUSE - DAY

           The Big House is energetic as everyone busily prepares for 
           tonight’s dinner party. 

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Alice is hurrying around the kitchen. Helen assisting her. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - AT THE SAME TIME

           Elizabeth orders Mary and Clara as to how to decorate and set 
           the dining and living room. 

           INT. DINING ROOM - AT THE SAME TIME

           Lena polishing all china, decor, and silverware. 

           Helen enters from the kitchen, walks toward the dining table 
           where Lena sits, polishing. 

           Helen grabs the pile of large serving plates on the table. 
           They make eye contact. Helen’s expression is hard to read. 

           Lena watches Helen turn and walk back into the kitchen. 

           Laughter amongst Angelica, Elizabeth and Henry heard from 
           another room. 
           INT. BIG HOUSE DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Mary scans the dining room table as Lena looks through the 
           window. 

           She watches as Ben helps dinner party guests out of their 
           carriages. 

                                 CLARA (O.S.)
                        Lena!

           Lena turns. 

                                 CLARA (CONT’D)
                        Come on now!

           INT. BIG HOUSE FOYER - NIGHT

           Lena joins the line of house women at the foyer, prepared to 
           welcome tonight’s guests. 

           INT. BIG HOUSE  - NIGHT

           Lena watches three well dressed white women laughing and 
           taking drinks from the serving plates of Lena and Clara, as 
           if they’re invisible. 

           EXT. PORCH - NIGHT

           Two white men smoking cigars and drinking on the porch. One 
           of them has his eye on Mary standing by the door.

           Mary avoids eye contact. 

           INT. BIG HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Lena enters the kitchen, sees Alice wipes her sweaty brow 
           with the back of her hand. Alice checks and re-checks the 
           dishes before her. 

           Helen is washing dishes in a large basin. 

           Lena kneels to the floor to help Helen. She picks up a dish. 

                                 LENA
                            (whispers)
                        I’m leavin. 

           Helen looks up. 
                                 LENA (CONT’D)
                        Tonight. I’m runnin’ North. 

           Helen’s expression processes the gravity of Lena’s words. 

                                 LENA (CONT’D)
                        Please. Come with me. 

           Helen stares at Lena. Thinks to herself.  

                                 LENA (CONT’D)
                        Please...

           Helen looks away. She shakes her head no. 

                                 LENA (CONT’D)
                        Helen...

           Helen’s hands gently take the dish out of Lena’s hands. She 
           continues washing, not looking at Lena. 

           Lena slowly rises, takes a tray of hors d'oeuvres near Alice, 
           and exits.

           INT. BIG HOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Clara fans Elizabeth, Angelica and 3 other white women, Anne, 
           PHOEBE (30), and SARAH (28). Lena stands holding a serving 
           dish of hors d'oeuvres. 

           Lena looks out the window, it’s dark outside.

                                 MARGARET
                        Elizabeth what an impressive home 
                        you have, and the food was just 
                        divine! 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Why thank you...

           Lena and Clara make eye contact. 

                                 SARAH
                        My husband is elated about our new 
                        nigger gal. Already she’s become 
                        the best field hand we got!

           Lena looks down at her serving plate as Margaret takes the 
           last hors d'oeuvre. Lena moves to leave the room. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Where is your plantation?
                                 SARAH
                        Bullock County. 

           Lena turns upon hearing this. 

           Clara looks at Lena.

           Grace?

           Lena stays in the room. 

           EXT. FIELD - NIGHT - AT THE SAME TIME

           Koi sits on the ground leaning against the well. It’s dark. 
           He stands and walks toward the plantation. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - AT THE SAME TIME

           Elizabeth smiles. She glances at Lena. 

                                 SARAH
                        Oh you must come visit!

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’d love to!

           Elizabeth eyes Lena’s interested expression, then her empty 
           tray.

                                 SARAH
                        I admit, for a moment, I thought 
                        you had deceived us!

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Oh?

                                 SARAH
                        Oh yes she was rather difficult 
                        when she first arrived. Refused to 
                        work. Eat. 

           The women listen. So does Lena.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        Even tried to stow-away in the 
                        driver’s carriage. But my husband 
                        figured out how to break her. 

                                 ANGELICA
                        How? 

           Sarah takes a sip of her drink.
                                 SARAH
                            (casually)
                        By removing a few of her fingers, I 
                        think.  

           Clara’s eyes stay on Lena. Lena looks sick. 

           The women’s conversation happens in slow motion before Lena. 

           Lena looks dizzy. 

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        There’s a science to all this. You 
                        have to figure out just the right 
                        thing to-

           Sarah’s glass shatters in her hand. Then Phoebe’s. Then 
           Anne’s. Angelica’s. Elizabeth’s. 

           Angelica’s eye catches the table next to her is beginning to 
           rise.

           The women don’t have a chance to process what’s happened when-

                                 LENA
                        What’s her name?

           EXT. BLACKSMITH’S CABIN - AT THE SAME TIME

           Koi stands near the Blacksmith’s cabin, he sees the Big 
           House’s glow in the night. Everything seems fine. Where is 
           Lena? 

           Men smoking cigar’s on the porch. Koi sees Tom Baylor, his 
           owner, pouring himself a drink. Koi quickly conceals himself. 

           INT. BIG HOUSE LIVING ROOM - AT THE SAME TIME

           Clara looks around her as furniture, portraits, paintings, 
           and items are disheveled and levitating.

           Lena’s eyes move left. The low-table slides left.

           Elizabeth looks disturbed as this phenomenon unfolds. 
           Angelica looks at Lena in horror.

           A piece of glass rises from the floor near Sarah’s neck, her 
           eyes widening with fear.  

           Lena’s voice is low. She glares right into Sarah.
                                 LENA
                        What is her name? 

           Sarah glances at Elizabeth fearfully. 

                                 SARAH
                        Eliza-

                                 LENA
                        What is her name?

           The glass presses harder into Sarah’s neck.

                                 SARAH
                        Uh...G..Grace...

           The piece of glass at Sarah’s neck falls. Lena exhales-

           SLAM!

           Angelica hits Lena over the head with the serving tray. 

           CUT TO BLACK. 

                                                          OVER BLACK:

           The cow bell rings. We know what this means.

                                                              CUT TO:

           EXT. BIG HOUSE PORCH - DUSK

           Field slaves gather by the oak tree. Whispers and mumbles. 
           “What’s goin on?” “Lord have mercy” and “That’s Grace’s baby” 
           can be heard. 

           John the overseer shoves Lena, down the stairs. She is 
           blindfolded and gagged. Elizabeth and Henry follow. 

           The house women come out, followed by their guests, some 
           unaware of what’s happened. 

           Alice’s eyes widen at the sight of John the overseer wrapping 
           rope around Lena’s crossed wrists. 

           They rise above her head as John yanks the rope over the 
           branch.  

           Helen notices a little blood on Sarah’s neck, as Sarah stands 
           tearfully on the porch, being consoled by Phoebe and 
           Margaret. 
           EXT. BLACKSMITH’S CABIN - AT THE SAME TIME

           Koi watches as Lena is dragged out of the house and tied up. 
           Dismay washes over his expression. He backs away, and turns 
           to leave.

           EXT. BIG HOUSE - AT THE SAME TIME

           Alice approaches Elizabeth.

                                 ALICE
                            (carefully)
                        Missus, what’s goin’ on here?

                                 ELIZABETH
                            (with an intense gaze)
                        That girl there is a...a witch. 
                        She’s to be whipped and burned. 

           Helen’s expression panics upon hearing this. She moves toward 
           the oak tree. Clara grabs her arm. 

           Henry lights a torch. 

                                 ALICE
                        Missus she’s just a little girl, 
                        please Missus maybe she can- 

                                 ELIZABETH
                            (coldly)
                        One more word Alice and you can 
                        join her.   

           Elizabeth has never spoken to Alice this way. 

           The field slaves are talking amongst themselves. Faces of 
           surprise. Frustration. Luke moves to the front of the crowd. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                            (speaking to everyone)
                        This girl is a witch. She worked 
                        with the devil and attacked us.

           Helen watches. Something is building inside Helen.  

           Field slaves listen, some observant, some suspicious.

           The overseer rips the back of Lena’s dress. 

           Elizabeth looks on fiercely.

           CRACK. 
           Lena screams through her gag. Alice looks away. What can they 
           do? 

           John circles the whip in the air. 

           CRACK. 

           The field slaves wince as Lena’s little body buckles against 
           the blow. 

           The whites on the porch look on.

           CRACK. 

           John raises his hand once again. 

           A figure moves quickly past Elizabeth, surprise grows on 
           Elizabeth’s face when-

           Helen approaches Lena and embraces her body, and the whip 
           lands on Helen -splitting the back of her dress open. 

           John looks to Henry, then Elizabeth. 

           Elizabeth shoots John a furious look that says, “continue”. 

           The whip splits Helen’s smooth brown back now accessible in 
           the dress. 

           CRACK. 

           Helen winces deeply, still holding onto Lena. 

           Luke’s brow is furrowed at this sight. 

           CRACK. Helen cries out. 

           Luke steps away from the crowd of field slaves and moves 
           toward Helen.

           He embraces Helen, who is still holding onto Lena. 

           John brings the whip down, more furiously than ever, now, 
           onto Luke. 

           CRACK. 

           CRACK!

           The house women look that this unprecedented sight. 

           We find Hattie’s (the woman who’s children were sold) face in 
           the crowd of field slaves, who angrily steps forward. 
           She embraces Lena from another side. Helen and Hattie make 
           eye contact. They brace themselves. Then another field slave 
           embraces the group. 

           Elizabeth can’t believe her eyes. 

           Then another slave, then another, another... 

           James nods, stepping forward.

           More field slaves join this huddle. 

           Henry and Elizabeth and John exchange looks. What do we do?

           The huddle grows as more slaves of the Belmont Plantation 
           surround Lena. 

           A few of them don’t even keep their backs turned. They 
           embrace them from behind, looking Elizabeth, Henry, or John 
           right in their eyes. 

           There are at least 40 slaves surrounding Lena’s hanging body. 
           There are about 10 whites. 

           Lena is still blindfolded. Helen’s face is close to hers. 
           Lena tries to speak. Helen removes her gag. 

                                 LENA
                        What’s goin on?

           Helen speaks for the first time since Elizabeth burned her 
           face. 

                                 HELEN
                        We standin’ up. 

           Lena smirks.

           Helen smiles back.

           It’s a standoff. White guests of the dinner party are 
           clustered on the porch. They are outnumbered. 

           We fall on a few faces of house and field slaves that look 
           uncertain where to place their allegiance. 

           Lena’s face still close to Helen’s.

                                 LENA
                        Can you get me loose? 

           Helen looks up at the knot. 
                                 HELEN
                        I think so. 

           Elizabeth and Henry see the rage swelling in the eyes of the 
           slaves that surround Lena. 

                                 HENRY
                        Now let’s all calm down, and not do 
                        something that you’re gonna regret. 

           Helen has almost got Lena’s knot loose. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        This is your home. Your place is 
                        here. Don’t get yourself killed 
                        over one little witch girl. 

           The standoff remains, Elizabeth has the ear of the whites and 
           blacks. 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        She works with the devil. Now you 
                        don’t want to be protecting the 
                        likes of her. This is your home.

           Luke looks at John the overseer. The whip in his hand. He 
           takes a step toward him. 

           BANG. 

           Luke’s eyes widen, he and the slaves near him look down at a 
           circle of blood growing in his belly. 

           On the porch, the white man who sent Lena into Henry’s study 
           looks indifferently at the smoke coming out of his handgun. 

           Luke drops to the ground. 

           Clara looks to the man who shot Luke. Her face twists as she 
           lunges at him, tackling him to the ground. 

           The whites around them gasp and step back as Clara snatches 
           the gun from the man’s hand and pistol whips him in the face. 

           Clara stands holding the pistol and the white women flee 
           toward their carriages. 

           Four black men walk toward John with the whip in his hand. 
           John backs away slowly. He raises his hand to whip one of 
           them. They dodge the whip’s lash then tackle him to the 
           ground.  

           Elizabeth backs away. 
           Helen finally gets Lena loose. Lena pulls the top of her 
           dress back over her and rubs her wrists. She looks up at the 
           chaos around her.

           EXT. OTHER SIDE OF THE BIG HOUSE - AT THE SAME TIME

           White women and a couple white men are retreating to their 
           carriages. Ben is standing there. 

           Anne, Tom’s wife, extends her arm to be helped into the 
           carriage. But Ben only stands there. 

                                 ANNE
                        Excuse me?!

           But Ben looks at growing glow of fire on the first floor, 
           then looks at Anne. Neither hurting or helping. 

           EXT. BIG HOUSE PORCH - AT THE SAME TIME

           Lena watches a white man with an ax coming toward Clara. She 
           raises her hand and turns it left. The man’s body rises and 
           slams against the house.

           Clara and a few other slaves who saw stare at Lena stares in 
           awe. 

           Lena awaits their reaction. 

           Clara smiles.  

           Alice watches another fire-torch fly into a window. She looks 
           at Mary. 

                                 ALICE
                        The baby!

           Mary nods and ventures into the burning home. 

           INT. BIG HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Yelling can be heard from outside but there’s a faint cry. 

           Mary ascends. Fire hasn’t reached upstairs but it’s smoky. 
           Mary runs to the baby’s room to find him crying and coughing. 
           She grabs a blanket off the chair, covers him, runs out. 
           EXT. BELMONT PLANTATION - CONTINUOUS

           Elizabeth watches this uprising unfold. A WHITE MALE DINNER 
           GUEST (40s) steps next to her and shoots a male field slave 
           in the chest. 

           Two other male slaves tackle him to the ground from behind 
           and start pounding his body with large rocks. 

           The CRACK of his skull.

           Elizabeth backs away. She looks up at Mary holding her baby 
           and pulls a tiny knife from her skirt. She runs to Mary. 

           Mary sees the knife in Elizabeth’s hand. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                            (trembling but firm)
                        You give my baby to me right now. 

                                 MARY
                        Missus it’s okay.  

           Elizabeth watches Mary with the baby. Mary’s loving hold. 
           Elizabeth nods.

           The fire grows inside the Big House. 

           Master Henry pulls a dagger out of the belly of a male field 
           slave who falls to the ground. Another male field slave 
           punches Henry in the face. Henry punches back, then runs the 
           dagger across the slave’s neck. Henry watches his body fall. 

           Henry looks up to see Clara standing in front of him holding 
           a large rock in one hand. 

           Henry backs up to find Helen standing behind him. 

           Two more field women approach and next to them, holding large 
           gardening tools. 

           They each glare deeply at him. Like he had stolen from each 
           of them.

           Sweet Retribution. 

           Helen looks into Henry’s eyes, she holds only her apron in 
           her hand. 

           Helen jump-ropes the apron around his neck and brings him to 
           the ground. The women join in striking his body with their 
           weapon of choice. A little blood splatters their faces. 

           Alice is trying to stay out of the way.  
           A white man in a three piece suit is choking Clara. 

           Alice and Mary see this, and look at each other panicked. 

           Alice scans the ground to find a empty glass bottle of 
           liquor. 

           The man chokes Clara when a glass bottle smashed over his 
           head. He falls to the ground. Clara inhales dramatically 
           looking at Alice, who looks both pleased and mortified at 
           what she’s done. 

           Elizabeth watches Lena as Lena uses her powers to disarm a 
           white man. Elizabeth finds an axe lying on the ground. She 
           picks it up. 

           Elizabeth does her best to hurl the ax towards Lena. The axe 
           stops midair just before it can hit Lena’s back. 

           Elizabeth looks confused. The axe drops to the ground. 

           Lena turns around.

           Mabel stands there with her arm extended. Koi at her side. 

           Lena grins. 

           Alice sees Mabel from afar. Alice smiles.

           Elizabeth stares at Mabel for a moment. She recognizes her. 

           Lena runs to Mabel and hugs her.

                                 LENA
                        I’m sorry. 

           Mabel puts her hand on Lena’s cheek.

           Koi looks takes in the mayhem around them.

                                 KOI
                        You been busy! 

           Lena smiles at Koi.

           Tom, Koi’s Master, pulls a dagger from the belly of a male 
           Slave. He looks up and sees Koi standing with Lena and Mabel.

           Slow motion: Eyes wild, Tom pulls a handgun from his belt. 

           Tom pulls the trigger. 
           Slow motion: Mabel sees Tom coming. She steps forward and 
           uses her power to thrust the gun out of his hand before he 
           pulls the trigger again. 

           But Mabel’s not quick enough. 

           The bullet penetrates Mabel’s chest. 

           Alice turns to the sound of the gunshot. 

           Lena’s eyes widen in horror as she falls down to the ground. 

           Koi kneels down to Mabel. 

           Lena turns to the direction of the bullet, wide-eyed. 

           She fiercely raises her hand as she storms toward Tom, 
           lifting his body in the air.  

           Tom looks terrified as Lena looks into his face as he hovers 
           above her. 

           With one motion to the left Lena throws his body into the 
           air, it smashes what’s left of a window into the burning 
           house. 

           Lena looks weaker. She turns to Koi who holds Mabel’s head in 
           his lap. She looks down at the pool of blood growing 
           underneath Mabel.

                                 MABEL
                            (playfully to Koi)
                        I knew you’d be trouble

           Koi smiles weakly. Lena kneels to Mabel’s other side. 

           Tears fall down Lena’s cheeks. 

           Mabel places a hand on Lena’s face. First and last affection. 
           She looks into Lena’s face.  

                                 LENA
                        I’ll...I’ll get Ms. Alice-

           Mabel struggles to get her words out. 

                                 MABEL
                        No no...You get these people out of 
                        here. 

           Lena looks into her grandmother’s face. 

                                 MABEL (CONT’D)
                        Be better...than me...Don’t hide-
           Something catches Koi’s attention. He points.

                                 KOI
                        Lena!

           Lena turns to see Elizabeth coming at her like a madwoman. 
           She holds a knife in one hand, a burning torch in the other. 

           Lena stands. 

           Elizabeth swings the torch at Lena. Lena dodges it. Lena uses 
           her powers to thrust the torch out of her hand into hers. 

           Lena brings her free hand to the fire and makes it grow 
           toward Elizabeth. Forcing Elizabeth back. 

           This only makes Elizabeth more aggressive. She comes at Lena 
           with the dagger. Lena tilts her head left. 

           Elizabeth’s arm extends, trying to hold onto the dagger. The 
           dagger eventually flies out of her hand.

           Lena raises her hand. Both of Elizabeth’s arms fly above her 
           own head, crossing. Elizabeth’s body rises into the air. 

           Lena looks into the desperation in Elizabeth’s face. She 
           knows this face. She’s come to understand this face. 

           Alice watches. Koi watches. Other rebelling slaves watch. 

           Elizabeth looks into Lena’s face. 

           Lena’s brow is furrowed. She breathes heavily.

           Lena can’t do it. 

           Elizabeth looks prepared to be killed. 

           Lena pushes her own hand forward. 

           Elizabeth’s body lurches several feet away, she lands hard on 
           the ground. 

           Lena exhales. She’s weak. She turns back toward Koi and 
           Mabel. 

           Mabel lies in Koi’s arms. Eyes open and unblinking.  

           Lena looks away. 

           Her eyes find what remain of the rebellion. She walks toward 
           it. Some bodies lie dead on the ground. Some black, some 
           white. 
           She sees Master Henry’s dead body, blood having spilled from 
           his mouth. 

           She sees Luke. 

           The eyes of the remaining slaves who fought, follow Lena’s 
           every step. Helen among them. Hattie among them. 

           Koi gives Mabel’s lifeless hand a squeeze and lays her head 
           gently to the ground. He stands and walks toward Lena.

           Lena looks up at the fiery Big House. 

           Alice stands next to Mary who still holds the baby. 

           Koi reaches Lena. 

                                 KOI (CONT’D)
                        We have to go. We dead come 
                        sunrise.

           Lena looks at Koi, then looks around at the slaves that 
           remain. They’re as good as dead too. 

           She looks at Mabel’s dead body some feet away. Lena looks 
           away. 

           She looks around at her people who lived through this night. 
           These adults, men and women, all eyes on this little girl. 

                                 LENA
                         We can’t stay here.

           Lena looks at Helen. 

                                 LENA (CONT’D)
                        What I know is that together, we 
                        can fight. 

                                 HATTIE
                        Where would we go?

           Lena pauses. 

                                 KOI
                        North. I know the way. 

           The Slaves whisper amongst themselves suspiciously. 

                                 KOI (CONT’D)
                        With Lena and with each other, we 
                        got a chance. More of a chance than 
                        if we stay. 
           No one moves. 

                                 KOI (CONT’D)
                        Whatever we gotta do we gotta do it 
                        n-

           Helen steps forward and grabs Lena’s hand. Lena looks at her 
           and smiles. Hattie stands by Helen. They start to walk 
           forward. The remaining slaves slowly follow behind them. 

           Mary hands the baby to Alice. Alice knows what this means. 
           Mary kisses Alice’s cheek. Alice watches Mary catch up and 
           join the group.

           Elizabeth slowly stands.

           Lena looks back at Elizabeth. 

           Elizabeth stares at Lena. 

           Lena stares at Elizabeth. Elizabeth only stands there. Chest 
           rising and falling. Disheveled hair. Looking at Lena. 

           Lena turns away. Surrounded by fellow slaves.

           Elizabeth is left standing alone. Her and her burning home. 

           Mary catches up with Helen. Mary looks at Koi. 

                                 MARY
                            (to Helen)
                        Who is that?

           Helen shrugs. 

           Moonlight blues the determined faces of Lena, Koi, and Helen. 
           The Big House burns behind them in the distance. With a drove 
           of slaves from the Belmont plantation behind them, they 
           fiercely gaze forward, ready to move into the night.

           CUT TO BLACK. 

           END.
