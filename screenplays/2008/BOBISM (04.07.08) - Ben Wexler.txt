           Over BLACK, we hear the sound of fingers clattering away on keys 
           accompanied by a lone voice.  He is BOB.

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        I guess if there’s one reason I’m 
                        starting this thing, it’s ‘cause 
                        I’m scared.  Scared that I’m gonna 
                        die someday without ever having 
                        made any sort of mark on the world.  
                        You ever think about that?  Like, 
                        what happens when you’re dead, and 
                        everyone you know is dead, and your 
                        permanent record’s, like, erased, 
                        to make room on the hard drive?  Is 
                        it like you never lived at all...?

           INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

           A class full of UNDERGRADS, so diverse it could be a Benneton Ad.  
           Everyone’s in ass-crack jeans, except for one kid in slacks and a 
           tie, typing on a LAPTOP: our hero, BOB TRAUTWIG, 20.  

           Bob is awkward, thin, pale - perhaps he’ll be comfortable in his 
           own skin one day, but he has to grow into it first.

                                 POLI SCI PROFESSOR (O.S.)
                        Okay, folks, midterm’s Friday.  
                        Bring your “A” game.

           Students STAND to leave.  Through the crowd, Bob spots the pretty 
           HEATHER BAILEY heading his way.  He quickly smooths his hair, then 
           cups his hand for a quick “breath check.”

                                 HEATHER
                        Bob?

                                 BOB
                        Heather!  Hi!!

           That was too loud and excited.  Bob does his best to calm down.

                                 HEATHER
                        Oh my God did you take notes?  
                        ‘Cause I totally--

                                 BOB
                        Spaced out for like the last half 
                        hour of the lecture?  Yeah, I 
                        already e-mailed ‘em to you.

                                 HEATHER
                        Bob - you are like my savior!
           She HUGS him.  Bob tries to hide the fact that this is the high 
           point of his life.  A student with a jew-fro, NOAH FEENBERG,  
           walks by an WHISPERS to Bob as he passes. 

                                 NOAH
                        Think about baseball.

                                 BOB
                        Shut up.

           Noah makes a “slide whistle” sound as if Bob is popping a boner.

           EXT. UCLA CAMPUS - DAY

           On a clear spring day, this is one of the most pleasant places on 
           earth.  Pretty students walk in pairs, yet talk on cell phones.  
           Bob walks with Heather.

                                 HEATHER
                        You totally saved my ass in Macro-
                        Econ, too.  If you hadn’t helped me 
                        with that paper, I’da failed.

                                 BOB
                        Hey, what’s one more all-nighter?  
                        Y’know, in the scheme of things?

                                 HEATHER
                        You’re awesome, Bob.

           She smiles and SLIPS HER ARM THROUGH HIS.  A shudder of excitement 
           ripples through him.  They walk like that a while, Bob slowly 
           working up the courage to say:

                                 BOB
                        Hey, Heather?  I was thinking, we 
                        just, we have such a good time 
                        together, studying n’ stuff, I mean 
                        it’s like we have that back-and-
                        forth thing, y’know, where we’re 
                        always finishing each other’s--
                             (she stares blankly)
                        --sentences... and I thought, I 
                        dunno, maybe if you’re free 
                        sometime we could possibly hang 
                        out.  Go out.  Hang out or go out.  
                        Either’s fine with me.

                                 HEATHER
                        Oh God, Bob, I - you’re a great 
                        guy, it’s just... I have a 
                        boyfriend.
           Bob looks like he’s been stabbed in the gut.  Playing it off:

                                 BOB
                        Oh yeah, no, sure.  I mean, me too.
                             (then)
                        Not “me too I have a boyfriend,” I 
                        mean “me too” the other thing.

                                 HEATHER
                        You... think you’re a great guy?

                                 BOB
                             (beat)
                        Yes.

           EXT. CAMPUS (BEHIND POWELL LIBRARY) - DAY

           Bob, now walking alone, has TEARS IN HIS EYES.

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        I guess there’s another reason why 
                        I’m starting this blog: To rail 
                        against the injustice of the world.  
                        A world that places value on the 
                        most superficial virtues, while 
                        ignoring such qualities as 
                        intelligence, hard work...

           EXT. HEATHER’S APARTMENT BUILDING - OUT OF TIME (M.O.S.)

           Over Bob’s continued rant, we SEE Heather KISS her jock BOYFRIEND.

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        And lets obscene over-consumption 
                        continue unabated, even as earth’s 
                        precious resources dwindle.

           Heather and the Boyfriend climb into his OBSCENELY HUGE SUV.  The 
           ANGLE WIDENS to reveal BOB, watching from ACROSS THE STREET.

           EXT. CAMPUS (BEHIND POWELL LIBRARY) - DAY

           Bob blinks back his tears as he approaches one of those old-school 
           SOFT DRINK VENDING MACHINES that drop a plastic cup, then shoot 
           ice and soda into the cup.

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        Do I expect to change the world?  
                        Of course not...
           Bob feeds a dollar bill into the slot, then selects ORANGE SODA.  
           A beat, then the ice drops, followed by the soda... but NO CUP!!

           This is the last straw.

                                 BOB
                        NO!!!

           That was really loud.  Many STUDENTS STARE as we SMASH TO:

           INT. WHITE BACKGROUND WORLD - OUT OF TIME

           Bob, wearing ALL WHITE, sits in a WHITE BACKGROUND WORLD and 
           speaks directly to the CAMERA.

                                 BOB
                        But if I don’t try, who else will?  
                        If I don’t at least try and make my 
                        voice heard, then what will my life 
                        have amounted to?  Y’know, when 
                        it’s all said and done?

           As Bob speaks, we PAN UP until he disappears from frame, filling 
           the screen with WHITE... then FURTHER UP until THE WORDS that Bob 
           just spoke APPEAR: “...when it’s all said and done?”

           Next to these words is a BLINKING CURSOR.  And we PULL BACK to 
           REVEAL we’re...

           INT. BOB’S COLLEGE BEDROOM - NIGHT

           ...watching a COMPUTER SCREEN - Bob’s LAPTOP - as Bob sits at his 
           desk, typing into his BLOG.

           It’s a TYPICAL COLLEGE BEDROOM - two futons, two desks, messy.  
           Over Bob’s desk is a JOHN WAYNE POSTER.  As Bob sits back to 
           assess what he’s just written, we SMASH TO BLACK.

           And a TITLE CARD appears:  “Genesis.”

           And over this, we HEAR, pre-lap, a LOUD COMMOTION.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           A giant bong rests atop an old SEGA GENESIS someone bought off 
           EBay in 1997.

           Bob’s roommates, the Hindu ANDY RANTAMPRIKASH and the lily-white 
           CHRIS GLUCK, play VIDEO GOLF as jew-fro NOAH watches from the 
           couch, another MASSIVE BONG between his pants-free legs.
                                 ANDY RANTAMPRIKASH
                        Ohhh!  Pebble Beach is my house, 
                        bitch!

                                 CHRIS
                        How does he chip that in from the 
                        rough?  HOW?!

           Bob pokes his head in from the adjacent BEDROOM.

                                 BOB
                        Guys?  Could you keep it down?  I’m 
                        trying to work in here.

                                 NOAH
                        What are you workin’, the gherkin?  
                        Put on some headphones.

                                 ANDY RANTAMPRIKASH
                             (laughing)
                        Heh.  After gherkin he said “Head.”

                                 NOAH
                        And don’t skimp on the lotion, pal.  
                        Dick-chafe is the number one killer 
                        of young men ages 18-20.

                                 ANDY RANTAMPRIKASH
                        Dude, why not take a break for once 
                        and smoke some sticky?  You study 
                        like nonstop.  It’s hard to watch.

                                 BOB
                        Actually, I’m not studying right 
                        now.  I’m starting a blog.

                                 NOAH
                        Oh, good, the inane ramblings of a 
                        college student.  Now the 
                        internet’s complete.

                                 BOB
                        Noah, do you even live here?  I 
                        don’t recall you paying us rent.

                                 NOAH
                        Baby, it don’t got to be about all 
                        that.  My lease ran out.  I’m 
                        looking.

                                 BOB
                        You’re homeless.  Chris, I found 
                        some gay porno on your bed.
           The room goes silent as Bob holds up a hard-core gay porno mag - 
           “CRACK N’ JACK” - and all eyes turn to Chris.  Beat, then:

                                 CHRIS
                        I was holding it for a friend.

           Andy and Noah SHRUG - that’s good enough for them.

           INT. BOB’S COLLEGE BEDROOM - NIGHT (QUICK DISSOLVES)

           Bob TYPES, furious and fast... thousands of WORDS fly by on the 
           screen... Chris, in his bed, SLEEPS.  Bob, at his desk, TYPES...  
           John Wayne, on the poster, LOOKS TOUGH.

           Finally Bob sits back, satisfied.  HESITATES, about to click the 
           LINK marked: “POST ENTRY NOW.”  After a long beat, he CLICKS it.  
           He looks at the clock.  It’s 4:15 a.m.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. BOB’S COLLEGE BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           A loud, insistent KNOCKING at the door PIERCES the silence.  Bob, 
           in a DEEP SLEEP, wakes suddenly and looks at the clock - it’s 7:15 
           a.m.  He looks at CHRIS, sound asleep in silk pajamas.

           INT. CRAPPY LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Bob groggily crosses to the front door.  Noah is passed out on the 
           couch in his underwear, clutching a five-iron.  He doesn’t stir.

           Bob opens the door to reveal two FEDERAL AGENT TYPES, both wearing 
           dark suits and sunglasses like villains from “The Matrix.”  These 
           are JOHN GAI (40s, Asian) and CORNELIUS ORANGE (30s, black).

                                 BOB
                        Can... can I help you?

                                 GAI
                        Yes, we’re looking for Bob Trautwig. 

                                 BOB
                        I’m Bob Trautwig.

           The Feds exchange a look, like they were expecting him to look 
           different, then FLASH BADGES so quick they’re impossible to read.

                                 ORANGE
                        I’m Federal Agent Cornelius Orange, 
                        this is Federal Agent John Gai.
           Bob looks nervously at the BONG next to Noah.

                                 GAI
                        Did you start a blog last night 
                        called “Bob-isms”?

                                 BOB
                        Oh, yeah, um, ever since I was a 
                        kid I’ve always said the darnedest 
                        things - well, not the darnedest, 
                        but pretty darned darned - and it 
                        got to a point where my parents 
                        started calling them “Bob-isms,” 
                        like “here comes another Bob-ism, 
                        or--

                                 GAI
                        Mr. Trautwig, could you come with 
                        us, please?

                                 ORANGE
                        And bring your laptop.

                                 BOB
                        What... what’d I do?

           INT. FEDS’ CAR - MOVING - MOMENTS LATER

           Bob sits in the back seat of the Feds’ car (his LAPTOP CASE on  
           the seat beside him) as it drives past the FEDERAL BUILDING in 
           Westwood and heads toward the 405.  A long beat of SILENCE.

                                 BOB
                        Seriously, what’d I do?

           INT. FEDS’ CAR - MOVING - SEVERAL HOURS LATER

           We’re now WAY OUT IN THE DESERT, very close to if not in the 
           MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.  Bob looks at the passing cacti.  A beat.

                                 BOB
                        You guys aren’t gonna tell me what 
                        I did, are you?

           Agent Gai, behind the wheel, suddenly PULLS OFF THE ROAD, driving 
           now through BARE DESERT.  Orange turns around to face Bob.

                                 ORANGE
                        You haven’t done anything, Mr. 
                        Trautwig.  We just need to ask you 
                        a few questions.
           The car pulls to a sudden stop.  The Feds GET OUT, open the back 
           door, and BOB DOES THE SAME.  They’re standing in THE MIDDLE OF 
           THE DESERT.  Nothing but sand and scrub as far as the eye can see.  

           Only one physical feature stands out from the otherwise-monotonous 
           landscape, but it’s striking: a SANDSTONE ROCK FORMATION that 
           forms a high, arching “BRIDGE” over the desert floor below.

           It’s known to locals - and will soon be known to us - simply as 
           “LANDBRIDGE.”

                                 GAI
                        Mr. Trautwig, have you ever seen 
                        this woman?

           He produces a SNAPSHOT of the most stunningly BEAUTIFUL WOMAN Bob 
           has ever seen.  Black hair, olive skin... gorgeous.

                                 BOB
                        No.  No.  And I’d remember.  Wow.

           Orange turns to Gai and SMILES.

                                 ORANGE
                        Pre-contact.  This is good.

           The agents SMILE for a beat.  Just then, Gai PULLS HIS GUN and 
           nervously scans the horizon!  Bob flinches.

                                 GAI
                        Did you hear something?

           Orange shakes his head, “No.”  A look around reveals... NOTHING.  
           Just a vast EMPTINESS, surrounding this very TENSE moment.

                                 BOB
                        I’d really like to know what I--

           BAM!  A BULLET WHIZZES BY BOB’S HEAD!

           And sends GAI’S GUN FLYING OUT OF HIS HAND.  Where did that shot 
            come from?  Bob SCREAMS like a girl.

                                 ORANGE
                        Down!  Down!  We’ve been 
                        compromised!

           BAM!  Another shot - the WINDSHIELD SHATTERS.  Then, suddenly:

           THE BEAUTIFUL WOMAN FROM THE SNAPSHOT

           APPEARS out of nowhere!  Riding a black Kawasaki Ninja, wearing a 
           silver lycra bodysuit, and FIRING a semi-automatic .45!
           The Feds DIVE for cover.  Bob DUCKS behind the car.  Sees GAI’S 
           GUN sitting in the sand, 10 or 15 feet away.

           THE WOMAN

           Banks her motorcycle hard, sending it into an intentional SKID-OUT 
           aimed STRAIGHT FOR ORANGE.  Orange has to JUMP STRAIGHT UP to 
           avoid being hit.

           Amazingly, as the Woman skids out under Orange, she’s able to GRAB 
           his leg and TWIST it sideways, causing him to come down awkwardly 
           and BANG HIS HEAD hard against a ROCK as he lands - out cold.

           She looks - her gun has skidded underneath the car - unreachable.

           She springs to her feet and greets Gai with a flurry of roundhouse 
           kicks.  PAP!  PAP!  PAP!  As she’s kicking Gai, she turns to BOB:

                                 BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                        Run, Bob Trautwig!  Run!!

           Bob reacts, wide-eyed.  How’d she know his name?

                                 BOB
                        How’d you know my name?

           No time to answer - Gai has pulled the GUN off Orange’s limp body.  
           The Woman grabs his wrist and a STRUGGLE for the gun ensues.  Gai 
           slowly starts to get the upper hand...

           Just before Gai gets the barrel pointed at her face, she uses her 
           entire body to JERK BACKWARDS, FLIPPING Gai right over her head!

           He lands on the roof of the car and SPRINGS to his feet, FIRING.  
           But the Woman is so agile, it seems she’s able to get out of the 
           way of the bullets a split-second before Gai fires.

           Now it’s her turn to dive behind a BOULDER.  As she does, Gai 
           EMPTIES HIS CLIP into the rock.  Gai squeezes the trigger - CLICK.  
           Out of ammo.  He turns his head toward BOB...

           ...who’s now HOLDING THE OTHER GUN.

                                 GAI
                        Give me the gun, Mr. Trautwig.

           He walks toward Bob.  Bob doesn’t quite know what to do.  He 
           doesn’t even know what’s going on...

           Behind Gai, the Woman takes a ROCK and, like Roger Clemens in his 
           roid-rage years, FIRES a fastball which CLOCKS Gai on the back of 
           the skull.  He crumples to the ground.
           She runs to Gai, takes his gun, tucks it into the back of her 
           belt, then LOOKS UP AT BOB.  Seeing him, she SOFTENS, speaking 
           with an ACCENT that’s hard to place:

                                 BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                        It’s really you.  I thought you’d 
                        be taller.

           We notice now that Bob’s holding the gun completely WRONG - with 
           his hands clasped around the barrel, which is pointed at the 
           ground, the BUTT of the gun pointed out.

                                 BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                        Nothing comes out of that end.

           Bob reacts, embarrassed.  From a sheath-holster on her leg, she 
           pulls an ENORMOUS DAGGER.

                                 BOB
                        What are you doing?

           She lowers the dagger until the point is TOUCHING GAI’S FOREHEAD!    
           Before she can plunge the knife directly into the Fed’s brain:

                                 BOB
                        Stop!  No!  You can’t kill him!

                                 BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                        Bob, these men mean you grave harm.

                                 BOB
                        No!  They’re Federal Agents.

                                 BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                        They’re not Federal Agents.

                                 BOB
                        Sure they are.  They showed me 
                        their badges.  They flashed them 
                        super-quick... but they were 
                        badges, you could tell.

                                 BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                        If we don’t kill these men right 
                        now, Bob, I promise you we’ll live 
                        to regret it.

                                 BOB
                        We?  Who are you?  And how do you 
                        know my name?
                                 BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                        There’ll be plenty of time for 
                        informational transfer later.  For 
                        now, just call me Lina.

                                 BOB
                        Okay.  Lina.  Please - I beg you, I 
                        implore you... don’t kill them.

                                 LINA
                             (long beat, then)
                        Then at least help me secure them.

           Lina ransacks the Feds’ car  - inside are many sets of HANDCUFFS.  
           Dozens.  WAY more handcuffs than two Feds would ever need.

                                 LINA
                        Place the smaller one on top of the 
                        larger one.

           Bob struggles to DRAG Gai over to Orange, dumping him FACE-DOWN 
           onto the larger man.  Lina cuffs Orange’s ankles to Gai’s wrists, 
           and vice-versa, sticking them in what amounts to a “69” position.

                                 LINA
                        Come.  Time is of the essence.

                                 BOB
                        We can’t just leave them here.  
                        They’ll starve.

           Lina looks at Bob, grabs a huge box of DONUTS off the passenger 
           seat, and THROWS it out onto the sand.

                                 LINA
                        There.  This should hold them.

           INT. FEDS’ CAR - MOVING - MOMENTS LATER

           Lina drives, fast, as Bob sits in the passenger seat in disbelief.

                                 BOB
                        I’d like that informational 
                        transfer now.

                                 LINA
                        Pardon me?

                                 BOB
                             (beat, then exploding)
                        WHO THE F ARE YOU?  And what the F 
                        just happened?  Seriously!  F!
                                 LINA
                        What I’m about to tell you will be 
                        difficult to comprehend--

                                 BOB
                        Just tell me!  Who are you?

                                 LINA
                        My full name is Angelina Grapefruit 
                        Boom Boom Thelonius Shakalaka.  I 
                        was sent here from the future to 
                        protect you from those... “men.”

           There’s a long beat.  Bob takes a deep breath, almost at peace 
           with what he must do next... then JUMPS OUT OF THE MOVING CAR!!

                                 LINA
                        Oh, Bob Trautwig!

           EXT. DESERT - SIDE OF THE ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           Bob rolls a lot in the desert sand on the side of the road.  It 
           appears to be QUITE PAINFUL.

                                 BOB
                        Ow... ow... ow...

           He continues to ROLL for a comically-long while.  He’s about to 
           slow to a STOP... then hits a small DOWNSLOPE and ROLLS some more.

           Lina pulls the car over and BRAKES to a SCREECHING HALT.  When  
           Bob finally comes to a stop, he BLINKS a few times at the 
           scorching SUN above.

                                 BOB
                        That hurt quite badly.

           And then LINA is standing over him.  She looks down at him with a 
           sympathy so deep, it borders on LOVE.

                                 LINA
                        I’m afraid I must do this for your 
                        own safety.

           She pulls out a perfectly round SHINY METAL OBJECT, like a tennis 
           ball made of stainless steel.  She pushes a few buttons on it.  
           Suddenly a BRIGHT LIGHT fills the screen, and we CUT TO BLACK.
           INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

           Bob BLINKS AWAKE.  He’s lying on a floral-pattern bedspread in a 
           CHEAP HOTEL ROOM.  As things come into focus, we see LINA is 
           sitting on top of him, STRADDLING him.

                                 LINA
                        Relax.  Try not to move too much.

           Now Bob is awake enough to be frightened.

                                 BOB
                        What is this?  Where are we?

                                 LINA
                        We’re safe for the time being.  
                        We’re in a Best Western temporary 
                        dwelling site, not far from your 
                        university.  I picked it because I 
                        know you like Westerns and this one 
                        purports to be the best.

                                 BOB
                        How do you know I like Westerns?

                                 LINA
                        I know everything about you.  
                        Everything you’ve committed to 
                        text, anyway.

                                 BOB
                        What are you talking about?  My 
                        blog?  I just started that last--

           Bob looks at her - she’s smiling at him so wide, it’s unsettling.

                                 BOB
                        Oh my God, you’re some sort of 
                        stalker, aren’t you?  You... you’re 
                        gonna rape me.

                                 LINA
                        Bob.  This will all be very 
                        difficult for you to assimilate 
                        into your current knowledge set, 
                        but it’s imperative that you come 
                        to trust me.  What you composed 
                        last night is merely the opening 
                        chapter of what will become the 
                        most important set of moral, 
                        ethical and existential guidelines 
                        the world has ever known.
                                 BOB
                             (extremely dubious)
                        Wait a minute.  You’re trying to 
                        tell me I wind up writing a 
                        religion?  Like L. Ron Hubbard?

                                 LINA
                        No.  Religions are still practiced 
                        in discrete sects, much like the 
                        present day.  Bobism is a unifying 
                        philosophy, the unifying philosophy, 
                        which binds the entire human race.

                                 BOB
                        Bobism?  The blog’s called Bob-isms.

                                 LINA
                        It’s not clear exactly when the “S” 
                        at the end was dropped.  A massive 
                        electrical storm in 2379 wiped out 
                        over half of what was then known as 
                        “The Internet.”  All that survived 
                        was a several-billion word-long 
                        Text File.  For centuries Bobism, 
                        all 1500 pages of it, was copied by 
                        hand.

           Bob just lies there, not knowing what to make of this nutjob.  
           There’s a beat, then:

                                 LINA
                        How would a woman rape a man?

                                 BOB
                             (fidgets, defensive)
                        It can happen...

           It’s now clear from the look on both of their faces that Bob, 
           still underneath Lina, has a serious BONER.  She climbs off of  
           him and he quickly grabs a PILLOW to cover his groin.

                                 BOB
                        You were like right on top of me!

           EXT. DESERT - AFTERNOON

           The two FEDS, still handcuffed together 69-style with Gai on top 
           of Orange, struggle to get over to the BOX OF DONUTS.

                                 GAI
                        Now a little to your left...
           Orange SHUFFLES slightly and Gai gets a hand on the box.  From 
           between Orange’s legs, he peers in.

                                 GAI
                        Okay, it’s lookin’ like we got 
                        crullers, half a bear claw...

           In the distance, a brightly-colored VW BUS approaches.

           INT. VW BUS - MOVING - SAME TIME

           Inside are four flamboyantly-dressed GAY GUYS and a great deal of 
           CAMPING GEAR.  The DRIVER spots something off in the distance.

           FROM HIS POV

           We see what he sees: two DARK-SUITED MEN handcuffed together,
           69-style, writhing in the sand.

                                 GAY CAMPER
                        Well well well!  What have we here?

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME

           Bob is now sitting up on the bed, the pillow still covering his 
           groin.  Lina sits a respectful distance away.

                                 LINA
                        I’m sorry.  Bobism removes the 
                        taboo associated with casual-yet-
                        intimate contact.

                                 BOB
                        That actually does sound like me...

                                 LINA
                        So you believe me then?  You 
                        believe that what I’m telling you 
                        is true?

           Bob looks deep into her intense, DARK BROWN EYES.  Finally:

                                 BOB
                        I do.  I believe.

                                 LINA
                        Then the rest will be easy.

           Lina SMILES a dazzling, gorgeous smile... then stands and crosses 
           to the BATHROOM.
                                 LINA
                        Remind me - is it still common 
                        practice to close the door while 
                        defecating?

                                 BOB
                        Yes.  Very much so.

           Lina nods and CLOSES THE DOOR.  Once it’s closed, Bob hurriedly 
           PICKS UP THE PHONE.  And DIALS: 9... 1... 1.

           EXT. DESERT - SAME TIME

           The Gay campers have pulled over to where the Feds are lying, 
           happily SPILLING OUT of the VW Bus to offer their help.

                                 GAY CAMPER
                        Are you guys going to Bending Man?

                                 ORANGE
                        Yeah... sure.  Do you think you can 
                        help us with these handcuffs?

                                 GAY CAMPER #2
                        Um, hello? I think we know how to 
                        deal with handcuffs!

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME

           Bob is waiting impatiently for 911 to answer.

                                 BOB
                        C’mon... c’mon...

                                 VOICE (ON PHONE)
                        Hotel security.

                                 BOB
                             (whispering urgently)
                        Hotel security?  I need the cops!

                                 VOICE (ON PHONE)
                        That’s an outside line.  You have 
                        to dial nine.

                                 BOB
                        I did dial nine.  9-1-1.  You’re 
                        telling me I need to dial 9-9-1-1?
                                 VOICE (ON PHONE)
                        That’s correct, sir.  Is there 
                        anything I can help you with?

                                 BOB
                        Yeah!  I’m being held against my 
                        will by a loony nutjob!

                                 VOICE (ON PHONE)
                             (long beat)
                        For that I’ll have to transfer you 
                        to local law enforcement--

                                 LINA (O.S.)
                        Bob?

                                 BOB
                        Just ordering room service!

                                 LINA (O.S.)
                        That’s fine - do you mind if I take 
                        a shower?  I still have chryo-plasm 
                        on my skin from the time portal.

                                 BOB
                        Oh, yeah, definitely.  Yes.  A 
                        shower, that’s a must.

           From inside the bathroom we HEAR the sound of the SHOWER starting.  
           Bob quickly HANGS UP the phone.  He spots his LAPTOP CASE, on the 
           floor, propped against a wall.  He grabs it, then SKEDADDLES.

           EXT. DESERT - LATE AFTERNOON

           The Gay Campers have cut through last of the Feds’ handcuffs.

                                 GAY CAMPER
                        There we go!  You’re free!

           Orange and Gai, free of their bonds, stiffly STAND.

                                 GAY CAMPER #2
                        Okay, who’s up for psychedelic 
                        drugs and lots and lots of 
                        tushy-related loveplay?!

           The Feds do that scary, villain NECK-CRACK move, then start SLOWLY 
           WALKING toward the gay campers.

                                 GAY CAMPER
                        What are you doing?
           INT. BOB’S COLLEGE APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING

           Slow and cautious, Bob OPENS THE DOOR to his apartment - it’s a 
           MESS, but it’s EMPTY.  And rather EERIE.

                                 BOB
                        Hello?

           No answer.  Bob tiptoes around, half-expecting someone to jump out 
           at him any second.  He sees a NOTE on the table marked “BOB.”  He 
           opens it:

           “Dude, what happened to you??? You disappeared! Meet us at the 
            Dodger Game tonight - we got sweet seats!”

           Folded-up in the note is a DODGER TICKET.  Bob thinks for a beat.

           INT. DODGER STADIUM - EVENING

           The Dodgers play the Giants.  DODGER FANS SCREAM “Giants Suck!”  
           And Bob sits in the sweet seats with Chris, Noah and Andy.  
           Bob is the only one not SWILLING BEER.

                                 ANDY RANTAMPRIKASH
                        So, the Asian guy was Agent Gai.  
                        And the other guy was...

                                 BOB
                        Agent Orange.

                                 ANDY RANTAMPRIKASH
                        Uh-huh.  And Orange was... black.

                                 BOB
                        Yes.

                                 CHRIS
                        And that’s all you know?  You don’t 
                        even know what Federal Agency they 
                        were supposedly from?

                                 BOB
                        That was the first question the 
                        cops asked when I called 911.  
                        So... I hung up.

                                 NOAH
                        Can we entertain one possibility 
                        for just one moment?  That maybe, 
                        perhaps the smokin’ hot chick with 
                        the enormo-rack and heart-shaped 
                        ass really is from the future?
                                 CHRIS
                        Okay, fine, but if she’s from the 
                        future then who are the two Feds?

                                 ANDY RANTAMPRIKASH
                        Duh.  They’re obviously evil 
                        cyborgs, also from the future, sent 
                        here to prevent Bob’s religion from 
                        ever being written.  My guess: 
                        we’re probably looking at a liquid 
                        metal endoskeleton surrounded by 
                        organic flesh, y’know, to 
                        facilitate time-travel.

                                 NOAH
                        Dude, that’s just “The Terminator.”

                                 BOB
                        And it’s not a religion.  Stop 
                        saying it’s a religion.

                                 CHRIS
                        You know what I never got about The 
                        Terminator?  How did Cyber Dynamics 
                        develop the technology to build the 
                        super-advanced carbon-metal alloy 
                        in the first place?

                                 ANDY RANTAMPRIKASH
                        By using a a sample the section of 
                        the Terminator’s arm, originally 
                        destroyed in the hydraulic press, 
                        ya moron.

                                 CHRIS
                        Exactly.  But how did that sample 
                        even get there in the first place, 
                        cock?  Because Terminator travelled 
                         back in time.

                                 ANDY RANTAMPRIKASH
                        So?

                                 CHRIS
                        So - nobody ever invented the 
                        technology in the first place!  It 
                        was invented in the present because 
                        it had been invented in the future.  
                        It’s a big, circular, logic-toilet.

                                 ANDY RANTAMPRIKASH
                        No it isn’t.
                                 NOAH
                        No, I see his point.  It kinda is.

                                 ANDY RANTAMPRIKASH
                             (getting angry)
                        What?!  You’re not even qualified 
                        to participate in this 
                        conversation, Bong-y!

           As the guys’ argument grows more and more heated, Bob grabs his 
           laptop case, RISES, and heads for the aisle, unnoticed.

           INT. DODGER STADIUM MEN’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Drunken DODGER FANS and a few GIANTS FANS piss into a TROUGH and 
           heap verbal abuse upon each other.

           Bob, sitting in a TOILET STALL, pulls out his iPHONE to check his 
           BLOG.  Clicks the link marked “FEEDBACK.”  The PAGE REFRESHES to 
           read: “NO COMMENTS POSTED FOR THIS BLOG.”  Bob reacts.  Then:

           We SMASH TO BLACK and a TITLE CARD appears:  “Deuteronomy.” 

           INT. WHITE BACKGROUND WORLD - OUT OF TIME

           As before, Bob speaks directly to the camera.

                                 BOB
                        Can I just say one thing?  Guns 
                        freak me out.  In fact, weapons of 
                        any kind freak me freakin’ out.  
                        You know how they say “guns don’t 
                        kill people, people kill people”?  
                        Well, you know what kinda people 
                        kill more people than most people?  
                        People with guns.  People who shoot 
                        people.  They’re the scariest 
                        people in the world.

           INT. VW BUS - SAME TIME

           The Feds, now alone, DRIVE the Gay Campers’ VW Bus in silence.  
           After a beat, the Fed in the passenger seat suddenly perks up.

                                 ORANGE
                        We’ve got activity on the blog!  
                        Coming from a handheld device in... 
                        Dodger Stadium.

           Gai smiles with grim satisfaction and steps harder on the GAS.
           INT. DODGER STADIUM - LATER

           It’s the bottom of the ninth, the Dodgers are down 4-2, and Bob is 
           back in his seat.  The CROWD has thinned considerably.

                                 NOAH
                        The only thing I don’t get is this:  
                        Even if she was some stalker fan 
                        obsessed with your blog, why oh why 
                        did you not bang her??

                                 ANDY RANTAMPRIKASH
                        Because then he’d have been all 
                        relaxed n’shit after and that’s 
                        when she’d have killed him.

                                 NOAH
                        If you can tell me ONE better way 
                        to die, I’ll buy you a car.

                                 BOB
                        Screw this.  Furcal’s gonna strike 
                        out.  This game’s over - let’s get 
                        the hell out of here.

                                 NOAH
                        Are you high?  We got two men on.

                                 BOB
                        Are you high?

                                 NOAH
                        Yes!  But this is baseball, baby!  
                        Anything can happen!

                                 BOB
                        Furcal’s hitting like .218.

           As the guys anticipate the next pitch, Andy looks OFFSCREEN, then 
           turns to Chris.

                                 ANDY RANTAMPRIKASH
                        How come that obviously gay guy’s 
                        been waving at you the whole game?

                                 CHRIS
                        Probably thinks I’m someone else.

           Andy SHRUGS - that’s good enough for him.  But JUST THEN:

           Furcal hits a HIGH FLY BALL, deep to center field!  It could be... 
           it might be... it is!  A home run!  The place goes UP FOR GRABS!
                                 NOAH
                        Holy shit!

           ELSEWHERE IN THE STADIUM

           The FEDS have arrived.  They SCAN the delirious crowd for Bob.

           THE GUYS

           Cheer, high-five, chest-bump, etc.  Chris HUGS Andy a bit too 
           long.  Bob turns to Noah.

                                 BOB
                        Unbelievable!  You were right, man.

           Noah smiles.  People are starting to EXIT.  As Bob bends down to 
           grab his LAPTOP, an ENVELOPE falls out of his jacket pocket.

           He picks it up: Huh?  OPENS it.  Inside, a slip of BEST WESTERN 
           stationery.  Written on it:

           “Bob, just in case you still don’t believe me...”

           Beneath that, a strange series of NUMBERS:

            SF 200 002 000 460
            LA 001 010 103 571

           Bob looks up at the DODGER SCOREBOARD, which from his P.O.V. is 
           just beyond the slip of paper.  The final line score reads:

           GIANTS  200 002 000 460
           DODGERS 001 010 103 571

           It’s the exact same series of numbers!  He looks back at the slip 
           of paper.  Beneath the line score, the note READS:

            “FURCAL HOMERS.  --Lina.”

                                 BOB
                        Holy Jesus Henry Christ.

           Bob LOOKS AROUND - what’s going on?  Is this some sort of joke?  
           As he looks up toward the EXIT, he sees...

           THE FEDS

           ...pointing and gesturing.  They just spotted him.  They start 
           heading his way.

           Bob doesn’t know what to do.  He turns to a group of big, tough 
           LATINO DODGER FANS next to him and points:
                                 BOB
                        Hey, see those two Matrix-looking 
                        dudes?  They’re Giants fans!  And 
                        they hate Mexicans!

           And just like that, Bob TAKES OFF RUNNING with his laptop.

                                 NOAH
                        Bob, what are you doing?

           But Bob is GONE, and the LATINOS are agitated...

                                 ORANGE
                        He’s got the laptop!  Move!

           The Feds try to give chase, but their PATH is BLOCKED by...

                                 LATINO DODGER FAN
                        Yo, what’s your deal, puta?

           The angry LATINOS open their Dodger jackets to reveal KNIVES.  The 
           FEDS open theirs to reveal GUNS.  The Latinos open the other sides 
           of their jackets - they, too, have GUNS!

           EXT. DODGER STADIUM PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Bob has RUN out into the PARKING LOT.  Where to go now?  Before he 
           can collect his thoughts, the FEDS BURST from a nearby exit, 
           pursued now by an even larger group of ANGRY DODGER FANS.

           Bob quickly DUCKS between two parked cars.  He looks to his left: 
           there’s A DRUNK GUY TAKING A LEAK.  He looks to his right: LINA!

                                 LINA
                        You got my note?

                                 BOB
                        Lina!

                                 LINA
                        Stay low and come with me.

           Lina grabs his hand and they CROUCH-RUN between parked cars.  A 
           massive SUV PULLS OUT of its space and Lina leads Bob, using the 
           SUV as a moving shield, keeping it between them and...

           THE FEDS, who desperately SCAN the parking lot for Bob as they 
           continue to evade the ANGRY MOB.

           Bob and Lina are EXPOSED momentarily when the SUV turns away.  
           They quickly duck between two still-parked CARS.
                                 BOB
                        You really are from the future?

                                 LINA
                        Yes.  But it was clear you needed 
                        more proof.

                                 BOB
                        Those guys, how did they find me?

                                 LINA
                        They’re monitoring your Blog.  
                        Every time you post a new entry, 
                        they’re able to pinpoint your 
                        location.

                                 BOB
                        Lina... give it to me straight.
                             (deep breath)
                        Are those guys cyborgs with a  
                        liquid metal alloy endoskeleton?

           Lina looks at Bob as though he’s quite insane.

                                 LINA
                        No.  They’re aliens.

                                 BOB
                        Aliens?

           One of the cars they’re hiding between PULLS AWAY.

                                 LINA
                        We’re losing our cover.  This way!

           She grabs his hand, leading him to a PICKUP TRUCK which is stopped 
           in traffic.  They CLIMB onto the back of the truck and into the 
           BED, where they hide...

           UNDER A TARP

           Between a LAWNMOWER and several RAKES.  The TRUCK starts MOVING.

                                 BOB
                        Wait, really?  In the future, the 
                        Earth is invaded by a super-smart 
                        race of Aliens?

                                 LINA
                        I wouldn’t characterize them as 
                        “super-smart.”  Their brain 
                        capacity is roughly two percent 
                        greater than that of humans.
                                 BOB
                        We get taken over by aliens who are 
                        only two percent smarter than us?

                                 LINA
                        Not taken over.  So far we’ve been 
                        able to battle them to a standstill 
                        despite their vastly-superior 
                        firepower.  Laser-guided missiles, 
                        explosives powerful enough to 
                        destroy an entire single-family 
                        dwelling... truly fearsome stuff.

                                 BOB
                        Wait a minute - we have those 
                        things, too.

                                 LINA
                        No.  In the next thousand years, 
                        humanity drastically reduces its 
                        development of new weapons.

                                 BOB
                             (dawning)
                        Because I just wrote guns are bad.  
                        Oh my god, I totally just screwed 
                        the human race.

                                 LINA
                        Quite the contrary - Bobism is the 
                        only thing that has allowed us to 
                        stave off annihilation.  Without 
                        Bobism, the aliens would rout us 
                        instantly.

                                 BOB
                        And that’s why they’re trying to 
                        kill me now.

                                 LINA
                        They were trying to kill you.  Now 
                        that they know I’ve made contact, 
                        killing you does them no good.  Not 
                        until they capture my Orbula 
                        Majora.

                                 BOB
                        What is an Orbula Majora?  ’Cause I 
                        gotta be honest, it sounds a little 
                        dirty.

           Lina pulls out the round, SHINY METAL OBJECT we saw earlier.
                                 LINA
                        It’s a multifunctional handheld 
                        device, much like your iPhone.  It 
                        contains all 1500 pages of Bobism.

                                 BOB
                        Fifteen hundred pages?  Okay, this 
                        is all very trippy.  I mean... 
                        there’s a bunch of cool philosophy 
                        I’m gonna write n’ change the world 
                        n’ junk and you’ve already got it 
                        on like a flash drive?

                                 LINA
                        Correct.  The Aliens know that if 
                        they killed you now, I’d use my Orb 
                        to post your teachings exactly as 
                        they’re destined to appear.  That’s 
                        why they wanted your laptop - they 
                        hoped to log on as you and enter a 
                        corrupted version of Bobism that 
                        would plunge the future into chaos.

                                 BOB
                        Can’t they just log on to the Blog 
                        from another computer?

                                 LINA
                        No.  They don’t have your password.

                                 BOB
                        They’re super-smart aliens from the 
                        future and they can’t figure out a 
                        way to hack my password?

                                 LINA
                        Again, only two percent smarter.

           Bob does his best to absorb all this as...

           ...THE PICKUP TRUCK pulls out of the parking lot and onto the 
           FREEWAY.

           INT. DODGER STADIUM - SAME TIME

           Noah, Chris and Andy are THE ONLY ONES LEFT in the stands.

                                 NOAH
                        He ain’t comin’ back.  Anybody 
                        sober yet?

           They all sadly SHAKE THEIR HEADS.  And continue to SIT there.
           EXT. STREET - EAST L.A. - NIGHT

           The PICKUP turns onto a main drag lined with TACO STANDS and 
           CARNICERIAS, passing a SIGN that reads “East Los Angeles.”

           UNDER THE TARP, Bob and Lina rattle among the gardening equipment.

                                 BOB
                        So - tell me junk about the future.
                        Does Heather ever dump that big 
                        dumb idiot?

                                 LINA
                        For you to know too much about the 
                        future would be dangerous.

                                 BOB
                        Why, because of the Space Time 
                        Continuum and what-have-you?

                                 LINA
                        What is that?

                                 BOB
                        I’m not sure.

                                 LINA
                        People have too great a tendency to 
                        imagine the future as something 
                        fixed, which it’s not.  Your 
                        destiny is malleable.

                                 BOB
                        Okay, fine, but tell me something.  
                        Who wins the next election?

           Beat.  Lina can’t help but SMILE at Bob’s curiosity.

                                 LINA
                        After your President Reagan, it 
                        went: Bush, Clinton, Bush, Clinton, 
                        Bush Bush Clinton Clinton Bush.  
                        Rabinowitz.  Clinton.  Then the 
                        Chinese take over.

           Just then, the ENGINE STOPS.  Lina gestures for Bob to be very 
           quiet, then pokes her head...

           ABOVE THE TARP

           The pickup has parked on a DRIVEWAY.  A Mexican MAN and WOMAN 
           emerge from the cab of the truck... then FOUR KIDS hop out too.  
           Everyone heads into the house, the wife rubbing her aching back.
           EXT. EAST L.A. - CRAPPY MINIMALL - THE NEXT MORNING

           Lina walks briskly toward one of those crappy minimalls prevalent 
           in working-class sections of L.A.  Bob, still wearing clothes from 
           last night, looks rather tired.

                                 BOB
                        East L.A.  I’ve never been here 
                        before.  It’s... nice.

                                 LINA
                        I hope you were able to get some 
                        sleep.  Today is a major turning 
                        point in the history of Bobism.

                                 BOB
                        Oh, yeah, the back of that pickup 
                        truck was super-comfy...

           Lina sees something OFFSCREEN and suddenly FREAKS OUT.

                                 LINA
                        Ahh!!  What on earth is that?!

           Lina cowers in abject fear and points at a SMALL DOG.

                                 BOB
                        That... dog?

                                 LINA
                        That’s a dog?

           She’s shaking with fear.  Bob can’t help but laugh.

                                 BOB
                        You’ve never seen a dog?

                                 LINA
                        No.  In fifty years or so, the air 
                        quality gets so bad, they all die.

           Hearing this news, Bob’s eyes WELL UP with TEARS.

                                 BOB
                        You always think it’s gonna be some 
                        crappy animal, like a spotted owl.  
                        You never think it’ll be doggies...

           Lina quickly pulls Bob inside a “LAVENDERIA,” or LAUNDROMAT.
           INT. LAUNDROMAT - MOMENTS LATER

           Lina has calmed down as Bob looks around - everyone here is a 
           MEXICAN WOMAN.  Lina sets up his laptop on a laundry counter.

                                 LINA
                        There’s an unprotected wireless 
                        network next door.  Once you’re 
                        finished with your entry, you can 
                        use it to post.

                                 BOB
                        Wait, I’m supposed to write the 
                        next entry right now?

                                 LINA
                        Yes.  But remember, once you post, 
                        we’ll have to leave immediately.

                                 BOB
                        So... a major turning point in 
                        the... thingy, that unites all of 
                        humanity... is written in a 
                        laundromat in East L.A.?

                                 LINA
                        Apparently so.  I’ll stand guard 
                        outside - call me when you’re ready 
                        to post.

           She leaves.  He STARES at his open laptop.  We PUSH IN on the 
           BLANK WHITE FIELD that awaits him, until we find ourselves...

           INT. WHITE BACKGROUND WORLD - OUT OF TIME

           Where Bob sits, trying in vain to come up with something to say.  
           He looks at US for a long time, in SILENCE.  Finally:

                                 BOB
                        This is weird.  It’s not every day 
                        you learn you’re, like, Jesus.
                             (then)
                        Jesus is probably not right.  I 
                        probably shouldn’t say Jesus.  
                        That’s just, that’s gonna be 
                        offensive to some people--

           The IMAGE OF BOB against the WHITE BG starts FURIOUSLY REWINDING.
           IN THE LAUNDROMAT

           Bob is furiously hitting the “BACKSPACE” button.

           WHITE BACKGROUND WORLD

           Bob tries to come up with the right thing to “say.”  Beat, then:

                                 BOB
                        Love thy neighbor?

           The IMAGE again REWINDS.  Another beat, then:

                                 BOB
                        Turn the other cheek...

           Again, the IMAGE REWINDS.  Bob sits there, frustrated.  Finally:

                                 BOB
                        Why can’t we all just... get along?  
                        Y’know?  I mean, our whole history 
                        of human... conflict... is just...

           IN THE LAUNDROMAT - A WHILE LATER

           Bob deletes again, then STARES at the screen in ANGER.

                                 BOB
                        Goddammit.

           This clearly isn’t fun for him.  Frustrated, he walks around the 
           Laundromat, trying to jog something loose.  Then, in a series of 
           QUICK DISSOLVES:

           Bob POUNDS HIS FIST against a dryer... then against his HEAD... 
           then he POUNDS HIS HEAD against the counter... a MEXICAN WOMAN 
           doing laundry stares at him... then, finally, he frowns and TYPES:

           WHITE BACKGROUND WORLD

           Bob angrily YELLS at the CAMERA:

                                 BOB
                        I’m not the messiah!

           IN THE LAUNDROMAT

           That’s all Bob has typed: “I’m not the messiah!!”  He stares at 
           the screen, seething.  His finger hovers over the “POST” button.
           EXT. LAUNDROMAT - MOMENTS LATER

           Lina scans the street watchfully as Bob EMERGES.

                                 BOB
                        Give me the orbula mandibula.

                                 LINA
                        What?

                                 BOB
                        You said you have a copy of Bobism 
                        on that thing.  Plug it into my 
                        laptop.  Just, type it in, or copy-
                        and-paste, whatever it is you 
                        future people do.

                                 LINA
                        That would not be right.  Bobism 
                        places the highest value on the 
                        virtue of a job well-labored-upon-- 

                                 BOB
                        I don’t care.  Log on as me.  All 
                        my usernames and passwords are in a 
                        folder on my desktop.  Marked 
                        “UserNames And Passwords.”  Write 
                        the whole thing.  I just don’t have 
                        it in me.

                                 LINA
                        That isn’t true.

                                 BOB
                        Yes it is.  And don’t tell me it’s 
                        “cheating” because I’ve written 
                        plenty of people’s papers for them 
                        and none of ‘em were like, “Oh, I’m 
                        sad, I missed out on the 
                        satisfaction of having done the 
                        work myself” after.

                                 LINA
                        Bob, millions of people revere you--

                                 BOB
                        Well, maybe they got the wrong guy.  
                        Or maybe this was always the way it 
                        was destined to happen.  Maybe it’s 
                        you they should revere, for going 
                        back in time with your orbalina and 
                        doing a little, y’know, cut-and-
                        paste-arooni.
                                 LINA
                        But that logic is so circular.  It 
                        exists in the future solely because 
                        I travelled back, to the past, and 
                        planted it there?  In that scenario, 
                        who originally composed it?

                                 BOB
                             (exasperated)
                        Nobody questioned it in Terminator!
                             (then)
                        Okay, you know what, I don’t care 
                        who composed it!  All I know is, it 
                        wasn’t me.  I’ve been in there two 
                        hours and all I have is four words.

                                 LINA
                             (beat)
                        You have four words?

           INT. LAUNDROMAT - MOMENTS LATER

           Lina reads what Bob has written.  It’s still just the same four 
           words: “I’m not the messiah!”  She gasps.

                                 LINA
                        Oh my.

                                 BOB
                        Yeah, I know.  Lina, I just--

                                 LINA
                        That’s it verbatim!  You’ve done 
                        it!  I can’t believe I’m witnessing 
                        this...

                                 BOB
                        No, you don’t understand.  I am not 
                        the messiah, I’m really not.

                                 LINA
                        Yes, it’s widely believed you issue 
                        this denial to indicate that only a 
                        false prophet would claim otherwise.

                                 BOB
                        But I am!  I am a false prophet!

           Bob angrily grabs the laptop and begins to type:  “I am a false 
            prophet!”  He then clicks the button marked “POST ENTRY NOW.”  
           Lina’s EYES WIDEN and she grabs the laptop from him.
                                 LINA
                        Bob, what are you doing?

                                 BOB
                        I’m posting it.  I don’t care--

           He grabs the laptop back and SPEAKS OUT LOUD as he TYPES:

                                 BOB
                        “Seriously... nobody... has any 
                        business... listening... to a word 
                        I say!”

           He hits “POST ENTRY NOW” and looks at her defiantly.  She is 
           visibly SHAKING with emotion and excitement.

                                 LINA
                         The Three Denials.

                                 BOB
                        Huh?

                                 LINA
                        “I’m not the messiah,” “I am a 
                        false prophet,” and “Seriously, 
                        nobody has any business listening 
                        to a word I say.”  I just watched 
                        the moment of their creation!  
                        Glory be to Bob!

           Bob stares at her for a very long beat.  Finally:

                                 BOB
                        You’re full of shit.

                                 LINA
                        My current digestive status is 
                        immaterial to the conversation.  
                        Bob, think about it.  What you know 
                        as “The Internet” is full of people 
                        claiming to have all the answers.  
                        Without The Three Denials, Bobism 
                        never would’ve stood out from that 
                        vast body of useless data.

           Bob’s head is spinning.  Lina hurriedly folds up his laptop, puts 
           it in the case, and slings the strap over her shoulder.

                                 LINA
                        We must hurry.  You posted too 
                        hastily for me to plan an escape 
                        route, and now that they have our 
                        coordinates they’ll be here any--
           Just then, a CAR SCREECHES UP!  Orange and Gai burst out, heading 
           into the place NEXT DOOR (the one that has the wireless network).

                                 BOB
                        Wow.  How’d they get here so--

           The ANGLE WIDENS to reveal that LINA, who was standing there a 
           second ago, is GONE.  So is the LAPTOP.

                                 BOB
                        --fast?  Lina?

           Bob is stunned.  A second later, THE FEDS BURST IN with their guns 
           drawn!  Bob just stands there like a deer in the headlights.  
           Various MEXICAN WOMEN scream:

                                 VARIOUS MEXICAN WOMEN
                        Soy Americano! / Tengo una Green 
                        Card! / No tengo cocana! No cocana!

           The Feds spot Bob, AIM THEIR GUNS at him, and Agent Orange barks:

                                 ORANGE
                        Where’s the girl?!

                                 BOB
                        She... was here a second ago.
                             (then, eyes closed)
                        If you’re gonna kill me, do it now.  
                        Don’t make me sit in an ass-stink 
                        car for four hours this time.

                                 GAI
                        Kill you?  We’re not gonna kill 
                        you.  Bob, we’re from the IRS.

           There’s a long, long beat -- then:

                        What?

                        Yes.  Lately she’s been preying on 
                        mostly young men, college age, who 
                        have recently started a blog.

                        The blogging community as a general 
                        rule is sad, lonely, particularly 
                        susceptible to this type of 
                        personal infiltration scam.

                        He gets it.  Then, you know how a 
                        guy gets after he drops a batch of 
                        daddy sauce.  That’s when she milks 
                        you of the stuff she really wants.  
                        Financial info.  Account numbers, 
                        usernames, passwords, the like.

                        We, uh, we didn’t have sex.

                        What?  You didn’t?

           Bob shakes his head.  The Agents look at each other.

                                 GAI
                        That’s great!  That means you

                        Um.  Bad news on that front.  There 
                        was this folder on my desktop.  
                        Marked “UserNames And Passwords.”  
                        Which I kinda... told her about.

                        You gotta be kidding me!  How?  
                        What story could she possibly have 
                        fed you to get you to part with 
                        that much sensitive information?

           Bob takes a deep breath and we SMASH TO:

           INT. IRS OFFICE WAITING ROOM - SECONDS LATER

           Bob bursts from the office, followed by Orange and Gai.  They’re 
           hysterical, gasping for air.  Convulsive FITS of laughter!

                                 BOB

           The Agents LAUGH even louder, dab at TEARS, clutch their STOMACHS.

                        she knew Furcal was gonna homer.  
                        How the hell could she have known 
                        that?  It was Dude’s first home run

                        she put this note in my pocket.  It 
                        had like the exact line score of 
                        the game.

                        Stadium, planted the note on you 
                        right at the end of the game.

                        things, like time-travel, and... it 
                        had like a trillion books on it...

                        things?

           Bob BLINKS AWAKE in familiar surroundings - HIS OWN BED!  Huh?  
           Was this all a dream?  Nope - as things come into focus, he SEES 
           Agents Gai and Orange standing over him.  Beat.

                                 GAI
                        Sorry about that.

           Bob looks - behind the Feds, just inside the doorway, are ANDY, 
           CHRIS and NOAH.

                                 CHRIS
                        Hey, buddy.  How ya doin’?

                        Sorry, man.  Tough break.

           Noah has to stifle LAUGHTER.  Soon, Andy and Chris, too, turn away 
           to hide their GIGGLES.

                        Bob, we contacted your bank.  I’m 
                        afraid the news is not good.  She 
                        zeroed out all your accounts.  And 
                        changed your passwords.

                             (then)
                        That sounded dirty but that’s not 
                        how I meant it.  I meant it like, 
                        “she screwed me, and now I wanna 
                        screw her.”  In the ass.
                             (then)
                        Again, much dirtier than I meant 
                        for that to sound.

                        Yes.  That.  The sexual sounding 
                        stuff, that was just frustration.

           Bob self-hatingly PUNCHES his own SKULL.  Just then, his iPHONE 
           RINGS!  The display reads: “NO CALLER ID.”  There’s a beat.

                                 GAI
                        That could be her.

                        we’re with you.

           The phone RINGS AGAIN.  The next few lines are spoken URGENTLY.

                                 BOB
                        What do I do??

                                 GAI
                        Answer it.  Make her think you’re 
                        still on board the con.  Hint at a 
                        secret account she didn’t know 
                        about.  And the most important 
                        thing is, try and get her to meet 
                        you someplace!

           Bob steels himself, then answers his phone.  

                                 BOB
                        Hello?  Lina!

                        No, they did not catch me.  I’m 
                        fine.  In order to stay on the lam 
                        from the aliens, I’m thinking of 
                        cashing in some... Israel bonds my 
                        Grandma gave me for my Bar Mitzvah.

           Bob looks at the FEDS, who nod in encouragement.

                                 LINA (ON PHONE)
                        Bob, there’s not much time.  Meet

                                 BOB
                        That was true.  Of course, they 
                        don’t mature until I turn 21.
                             (softly)
                        Sometimes I just hate her so much...

           EXT. GRIFFITH PARK OBSERVATORY - DAY

           In a secluded area outside Griffith Park Observatory, the Feds 
           tape a WIRE to Bob’s chest as he laughs, nervously.

                                 BOB
                        A wire, this is cool.
                             (whispering into chest)
                        “Serrano’s got the disks!  
                        Serrano’s got the disks!”

                        Nothing?  “Serrano’s got the--”

           Nothing.  Bob just trails off.

                                 BOB
                        Okay.

                                 GAI
                        The moment you establish visual 
                        contact or “vis-con,” indicate as 
                        much.  We’ll take it from there.

           INT. GRIFFITH PARK OBSERVATORY - ROTUNDA - MOMENTS LATER

           Bob’s steps ECHO against the marble floors of the empty ROTUNDA.  
           It’s eerily QUIET.

                                 BOB
                        Lina?  Lina?

           Bob hears the muffled sounds of a MOVIE coming from inside the 
           AUDITORIUM.  He walks over and PEEKS IN - it’s a HIGH SCHOOL CLASS 
           on a field trip, watching “Mysteries of Outer Space.”

           Bob heads up a set of STAIRS, whispering into his chest.
                                 BOB
                        No visual contact as of yet.  I 
                        repeat, no vis-con as of yet.

           He gets to the top of the stairs and heads into a narrow CORRIDOR.  
           Proceeds with caution.  Suddenly an ARM shoots out of nowhere and 
           pulls him into...

           THE TELESCOPE ROOM

           ...where a huge, high-powered TELESCOPE gives off a faint HUM, and 
           Bob is suddenly face-to-face with LINA!

           IN THE FEDS’ CAR

           Suddenly their surveillance equipment goes from live sound of BOB 
           BREATHING to PURE WHITE STATIC.  They exchange a concerned look.

           IN THE TELESCOPE ROOM

           Bob’s face is inches from Lina’s.  He tries to act “casual.”

                                 BOB
                        Lina, hi!  How nice to be seeing 
                        you.  Actually looking at you.

                                 LINA
                        They can’t hear you.

                                 BOB
                        What?  Hear me?  Who, what are you-- 
                        who can’t hear me?  Talking face-to-
                        face with you.  Lina.

                                 LINA
                        I know they’re waiting outside, 
                        Bob.  They plan to kill us both.

           IN THE FEDS’ CAR

           It’s still just STATIC.  Gai and Orange are getting antsy.

                                 ORANGE
                        I don’t like this.  Let’s go in.

                                 GAI
                        Give him another minute.

           IN THE TELESCOPE ROOM

           Bob is still face-to-face with Lina.
                                 LINA
                        Think about it, Bob.  If I’m an 
                        identity thief, why didn’t they 
                        tell you on that first day?  Four 
                        hours in a car, driving out to the 
                        desert, don’t you think that 
                        would’ve come up?
                             (beat)
                        You must believe me, Bob.

                                 BOB
                             (exhales, frustrated)
                        You know what - why?  Why should I 
                        believe you, when I have no proof?

                                 LINA
                        You’ll have proof soon enough.  But 
                        right here, right now, you need to 
                        look deep within yourself.  Belief 
                        in the absence of proof, Bob - it’s 
                        called faith.  Which do you choose 
                        to believe about yourself - that 
                        Bob Trautwig has it in him to 
                        change the world?  Or do you want 
                        to go on believing what you’ve 
                        always believed - that he’s just a 
                        face in the crowd, waiting to get 
                        taken in by yet another girl who’s 
                        out to use him?

           Bob takes this all in, weighing his options.

                                 LINA
                        Your old identity’s been stolen, 
                        Bob, but not by me.  And from what 
                        I saw of it, it needed stealing.

           INT. FEDS’ CAR - SAME TIME

           Gai is fiddling with the audio, trying in vain to get a signal.

                                 ORANGE
                        This is ridiculous.  I’m going in.

           Just then, the AUDIO SIGNAL becomes CRYSTAL CLEAR, and we HEAR:

                                 BOB (O.S.)
                        Guys!  She’s in the Rotunda!  I 
                        repeat, she’s in the Rotunda!

           And with that, the Feds spring into action.  They cock GIANT 
           SHOTGUNS and make a RUN for the FRONT DOOR.  
           INT. GRIFFITH PARK OBSERVATORY - ROTUNDA - CONTINUOUS

           They kick open the door and BURST into the ROTUNDA, where they 
           frantically point their guns at everything.  But it’s SILENCE - 
           all they hear are the muffled sounds of the MOVIE from inside...

           THE AUDITORIUM 

           ...where HIGH SCHOOL KIDS watch the boring film about astronomy.

                                 TEENAGER #1
                        Let’s go outside and smoke a bowl.  
                        This is boring as ass.

                                 TEENAGER #2
                        No kidding.  This movie needs like 
                        aliens or some shit.

           IN THE ROTUNDA

           The FEDS tiptoe around, shotguns at the ready.  Suddenly a DROP of 
           something lands on Gai’s shoulder.  He looks at it, SNIFFS, then:

                                 GAI
                        What the--?

           They both LOOK UP at the same time.

           ON THE BALCONY ABOVE THE ROTUNDA

           AGENTS’ P.O.V.: LINA leans over the guard rail, about to pour 
           GALLONS AND GALLONS OF MR. CLEAN...

                                 LINA
                        Here’s your proof, Bob.

           ...Which now RAIN DOWN upon the Feds!  Then something strange 
           happens.  As the Mr. Clean makes contact with their skin...

           THE FEDS BEGIN TO SMOKE.  

           A little at first, then a LOT.  Mr. Clean clearly hurts these men. 
           But now, it’s becoming evident... THEY AREN’T MEN AT ALL!  

           They begin to MELT, MOLT, MORPH before our very eyes... into 
           scaly, lizardy, tentacle-y, ALIENS!

           BOB, who along with Lina is emptying huge bottles of Mr. Clean 
           over the guard rail, stops to WATCH what’s going on below.

                                 BOB
                        Holy fuckamole.
           The Feds are now WRITHING in agony on the floor, as the anguished 
           bodies of the ALIENS crawl out of the men through THEIR EARS!

           A sickening green slimy OOZE trails from the Feds’ ears across the 
           floor as the Aliens CRAWL AWAY, clutching the government-issue 
           SHOTGUNS in their lizardy hands.

           ANGLE ON

           The two bored teenagers, who have just snuck out of the 
           auditorium.  Jaws hanging open.  They’ve seen everything.

                                 TEENAGER #1
                        Okay, my apologies - this rules!

           Just then, yet more Mr. Clean RAINS DOWN on one of the Aliens, 
           sending his SHOTGUN SKITTERING across the floor.  The other Alien 
           aims his gun and FIRES, winging LINA in the shoulder!

                                 LINA
                             (ala “Jesus Christ!”)
                        Ahh!  Bob Trautwig!

           Bob sees this, then sees the (less-injured) Alien LEAP onto the 
           wall and climb STRAIGHT UPWARDS 90 degrees like a salamander 
           scaling a tree.  Climbing up for them!  

           He RUNS toward Lina, grabs the last full bottle of Mr. Clean, and 
           CUTS the top off with a KNIFE.

                                 LINA
                        No!  Leave me.  Get out of here.

                                 BOB
                        We’re getting out of this together.

           Bob sends the Mr. Clean cascading down the wall.  The Alien on the 
           wall looks up and FIRES!  Bob DUCKS behind the thick plaster as 
           bullets fly into the space he just occupied.

           DOWNSTAIRS

           The high school kids GO NUTS!  They’re now joined by a dozen OTHER 
           KIDS, plus a couple TEACHERS.

           UPSTAIRS

           Bob peeks over the balcony at the Rotunda below.  The high school 
           kids watch the “show,” which at this moment includes the injured 
           Alien slowly BELLY-CRAWLING across the floor towards his shotgun.

           Bob weighs his options.  Only one way down...
           BOB JUMPS OFF THE BALCONY!

           A fall of about 15 feet.  LANDS.  Grimaces in pain.

                                 BOB
                        That hurt very badly.

           Bob picks up the shotgun that skittered across the floor and 
           points it at the belly-crawling Alien.

                                 BOB
                        Okay, the safety’s probably on and 
                        I have no idea how to use one of 
                        these but I guess it’s worth a--

           Bob SQUEEZES the trigger - and BLOWS THE SHIT out of the alien!

                                 BOB
                        --SHOT.

           The High School kids CHEER with wild abandon.  Bob just stares 
           slackjawed at the smoking shotgun in his hand.  Then:

                                 BOB
                        I guess I better re... cock...

           He grabs it by the barrel and, with growing enthusiasm, does that 
           bad-ass “shotgun re-cock” gesture.  He sets his sights on the 
           Alien still climbing the wall towards Lina.

                                 BOB
                        This is from Bob Trautwig.

           Bob BLOWS THE SHIT out of his second alien.

           The High School kids break out into WILD APPLAUSE as Bob heads for 
           the stairs, holding the shotgun as far out from his body as he 
           can.  One TEACHER turns to the other.

                                 TEACHER
                        Did you know this was part of the 
                        program?

           The other teacher shakes her head as Bob BOUNDS UP THE STAIRS two 
           at a time to LINA, who’s holding her injured shoulder.

                                 BOB
                        That was awesome!  They were really 
                        aliens!  I killed the aliens!

                                 LINA
                        No.  Guns don’t kill aliens.
                                 BOB
                             (hoping against hope)
                        People kill aliens...?

           The ALIENS stir -- and GROW NEW LIMBS -- their wounds healing.  
           Kids are still applauding, as though they’re two performers at 
           Universal City.  Bob looks at Lina... and then they RUN!!

           EXT. GRIFFITH PARK OBSERVATORY - DAY

           Bob and Lina BURST OUTSIDE and RUN through the parking lot.  Lina 
           surveys the available CARS... until her eyes settle on a VESPA.

           The aliens SLITHER out after them, just in time to see:

           BOB AND LINA

           ...escaping on the Vespa.  Bob is sitting on the back, his arms 
           wrapped tight around Lina’s waist.

           THE ALIENS HISS MADLY.  They scan the area, zeroing in on:

           AN ELDERLY COUPLE 

           At the rail, using a coin-op metal TELESCOPE to look at downtown 
           L.A.  The Aliens SLOWLY ADVANCE on the old folks, and whip out 
           their ORBS...

           ON THE VESPA

           Bob and Lina whip through the winding streets of the HOLLYWOOD 
           HILLS on their commandeered SCOOTER.  Bob’s thrill has turned to 
           sheer TERROR.  He yells to Lina through the whipping wind.

                                 BOB
                        What the hell was that?  They 
                        re-grew their flippin’ limbs?!

                                 LINA
                        The aliens’ molecular structure 
                        allows them to heal from single-
                        entry contusions at a rate 10,000 
                        times faster than humans.

                                 BOB
                        Well, that sucks.

                                 LINA
                        The only way to kill them is with 
                        the point of a knife to a very 
                        specific spot on the brain.  Kind 
                        of like a lobster.
                                 BOB
                        Question.  Are they able to quickly 
                        inhabit the bodies of other humans?

                                 LINA
                        Yes.  How did you know that?

                                 BOB
                        ‘Cause old people don’t usually 
                        drive like that.

           Bob POINTS behind then.  Lina looks back, sees TWO INSANELY OLD 
           PEOPLE in a Cutlass Supreme driving like maniacs in pursuit.    
           Yep - that’s them.  She steels herself for a renewed chase.

                                 LINA
                        Hold on tight!

           She pulls a HARD BANK and SWERVES off the road, sending the 
           scooter down a steep and bumpy portion of the HOLLYWOOD HILLS.

           THE ALIENS/OLD PEOPLE

           Trying to pursue the Vespa, also bank hard... and EAT SHIT.  They 
           SKID OUT and SLAM into somebody’s BIG-ASS SECURITY FENCE.

           BOB AND LINA

           Meanwhile, are in a barely-controlled CAREEN through Beechwood 
           Canyon, bumpity-bumpity-bumping through BRUSH, ROCKS, etc...

           THE HOMEOWNER 

           Whose fence the oldies just demolished happens to be right there, 
           watering his driveway.  He approaches the smoking Cutlass.

                                 HOMEOWNER
                        Good Christ!  Are you folks okay?

                                 OLD LADY
                        We’re going to be needing your car.

                                 HOMEOWNER
                        What?

           The Old Man PULLS A SHOTGUN.

                                 OLD MAN
                        Your car, human!  NOW!  Before I 
                        shoot you in your human face!
           BOB AND LINA

           Miraculously emerge at the bottom of the hill, scratched-up but 
           intact.  They take a left on Franklin and go right past the 
           SCIENTOLOGY CELEBRITY CENTER.

                                 BOB
                        I think we lost them!

                                 LINA
                        Let’s keep going, just to be safe.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN HOLLYWOOD - DAY

           The Vespa WHIPS past Chewbacca taking photos with tourists... 
           several TRANSVESTITE HOOKERS... WILLIAM SHATNER’s star on the  
           Walk of Fame...a FREAK ranting about the end of the world...

           ...then finally, in the seedy part of Hollywood, they pull into an 
           ALLEY behind the “DIANETICS by L. Ron Hubbard” building.

                                 BOB
                        Wow.  These guys really own a lot 
                        of real estate.

           Lina pulls out her ORB and applies it to her injured shoulder.

                                 BOB
                        What’s it doing?

                                 LINA
                        Right now it’s altering the 
                        chemical makeup of the tissue to 
                        prevent further blood loss.

                                 BOB
                        I don’t think my iPhone does that.

                        Version 6 will.  It doesn’t heal 
                        internal organs, though.  Luckily 
                        the bullet only hit my shoulder.

           The Orb has amazingly FROZEN Lina’s wound.  Bob reacts.

                                 BOB
                        My God.  That’s not a government-
                        issue taser.  This is all real.

                                 LINA
                        I thought perhaps seeing the Aliens 
                        might drive that point home for you.
           Suddenly, a Jaguar rounds the corner at the far end of the alley, 
           our two ELDERLY friends in the front seat.

                                 BOB
                        What?  How’d they find us so quick?

           But instead of answering, Lina GUNS the Vespa a millisecond before 
           a SHOTGUN BLAST destroys the DUMPSTER they were just in front of.  
           The CHASE IS BACK ON.

                                 LINA
                        I was afraid this might be the 
                        case.  They planted a tracking 
                        device in you, Bob!

           Bob frantically brushes at his skin, like he’s covered with bees.

                                 LINA
                        Not on you.  In you.

                                 BOB
                        How’d they get a tracking device in 
                        me without my knowing?  That’s 
                        impossible.

                                 LINA
                        While you were in their custody, 
                        did you lose consciousness at any 
                        point?

                                 BOB
                        Oh no, yeah, that happened.

           Lina nods grimly, then banks hard, CRASHING through the GLASS 
           DOORS of the Dianetics building!  The Vespa SPEEDS through the 
           main corridor inside!  Scientologists SCATTER!

                                 SCIENTOLOGIST
                        Heavens to Zortron!!

           EXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD - SECONDS LATER

           They EMERGE at the other end of the Dianetics building, but the 
           Jaguar is there to meet them.  Lina SWERVES to avoid the next 
           volley of gunfire.

                                 BOB
                        How are we gonna lose them?

                                 LINA
                        We can’t lose them!  That’s the 
                        advantage of a tracking device!
                                 BOB
                        Sarcasm is not your best color.

           Lina WEAVES through oncoming traffic, barely avoiding crash after 
           crash.  Still, the Jaguar pursues.  The Old Lady leans out the 
           passenger window, holding the shotgun, waiting for a clean shot.

           At Sunset & Vermont, Lina JUMPS the curb and hurls the Vespa 
           straight for the SUBWAY STATION!

           INT. SUBWAY STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Pedestrians SCATTER as she speeds DOWN the UP-ESCALATOR, right 
           underground!  The Jaguar screeches to a stop and the Oldies get 
           out, packing heat, hobbling forward as fast as they can.

           THE VESPA

           Jumps a turnstile underground and speeds along the platform.

                                 BOB
                        There’s a subway in L.A.?!

           Lina jumps the platform and LANDS on the tracks eight feet below.  
           They SPEED along the bumpy tracks, Bob holding on for dear life, 
           until the LIGHTS of an oncoming train appear.

                                 BOB
                        Uh... Lina?

           Lina sets her jaw and GUNS it, heading straight for the train.  At 
           the last possible instant, she pulls HARD on the brakes, SKIDDING 
           to a stop in front of a niche carved into the side of the tunnel.

           Lina YANKS Bob off the Vespa, ditching the scooter right there on 
           the tracks and still holding his shirt, DIVES into the alcove just 
           as the train SPEEDS by, CRUSHING the Vespa.

           They’re in front of a DOOR marked “TO BOILER ROOM.”  It’s locked.

           THE OLD FOLKS

           Hobble down to the platform.  The Man pulls out his ORB, pushes a 
           button.  It HINGES OPEN, emits a FINE MIST, and PROJECTS onto it a 
           holographic image that looks like a GPS readout.

           He gets a fix on BOB’S LOCATION.  They NOD at each other, then 
           CLIMB DOWN onto the tracks, much to the shock of other commuters.  
           They take a few steps in Bob’s direction, and then

           THE TRAIN RAMS INTO THEM!

           They HISS as the train just fuckin’ PLOWS them down the tracks!
           BOB AND LINA

           At the door, hear the deafening HISS echo through the tunnel.  
           Lina reacts, satisfied, then puts the Orb against the keyhole.   
           Like R2D2 workin’ it, the Orb quickly unlocks the door.

           Bob and Lina enter, shut the door behind them, then Lina uses the 
           Orb to WELD the door shut.  Bob stares at the Orb for a long beat.

                                 BOB
                        Does that thing play music, too?

                                 LINA
                        Yes.

           Lina finishes welding the door shut, then leads Bob down a narrow 
           corridor toward...

           INT. BOILER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Where Lina closes another set of doors and BOLTS it shut.

                                 LINA
                        Alright.  We just bought some time.

                                 BOB
                        Good, now how are we gonna get this 
                        tracking device outta me?

                                 LINA
                        I’m afraid it’s not a simple 
                        process.

                                 BOB
                        That’s okay.  I can handle it.

                                 LINA
                        Good.  Take off your pants, bend 
                        over, and spread your buttocks 
                        apart an almost painful amount.

                                 BOB
                        Oh my God, no.  It’s... up my ass?

                                 LINA
                        Deep within your colon, most 
                        likely.  The device is liquid, so 
                        it’s quite difficult to remove.   
                        I’d be lying if I didn’t tell you 
                        this will be horribly painful.
                                 BOB
                        Okay, hang on.  If it’s liquid, 
                        can’t I just drink lots of water 
                        and flush it out?

                                 LINA
                        That would take too long.

                                 BOB
                        How long?

                                 LINA
                        Three years.

                                 BOB
                        I don’t believe this.  Aliens 
                        planted something in me anally.  
                        I’m that guy.

           THE SUBWAY TRAIN

           Which plowed the Old Folks COMES TO A STOP.  They look awful, 
           but they’re still ALIVE.  Just then, the TRAIN STARTS BACK UP.  
           They MOAN sadly as they’re dragged off again.

           IN THE BOILER ROOM

           Lina is behind a bent-over Bob, using her Orb to work on his ass, 
           as BOB SCREAMS:

                                 BOB
                        This is as humiliating as it is 
                        uncomfortable!  Ahhhh!

           TITLE CARD:  “One Hour Later.”

           Bob is still SCREAMING.

                                 BOB
                        Ahhh!  Ooh... OW!  No die-down of 
                        the pain, none!  Remarkable really!

           Finally, she pulls out the tracking device.  It’s HUGE - the size 
           of a grapefruit.  It looks like a sphere of suspended liquid.  
           Lina throws it on the ground and STOMPS on it.

           Bob’s screams finally die down.  He turns to her, full of shame.

                                 BOB
                        Don’t tell anybody about this.
           THE SUBWAY TRAIN

           Finally reaches the END OF THE LINE.  The Old Folks CRAWL OUT from 
           underneath it, MANGLED almost beyond recognition.  The Old Man 
           checks his GPS and they hobble in the direction of Bob.

           INT. BOILER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Bob and Lina are both exhausted, like a brand-new mother and her 
           doctor moments after the baby’s been delivered.

                                 LINA
                        You’ll want to lie still and 
                        recuperate for a few minutes.  

                                 BOB
                        Not a problem.

           A long beat of silence as Bob lies down, grimacing with pain.

                                 LINA
                        I once had to perform an extraction 
                        on Lieutenant Nix, the bravest 
                        soldier in our entire unit.  He 
                        could face down alien fire without 
                        flinching, but that same procedure 
                        you just went through nearly 
                        wrecked him.
                             (beat)
                        That was meant ironically.  Did you 
                        not-- “wrecked him?”  Wrecked-’im?
                             (then)
                        Did I tell it wrong?

           Beat, then Bob starts to laugh.

                                 BOB
                        You just made a joke!

                                 LINA
                        It’s not my strength.

                                 BOB
                        No!  No, that was a really good 
                        one.  I just wish it didn’t hurt 
                        my ass so much to laugh.

           He laughs again, then grimaces.  She starts laughing too.  The 
           laughter dies down and they’re left smiling at each other.

                                 BOB
                        So really, that thing plays music?
                                 LINA
                        The Orb contains every song ever 
                        recorded, every book ever written.  
                        The number of trees it saves alone 
                        is staggering.

                                 BOB
                        Good lord.  That thing must cost a 
                        ton of money.

                                 LINA
                        Not at all.  Each citizen is given

                        much people experience in life

           THE OLD FOLKS

           Have finally reached the “To Boiler Room” door.  They test it: 
           WELDED SHUT.  The Old Man takes his Orb and, using its “BLOWTORCH” 
           function, begins to SLOWLY CUT THROUGH the edges of the doorway.

           At this rate, it’ll take a while.
           INT. BOILER ROOM - SAME TIME

           Lina has sat down next to Bob and slips her HAND into his.

                                 LINA
                        For this to work, we must be 
                        touching at all times.

                                 BOB
                        I’m okay with that.

           With her other hand, she pushes a few buttons on the Orb.  It 
           begins to VIBRATE, then GLOW, and finally it gives off

           A BLINDING WHITE LIGHT

           ...and suddenly, we’re in:

           THE YEAR 3008

           Bob and Lina, still holding hands, appear as a HOLOGRAM, kinda 
           like Yoda and Ben Kenobi looked when they’d show up after death.

           The WORLD OF THE FUTURE is impossibly utopian.  GLEAMING, TALL 
           STRUCTURES rise toward a perfectly-blue sky dotted with puffy 
           white clouds.  And...

                                 BOB
                        Everyone is beige.

                                 LINA
                        That’s right.  What you know as 
                        “races” have long since merged.

                                 BOB
                        So the entire world... did it with 
                        each other.

                                 LINA
                        I suppose so.  An indirect result 
                        is that there are no “nations” 
                        anymore.  War, at least between 
                        humans, is a distant memory.

           Bob shakes his head - it’s too good to be true.  He looks around: 
           wildly attractive people, all of them healthy and fit, move about 
           through perfectly-manicured PUBLIC PARKS.

           On a beautiful, wide BOULEVARD, a sleek AUTOMOBILE glides by - TWO 
           FEET OFF THE GROUND.  Bob reacts.  A beat, then he SNIFFS THE AIR.

                                 BOB
                        What’s that smell?
                                 LINA
                        Oh, yes, that.  Several hundred 
                        years ago, scientists developed a 
                        way to convert the carcasses of 
                        SUVs into super-compressed energy 
                        pellets the size of a small marble 
                        which can power modern-day vehicles 
                        over 100,000 miles.  The emissions 
                        have the exact chemical 
                        composition, and aroma, of--

                                 BOB
                        Fresh-popped popcorn.

                                 LINA
                             (nods, then)
                        You get used to the smell after a 
                        while.

                                 BOB
                        That’s... too bad.

           They round a CORNER and find themselves in a MASSIVE CITY PLAZA.  
           Like a huge, futuristic ROCKEFELLER CENTER, tall buildings ring  
           an enormous public space.  Bob looks up.

                                 BOB
                        Oh my God.

           On the façade of one of the buildings, twenty stories high, is the 
           image of a serenely-smiling FACE, and beneath it, in HUGE LETTERS, 
           “BOB TRAUTWIG.”

           Just one problem - the face is much more handsome, and racially 
            much darker, than the real Bob.

                                 LINA
                        No photographs of you survived.

                                 BOB
                        That’s clear.

           Bob looks to his right - a man is selling “TROUT WIGS” (an actual 
           FISH that fits over your head).

                                 VENDOR
                        Trout wigs!  Get your trout wigs 
                        here! 

           Bob marvels at this oddity, then looks beyond the City Plaza at a 
            natural feature we’ve seen before: the SANDSTONE ROCK FORMATION 
           known as “LANDBRIDGE.”  It’s surrounded by CANDLES and FLOWERS.
                                 BOB
                        Hey.  That rock formation, the 
                        arch.  I’ve been there before.  
                        It... it was in the desert...

           A dark LOOK passes over Lina’s face.

                                 LINA
                        It’s called LandBridge.

                                 BOB
                        Why are there so many candles?

                                 LINA
                             (changing subject)
                        Here, I want to show you something.

           Lina grabs Bob by the arm and PULLS him into...

           INT. PIZZA PARLOR OF THE FUTURE

           Kinda like a Pizza Parlor of the 1950’s, only even more awesome.  
           “Little Italy” meets “Minority Report.”  Bob inhales the scent.

                                 BOB
                        Wow.  That smells even better than 
                        the car exhaust.

                                 LINA
                        New York City tap water is 
                        available throughout the world.  
                        Pizza is delicious everywhere on 
                        earth.  Music, even in elevators, 
                        rocks.  And of course, I mentioned 
                        the thing about there being no more 
                        war.

                                 BOB
                             (tearing up)
                        It’s impossibly wonderful...

                                 LINA
                        We’d better go.  This drains the 
                        battery tremendously.

           Bob nods reluctantly.  Lina pushes some buttons on her Orb, and... 

           THE BLINDING WHITE LIGHT

           Returns them to THE PRESENT DAY, where they find themselves...
           INT. BOILER ROOM - SAME TIME

           ...holding hands, as before.  Bob is blown away by what he’s just 
           seen.

                                 BOB
                        That... that’s all because of stuff 
                        I write?

                                 LINA
                        Because of what you set into motion, 
                        yes.  It’s amazing the effect one 
                        human being can have upon the world.

           Bob reacts, amazed, as we CUT TO:

           INT. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

           The OLD FOLKS have finished CUTTING THROUGH the first set of 
           DOORS.  They KICK them down and head down the corridor toward 
           the door marked “BOILER ROOM.”

           INT. BOILER ROOM - SAME TIME

           Bob and Lina hear the Aliens just on the other side of the door.

                                 LINA
                        They’re drawing closer!  We must 
                        flee!

           Lina helps Bob to his feet.  He hobbles along, wincing with tushy 
           pain at each step.  She uses the GPS function on her Orb to lead 
           him through the bowels of the system, and UP...

           ...a METAL LADDER, into a room full of massive POWER GENERATORS.  
           Lina looks at her Orb, then leads them through a narrow passageway 
           that leads to a large GRATE, which she easily unhooks.

           They climb through the opening, into a corridor which leads to...

           A DEAD END.

                                 LINA
                        What?  I don’t understand.  The Orb 
                        indicates this corridor should lead 
                        directly to an air shaft.
                             (slaps the wall)
                        But this - it’s solid brick.

                                 BOB
                        Could I see that?
           He looks at the GPS readout on the Orb.  Then looks closer.

                                 BOB
                        Look.  This says “as of 11:59 pm 
                        tonight.  My guess is, something 
                        happens between now and the end of 
                        the day to open this passage up.
                             (then)
                        Is is possible we do it?

                                 LINA
                             (knowing)
                        Yes.  It’s possible.

           INT. BOILER ROOM - SAME TIME

           The Old Folks finally SMASH DOWN the Boiler Room door.  They pull 
           their shotguns and give chase in hot pursuit, HISSING ferociously.

           INT. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

           The HISSING echoes to Bob and Lina.  Time is quickly running out.

                                 LINA
                        We can blast through this wall.  
                        But at a great cost, I’m afraid.

                                 BOB
                        Okay, fine.  What’s the cost?

                                 LINA
                        The Orb.

           Bob nods, getting it.  That is a great cost indeed.

                                 LINA
                        It’s capable of delivering a 
                        powerful explosive charge, but it 
                        would be destroyed in the process.  
                        Which means two things.  One is 
                        that the only remaining copy of 
                        Bobism would be--

                                 BOB
                        The one in my head.  The one I 
                        haven’t written yet.

                                 LINA
                        That’s correct.
                                 BOB
                        And what’s the other thing?

                                 LINA
                             (beat)
                        Never mind the other thing.  We can 
                        handle that.  The question is - can 
                        you handle this responsibility?  
                        Are you sure you have it in you to 
                        do what must be done?

                                 BOB
                        Yes.  Yes, I’m sure.

           Bob looks Lina in the eye - he’s positive.  They both look down at 
           THE ORB in her hand.

           THE OLD FOLKS

           Advance along the path just travelled by Bob and Lina.  They get 
           to the METAL LADDER and gingerly start CLIMBING it.

           LINA

           Opens a panel on the Orb, revealing a COMPARTMENT inside with a 
           RED BUTTON.  She presses the button, places the Orb at the base  
           of the wall, then RUNS.

           She DUCKS AROUND A CORNER where Bob is already huddled in a 
           protected spot.  She hurries to join him just as...

           THE ORB EXPLODES!

           ...Sending Lina HURTLING FORWARD, smack ON TOP OF BOB...

           ...Sending The Old Folks FLYING BACKWARDS, blasted off the METAL 
           LADDER and CRASHING down on the concrete floor below.

           When the DUST SETTLES, a HOLE has been BLOWN through the wall, 
           through which we can see an AIR SHAFT where FILTERED SUNLIGHT 
           beams down from the SIDEWALK GRATE above.

           Bob and Lina, their faces inches apart, LOCK EYES.  The air is 
           thick with TENSION, sexual and otherwise, when suddenly the Old 
           Folks ROUND THE CORNER!  Lina grabs Bob by the hand.

                                 LINA
                        Come!  We must hurry!

           Lina pulls Bob up and they climb through the air shaft, up toward 
           the SIDEWALK GRATE.  When they reach the top, Lina moves the grate 
           aside and THEY EMERGE at...
           EXT. HOLLYWOOD AND HIGHLAND - CONTINUOUS

           ...Right across the street from the tourist zoo that is GRAUMAN’S 
           CHINESE THEATER.

                                 LINA
                        Where are we?  I’m lost without my 
                        Orb!

                                 BOB
                        Follow me.

           Bob takes ONE STEP before he’s startled by a WHITE KID his own age 
           standing right in his face.

                                 PANHANDLER KID
                        Spare some change?

                                 BOB
                        What?  No!  Dude, you’re like 
                        twenty.  Work!

           The kid SLINKS OFF.  Just then, an OLD LADY ARM reaches around 
           Bob’s neck!  Bob tries to SCREAM but no sound comes out!

           Bob grabs her arm and FLIPS HER OVER HIS HEAD!  People take notice 
           just in time to see the Old Lady CRASH into a sunglasses display.  
           Bob POUNCES on her, SMASHING A FIST into her face.

           Onlookers are HORRIFIED as Bob climbs on top of the Old Lady and 
           begins PUMMELLING her!  A lifetime of rage pouring out.

                                 BOB
                        You bitch!  I will kill you!  You 
                        hear me, freak-show?  Kill you!

           The OLD MAN jumps on Bob’s back.  Bob ELBOWS him in the face, too.

                                 BOB
                        Oh, you want some?  I’m Bob, 
                        motherfucker!

           Bob POUNDS both old folks.  It’s an awful sight and people SHIELD 
           THEIR EYES.  Then, out of nowhere, someone BLINDSIDES Bob, 
           knocking him off the now-defenseless Old Lady.

           It’s SUPERMAN.  Not the real Superman, of course - the guy in the 
           costume who poses for photos on the Walk of Fame.  If Superman 
           were 45 and smoked three packs a day, he’d look like this guy.

           Bob is THROWN into the street - right into oncoming traffic.
                                 LINA
                        Bob!

           ERRT!  A PRIUS SKIDS OUT, coming to a stop inches from Bob’s head.  
           The DRIVER hops out, furious.

                                 ANGRY PRIUS DRIVER
                        What the hell, bro?!

           Lina LEVELS the guy with a high kick. 

                                 LINA
                        Bob!  Let’s go!

           She HOPS IN the Prius, Bob right behind her.  The badly banged-up 
           Old Folks watch them PEEL OUT, as both SUPERMAN and MARILYN MONROE 
           (50-ish, billowy white dress) stand over them.

                                 MARILYN MONROE
                        Are you okay?

           The Old Folks’ SWOLLEN EYES look Marilyn and Superman up and down, 
           with a sinister GLEAM.

           EXT. LAX - LONG-TERM PARKING - DAY

           Bob and Lina park - and promptly DITCH - the PRIUS.  As they RUN 
           across the vast expanse of PARKED CARS that is Lot C, we hear:

                                 LINA (PRE-LAP)
                        You’ll take your time writing each 
                        entry, as much time as you need.  
                        But once you’re ready to post, we 
                        also must be ready to escape.  Each 
                        time we log on to the grid, they’ll 
                        have a fix on our location.

                                 BOB (PRE-LAP)
                        Got it.

           INT. LAX - STORAGE LOCKER AREA - DAY

           This conversation has been taking place in the part of the 
           terminal where people rent LOCKERS.  Lina opens one with a 
           key and pulls out BOB’S LAPTOP.  He reacts, delighted.

                                 BOB
                        Lappy!
                             (off her look)
                        It’s what I call my laptop.
                                 LINA
                        I’ll be nearby.  Try to stay 
                        relaxed - it’s just the future 
                        of the human race.

           He nods.  She leaves.  As he sits on the floor and OPENS HIS 
           LAPTOP, we SMASH TO BLACK.

           TITLE CARD:  “Numbers.”

           INT. WHITE BACKGROUND WORLD - OUT OF TIME

           Bob wears the all-white, stands in front of the all-white 
           background, and (after a beat) speaks directly into CAMERA.

                                 BOB
                        Well.  It’s been an eventful couple 
                        days...

           MONTAGE

           Over the next, Bob and Lina POST a series of NEW blog entries.  
           Bob writes them in various locations around the city, then they 
           HURRY AWAY before the Aliens arrive.

           As they RUN from LAX, hopping the first COURTESY SHUTTLE they 
           find, we hear:

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        So much has happened - so much has 
                        changed.  I’ve seen parts of the 
                        city I never knew existed...

           Bob types furiously on his laptop in a coffeeshop in the heart of 
           THE CRENSHAW DISTRICT - he’s the only white guy in the place.

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        But more than that.  I’ve seen a 
                        vision.  Of a world - our world - 
                        not as it is, but as it should be.  
                        As it will be...

           Bob and Lina hop out of a TAXI in the heart of BEVERLY HILLS.  
           They head for the one place on Rodeo Drive that offers FREE WI-FI.

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        Could you imagine what would happen 
                        if we put aside our differences, if 
                        we spent less time acquiring and 
                        more time inquiring - into what it 
                        means to have a soul, into what it 
                        means to be a human being?
           SUPERMAN and MARILYN MONROE, each holding an ORB, burst into the 
           Crenshaw District coffeeshop where Bob was typing earlier.  No 
           sign of Bob and Lina.  Black PATRONS chuckle at their get-up.

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        I’ve seen it, and it’s wonderful.  
                        The world I’ve seen inspires me.   
                        It makes me think humanity does 
                        have a chance to become One.

           Bob finishes up another entry, then he and Lina HURRY OUT.  
           They’re in Chinatown now, running past a market choked with 
           ASIAN FOLKS... BUSINESSMEN on lunch...

           EXT. UCLA CAMPUS - LUVALLE COMMONS - DAY

           A jillion STUDENTS dine al fresco at this outdoor eatery.  
           Chris, Andy and Noah share a table.  Noah’s on his laptop.

                                 NOAH
                        Wow.

                                 ANDY RANTAMPRIKASH
                        Whaddya got, sex tape?  Upskirt?  
                        Some lesbo action on a webcam?  
                        Even if it’s fake, I don’t care.

                                 NOAH
                        Bob’s blog.  I was gonna post a 
                        comment just to tell him he’s a 
                        douchebag, but this is actually 
                        some profound shit.  Look.

           Chris and Andy come around to read what’s on Noah’s screen.  
           They’re dubious at first, but quickly grow absorbed.  A pretty 
           GIRL in a KAPPA t-shirt notices them.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN L.A. - DAY

           Bob and Lina have turned onto Cesar Chavez and RUN past OLVERA 
           STREET and its many Mexican-Americans and TOURISTS...

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        And to think, a week ago I was 
                        worried about midterms, obsessed 
                        with Heather Bailey, applying to 
                        business school.  Much has changed.  
                        But much has yet to change, too.
           EXT. UCLA CAMPUS - LUVALLE COMMONS - MOMENTS LATER

           The Kappa Girl and a few more SORORITY GIRLS have joined Chris and 
           Andy standing behind Noah, reading Bob’s blog off his laptop.

                                 KAPPA GIRL
                        Wow.  That is so cool.  Could you 
                        forward me the link to this?

                                 OTHER SORORITY GIRLS
                        Me too. / Yeah, me too.

                                 NOAH
                        Totally!  I’m gonna need all your  
                        e-mails.  Cell phone numbers, too.  
                        Just so I can follow up.

           As the girls write their info down for Noah, LYNN (a very butch 
           lesbian girl) walks by.

                                 LYNN
                        Hey, Chris!  See ya at the meeting 
                        tonight?

                                 CHRIS
                        Uhh, meeting?  Don’t know what 
                        you’re talking about.  Stranger.

                                 LYNN
                        The meeting.  Of the Gay Lesbian 
                        Bisexual Transgender Club.  Of 
                        which you’re the Treasurer.

                                 CHRIS
                        Oh, that, yeah.  See ya there.
                             (to guys, “explaining”)
                        Lotta extra-curriculars - looks 
                        good on a grad school application.

           Andy and Noah SHRUG - that’s good enough for them.

           INT. CRAPPY TERCEL - MOVING - DAY

           Superman smokes and drives; Marilyn is studying her Orb.

                                 MARILYN MONROE
                        Okay, this is weird - I just got 
                        activity coming from UCLA.

                                 SUPERMAN
                        That makes no sense.  She wouldn’t 
                        let him go back to his apartment.  
                        Even he knows it’s too dangerous.
                                 MARILYN MONROE
                        That’s not the weird part.  Three 
                        minutes ago, another entry logged - 
                        in Chinatown.  Fifteen miles away.

                                 SUPERMAN
                        You... think they split up?

                                 MARILYN MONROE
                        She doesn’t have an Orb.
                             (then, looking)
                        Shit!  Another post.  From... New 
                        York City?  How is this possible?

                                 SUPERMAN
                        Where do you want me to go?

                                 MARILYN MONROE
                        You tell me, genius!

           Marilyn looks out the window as Superman takes a long DRAG.  
           They’re pissed at each other.

           INT. UNION STATION - DAY

           Bob sits in a chair in the train station, furiously TYPING.  
           Finally he finishes, then looks up at Lina, a few seats away.

                                 BOB
                        Okay, I’m ready to log on and post.

           Lina nods, stands.  Bob LOGS ON, then reacts to something on the 
           screen.

                                 BOB
                        Whoa.  Look at this.  I have 
                        responses!  A lot of ‘em.  And not 
                        just Noah calling me a douchebag.

                                 LINA
                        Noah?  The Apostle Noah?

                                 BOB
                        Apostle?

                                 LINA
                        One of three.  Noah, Chris, and 
                        Andy Rantamprikash are revered as 
                        the chosen and pure of heart.
                                 BOB
                        Pure of heart?  Noah is a pothead!  
                        Chris hides gay porno under my bed.  
                        And Andy seems nice - till he gets 
                        drunk.  Then it’s all pissing in 
                        laundry baskets and anti-semitism.

           Lina comes around to read what’s on the Blog.

                                 LINA
                        Wait, so these writings come from--

                                 BOB
                        Readers of the Blog.  People post 
                        comments.
                             (off blank stare)
                        Do you not have Blogs in 3008?

                                 LINA
                        Not as such.  Humanity has grown 
                        considerably less self-involved in 
                        the last thousand years.

           INT. INTELLIGENTSIA COFFEE - SILVER LAKE - DAY

           Superman and Marilyn are at the front of a long line, accosting a 
           tatted-up BARISTA.

                                 SUPERMAN
                        What the hell do you mean, people 
                        can “post comments”?

                                 BARISTA
                        It’s called Open-Source, homes.  
                        What, you never read a blog before?

           Superman and Marilyn exchange a LOOK.  The Barista gestures at the 
           long line behind them.

                                 BARISTA
                        Listen, Superman, you gonna order a 
                        coffee or not?

           Just then, Marilyn’s EYES WIDEN.  She pulls Superman aside and 
           they huddle close, looking at her Orb and WHISPERING.

                                 MARILYN MONROE
                        There’s activity right here, in 
                        this coffeehouse!

           They look up around - EVERY HIPSTER in the place is on a LAPTOP.
           INT. COMMUTER TRAIN - MOVING - DAY

           Bob and Lina sit next to each other as the WORLD SPEEDS BY their 
           window.  They gaze at the POSTINGS - dozens more by the minute.

                                 LINA
                        This is certainly unexpected.  We 
                        mistakenly thought the entire Text 
                        File was generated by you.  But of 
                        course, this makes more sense.

                                 BOB
                        It’s kinda cool, when you think 
                        about it.  I set something into 
                        motion, but the reality of it is, a 
                        thousand hands help shape this.  
                        I’d have loved to write the Great 
                        American Novel, but in a way this 
                        is better.

                                 LINA
                        You know what it means.  The Aliens 
                        cannot track your entries anymore.

                                 BOB
                        That’s awesome!

                                 LINA
                        Perhaps you know of someplace where 
                        we can make ourselves comfortable 
                        for a few days.  I haven’t had a 
                        shower since Bob-knows-when.

                                 BOB
                        I know where we can lie low, but 
                        it’s not comfortable.
                             (exhales deeply)
                        Orange County.  My parents’ house.

                                 LINA
                        Are you serious?  I get to meet 
                        Beverly and Michael Trautwig, the 
                        esteemed forebears of Bob?

                                 BOB
                        Yeah... them.

           As Bob shudders with anticipatory disgust, we CUT TO:
           INT. THE TRAUTWIG HOUSE - ORANGE COUNTY - EVENING

           This is the house where Bob grew up, a McMansion decorated with 
           more money than taste.  A horribly cheesy POSED PORTRAIT of Bob 
           and his PARENTS smiles down from above a white leather couch.

           And there they are - BEVERLY TRAUTWIG, 50s, with way too much 
           jewelry and makeup, and MICHAEL TRAUTWIG, 50s, with more “hair” 
           than he had ten years ago - seated around the dining table.

                                 MICHAEL TRAUTWIG
                        ...course, that’s what happens when 
                        you do business with the Chinks.  I 
                        tell you, they’re one step up from 
                        the dot-heads.

           Bob, wildly uncomfortable, stares at his plate as he tells Lina:

                                 BOB
                        Dad is in the plastic bobble-head 
                        business.

                                 MICHAEL TRAUTWIG
                        Correction - I am the plastic 
                        bobble-head business.

           He smiles smarmily at Lina.  His teeth are way too WHITE.

                                 LINA
                        Mr. and Mrs. Trautwig, I cannot 
                        begin to explain what an honor it 
                        is to be sitting here, in your 
                        home, sharing the evening meal with 
                        you.  You!  Parents of... Bob.

                                 BEVERLY TRAUTWIG
                        Lina.  That’s such an interesting 
                        name.  Is it Irish?

                                 LINA
                        Actually, no.  It’s short for 
                        Angelina Grapefruit Boom Boom 
                        Thelonius Shakalaka.

                                 MICHAEL TRAUTWIG
                        Oy my God.

                                 BEVERLY TRAUTWIG
                        That doesn’t sound Jewish...

                                 LINA
                        Actually, it’s Bobist.

           Bob STANDS and quickly begins clearing the table as we CUT TO:
           INT. CHEAP MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Superman has stripped down to tights, boots and a WIFE-BEATER.  
           Marilyn still wears her billowy white dress, but the blonde wig 
           is OFF.

                                 SUPERMAN
                        We have failed.  How will we ever 
                        find him now?  We have absolutely 
                        no biographical data on Bob, no 
                        known contacts other than the 
                        apostles - and there’s no chance 
                        he’ll contact them.  We have no 
                        leads.

           A beat - they’re both stumped.  Marilyn, on her Orb, scrolls 
           through the BLOG, looking for any clue.  Then, suddenly:

                                 MARILYN MONROE
                        I have an idea...

           INT. BOB’S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Lina looks around Bob’s childhood bedroom in awe.  She’s changed 
           into an old “Boy Meets World” t-shirt of Bob’s and her hair is 
           still wet from the shower.  She touches a “PARTICIPATION” trophy 
           from Little League as though it’s the Holy Grail.

                                 LINA
                        I’m speechless.  This is the 
                        definitive collection of Bob-
                        aphernalia!  I wish I could take  
                        it all back to 3008...

                                 BOB
                        Hey, I’ve been wondering about 
                        that.  When we’re all done with 
                        this “Bobism” thing, how do you  
                        get back to 3008?

                                 LINA
                             (beat)
                        That was the “second thing.”

                                 BOB
                        You mean... the Orb?

           Lina nods.  Bob absorbs this.

                                 BOB
                        Lina, why didn’t you tell me we 
                        were blowing up your ticket home?
                                 LINA
                        It wasn’t germane to our objective, 
                        which at that moment was to escape. 
                        And it might’ve compromised the 
                        mission.

                                 BOB
                        The mission?

                                 LINA
                        To protect Bobism at all costs.

                                 BOB
                        So now you’re stuck in this craphole 
                        of an era for the rest of your life?

                                 LINA
                        It’s not that bad.  2008 has its 
                        redeeming qualities.

           She smiles and LOOKS INTO HIS EYES.  She’s talking about him.   
           The MOMENT hangs heavy like that for a beat.  Bob opens his mouth 
           to SPEAK...

           ...but before he can get a word out, they’re KISSING.  They sink 
           down onto his CHILDHOOD BED, surrounded by SPORTS BOBBLE-HEADS, 
           each of which seems to be nodding “YES!”

                                 BOB
                        I’m so glad we got a chance to 
                        shower...

           INT. MICHAEL AND BEVERLY’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

           Bob’s parents are lying in bed, reading magazines.

                                 BEVERLY TRAUTWIG
                        They’re not in separate bedrooms.  
                        I can just tell.

           INT. WHITE BACKGROUND WORLD - OUT OF TIME

           Bob looks into CAMERA, a faint shit-eating grin on his face.

                                 BOB
                        Life really is a wonderful thing, 
                        you know that?  Think about it for 
                        a minute, how incredible it is to 
                        be alive.  On a planet where 
                        billions of people have come and 
                        gone... you are alive, right now.
           INT. BOB’S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

           Bob types and types, with just the WHITE GLOW from his laptop 
           illuminating the dark room.  He looks over at his BED, where LINA 
           lies sound asleep.  He smiles - still can’t believe that happened.

           He types a little more, clicks the “POST ENTRY NOW” link, then, 
           out of curiosity, clicks the link marked “FEEDBACK.”

           The FEEDBACK PAGE comes up and there are literally THOUSANDS OF 
           RESPONSES.  He scrolls down, down... a zillion WORDS fly by.  The 
           Blog has caught fire.  Bob reacts, stunned by what he’s started.

           Then one LINE catches his eye: “Posted by HeatherBailey222 9:14pm”  
           He stops scrolling and reads the POST:

           “Bob its me heather remember? blast from the past listen me & BF 
            kinda called it off/are taking a break & i’ve been reading your 
            blog it’s AMAZING! give me a call, OK?”

           Bob LAUGHS softly to himself - he’s come a long way since she was 
           the one he pined for.  Lina BLINKS AWAKE.

                                 LINA
                        Bob?  What are you doing up?

                                 BOB
                        I couldn’t sleep, so I wrote an 
                        entry.  Look at all these posts.

           Bob shows Lina the FEEDBACK PAGE.  At the bottom, it reads:
           “The Comments Section is now closed as feedback has exceeded 
            allotted server space.”  Now it’s Lina’s turn to be stunned.

                                 LINA
                        Oh my-- hang on a moment...

           Lina quickly scrolls through it again, then turns to Bob.

                                 LINA
                        You’re only ten pages away from 
                        having written all of Bobism.

                                 BOB
                        That’s fantastic!  I could knock 
                        that out tomorrow!

                                 LINA
                             (quickly)
                        No!
                             (then)
                        I mean, what’s the hurry?  Take a 
                        day off.  Enjoy Orange County.
                                 BOB
                        What are you talking about?  We’re 
                        almost done.  That’s great, right?

           There’s a SADNESS on Lina’s face she can’t hide.  Bob sees it.

                                 BOB
                        Something happens to me after I 
                        write the final entry, doesn’t it?
                             (off her silence)
                        Usually when the answer to a 
                        question like that is “no,” the 
                        person says “no” right away.

                                 LINA
                        The future is not fixed, Bob.  Your 
                        destiny is malleable.

                                 BOB
                        Yeah but every other prediction 
                        you’ve made so far has been pretty 
                        g-damn spot-on.  What happens to 
                        me, Lina??

           Lina can’t answer - doesn’t want to answer.  Finally, she breaks:

                                 LINA
                        You die.

                                 BOB
                        When?  Where?
                             (then)
                        Wait a minute, I saw it.  The 
                        candles, the flowers.  What’d you 
                        call it - LandBridge.  That’s why 
                        the Aliens drove me out there in 
                        the first place.  That’s where 
                        they... kill me.

                                 LINA
                        According to what little we know 
                        about your death, yes.  It does 
                        occur at LandBridge.

                                 BOB
                        When?  Tell me, Lina.  When?

                                 LINA
                             (beat, then softly)
                        On your 21st birthday.

                                 BOB
                        That... that’s in two days!
                                 LINA
                        I was sent back with instructions 
                        to reveal as little as possible 
                        about the immediate future.

                                 BOB
                        Oh, so you could tell me the final 
                        score of a baseball game but you 
                        couldn’t say, “hey, y’know what 
                        Bob?  Go ahead and splurge, get the 
                        extra cheese, ‘cause you die on 
                        fucking Saturday.”

                                 LINA
                        Telling you too much could’ve 
                        compromised the mission.

                                 BOB
                        Oh, so that’s all I am to you?  A 
                        mission?

           There’s a long, stinging beat.  Lina speaks through TEARS.

                                 LINA
                        Bob, I still believe your death can 
                        be avoided.  You must stay away 
                        from LandBridge at all costs, and 
                        you can still live a long and 
                        healthy life.  I have faith.

                                 BOB
                        Oh, you have “faith”?  Great.  I 
                        don’t want your faith, Lina.  I 
                        never wanted any of this!

           Bob gathers up some pillows and a blanket and STORMS OUT in a huff 
           as we DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. LIVING ROOM - THE NEXT DAY

           The sun is high in the sky as BOB SLEEPS ON THE COUCH.

                                 BEVERLY TRAUTWIG (O.S.)
                        Bob?  Bob?  Wake up, honey.

           Bob looks up to see BEVERLY standing over him.

                                 BEVERLY TRAUTWIG
                        What happened to the shiksa goddess 
                        with the disturbingly even tan?

                                 BOB
                        What?
           INT. BOB’S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Bob hurries up to his old room, only to find his BED NEATLY MADE.  
           There’s no sign of Lina except for a NOTE on his pillow.  Bob 
           picks it up and READS it:

           “I will love you for 1000 years-- A.G.B.B.T.S.”

           INT. BOB’S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - HOURS LATER

           Bob hasn’t moved in hours.  He lies on his bed, crushingly 
           depressed.  Finally he pulls out his iPhone and DIALS:

                                 BOB
                        Hey Heather, it’s me Bob.  Trautwig.  
                        Sorry to hear about your boyfriend...
                             (deep breath)
                        Listen, um, for what it’s worth?  I 
                        was really, really into you.  Really 
                        into you.  And I happen to know that 
                        if you’d given me a shot you’d have 
                        liked it quite a bit, ‘cause I uh, I 
                        recently had occasion to have 
                        intercourse with a very very 
                        attractive lady, probably a good 40 
                        percent hotter than you, and I 
                        brought her to orgasm.  Thrice.

           INT. HEATHER’S DORM ROOM - SAME TIME

           As Heather’s ANSWERING MACHINE captures the last of Bob’s message, 
           the ANGLE WIDENS to reveal HEATHER standing there, listening.

                                 BOB (OVER ANSWERING MACHINE)
                        So, there you have it.  Hat trick.  
                        Trifecta.  Coulda been you.

           The message ENDS and Heather checks the CALLER ID... then whips 
           out an ORB!!  As she does, the ANGLE WIDENS further to reveal 
           she’s standing there with SUPERMAN!

                                 HEATHER
                        The call came from a single-family 
                        residence in Orange County.  The 
                        Orb is now tracking his every move 
                        using the GPS on his own phone.

                                 SUPERMAN
                        We can be there in an hour.

                                 HEATHER
                        No, I’ll handle this myself.
                                 SUPERMAN
                        Split up?  But what if you’re not 
                        successful in eliminating him

                                 HEATHER
                        While I’m in Orange County, you 
                        will commence collections for 
                        Contingency Plan 8801-B.  We will 
                        reconnoiter at the portal.

                                 SUPERMAN
                        Contingency Plan 8801... B?

           Heather NODS, ominously.  Superman’s eyes widen.  Whatever 
           Contingency Plan 8801-B is, it’s pretty serious...

           INT. BENIHANA - EVENING

           Beverly and Michael lead a BLINDFOLDED Bob in.

                                 BOB
                        I don’t like this.  Where are you 
                        guys taking me?

                                 BEVERLY TRAUTWIG
                        You said you might not be around 
                        tomorrow for your birthday, so 
                        we’re surprising you.  Ready?

           Bob’s parents exchange a nod, then remove the blindfold to reveal 
           they’re in a crowded, Orange County BENIHANA.  Andy, Chris and 
           Noah stand in the bar area with the four KAPPAS we met earlier.

                                 ANDY RANTAMPRIKASH
                        Happy birthday, biyotch!

                                 NOAH
                        Your folks said they were paying, 
                        so we brought dates for all of us.

                                 KAPPA GIRL
                        Hey, Bob.  I like your blog.

           The Kappa smiles flirtatiously at Bob as a HOSTESS leads the  
           group toward their table.  Chris and Bob hang back.

                                 CHRIS
                        So, did you tell your parents about 
                        the whole identity theft thing?  
                        Because I can’t imagine they’d have 
                        been cool with that.
                                 BOB
                        Actually... turns out it wasn’t 
                        identity theft.  It was something 
                        else.

                                 CHRIS
                        Aliens and a woman from the future?

           Chris looks into Bob’s eyes for a long beat.  Finally:

                                 BOB
                        Yes.

           Another long beat, then:

                                 CHRIS
                        Bob, when you’re ready to tell me 
                        the truth, I’m here for you.

           Chris walks ahead.  Bob watches him go.  And sighs.

           INT. HEATHER’S BMW - DUSK

           Heather’s BMW is crawling in Friday rush hour traffic on the 405.

                                 HEATHER
                        Son of a bitch!  What is with this 
                        freakin’ traffic?!

           From her ORB, sitting on the passenger seat, Superman’s VOICE can 
           be heard as if on SPEAKER PHONE.

                                 SUPERMAN (OVER ORB)
                        If you’d let me come with, we could 
                        be in the carpool lane right now.

                                 HEATHER
                        Shut up!

           INT. BENIHANA - A SHORT WHILE LATER

           The Trautwig party of ten is now seated at a table with a YOUNG 
           CHILD and his PARENTS, who seem vaguely annoyed by the group’s 
           rowdiness.  Noah leads the roommates in a round of SAKE BOMBS.

                                 NOAH
                        Alright everybody, one... two... 
                        three!  MASI OKA!

                                 ANDY/CHRIS/GIRLS
                        MASI OKA!!!
           The roomies and the Sorority Girls drop SAKE CUPS into their beer 
           glasses, then chug it all down.  Bob sips his half-heartedly.  
           Everyone else watches, horrified.

           The obviously Mexican CHEF, whose nametag reads “SHISITO HATORI,” 
           puts a shrimp on his spatula.

                                 SHISITO HATORI
                        Okay, birthday boy.  You ready?

                                 ANDY RANTAMPRIKASH
                        Whoa whoa whoa, hang on.
                             (off Chef’s nametag)
                        “Shisito Hatori”?  What’s your real 
                        name?

                                 SHISITO HATORI
                             (lying badly)
                        That is my real name.

                                 ANDY RANTAMPRIKASH
                        Yeah, and Andy’s my real name.

                                 NOAH
                        What?  Dude, what is your real 
                        name?

                                 ANDY RANTAMPRIKASH
                        Long story.

                                 SHISITO HATORI
                        Cut me some slack, okay ese?
                             (then, to Bob)
                        Lean your head back, open your 
                        mouth and close your eyes.

           Bob does.  The Chef turns his back and flips the SHRIMP over his 
           own head, directly into Bob’s OPEN MOUTH.

           Just before the SHRIMP lands in Bob’s mouth, the HOSTESS snaps a 
           PHOTO just as a GREASE FIRE FLARES one table over.

           FREEZE FRAME:  

           Bob, flanked by 12 people, including his “apostles.”  His arms are 
           out slightly and his head is leaned back, the shrimp an inch above 
           his mouth and the grease fire creating a HALO EFFECT around him.

           BACK TO LIVE ACTION:

           The SHRIMP lands in Bob’s mouth.  Everyone APPLAUDS.  The Hostess 
           prints out the digital photo from her camera and hands it to Bob.
                                 HOSTESS
                        Happy birthday from Benihana.

           She LEAVES.  Bob CHEWS the shrimp, then looks around the table.

           And then the WORLD SLOWS DOWN, but just for Bob.  The SCENE GOES 
           SILENT as he looks around:

           The Chef CHOPS with lightning-speed.  Noah FLIRTS with the Kappas.  
           Chris looks LONGINGLY at Andy.  Beverly and Michael BICKER.

           Bob SMILES a strange half-smile - if this were to be his Last 
           Supper, it’d be a good way to go out.  Just then:

                                 NOAH
                        Dude... is that Heather Bailey?

           Bob LOOKS UP.  There, through the tumult of the busy Benihana, is 
           HEATHER, coming towards him in SUPER SLO-MO.  She smiles at him.

                                 BOB
                        No way.  She got my message...

           Bob’s expression changes - first to AMAZEMENT, then to DREAD.  
           Heather’s EYES go dead as, in one fluid motion, she reaches into 
           her jacket and pulls out an enormous .45 AUTOMATIC.

           We WHIP back to REAL TIME as ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.

           Heather aims and FIRES - but Bob’s already HIT THE DECK.  The 
           bullet WHIZZES past Shisito Hatori’s shoulder and SLAMS into the 
           back of the chair Bob just vacated.

                                 SHISITO HATORI
                        ¡Aye, dios mio!

           SHISITO HATORI DIVES out of the way.  The spatula he’d been using 
           goes straight up, sending FRIED RICE everywhere.

           As the fried rice rains like delicious savory confetti, BOB CRAWLS 
           under the table.  Noah, Chris and Andy are already down there.  

                                 NOAH
                        Dude!  The hottest piece of ass in 
                        school is trying to kill us!  
                        What’s that all about?

                                 BOB
                        It’s me she’s after.  You stay 
                        here.  I’ll deal with her.

           Bob peeks out: GUNFIRE EXPLODES all around!  HEATHER keeps coming, 
           ejecting the spent shell nonchalantly.  We suddenly WHIP PAN to:
           A BUS BOY

           One table over, triangulated between the party of Bob and the 
           rapidly-approaching Alien chick - LOOKS UP. 

           Despite the crazy Japanese get-up and the hat into which her hair 
           is piled, we recognize her instantly: it’s LINA.

           She reaches behind her, CLEANLY PICKS the enormous knife out of 
           Hatori’s hand, and without hesitating WHIPS the knife across the 
           room at HEATHER, who’s about to take another shot.

           The knife goes CLEANLY THROUGH HEATHER’S THROAT and she drops like 
           a sack of potatoes.  Patrons SCREAM.  Benihana goes up for grabs.

                                 LINA
                        Bob, get out of here!  There’s a 
                        back-exit in the kitchen.  RUN!

           Bob SPRINTS for the kitchen.  LINA grabs another huge knife and 
           grimly makes her way toward HEATHER as frightened patrons cower.

           A burly MARINE-TYPE with buzzcut decides to be a hero.  He grabs 
           Lina from behind, pinning her knife-hand to her side.

           But before he even knows what hit him, Lina quickly jerks down and 
           then UP, slamming the top of her skull into his chin.  It’s just 
           enough to loosen his grip.

           She reaches back with two fingers and grabs his nostrils like a 
           bowling ball.  Using this grip, plus a powerful lower body THRUST, 
           she HURLS the guy through the air, until he lands on...

           A HOT FLAT-TOP GRILL

           ...which COOKS the back of his leather jacket with a loud SIZZLE.

           Meanwhile, Heather STIRS, struggles to her feet, and does that 
           quick “shake the cobwebs out” move.  As she does, her face briefly 
           toggles back-and-forth between HUMAN and ALIEN. 

           Nobody in the restaurant sees this... except Bob’s PARENTS and 
           ROOMMATES.  Their jaws nearly drop into their miso soups.

                                 CHRIS
                        Did she just morph a little bit?  
                        I think she morphed!

           Heather calmly PULLS THE KNIFE OUT OF HER THROAT.  Lina DIVES out 
           of the way as Heather FIRES, barely missing her.  Lina TAKES OFF 
           for...
           THE KITCHEN

           And RUNS FAST through the narrow space.  She DROPS to her hands 
           and knees just as Heather ENTERS from the restaurant.

           The COOKS and DISHWASHERS perk up - no two hotter chicks have ever 
           been back here.  Heather scans the kitchen for Lina, but...

           ...LINA, below the radar, CRAWLS toward the back door, grabs a 
           HUGE VAT OF GREASE, and BACKS OUT, spilling the grease all over 
           the floor behind her.  Then she STANDS.  Seeing Lina, Heather 
           SPRINTS for the back door.

           EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           Lina BURSTS through the door into the cool night air outside.  
           Bob, who’s hiding behind a dumpster, calls out:

                                 BOB
                        Lina!

                                 LINA
                        Get down!

           Lina quickly side-steps just as HEATHER reaches the back door at a 
           full run, hits the grease and EATS SHIT, skidding at high-speed 
           until she CATAPULTS forward into THE ALLEY... 

           ...where she goes SPRAWLING across the pavement.  Her gun SKITTERS 
           towards Bob, and he wastes no time in grabbing it.

           Lina POUNCES on Heather from behind, flips her over, and presses 
           the point of her huge KNIFE to Heather’s FOREHEAD, just above the 
           midpoint between her eyes.

                                 LINA
                        Move a muscle and you’re dead.

           Heather defiantly SPITS in Lina’s face.  Lina turns the knife 
           around and SLAMS the butt of it into Heather’s forehead, knocking 
           the Alien OUT COLD.  She then turns to Bob.

                                 LINA
                        Give me your iPhone.

           Bob does.  Lina SMASHES it to bits under her heel.

                                 BOB
                        I paid 600 bucks for that.  Didn’t 
                        even get the rebate...
                                 LINA
                        They were using it to track you.
                             (then)
                        We need to find a safe place to 
                        interrogate the Alien.  Someplace 
                        we know will be empty.

           They look across the street - above a darkened storefront, a SIGN 
           reads:  “AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY CENTER OF  ORANGE COUNTY.”

           INT. AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY CENTER OF ORANGE COUNTY - NIGHT

           It’s after-hours at the deserted A.A.C.C.O.O.C, but that hardly 
           matters - it doesn’t look like anybody’s been here in weeks.  

           Bob, his parents, the roommates, and the Sorority Girls sit around 
           under a smiling picture of BARACK OBAMA, awkwardly listening to 
           HORRIBLY VIOLENT NOISES coming from the next room.  Finally:

                                 MICHAEL TRAUTWIG
                        Explain to me again, the Alien is 
                        occupying this broad’s body?

                                 NOAH
                        Heather Bailey.  She’s a Tri-Delt.  
                        Word on campus is her body gets 
                        occupied with alarming frequency.

                                 ANDY RANTAMPRIKASH
                        Boom!

           Andy FIST-BUMPS Noah.  Bob shoots them a look to knock it off.

                                 MICHAEL TRAUTWIG
                        The part I don’t buy is this crap 
                        about Bob being Jesus.  I mean, 
                        this is a kid who couldn’t figure 
                        out how to use a fork until I don’t 
                        wanna tell you when.

                                 BOB
                        Dad?!  How many times I gotta tell 
                        you, I’m not Jesus.  It’s not a 
                        religion, okay?  Stop saying Jesus.

                                 BEVERLY TRAUTWIG
                        Good, because Jesus probably didn’t 
                        hide a stash of pornography under--

                                 BOB
                        Mom!
                                 BEVERLY TRAUTWIG
                        The afghan he got from his grammy.

                                 BOB
                        O-kay.

           A long beat as the roommates and girls try not to laugh.  
           Thankfully, LINA EMERGES from the next room.

                                 LINA
                        She won’t reveal the location of 
                        her partner.  But she says she’ll 
                        tell you, Bob.  If she can talk to 
                        you alone.

                                 BOB
                        Okay.  Let’s do this.
                             (stands, then)
                        Do you have her Orb?

                                 LINA
                        Yes.

                                 BOB
                        Could you, like, show it to my 
                        parents?  Let ‘em see the giant Bob 
                        building.  Something.

           INT. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Bob tentatively enters the EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR’S OFFICE.  There 
           sits a defiant Heather, securely tied to a chair.

                                 BOB
                        Um... hey, Heather.

                                 HEATHER
                        My name is not Heather.  It is--

           She produces an UNEARTHLY SERIES OF PIERCING WHISTLES.

                                 BOB
                        Okay, I’m not sure I can pronounce 
                        that correctly, so--

                                 HEATHER
                        If you post the Final Entry, your 
                        girlfriend will die.

                                 BOB
                        What?
                                 HEATHER
                        If Bobism goes online in its 
                        complete form, my partner has 
                        instructions to return to 3008 with 
                        a dirty bomb powerful enough to 
                        destroy humanity.

           Bob is stung by this, but he maintains an air of false bravado.

                                 BOB
                        Fine.  Lina can stay here with me.

                                 HEATHER
                        Not for long.  Her lungs aren’t 
                        equipped to handle present-day 
                        pollution levels.  Unless she gets 
                        back home, she can only survive 
                        another month.  Two, tops.

           This time it’s harder for Bob to hide his utter shock.  Beat.

                                 BOB
                        You’re lying.

                                 HEATHER
                        Am I?  Suit yourself.  Find out the 
                        hard way.  Oh, by the way, this is 
                        Heather speaking now -- I never 
                        liked you.  I was just using you 
                        for your Econ notes.

                                 BOB
                        What?!  Is this really Heather?

                                 HEATHER
                             (beat)
                        No.

           A beat, then Bob goes apeshit, grabbing her by the shoulders.

                                 BOB
                        You bitch!  I’ll kill you!

                                 HEATHER
                        You don’t have the guts!

                                 BOB
                        Oh, I don’t?

           He grabs a large KNIFE just as LINA BURSTS IN from the next room.

                                 LINA
                        Bob!  She’s no good to us dead!
                                 BOB
                        I don’t care.  This lizard needs to 
                        die.

           He walks toward Heather, brandishing the knife. 

                                 LINA
                        No!  If you miss, even by a 
                        centimeter, the Alien will release 
                        a toxin strong enough to kill us 
                        all.  Kind of like a blowfish.

           A beat, then Bob backs down, DROPPING the knife.

                                 BOB
                        Are there any other ways in which 
                        these guys are like seafood?

           EXT. LAUREL CANYON DOG PARK - NIGHT

           A PICKUP TRUCK pulls up to the locked gate of the Laurel Canyon 
           Dog Park and SUPERMAN steps out of it.  He uses his Orb to CUT 
           THROUGH the chain that secures the gate, then heads to a DUMPSTER.

           INT. AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY CENTER OF ORANGE COUNTY - LATER

           Lina stands outside the door to the Executive Director’s office, 
           addressing the GUYS, the GIRLS, the TRAUTWIGS.  Everybody holds a 
           spray-bottle of MR. CLEAN in each hand.

                                 LINA
                        I want two people at each entrance. 
                        If you see anything out of the 
                        ordinary, start spraying.

           Everyone nods, “check,” and they all fan out to their posts, 
           leaving Bob and Lina alone.  A beat.

                                 LINA
                        Are you ready to write?

                                 BOB
                        Is it true what Heather said?  That 
                        you can only live another month or 
                        two in 2008?

           Lina simply NODS.  Bob absorbs this.

                                 BOB
                        So when you blew up your Orb to save 
                        me, you knew it meant you’d die.
                                 LINA
                        Yes.  And I’d do it again.

           Bob is floored by the sacrifice she was willing to make.  Then:

                                 BOB
                        I’ll write the Final Entry, on one 
                        condition.

                                 LINA
                        What’s that?

                                 BOB
                        I’ll tell you after I write it.

           Bob heads into...

           INT. ANOTHER OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Bob pulls his laptop from its case and sits at a desk in an office 
           across the hall.  He opens the laptop, takes a deep breath.

           Over black, a TITLE CARD:  “The Parable of the Orange Soda.”

           INT. WHITE BACKGROUND WORLD - OUT OF TIME

           Bob, in the all-white, speaks directly to CAMERA.

                                 BOB
                        You know those vending machines 
                        where you choose your soda, then 
                        the cup comes down and the drink 
                        shoots in with some little ice 
                        cubes?  Yeah.  Well, a couple weeks 
                        ago I tried to buy an Orange Soda 
                        from one of those...

           FLASHBACK - CAMPUS - A FEW WEEKS AGO

           The scene we saw at the start of the movie - Bob, at the vending 
           machine, feeds a bill into the slot, makes his selection...

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        It all seemed to be going fine 
                        until my orange soda started 
                        shooting down... without a cup.

                                 BOB
                        NO!!!
           As we saw the first time around, other STUDENTS turn and STARE.  
           But this time, the scene continues...

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        At first I froze - I didn’t know 
                        what to do.  Then, something inside 
                        me just... took over.

           Suddenly, Bob CUPS HIS HANDS in an attempt to CATCH the soda!

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        My hands shot into the stream, 
                        senselessly trying to capture as 
                        much of the soda as they could.  
                        Then, as other would-be vendees 
                        looked on, I frantically began to 
                        lick my dripping hands free of all 
                        the delicious Orange Soda my tongue 
                        could catch.

           Bob LAPS at his hands like a dog.  Some laugh; others turn away, 
           disgusted.

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        I licked and licked until there was 
                        nothing but spit left on my hands.  
                        My soda had been snatched away in 
                        the blink of an eye, the lack of a 
                        cup.

           As Bob cleans up the mess, first dabbing at his own clothes, then 
           bending down to wipe up the pavement, something OCCURS TO HIM.

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        And then I realized something.  
                        Maybe not right then, but in the 
                        two weeks since...

           INT. WHITE BACKGROUND WORLD - OUT OF TIME

           Bob, in the all-white, speaks to CAMERA.

                                 BOB
                        We all assume we’re gonna get a 
                        full cup, or a half-full cup, or at 
                        least half-empty... but maybe life 
                         doesn’t provide us with a cup at 
                         all.  Maybe we should be happy to 
                        lick from our hands whatever we can 
                        capture.  Especially considering 
                        the pocket change they’re asking 
                        for the whole deal.
           INT. AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY CENTER - DISSOLVES - NIGHT

           In DISSOLVES, we look around: the TRAUTWIGS man the front door... 
           CHRIS and ANDY man the back door... LINA covers the Executive 
           Director’s office... NOAH socializes with the Kappas...

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        There’s this Latin term, “Memento 
                        Mori.”  It means “Remember Death,” 
                        but its connotation is “Remember 
                         Your Own Death.”  As in, even 
                        though it hasn’t happened yet, 
                        remember that it will.  Plus it’s 
                        Latin, so you know it must be 
                        smart.  I’m not saying “Live each 
                        day like it’s your last” - that’s 
                        cliché.  Good rule of thumb: Once 
                        it’s on a coffee mug, it’s probably 
                        not a rule to live by.  Also 
                        useless is that poster with the cat 
                        that says “Hang in There, Baby.”

           INT. ANOTHER OFFICE - SAME TIME

           At his laptop, BOB TYPES furiously, really in a zone.

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        But maybe it’s just “Live Each Day.”  
                        I like that.  Live Each Day.

           Bob types for a while longer.  Finally he SITS BACK.

           INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Bob pokes his head out and addresses Lina.

                                 BOB
                        I’m ready to post.  But I want you 
                        to read it first.

           Lina NODS, then pulls NOAH from the stairs where he’s socializing.    
           She drags him to the OFFICE where Heather is tied up.

                                 LINA
                        Stand right outside this door.  
                        Don’t let her out of your sight.  
                        Don’t speak to her, don’t touch 
                        her.  I’ll be back in two minutes.

           Lina leaves.  A long beat, then Heather SMILES at Noah.

                                 HEATHER
                        You’re cute.
           INT. ANOTHER OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Lina is reading Bob’s Final Entry off the laptop screen.  We 
           PUSH IN on the SCREEN to read along:

           “...if I could leave you with just one thing, it would be this: 
            HAVE FAITH.  Not just in others - have faith in yourself.  And 
            know that you have it in you to change the world.”

           Lina is moved nearly to tears.

                                 LINA
                        That’s it, exactly.  To the comma.

                                 BOB
                        You know it all by heart?

                                 LINA
                        I have all along.  I’ve read each 
                        word a thousand times.

           Bob laughs, amazed.  Lina looks at the CLOCK - it’s 12:01 a.m.

                                 LINA
                        Happy birthday.

                                 BOB
                        Thanks.

           They smile at each other.  They KISS.  And just then...

           CRASH!

           Like, really LOUD.  They hurry to the window in time to see:

           Beverly’s JAGUAR SPEEDING OFF!  Bob and Lina rush into...

           INT. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Noah lies in an awkward heap on the floor, his shirt and pants 
           open to reveal a chubby belly and threadbare boxer shorts.  He has 
           a nasty cut above his eye.

           The ANGLE WIDENS to reveal HUMAN HEATHER, lying on the floor in 
           a sexy black bra, unconscious.  A sickening green OOZE trails 
           out of her ear, across the floor towards the busted-open WINDOW.

                                 BOB
                        Noah!  Dude, what happened?!
                                 LINA
                        Isn’t it somewhat obvious what 
                        happened?

                             (barely conscious)
                        I regret nothing.

                        It took the Orb!  Bob, go back into 
                        your room.  Post the entry.  NOW!!

           INT. ANOTHER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Bob RUNS back to his laptop (LINA right behind him), hits “POST.”  
           The laptop screen READS:  “YOU ARE NOT CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET.”

                                 LINA
                        Bobdammit!  I was afraid they would 
                        resort to this.

                                 BOB
                        To what?  They broke the internet?

                                 LINA
                        The Orb can be hacked in such a way 
                        that it’s capable of shutting down 
                        all the servers in the area.

                                 BOB
                        How big an area?  Can’t we just 
                        take the laptop, drive across town--

                                 LINA
                        The entire Southwest region.  A 
                        radius of at least 600 miles.

                                 BOB
                        That’s a big area.

                                 LINA
                        The only way we can get the servers 
                        back up is with that Orb.

                                 BOB
                        Well, it’s in my mom’s Jag headed 
                        God knows where.

                                 LINA
                        Oh, I know where they’re headed...

           Lina NODS, gravely.  Noah, Andy and Chris have clustered in the 
           doorway, the Kappa Girls behind them in the hallway.

                                 CHRIS
                        What’s LandBridge?

                                 BOB
                        It’s where I die.  Potentially.

                                 NOAH
                        That sucks.

                                 BOB
                        Lina, I’m coming with you.

                                 LINA
                        No.  Absolutely not.

                                 BOB
                        You read what I wrote.  I’m not 
                        afraid, Lina.  I’ve lived more in 
                        the last two weeks than I did in my 
                        first twenty years.

                                 NOAH
                        It’s true.  He has.
                             (off Bob’s glare)
                        Sorry.  Go on.

                                 BOB
                        Lina, you were willing to die for 
                        me.  I’m willing to die for you.
                        Besides, that was my one condition.

                                 ANDY RANTAMPRIKASH
                        If Bob’s going, I’m going too.

                        So am I.

                                 NOAH
                        Me too.

           The Kappa Girls fidget nervously.

                                 KAPPA GIRL
                        We kinda don’t know you guys that

           EXT. THE TRAUTWIG HOUSE - NIGHT

           Bob, Lina and the guys are piling into Mr. Trautwig’s ESCALADE 
           as Beverly and Michael look on.

                                 BEVERLY TRAUTWIG
                        Okay, kids.  Do you have everything 
                        you need to kill the Aliens and 
                        save the future?

                                 LINA
                        Yes, Mrs. Trautwig, and thank you 
                        for everything.

                                 BEVERLY TRAUTWIG
                        Bobby, you gonna be warm enough?

                                 BOB
                        Mom.  I’m fine.  Just make sure Dad 
                        posts my entry the minute the 
                        internet comes back up.

                                 MICHAEL TRAUTWIG
                        Okay, I’m just worried I might hit 
                        the wrong button and lose the whole 
                        religion.

                                 BOB
                        Not a religion...

           Lina holds up a FLASH DRIVE.

                                 LINA
                        Don’t worry.  We have a backup copy 
                        on this Flash Drive just in case.

                                 BOB
                        Well, Mom, Dad.  Guess this is it.  
                        It’s possible I might never see you 
                        again so um, thanks for raising me.

                                 BEVERLY TRAUTWIG
                        Bobby, honey, just please promise 
                        me... you’ll get that Jaguar back.  
                        I love that Jaguar.

                                 BOB
                        Yyyyep.

           Bob steels himself, then DRIVES AWAY.  Beverly turns to Michael.

                                 BEVERLY TRAUTWIG
                        Did you think he had this in him?
                                 MICHAEL TRAUTWIG
                        You kidding me?  I was just hoping 
                        he’d get into business school.  Get 
                        a job working for some Orientals.

           INT. ESCALADE - MOVING - NIGHT

           Bob drives, and Lina sits in the passenger seat of the huge SUV.  
           Noah, Andy and Chris sit in the back.

                                 BOB
                        So all we gotta do is capture their 
                        Orb, get the internet back up and 
                        running, prevent them from bringing 
                        the dirty bomb through the time 
                        travel portal to wipe out the human 
                        race of the future, then get Lina 
                        back to 3008 so her lungs don’t 
                        collapse from all the crap in 
                        today’s air.

                        You have a ballpark figure for when 
                        you think we might be done?  I have 
                        a midterm at like three.

                                 LINA
                        What I still don’t understand is 
                        what they’re planning for this 
                        dirty bomb.  The Aliens have long 
                        since developed a sophisticated 
                        trigger mechanism for one, but the 
                        fuel source doesn’t exist in 3008.

                                 BOB
                        What’s the fuel source?

                                 LINA
                        A combination of methyl indol, 
                        C9H9N, and chromic oxide, Cr2O3.  
                        Both of which can be found in--

                                 ANDY RANTAMPRIKASH
                        Dogshit.
                             (off looks)
                        What?  I’m a Chem major.  Stop 
                        looking at me like I’m a terrorist.

                                 LINA
                        That’s the thing.  A thousand years 
                        from now, there are no dogs.
                                 CHRIS
                        But right now, there are.  Lots of 
                        ‘em.

                                 BOB
                        So that’s the backup plan - even if 
                        we manage to post the Final Entry, 
                        they’ll smuggle the dogshit back to 
                        3008 and destroy the human race.  
                        Bobism won’t matter.

                                 ANDY RANTAMPRIKASH
                        Yeah.  Even really awesome 
                        philosophical tenets are no match 
                        for a dogshit-powered dirty bomb.

           INT./EXT. “KATHY’S KENNEL” DOG HOTEL - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

           One of those places people leave their dogs when they go out of 
           town.  As SUPERMAN walks through the place, the caged DOGS GO 
           CRAZY.  He heads out back and finds what he’s looking for: THE 
           DUMPSTER.  He flips the lid open and INHALES deeply.

                                 SUPERMAN
                        Mm.  Smells like victory.

           EXT. LANDBRIDGE - DAWN

           The SUN RISES over Landbridge just as the Escalade crests a ridge, 
           affording us a sweeping VIEW of the valley below.

           A vast TENT CITY has sprung up, with thousands of CAMPSITES 
           arranged in such a way as to suggest in a festival of some sort.

                                 LINA
                        What in Bob’s name is that?

                                 CHRIS
                        It’s called Bending Man.  It’s a 
                        gay camping odyssey out here in the 
                        desert.  Takes place every April.

                                 NOAH
                        Dude, how do you even know about 
                        shit like this?

                                 CHRIS
                        Oh, y’know, you read the LA Weekly, 
                        they have a list of concerts, 
                        festivals, that kinda thing...

           Noah and Andy SHRUG - that’s good enough for them.  Long beat.
                                 CHRIS
                        No.  You know what?  I’ve been 
                        reading Bob’s religion, and he’s 
                        right.  Life’s too short.
                             (deep breath)
                        Guys... I’m gay.

           A long beat as Noah and Andy’s world is rocked.  They stare at 
           Chris and he meets their gaze, honest for the first time in his 
           life.  Another beat... then they BURST OUT LAUGHING!

                                 NOAH
                        Oh man!  You totally had me!

                                 ANDY RANTAMPRIKASH
                        Don’t joke like that, ya ball-
                        licker!

           As Andy and Noah continue to LAUGH, Bob turns to Lina.

                                 BOB
                        How will we ever find the Aliens in 
                        that huge crowd?

                                 LINA
                        Don’t worry.  Even among thousands 
                        of humans, two extra-terrestrials 
                        should be easy to spot.

           EXT. “BENDING MAN” FESTIVAL - MORNING

           It’s later in the morning and scores of GAY CAMPERS are now up and 
           about, in all manner of flamboyant get-ups: VEGAS SHOWGIRLS... 
           LEATHER-CLAD BIKERS... some are even dressed as ALIENS.

                                 LINA
                        Okay, check that.  Maybe the Aliens 
                        can blend in.

                                 BOB
                        Uh-oh.  Even for this place, that 
                        looks off.

           Bob’s points off at a cluster of GAY CAMPERS gathered in a circle, 
           cheering as they watch...

           SUPERMAN!  Although the R-rated bits are obscured by onlookers, 
           it’s clear he is MAKING SWEET LOVE to the horrible, SCALY ALIEN!

                                 LINA
                        Oh no, this is terrible!
                                 BOB
                        Every time you say that, things get 
                        way more complicated for us.

                                 LINA
                        They’ve gotten desperate!  They’re 
                        going to copulate and bury eggs...
                             (then)
                        Of course.  It all makes sense!
                        This is how they got here!  This is 
                        why we have aliens in the future!

                                 BOB
                        Because of a gay festival?

                                 LINA
                        Yes!  The gestation period for 
                        Alien eggs is a thousand years.  It 
                        was always a great mystery how the 
                        Aliens arrived on earth.  There was 
                        never an invasion from outer space - 
                        they just... showed up one day.

                                 CHRIS
                        Hang on.  So you’re saying they 
                        show up in the future because of 
                        eggs they lay today, but they’re 
                        only here today... because they 
                        travelled back in time from the 
                        future?

                                 LINA
                        Yes.

                                 CHRIS
                        That makes no sense!  None!

           Noah and Andy just watch, transfixed, as the Aliens copulate.

                                 NOAH
                        How come I’m hard as a rock right 
                        now?

                                 BOB
                        Why are we just standing here?  
                        Let’s get ‘em!

           Bob pulls a HUGE KNIFE and rushes FORWARD.  Lina STOPS him.

                                 LINA
                        No!  After the mating ritual is 
                        complete, the male alien--
           Suddenly, a BIG SMILE spreads across Superman’s face and all the 
           onlookers gathered round FALL DOWN DEAD.  Then, so does SUPERMAN.

                                 LINA
                        --releases a poison gas, then dies.

                                 ANDY RANTAMPRIKASH
                        That’s harsh.

                                 LINA
                        That’s not all...

           The female Alien then DEVOURS SUPERMAN, sucking his slimy  
           ENTRAILS through her many rows of horrifying TEETH.

                                 NOAH
                        Okay, that’s the worst thing I’ve 
                        ever seen.  And yet, still hard.

                                 BOB
                        No, it’s great!  It means we only 
                        have one alien to kill.

                                 LINA
                        No, still terrible.  When a female 
                        alien is gestating, she becomes ten 
                        times more ferocious.  She also 
                        becomes ten times more...

                                 BOB
                        More what?

           Since Bob is turned to face Lina, only he cannot see what she, 
           Noah, Andy and Chris are now STARING at in ABJECT FEAR.

           The FEMALE ALIEN now TOWERS over Bending Man!  Gays SCATTER!

                                 LINA
                        More large!

           Andy, Chris and Noah hold their ground for about a second... then 
           RUN!  The giant Alien heads for the PICKUP TRUCK full of dogshit.

                                 LINA
                        Oh no!  She intends to take the 
                        feces to the future!

           As the Alien picks the truck up with both hands, Bob LOOKS -  
           lying there, next to Superman’s bloody cape, is an ORB!

                                 BOB
                        The Orb!  Superman dropped his Orb!
           Bob takes off SPRINTING for the Orb.

                                 LINA
                        Bob, no!  Stop!

           But on BOB RACES.  Seeing him, the Alien DROPS THE TRUCK, but Bob 
           gets to the ORB a step ahead of her.  He SNATCHES it and DIVES 
           between two rocks.

           The truck lands, sending DOGSHIT SPLATTERING EVERYWHERE.  The 
           Alien reaches for Bob, but he’s wedged between the rocks.  She 
           jams her finger, HOWLING in pain.

           She sucks on her throbbing finger, but it has some dogshit on it 
           so it tastes horrible.  She spits, disgusted.  Bob RUNS off!

           BEHIND A ROCK

           Andy, Noah and Chris, hiding from the Alien, MAKE SMALL TALK.

                                 NOAH
                        So if your name’s not really 
                        Andy... what is it?

                                 ANDY RANTAMPRIKASH
                        Okay, here’s the deal.  My parents 
                        were expecting twins.  They were 
                        gonna call ‘em Dinesh and Maheesh.  
                        When triplets came out, they 
                        couldn’t think of another name, so 
                        they went with “Dinesh, Ampersand, 
                        Maheesh.”

                                 CHRIS
                        Your real name is Ampersand?

                                 ANDY RANTAMPRIKASH
                        Yeah.  Classic “Middle Child” 
                        story.

                                 NOAH
                             (beat)
                        No.  It’s really not.

           BOB

           Runs as fast as he can, but the Alien’s legs are so long, she 
           catches up to him in just a few strides.  When she does, she  
           GRABS him roughly.  He’s got the Orb... but she’s got him!

                                 LINA
                        No!!
           The Alien lifts Bob to her mouth, salivating with anticipation.  
           Bob, trapped in her giant fist, calmly opens a panel on the Orb, 
           revealing the compartment inside that houses... THE RED BUTTON!

           The Alien opens her grotesque mouth, revealing row after row of 
           SHARP TEETH.  But Bob stays calm.  At the last possible moment, 
           he pushes the button and HEAVES THE ORB right up the Alien’s NOSE!

           It goes way, WAY up and LODGES there.  The Alien reacts.  It 
           starts to shake and wheeze... then it SNEEZES violently.

           The sneeze causes it to involuntarily lift Bob to its nose.  The 
           sheer force of the sneeze PROPELS Bob out of the Alien’s hand and 
           THROUGH THE AIR.

           Bob LANDS with a THUD on the desert sand.  He doesn’t move.

                                 LINA
                        Oh, Bob.  Oh, BOB!

           And then, as the Alien starts doing another pre-sneeze inhale...

                                 ALIEN
                        Ah... AHHH...

           HER HEAD EXPLODES!

           Alien brains, snot, and dog crap RAIN DOWN on the desert.  One 
           GAY CAMPER turns to another.  

                                 GAY CAMPER
                        Best... acid... ever.

           LINA wrenches the last remaining ORB from the giant Alien’s cold, 
           dead HAND and presses a couple BUTTONS on it.

           INT. BOB’S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - SAME TIME

           Beverly is fast asleep on Bob’s bed.  Michael, exhausted, sits at 
           Bob’s laptop, hitting “POST” for the umpteenth time.  Finally, 
           this time it GOES THROUGH.

                                 MICHAEL TRAUTWIG
                        Oh, look at that.  It worked.

           Michael looks over at the bed to make sure Beverly’s asleep, then 
           opens up a PORNO WEBSITE.  He grabs some Kleenex.
           EXT. “BENDING MAN” FESTIVAL - CONTINUOUS

           Lina now kneels at Bob’s side.  He’s mortally injured.  It takes 
           nearly all the energy he has to open his eyes and look up at Lina.

                                 BOB
                        That was kinda cool, huh?

           Lina nods, breaking down.  She holds out the Orb to him.

                                 LINA
                        Bob, darling, take this.

                                 BOB
                        I don’t think that’s gonna heal 
                        me.  I’m pretty sure internal 
                        organs are involved.

                                 LINA
                        No, it can transport you to 3008.  
                        The doctors there are quite good.

                                 BOB
                        And there are lots of hotties there 
                        who worship me.

           Lina LAUGHS through tears.

                                 BOB
                        No.  I’m not gonna make it, Lina, 
                        we both know that.  Go.  There’s 
                        only one Orb left - you need it 
                        more than I do.  And if you stay to 
                        watch me die, I’ll kill you.
                             (fading fast)
                        Tell ‘em... tell ‘em I loved you.

           Bob’s EYES CLOSE.  Noah, Chris and Andy have now gathered around 
           and comfort Lina, who’s really CRYING pretty hard.

           She stands, pained, and begins walking toward the SANDSTONE ROCK 
           FORMATION, clutching the ORB.  The crowd of GAY CAMPERS parts to 
           let her through, and when she gets there... SHE DISAPPEARS.

           FROM ABOVE, we see Bob lying peacefully on the desert floor, 
           surrounded by his friends, and THE SCREEN GOES WHITE.

           TITLE CARD:  “Six Months Later.”

           At first, the WORLD IS ALL WHITE.  Then, IMAGES come into focus.  
           Shapeless forms, which SHARPEN until we realize: they are Andy, 
           Chris and Noah, looking down into CAMERA.
                                 NOAH
                        That was one hell of a long coma.

           ANOTHER ANGLE reveals Bob, lying in a hospital bed, waking up.

                                 BOB
                        I didn’t die??

                                 ANDY RANTAMPRIKASH
                        For the purposes of the internet 
                        you sure as shit did.  We posted a 
                        note on your blog, talking about 
                        what happened, how you “died” out 
                        in the desert, in front of all 
                        those witnesses... dude, once you 
                        became a martyr, that shit blew up 
                        in earnest.

           An ORDERLY passes by in the hallway outside, wearing an Urban 
           Outfitters-esque T-SHIRT that reads “BOBISM.”

                                 CHRIS
                        Just to make sure Bob Trautwig 
                        stays dead, we bought you a new 
                        identity.  Here.

           Chris hands Bob a fake DRIVER’S LICENSE.  In the Photoshopped I.D. 
           picture, Bob has a mustache.

                                 BOB
                        Miguel Sanchez.  I like it.

                                 ANDY RANTAMPRIKASH
                        So... what are you gonna do with 
                        the rest of your life?

           As Bob considers this, we:

                                                        SMASH TO BLACK.

           TITLE CARD:  “3015.”

           INT. LINA’S DOMICILE - 3015 - DAY

           Lina sits in her super-futuristic DOMICILE with a stainless steel 
           mug of coffee and her ORB.  She pushes a few buttons on her Orb 
           and a HOLOGRAPHIC IMAGE of a BOOK appears.  The “cover” reads:

            “The Great American Novel,” by Miguel Sanchez.

           Lina SWIPES her fingers over the hologram to “open” the book to 
           the DEDICATION PAGE, which reads:
           “For Angelina Grapefruit Boom Boom Thelonius Shakalaka, wherever 
            she may be.”

           Lina smiles, knowing who the real author was.  She looks over to:

           THE COUCH, where a very pretty YOUNG GIRL sits watching TV as a 
           SEVEN-YEAR-OLD BOY, the spitting image of BOB, sits next to her, 
           doing a pile of SCHOOLWORK.

                                 LINA
                        Bobby, she can do her own homework.

           The boy shrugs, then runs to the KITCHEN, goes to a high-tech 
           fridge unit, and places his hand into a dispenser.  ORANGE SODA 
           rains down.  Bob Jr. drinks it out of his hands, smiling happily.

           And we PULL BACK through the window to see Bob’s vision of a NEW 
           LOS ANGELES in all its glory.

                                                              FADE OUT.

                                     THE END
