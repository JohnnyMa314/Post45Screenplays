           INT. CAMPUS - MEDICAL SCIENCE LAB – DAY

           A large medical science lab – a teaching facility on campus. 
           Rows and rows of benches. A STUDENT DOCTOR, kind and 
           courteous, wholesome mid-20’s, in a white lab coat and jeans, 
           t-shirt, is waiting. He has set up his experiment: implements 
           at the ready. Plastic tubing, a small rubber balloon.

           He checks his watch. 

           He fusses around. He puts on a pair of thin white rubber 
           gloves, takes a seat.

           A long wait: he stretches the fingertips of the rubber 
           gloves. Impatient, he goes to stand but on second thoughts he 
           settles back down.

           Finally LUCY enters, unapologetic. She is 23; she wears flat 
           knee-high boots, a shortish skirt and a casual top. Minimal 
           grooming. Self-possessed.

                                 STUDENT DOCTOR
                        Hey.

                                 LUCY
                        Hey.

                                 STUDENT DOCTOR
                        Your autograph please.

           He presents her with a clipboard and she signs the clearance 
           without bothering to read it.

                                 LUCY
                        Sure.

           He shows her into the seat. He fits the rubber balloon to the 
           end of the snaking plastic tube. He hands it to her. 

                                 STUDENT DOCTOR
                        Thanks for this.

           She opens her mouth and tips back her head. She holds the 
           balloon above her open mouth and after a few seconds she 
           swallows it: he hovers over her, guiding the tube. 

           This disquieting experiment is in real-time.

                                 STUDENT DOCTOR
                        Good, that’s it. Good. OK.

           He clips the end of the tube to a machine and takes a 
           measurement. 

           Then he unclips the tube; he picks up a syringe and very 
           carefully pushes some air down the tube.

                                               (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                 STUDENT DOCTOR
                        I’m pushing the air in now. Just a 
                        little. So the pressure in your 
                        chest will change. 

           He clips off the tube and reconnects it to the machine to 
           take a second measurement. 

           He unclips. With great care he slowly pushes in more air with 
           the syringe. 

                                 STUDENT DOCTOR
                        You’re doing a great job.

           She slowly blinks in acknowledgement.

           INT. CAMPUS - WOMEN’S TOILET- DAY

           Lucy is in the public women’s toilet. She is drinking water 
           out of the tap, gargling so as to soothe her throat. Another 
           student enters, with a bottle of water, and this student 
           begins to apply lipstick. Lucy continues to drink water out 
           of the tap.

           INT. CORRIDOR/LECTURE THEATRE ENTRANCE - DAY

           Lucy leaves the toilets and walks along the corridor. This is 
           an ugly campus (UNSW).

           A large group of students, many Asian, are patiently 
           funnelling through the entry of the lecture theatre. She 
           joins them. A ubiquitous surveillance camera is perched above 
           the door.

           There is a pile of student newspapers on the ground; she 
           picks one up on her way past.

           INT. RESTAURANT – NIGHT

           Lucy is clearing the tables at the restaurant. There are no 
           plates or glasses. She patiently removes a tablecloth and 
           throws it onto the floor in the centre of the room. She 
           quickly windexes the tabletop and gives it a wipe. She  tips 
           the chairs upside down onto the table: it is the end of the 
           night. 

           She clears a second table.

           She clears a third table. She works quickly and efficiently.

           The COOK – 20’s, male - comes out of the kitchen.

                                 COOK
                        Need a ride?

                        (continuing her clearing)
                        No thanks, think I’ll do the 
                        drycleaners.

                                 COOK
                        Seek Help.

                                 LUCY
                        Aye aye me hearty. Night.

                                 COOK
                        See ya.

           INT. BAR – NIGHT

           Lucy, in red lipstick, is sitting at the bar amidst a swarm 
           of businessmen in expensive suits. The place is fashionably 
           decorated, moneyed. She is nursing a beer.

           A WOMAN in her 40’s, in a stylish pants suit, silk shirt, 
           large breasts, short hair, serious jewellery, manicure, comes 
           to join her at the bar. They acknowledge each other with 
           quick smiles.

                                 WOMAN
                        Can I interest you in a line?

                                 LUCY
                        Why not.

           The woman gets up and heads for the Ladies’ Restroom. 

           Lucy follows. 

           INT. LADIES RESTROOM - NIGHT

           They squeeze into the same cubicle. A strong sexual tension. 
           The woman deftly racks up two generous lines on top of the 
           silver toilet-paper dispenser. She rolls up a bank-note and 
           snorts. 

           Lucy goes next. 

           Instead of returning the rolled-up note she openly pockets 
           it.

                                 LUCY
                        Thanks.

           The woman steadily returns the direct gaze.

                                 WOMAN
                        A pleasure.
                                      (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                    (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)           INT. BAR – BANQUETTES – NIGHT

           The woman slides onto a velvet banquette in a private alcove. 
           Lucy follows. Each holds two balloons of brandy. Sitting 
           opposite are two BUSINESSMEN in their 40’s. Ties loosened.

                                 WOMAN
                        This is Lucy.

                                 BUSINESSMAN 1
                        Hi Lucy. Lucy in the sky.

                                 BUSINESSMAN 2
                        We’ve just been talking about which 
                        one of us is going to fuck you.

                                 LUCY
                        Oh really. (Long pause). Why don’t 
                        you toss for it?

           The businessmen are surprised but delighted. Man 2 fumbles 
           for a coin.

                                 BUSNESSMAN 2 (TO WOMAN)
                        Are you in?

           The woman shakes her head. She is slightly miffed that the 
           young Lucy is the beacon for sexual attention.

                                 BUSINESSMAN 2 (TO BUSINESSMAN 1)
                        Heads or tails?

                                 BUSINESSMAN 1 
                        Head. 

           Man 2 flips coin over and over – builds anticipation – then 
           tosses. They all lean forward to see the result.

                                 BUSINESSMAN 2
                        Cunt!

                                 BUSINESSMAN 1
                         (jubilant, sweeping up the 
                          coin)
                        Head it is.

                                 LUCY
                        Yes, my prince. But did I say when. 
                        Did I say tonight, this year, next 
                        year...

                                 BUSINESSMAN 1
                        Fair enough. We’ll toss. Tonight - 
                        or next year. (He plays with the

                        Tonight.

                                 BUSINESSMAN 1
                        My lucky night.

                                 LUCY
                        Now - or in five hours?

           She directs a complicit glance toward the woman.

                                 BUSINESSMAN 1
                        OK. Now.....tails.

           He tosses the coin again. They inspect the fall.

                                 LUCY
                        Tails never fails.

           Man 1 stands to his feet.

                                 BUSINESSMAN 1
                        Right. Let’s go then, shall we.

           He gathers his coat and briefcase. Lucy smiles and 
           accompanies him without protest. 

           EXT. BAR/STREET - NIGHT

           They stand outside the bar waiting for a cab.

                                 BUSINESSMAN 1
                         (kindly)
                        We don’t have to go through with 
                        this. I can pour you into a cab.

                                 LUCY
                        I want to.

           INT. STUDENT TERRACE HOUSE - HALL - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Lucy opens the front door: this requires concentration. Her 
           key ring holds numerous keys and has a distinctive key-tag. 
           She walks down the corridor, into the living room. The living 
           room abuts an open kitchen. Ratty student furnishings. 
           Windowfuls of morning light. She is wearing the clothes from 
           the night before; her hair is mussed. Two flatmates, SHELL 
           and CHRIS, girlfriend and boyfriend, are eating breakfast. 
           She seems to have interrupted them. They are dressed in 
           cutting-edge fashion.

                                 LUCY
                        Hi.

                        Hi.

           Chris just nods.

           Lucy goes to the fridge. The shelves have names: “Shell & 
           Chris”. “Lucy”. Lucy’s shelf is almost bare. A jar of 
           anchovies. A small container of cream, yellowed at the edges.  
           A tin of chickpeas. She closes the fridge and picks up an 
           apple in a fruit bowl on the bench. Behind her on the wall is 
           a magnetic strip which holds several large sharp knives.

           Shell and Chris swap glances. He raises his brows. Shell 
           frowns as if to say ‘shut up’.

                                 CHRIS
                        Have you got the rent?

                                 LUCY
                        The rent?

                                 CHRIS
                        The rent. As in: the rent. The rent 
                        is due. The rent is overdue.

                                 LUCY
                        It won’t kill them to wait.

                                 CHRIS
                        You have no idea. It’s her house.

                                 LUCY 
                        (to Shell) Is it your house? 

           Shell shrugs.

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)

                        (to Chris) It’s her parents’ house. 
                        There’s no virtue in being born.

                                 CHRIS
                        Just pay the fucking rent and while 
                        you’re at it clean the fucking 
                        bathroom. As we all agreed (to 
                        Shell). It’s your turn (back to 
                        Lucy).

                                 LUCY
                        I did clean it.

                                 CHRIS
                        You have to grout.

           Lucy, stone-faced, doesn’t seem to know what ‘grout’ means.
                                       (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)

                        Grout. Between the tiles. That 
                        black stuff.

                                 LUCY
                        (self-possessed)
                        It will give me great pleasure to 
                        grout. 

           INT. STUDENT TERRACE HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

           Lucy, still dressed in clothes from the night before, wearing 
           pink rubber gloves, is barefoot in the bath and is patiently 
           and determinedly rubbing away at the mould between the tiles: 
           grouting. 

           Now and then she picks up an anti-mould spray and sprays the 
           tiles. Returns to grouting. 

           She displays no frustration or anger but instead an 
           equanimity. A long boring job.

           INT. STUDENT TERRACE HOUSE - BEDROOM – DAY

           The bed is a low futon on milk crates; another milk-crate 
           serves as a bedside table. It holds a frangi-pani flower in a 
           small glass of water and an eye-mask, the kind found in an 
           airline toiletries bag. The spartan room is strewn with 
           clothes, empty coffee cups, junk.

           Lucy enters. She dumps her boots. 

           She sits on the edge of the bed and puts on the airline eye-
           mask.

           Still dressed, she sprawls out, belly down. She does not move 
           an inch. She sleeps.

           EXT. TERRACE BACKYARD - LANEWAY - MORNING

           A new day. The concrete backyard of a student terrace. Lucy 
           walks out the back door and into the laneway. Lucy is freshly 
           dressed, has redone her hair. Her walk  is steady, self-
           possessed. She is wearing head-phones. 

           A tree overhangs a back-fence, laden with red berries. As she 
           walks past – but without stopping – she reaches out and grabs 
           a fistful of berries. 

           As she continues her long walk she scatters these berries one 
           by one on the macadam.

           A dead bat clings to a powerline: she aims a berry in its 
           direction.

           an overwhelming transverse eight lanes of cars, morning rush.

           INT. PHOTOCOPY ROOM – DAY

           A large artificially-lit room devoted to photocopying - a 
           super-machine. She is processing a stack of papers 
           ...unpicking staples, running the documents through the 
           machine, restacking. Methodical and seemingly endless 
           Sisyphean work. She is wearing headphones. There is a small 
           surveillance camera perched high in one corner of the room.

           Page after page runs through the machine. Copy after copy 
           after copy. Repetition.

           Inexplicably the photocopier makes a crunching noise and 
           jams. This does not phase her in the slightest. She has to 
           open the machine and look through every part of it to find 
           the scrunched document. She removes the toner cartridge and 
           reaches into the machine, gently easing out a document folded 
           like a concertina. She closes the machine and is patiently 
           trying to smooth out the document when – behind her – a YOUNG 
           COLLEAGUE enters the room. He is about her age, mid-20’s, and 
           is wearing a smart suit and tie: her superior. He is carrying 
           a huge stack of manila folders.

                                 COLLEAGUE
                        Lucy. (Louder) Lucy.

           He fails to get her attention and so he puts the folders down 
           on the table and goes to stand nearby. He is about to touch 
           her on the shoulder but thinks better of it and instead waves 
           his hand in front of her face.

           She turns to face him. 

                                 COLLEAGUE
                         (pointing to the 
                          documents)
                        Can you do them by 11.00

                                 LUCY
                        Sure.

           The colleague leaves.

           She carries on with her photocopying. 

           There is another interruption – this time by a SECOND 
           COLLEAGUE, a woman, 50’s, whose enormous collagen-plumped 
           lips are further enhanced by bright red lipstick.

The 
           woman flicks the lights on and off in order to get Lucy’s 
           attention. Lucy turns around.

           Lucy calmly removes her headphones. 

           INT. CORRIDOR/OFFICE - DAY

           Lucy follows Colleague 2 down the corridor, past a warren of 
           offices. The woman holds open the door to a room and points 
           to the telephone.

                                 LUCY
                        Thank you.

           The woman stands outside the room so as to afford some 
           measure of privacy - but the door remains open and she is 
           clearly eavesdropping.

                                 LUCY (ON TELEPHONE)
                        Hello.

                        Hi Mum.

                        How did you get this number?

                        No. 

                        No.

                        No.

                        Do you want me to lose this job?

                        Alright. I have the card in my 
                        hand. Visa. 4564 3185 1970. Expiry 
                        04/12. 

                        What?

                        Yes, I can see it. Security code 
                        399. Alright? I have to go now.

                        I’m sure. I really have to go. 
                        Don’t worry.

                        Ok. Goodbye. Bye Mum. Bye.

           Note: she has no credit-card in her hand.

Passes the 
           colleague. They make eye-contact. Lucy’s gaze is direct, 
           challengingly unashamed.  Neither says anything. Lucy walks 
           away.

           INT/EXT. BOTTLE-O - STREET - DAY 

           Lucy is at the Bottle-O. She has a small plastic bag full of 
           packets of muesli slung around one wrist: her own knapsack 
           hangs over her shoulder. The ATTENDANT, 18, is putting four 
           bottles of vodka and a six-pack of beer into a cardboard box. 
           He has a temporary tattoo of a beer logo on his forehead.

                                 ATTENDANT
                        You’ll be right to carry this?

                                 LUCY
                        Yeah, fine thanks.

                                 ATTENDANT
                        Cash or credit.

                                 LUCY
                        Credit.

           She hands him a credit card.

                                 ATTENDANT
                        There’s a charge with Amex.

                                 LUCY
                        That’s OK. All I’ve got.

                                 ATTENDANT
                        No worries.

           He generates the paperwork. She signs the receipt.

                                 ATTENDANT
                        Have a good one.

                                 LUCY
                        Ta.

           She walks out, loaded with the heavy box and the muesli.

           She walks determinedly along the pavement. 

           Coming toward her, walking slowly, is a HUMAN BILLBOARD. A 
           man wearing a sandwich board with advertising for an 
           electrical goods outlet. The sandwich board incorporates a 
           small sound-system which plays a constant advertising jingle. 
           Hell.

           They bear toward one another.

           INT. BOARDING HOUSE ENTRANCE/ STAIRWAY- DAY

           This is a boarding house for men. The bare entrance hall has 
           no security. Lucy enters - we see an old man watching her 
           from the stairwell. She climbs a set of grimey stairs to the 
           first floor. 

           INT. BOARDING HOUSE LANDING/BIRDMANN’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Lucy goes to the door – No.7 – and does a secret knock.

           Tap, tap-tap, tap-tap, tap. 

           She puts her ear to the door to hear if anyone is moving, 
           then she waits patiently.

           After a long while the door opens. BIRDMANN, early 30’s, is 
           in advanced stages of alcoholism: he is very thin, with grey 
           pallor, his hands have a slight tremble. He is dressed in a 
           dark grey business suit with an immaculate white shirt. His 
           hair is neat and combed. He is clean-shaven although he has a 
           few shaving cuts. He has a gentle manner.

                                 BIRDMANN
                        Hello Lucy. Come in.

                                 LUCY
                         (warmly, so happy to see 
                          him)
                        Hey Birdmann. I bear gifts.

           He holds the door open and she walks into his bed-sit. Though 
           bare, it is very clean and neat. The bed has been made. She 
           opens a cupboard and a tiny kitchen is revealed: two electric 
           burners on top of a mini bar-fridge. A sink.

           She dumps the vodka bottles in the sink. She rests the beer 
           and groceries on the floor. Birdmann stands and watches; he 
           has his hand on his side, elbow out - he is applying pressure 
           to his painful kidney.

                                 BIRDMANN
                        Thanks.

           She looks to see what he is drinking. There is a large 
           tumbler on the table, with a finger of vodka, clear as water. 
           She opens one beer.

           She retrieves a packet of muesli from the groceries bag. She 
           quickly pours him a small bowl. She opens one of the bottles 
           of vodka and splashes it in the bowl rather than milk. This 
           is done with a minimum of fuss.

The TV is on 
           so that a light jitters on their faces; the sound is turned 
           down.

                         (highly mannered)
                        Hello Birdmann, How Are You?

                                 BIRDMANN
                         (also highly  mannered)
                        Very Well Thank You, And You?

                                 LUCY 
                        Very Well Thank You. And How’s The 
                        Family?

                                 BIRDMANN
                        Oh Very Well, Thank You. And Yours?

                                 LUCY
                        Oh Yes, Very Well.

                                 BIRDMANN 
                        Well, Well.

           This deliberate ritualistic patter ends – they both know it 
           be untrue.

                                 BIRDMANN (CONT’D)
                         (now sincerely)
                        It’s good to see you. You look 
                        beautiful.

                                 LUCY
                         (sincerely)
                        Thanks.

                                 BIRDMANN
                        I have something important to tell 
                        you.

           She nods.

                                 BIRDMANN (CONT’D)
                        Do you remember that time - on the 
                        beach. After we’d been to Andy’s 
                        place. That morning. I wanted to 
                        kiss you. You must have wanted me 
                        to kiss you. But I couldn’t because 
                        of my tongue. My tongue was furred. 
                        Furred and thick. Putrid. The 
                        arsehole of the arsehole of the 
                        arsehole. I couldn’t kiss you.

                                 LUCY
                        That’s OK.

                        I wanted you to know.... I just 
                        want to love my friends.

                                 LUCY
                        I know. Not an unreasonable 
                        request.

           She gives him a gentle friendly kiss on the cheek.

                                 BIRDMANN
                         (taking a drink)
                        I’m so fucking tired of watching 
                        Oprah. 

           EXT. PUBLIC TELEPHONES - DUSK

           Later that day Lucy walks past a bank of public telephones. 
           Out of instinct she checks each phone for loose change: she 
           salvages a few coins. She carries on.

           She pauses. She digs into her knapsack and finds the student 
           newspaper. She backtracks to the phones. She flicks through 
           the paper until she finds the page she wants. Dials a number 
           from the untraceable public phone.

                                 LUCY
                        Hello. This is Melissa. I’m calling 
                        about the ad in the student 
                        paper....Yes.....Five foot 7 
                        ....Brunette.....Slim....Yes....
                        Yes....No, not that I 
                        know....Yes.....12B.....Pert (eyes 
                        roll)....I understand. What should 
                        I wear?.....Alright. Thank you so 
                        much. I look forward to seeing 
                        you.....Bye.

           EXT. LANEWAY - MORNING 

           The next morning Lucy is walking down the laneway. Self-
           assured, seemingly in good spirits. Today she has made an 
           effort with her grooming. She is wearing more make-up. Her 
           hair swings shiny and clean. She is wearing a dress and high 
           heels. 

           As before, she takes a handful of berries and bounces them in 
           her palm, playfully scatters them one at a time. 

           She looks up to see if the dead bat is still there: it is. 
           She aims a berry in its direction.
                                         (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                       (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)           EXT. TRAIN STATION

           Lucy – in her dress and heels - exits a train station. She 
           hovers around the ticket barriers, at the furthest distance 
           from the guard. The other departing passengers  file past 
           with their tickets in hand. Businessmen, old ladies... When 
           she sees a teenage guy about to go through – his ticket at 
           the ready – she quickly steps in, pushes through behind him. 
           He turns around.

                                 LUCY
                         (smiling brightly)
                        Sorry.

                                 GUY WITH TICKET
                        No worries.

           They quickly go their separate ways.

           INT. DECORATOR’S SHOWROOM – DAY

           This is an elegant interior decoration showroom: there is a 
           chandelier; a dove-grey chaise longue littered with swathes 
           of rich furnishing fabrics; a pair of stone urns; Japanese 
           silk-screens; a collection of antler trophies on the wall. It 
           is not at all gaudy. A tone of refinement. 

           Lucy is sitting on a Louis XV sofa. An immaculately groomed, 
           effeminate man with shaped eyebrows, THOMAS, 30, sits behind 
           an antique desk doing some paperwork. On the wall behind him 
           hangs an elaborate gilt-framed antique mirror. He stands and 
           walks over to her.

                                 THOMAS
                        Are you sure you wouldn’t like a 
                        tea or coffee. Water?

                                 LUCY
                        I’m fine, thank you.

           He returns to the desk. Lucy idly leafs through one of the 
           “World of Interior” magazines on the low table beside her. A 
           phone rings at the reception desk.

                                 THOMAS
                         (listening a while before 
                          speaking)
                        Yes, I think we are ready.

           He puts down the phone and nods to Lucy. She stands. He shows 
           her through a door at the back of the room.

                        (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)           INT. DECORATOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           Lucy enters the office: it is chic and refined. An orchid on 
           the table. A small archaic Greek statue. She is greeted by 
           CLARA, a supremely elegant woman in her late 50’s. She wears 
           her hair in a glossy chignon. A pale-hued dress and jacket. 
           Pearls. Once she would have been a great beauty. She seems 
           kind, gentle: dignified resignation. 

                                 CLARA
                        Hello, hello, please come in, sit 
                        down.

           Lucy take a seat. She notices the antique mirror that hung in 
           the reception room works two-ways.

                                 LUCY
                        Thank you.

                                 CLARA
                        Thank you for coming. Such a 
                        pleasure to see such a unique 
                        beauty. Let me tell you how I think 
                        we should proceed. I will describe 
                        the job and then, if you are 
                        interested, we will discuss 
                        particulars. How does that sound?

                                 LUCY
                        Yes, good.

                        supply. You will work with other

                        be sure to maintain another, more 
                        reliable, source of income.

                        I understand.

                        OK.

                                 CLARA
                        My sincere advice is to use the 
                        money wisely. Think of it as a 
                        windfall. Pay off your student 
                        loan. Or save for a home-deposit. 
                        Please – please do not see this as 
                        a career. Work hard for a short 
                        amount of time... Your vagina will 
                        not be penetrated. Your vagina will 
                        be a temple... So - there it is.

                                 LUCY
                        My vagina is not a temple.

           Clara is greatly pleased by this reply: a test has been 
           passed.

                                 CLARA
                        Excellent. Although it’s quite 
                        true, my darling, you won’t ever be 
                        penetrated. Now, will you stand up 
                        for me please and strip. (She picks 
                        up the phone). Thomas.

           Lucy slips off her dress: we see the hem is held up by white 
           masking tape. She stands in her underwear - bra and panties. 
           Clara carries out a physical appraisal. She touches Lucy’s 
           hair. 

                                 CLARA
                        Open your mouth, darling.

           She inspects her teeth. 

           She cups one breast, feels it’s weight. Passes her thumb over 
           the nipple.

                                 CLARA
                        Not pierced.

           Lucy shakes her head.

           Thomas enters the room and stands close behind Lucy. Lucy is 
           slightly apprehensive.

                                 CLARA
                        No tattoos?

           Lucy shakes her head.

           right ear is deformed, the top has been sliced off and is 
           scarred and mangled. Lucy registers this deliberate exposure.

                                 THOMAS
                        Stand your feet apart a few inches.

           He gets down on his knees, still behind her, and runs his 
           hands lightly along her ankles, calves, thighs, right up her 
           inner thighs. He pauses.

                                 THOMAS
                        What’s this?

           He turns out her inner thigh.

                                 LUCY
                        I had a mole removed.

           Clara takes a close look at the faint scar, makes no comment. 
           Then the inspection is over. 

                                 THOMAS
                        Please, get dressed.

           Lucy dresses. Clara returns behind her desk. Thomas stands 
           nearby.

                                 CLARA
                        Sit down. I have some questions I 
                        need to ask you. Are you on any 
                        medication?

                                 LUCY

                                 LUCY
                        No.

                                 CLARA
                        Are you a smoker?

                                 LUCY
                        No. Maybe the occasional jazz 
                        cigarette. Rarely.

                        You are very beautiful, very 
                        talented, but we are going to make 
                        you even more beautiful, more 
                        talented. (To Thomas) Aren’t we?

           Thomas nods.

                                 CLARA
                        Oh - your name. We’d like to call 
                        you Sara. 

           INT. BEAUTY SALON - DAY

           Lucy is sitting high on the pedicure throne at the beauty 
           salon. A Korean woman – wearing thin white rubber gloves and 
           a white face mask over her mouth – is bathing Lucy’s feet, 
           performing a pedicure. Subservience.

           Lucy’s hands are on display - her fingernails have just been 
           painted a purple-red. 

           It is the first time Lucy has had a pedicure and she is not 
           familiar with procedure. The beautician readies a towel and 
           waits for Lucy to take her foot out of the water for drying. 

           When this doesn’t happen the beautician takes hold of the 
           foot herself, smiling and nodding, showing Lucy what to do.

           INT. WAXING SALON - DAY

           Lucy is lying on a trestle table, wearing a shirt and 
           panties. Her arms are crossed over her chest. The door opens 
           and a beautician enters: a matronly Arabic woman in her 50’s. 

           The beautician points at the panties and indicates to Lucy 
           that they should come off. 

           The beautician goes to a workbench and returns with a ball of 
           sticky-stretchy sugar taffy. To begin she reassuringly places 
           a hand on Lucy’s belly.

                                 BEAUTICIAN
                        OK. Good girl.

           Then she stretches the taffy and presses it onto Lucy’s pubic 
           hair -- then she rips it away.

                                 LUCY
                        Ow!

                                 BEAUTICIAN
                        Would you like a lavender tissue, 
                        darling?
                                                     (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                                      (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)           Lucy nods. The beautician gets a kleenex tissue and sprays it 
           with lavender essence. She deposits the snowy-white tissue 
           over Lucy’s nose.

           The procedure is repeated, over and over. Each time Lucy 
           cries out – Ow! The taffy is stretched and balled; stretched 
           and balled. The beautician continues, working quickly, 
           smiling and indulging Lucy’s complaints. The ridiculous 
           kleenex tissue has fallen away. Lucy grows hysterical with 
           laughter – as if she can’t believe the pain.

           The beautician lifts both Lucy’s knees and works right 
           between Lucy’s legs, removing every last trace of hair with 
           the viscous ball of pube-studded taffy. Lucy falls silent and 
           shuts her eyes – on the next rip she turns her head to the 
           side.

           INT. BOARDING HOUSE LANDING/BIRDMANN’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Lucy does the secret knock at Birdmann’s door:

           Tap tap-tap tap-tap –

           But before she finishes the door opens wide.

                                 BIRDMANN
                        Good Afternoon.

                                 LUCY
                        Good Afternoon.

           She gives him a peck on the cheek, then passes down the 
           hallway, headed straight for the kitchenette. She carries a 
           plastic bag filled with two bottles of vodka and takeaway 
           food containers.

                                 BIRDMANN
                        And How Are You?

                                 LUCY
                        Oh Very Well Thank You. And You.

                                 BIRDMANN
                        Oh Yes Fine Thank You.

                                 LUCY
                        OK, sit down. At the table.

           He gingerly takes a seat at the little table, wincing in 
           pain. She brings over a fistful of mismatched cutlery, a nest 
           of mismatched plates. A couple of wine glasses. She quickly 
           sets the table-for-two.

                                 BIRDMANN
                        To what do I owe this pleasure?
                                (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                     (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                 LUCY
                        Nothing. Nothing special. I’m 
                        ‘upgrading my skillset’.

           She stands beside him with a newly opened bottle of vodka.

                                 BIRDMANN
                         (Pause)
                        Nothing special?

           Lucy shakes her head, avoiding the question. He accepts this.

                                 LUCY 
                        White or white?

           She pours the vodka into the glass, from the correct height 
           and twisting the bottle at the final moment so as not to 
           spill a drop. She puts down the bottle and then opens the 
           takeaway food containers. She grips a fork and spoon in one 
           hand, and holding the container in the other hand as if it 
           were a platter, she successfully transfers some food onto his 
           plate in a dextrous silver-service fashion. After she has 
           served him she serves herself...showing off her new skills by 
           shuffling her food around the plate. Birdmann observes, 
           impressed. She sits down. They both look at the unappetising 
           food.

                                 LUCY
                        Go on, you first.

           He manoeuvres a mouthful, chews slowly.

                                 BIRDMANN
                        Can we watch some porn?

                                 LUCY
                        No.

                                 BIRDMANN
                        OK. (He sips his drink.) What have 
                        you done to your fingers?

           She puts down her cutlery and contemplates her shiny 
           lacquered nails. She places her fingertips on the table, then 
           scuttles her nails up onto the plate, over the food, across 
           the table. A staccato assault. They both study these fingers 
           that appear to have a life of their own and then comment, at 
           the same time:

                                 LUCY AND BIRDMANN
                        Beetles.

           A small shared smile acknowledging this moment of unexpected 
           unison.

LANEWAY – NIGHT

           The back gate opens and Lucy walks down the laneway. With 
           confidence. She is wearing high heels, a coat. Glamorous make-
           up, glossy smooth hair: a beauty.

           She grabs the berries - as is her habit. Lets them drop.

           Up ahead we see a car waiting at the spot where the dead bat 
           hangs in the power-lines. A swarthy bull-necked man, her 
           DRIVER, is leaning against the driver door. As he sees her 
           coming he makes call on a mobile phone to confirm her 
           arrival.

                                 DRIVER
                        Sara?

           She nods. 

           He holds open the backseat door for her.

           They drive away.

           INT. LUXURY APARTMENT - ENTRANCE/BEDROOM/KITCHEN - NIGHT

           The doors of an art-deco elevator open: Lucy steps out into 
           the entrance hall of a grand apartment. Oak-panelled walls, 
           parquet floor.

           She is immediately greeted by a beautiful woman in her 30’s, 
           SOPHIE. Sophie wears a short black silk kimono - open. Under 
           the kimono she is wearing a 1930’s burlesque-style black 
           suspender belt and black net stockings. No bra, no panties. 
           Her hair is cropped short and she has a large tattoo over her 
           left breast. Her style is suicide-girl. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        Hello Sara. I’m Sophie.

                                 LUCY
                        Hi.

           She quickly ushers Lucy down a corridor into a minimally 
           furnished guest bedroom. The bed is loaded with coats and 
           bags belonging to the staff. 

           Lucy unbuttons her coat and lays it on the bed. She slips off 
           her dress. She is wearing a cream silk balconette bra, 
           nipples exposed; cream silk panties that tie with satin 
           ribbons at the side; cream silk suspender belt and cream silk 
           stockings. Ultra-feminine.

                                 SOPHIE 
                        You look lovely.

                        Thanks.

                                 SOPHIE
                        OK now I need you to go into the 
                        ensuite and fix your make-up. 
                        You’ll find a lipstick palette in 
                        there and I want you to match - an 
                        exact match - match your lipstick 
                        to the colour of your labia.

           Long pause.

                                 LUCY
                         (muted disbelief) 
                        You’re kidding me.

           Sophie shakes her head and indicates the direction of the 
           ensuite bathroom.

           Lucy goes into the bathroom and finds the palette. She leaves 
           it alone and instead brushes her hair. She fixes her 
           eyeliner. She studies the palette and then decides to apply 
           the most lurid shade of pink possible. 

           She emerges and gazes directly at Sophie. Sophie is non-
           plussed and removes another palette from a pocket in her 
           kimono.

                                 SOPHIE
                         (gently)
                        It’s not a game.

           She approaches Lucy and quickly bends down, pulls aside the 
           panties, has a good look, stands up, mixes her brush along 
           the lip palette and then wipes away the lurid pink with the 
           back of her hand and applies a new colour to Lucy’s mouth. 
           Lucy obliges.

           They leave the room and Sophie leads the way down the 
           corridor into a large kitchen. A male CHEF is working hard, 
           stirring, blending. A sense of abundance. The other 
           WAITRESSES – six of them – are sitting around, lounging 
           against the benches. Each of these other waitresses are 
           dressed in the same manner as Sophie: extraordinarily 
           beautiful 20-something suicide-girls, pierced and tatooed, 
           topless, no panties, black or red suspenders and stockings. 
           They exude a languorous menace. They study Lucy: a bunny who 
           has walked into a lion’s den. One waitress whispers something 
           to her friend, clearly something about Lucy. Ha. The friend 
           gives a knowing laugh. 

           Sophie shucks off her kimono. She gently adjusts the hair of 
           one of her girls. She checks her watch.

                         (chiefly to Lucy)
                        Let’s go.

           The waitresses stand to the ready.

           INT. LUXURY APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           A sumptuous dining room. A glittering chandelier. An 
           elaborately laid table, set for seven places, now empty. Cut 
           crystal glasses. An oak buffet. Abundant flowers. The feel of 
           a gentleman’s club, a Helmut Newton room. Lucy and Sophie are 
           stationed on either of the buffet, patient and poised. 

           The sound of approaching footsteps. 

           Lucy takes a deep breath, she adjusts her bra strap.

           A pair of French double-doors is opened wide and one by one 
           the diners slowly file in, take their respective places. A 
           ceremonial procession.

           The diners: these men are all late 60’s or older. Silver-
           haired. Among them is one old butch dyke. One man has trouble 
           walking - he is truly ancient. They wear formal black and 
           white dinner suits. Wealth. Power.

           Once the diners are seated Lucy steps forward to serve MAN 1 
           who presides at the head of the table. He is thin and kindly-
           faced, patrician. She expertly displays the wine bottle and 
           pours a glass of white wine. He sniffs the wine, then nods 
           and smiles in thanks.

           She works her way around the table - to the appreciation of 
           the diners.

           Once everyone has a full glass a toast is made.

                                 MAN 1
                        Thank you, friends, for being here 
                        tonight. As ever it is wonderful to 
                        see you. Thank you. 

           Murmured appreciations. Cheers.

           Sophie steps forward.

                        Tonight’s entree is Le Foie Gras 
                        poelee, Puree d’Ail et de Citron

           A door opens and three waitresses stream in, each balancing 
           two entrees. A balletic serving performance. They begin to 
           eat.

                        Ah my favourite. You are too kind, 
                        too kind. It’s remarkable: where do 
                        your source your supplies?

           She turns to Lucy and indicates she’d like a top-up of wine. 

                                 MAN 1 
                        Ways and means, ways and means.

           Sophie takes a stool and sits by the ancient man (who has not 
           touched his food). 

           Lucy watches mesmerised as Sophie begins to spoonfeed him 
           like a baby.

           INT. LUXURY APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           The CHEF is putting the finishing touches to the main course. 
           He wipes around edges of each platter with a damp cloth.

           Three waitresses (Group A) don’t lift a finger to help.

           Three waitresses (Group B) enter with finished entree plates 
           that they dump on a bench.

           When the Chef is satisfied the Group A waitresses line up to 
           take out the next course.

           Lucy serves a red wine: one glass after the other.

                        Perhaps you will be able to tell me 
                        if it really does taste so good or 
                        if it is the memories of Elizabeth 
                        that make it so special.

           The others are in agreement though they pick up their cutlery 
           as if it weighs very heavy.

           The waitresses have been making sure everyone has their main 
           course. They serve each individual in the silver-service 
           style: first from the rice platter, then from the chicken 
           fricasee platter, then from the morel sauce jug.  

           Lucy continues her pouring: she doesn’t spill a drop.

           Finished, she resumes her station. She swaps a quick glance 
           with Sophie. Sophie gives her a reassuring tiny nod.

           INT. LUXURY APARTMENT – KITCHEN - NIGHT

           The Chef is preparing an elaborate dessert. 

           He allows one of the waitresses a sample tasting. 

           He holds out one sweetened finger.

           She licks its length and then takes it whole in her mouth as 
           if giving a blow-job.

           The desert has been demolished.

           MAN 1 places his linen serviette on the table and slowly 
           stands. The others follow suit.

           Sophie opens the French double-doors. A living-room area is 
           revealed. Leather club couches and velvet upholstered wing 
           chairs. Persian rugs. Paintings on the wall. A luxurious and 
           refined environment. Two girls we haven’t seen before – 
           suicide-girls in leather collars– are kneeling over low 
           velvet footstools, facing a fireplace. Their exquisite naked 
           arses are on display.

           The diners take up their seats. Sophie and Lucy and the 
           waitresses enter the room.

           The waitresses station themselves around the room. Sophie 
           goes to a side-table and passes Lucy a silver tray bearing a 
           crystal decanter and brandy balloons. Sophie herself then 
           takes up a second tray which bears a silver coffee pot and 
           coffee cups. Sophie approaches a diner.

           (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                 SOPHIE
                        Coffee or brandy?

           With a wave of the hand the diner indicates he will take 
           both. Sophie pours a hot black coffee and knows exactly how 
           much milk and sugar to add. Lucy, on the other side, pours 
           brandy into the glass balloon.

           They approach the next guest.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Coffee or brandy?

           The process is repeated. 

           A waitress is summoned from her station and is instructed by 
           MAN 3 to sit close by him, on the edge of the leather sofa. 
           She obeys without question. He runs his fingers up and down 
           her spine. She arches her back in cat-like response, breasts 
           forward.

           Once Sophie and Lucy have finished serving the drinks they 
           prepare to leave the room. Sophie walks ahead. 

           As Lucy walks past MAN 2 – a strong man, barrel-chested with 
           a big gut - he deliberately sticks out his foot and trips 
           her. She tumbles to the floor - but does not make a sound: 
           all eyes on Lucy. Crash: the crystal decanter is shattered. 

           MAN 1 gets up from his seat and helps her to her feet. His 
           opportunity to touch her.

                                 MAN 1
                        There, there. Not to worry. Upsie 
                        getsy.

           Lucy is upset, flummoxed, humiliated but under Sophie’s stern 
           gaze she says nothing. Her eyes shine with tears. They leave 
           the room.

           A waitress moves over to collect the broken crystal. This is 
           no scandal: with the fireplace metal dustpan and poker calmly 
           in hand we feel she has seen this all before.

           INT. LUXURY APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Sophie and Lucy return to the kitchen with their trays. The 
           CHEF is carefully wiping down his knives.

                                 LUCY
                        I’m sorry.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Don’t worry. You did well.

           (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)           Lucy goes to the sink and turns on the tap, makes to wash the 
           dishes.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT’D)
                        Leave those for the cleaners.

           She goes to a drawer and pulls out an envelope. She hands 
           this over to Lucy.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT’D)
                        We won’t be needing you anymore 
                        tonight.

           INT - STUDENT TERRACE HOUSE - HALLWAY - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Lucy comes home to a dark empty house. There is a folded note 
           “Lucy” on the table. She reads it and frowns, crumples it up. 

           In a drawer in the TV cabinet she finds a pouch of pot and 
           some rollies. She expertly rolls herself a spliff. She lights 
           it and inhales.

           She takes the pay envelope from her coat pocket. Feels its 
           weight. She opens it and empties out the $50 bills. 

           She fashions a neat stack of bills, then peels off the top 
           bill.

           She flicks her cigarette lighter with her manicured nail and 
           applies a steady flame to the bill she has set aside. 

           It gives her deep pleasure to be able to destroy it, watch 
           the plasticised money shrivel and burn.

           INT. PHOTOCOPY ROOM - DAY

           Lucy is back at her photocopy job, patiently feeding 
           documents through the machine. 

           This is long boring repetitive work that she performs with 
           equanimity. However, not complete equanimity: she takes a 
           deep sigh and presses her thumbs against her eyeballs.

           She uses the unpicker to remove staples from some papers. The 
           staples are tricky to remove. We see her chipped scrappy 
           nailpolish, the very last remnants of the manicure.

           Her colleague enters with a new folder. It’s the woman with 
           the enormous collagen-plumped reddened lips, COLLEAGUE 2. She 
           slams down the folder to get Lucy’s attention.

           The moment she has left the room Lucy retrieves the folder. 
           She smacks her lips together and then says loudly, clearly, 
           with hyper-enunciation:
                       (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                                      (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                     (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                 LUCY
                        Baboon.

           INT. TRAIN - DAY

           Lucy gets on the train. She is casually dressed.

           The compartment is almost full. There are three seats free. 
           She looks down and sees someone has drawn a large cock and 
           balls picture on one seat. She avoids this - and sits on the 
           seat beside.

           An old woman is sitting on the bench opposite. Her shin is 
           bandaged. She stares at Lucy and offers a watery smile. Lucy 
           does not return the smile.

           A young mother and her child, age 5, also get on the train. 
           Lucy is obliged to slide over onto the graffiti-marked seat. 
           The mother sits down.

           The child starts screaming, having an hysterical fit. He 
           thumps and bangs the seat.

                                 CHILD-TYRANT
                        I won’t sit down! I won’t sit down! 
                        Stand up, Mummy! Stand up! Stand 
                        up, Mummy! Mummy, stand up, Mummy! 
                        Stand up!

           Over and over and over. High pitched squealing. After one or 
           two attempts to calm him the mother ignores the child. 

           The child pauses in his hysterical fit and sneaks Lucy a 
           glance. The eye of the storm. Lucy regards him coldly. The 
           fit resumes with even greater intensity. The child yanks at 
           his mother’s skirt.

                                 CHILD-TYRANT
                        Stand up! Stand up, Mummy! Don’t 
                        sit down! Stand up Mummy! I won’t 
                        sit down!

           The mother gives the child a hard slap across the face. A 
           sudden quiet. The commuters continue to stare blank-faced and 
           discomfited. 

           Lucy stands and moves away.

           INT. SECOND APARTMENT - NIGHT

           The elevator doors open. Lucy has arrived at a new luxury 
           residence. She is in her coat and high heels. 
                                      (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)           As before, Sophie is waiting for her, dressed in her black 
           silk kimono and black suspender belt. Her hair is a new 
           colour, a platinum white.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Hi.

                                 LUCY
                        Hi.

           Once again Sophie ushers Lucy into a bedroom that is used by 
           staff as the cloakroom. On the way they cross paths with a 
           suicide-girl WAITRESS from the previous dinner. She 
           acknowledges Lucy with a friendly nod.

           In the bedroom Lucy takes off her coat, then her dress. We 
           see she is wearing a new lingerie ensemble: a pale pink lace-
           trimmed balconette bra, pale pink stain panties that tie at 
           the side, pale pink suspender belt and cream stockings. Once 
           again, ultra-feminine.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Very beautiful.

                                 LUCY
                        You look good. Your hair looks 
                        great.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Oh. Ta.

           Sophie gestures with an invisible lipstick.

           Lucy goes to the bathroom and does her make-up, quickly 
           applying a natural shade of lipstick. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        It gets a little easier. But it’s 
                        never easy.

           Lucy nods in appreciation.

                                 LUCY
                        How long have you been doing this?

           Sophie gives her a long hard stare.

                                 SOPHIE
                        What sort of question is that?

           Lucy realises her gaff.

                                 LUCY
                        Sorry.

CAR/CITY STREET– NIGHT

           Lucy is in the back of the car, being driven by her allocated 
           driver. 

           She toys with the envelope of cash in her hand.

                                 LUCY
                        Just at the corner, thanks.

                                 DRIVER
                        No problem, darl.

           The car pulls over. Lucy gets out. She waits for the car to 
           disappear out of sight before she turns in the other 
           direction.

           She walks along the street until she reaches the moneyed bar, 
           her haunt. 

           INT. BAR – NIGHT

           Lucy makes a noticeable entrance and without hesitation 
           orders herself a drink.

           Soon she is joined by a businessman, tie loosened.

                                 BUSINESSMAN
                        May I?

                                 LUCY
                        Be my guest.

                                 BUSINESSMAN
                        Some people fake their deaths - I’m 
                        faking my life.

                                 LUCY
                        You’re doing a good job.

           He raises his glass to her; she raises hers. She studies him 
           closely. She is full of indiscriminate love so appears warm, 
           loving, friendly.

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        I have something to show you.

           She inches up her dress and reveals the top of her stockings. 

           The businessman is impressed but is not lecherous.

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                         (absolute sincerity)
                        I would really love to suck your 
                        cock.

Lucy nods in affirmation.

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Say yes.

           A slow smile spreads on the businessman’s face.

                                 BUSINESSMAN
                        Hallelujah.

           INT. BOARDING HOUSE LANDING/ BIRDMANN’S APARTMENT- MORNING

           Early the next morning Lucy is at Birdmann’s door. She is 
           wearing clothes from the night before; her hair is a mussed-
           up bird’s nest.

           She does the secret knock: tap, tap-tap, tap-tap, tap.

           She puts her ear to the door. She repeats the secret knock, 
           more quietly this time.

           Afte a while the door opens. Birdmann is wearing pyjamas 
           buttoned to the neck and a full-length dressing gown belted 
           at the waist. On his feet: a garish pair of fluffy slippers.

                                 BIRDMANN
                        Hello Lucy. What time is it?

                                 LUCY
                        Morning.

           She gives him a kiss on the cheek. They go into his room: the 
           bed has been hastily made.

           Birdmann steps into the toilet: we hear the sound of 
           vomiting. He emerges as if nothing has happened.

                                 BIRDMANN
                        Can I get you anything? Coffee?

                                 LUCY
                        Coffee. Thanks.

           He puts on an electric kettle. 

           She plonks down on the sofa.

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Birdmann, will you marry me?

                                 BIRDMANN
                        Yes.

                                 LUCY
                        Thank you.

                                 BIRDMANN
                        Not at all.

                                 LUCY
                        That’s very kind of you.

                                 BIRDMANN
                        A pleasure.

           They share a small gentle smile at what they both know to be 
           untrue.

           He spoons some instant coffee into a mug and adds boiling 
           water, hands slightly trembling.  He brings the coffee over 
           to her, cupping it on both hands to hold it steady. Ta. He 
           settles slowly onto the sofa, wincing at the pain in his 
           side. There is a strong tenderness between them.

                                 BIRDMANN
                        I’m ready, I think. I think I’m 
                        nearly ready.

                                 LUCY
                        We could get you back into detox. I 
                        could. Me. I could, I’m flush.

                                 BIRDMANN
                        Thank you. I don’t think I’d make 
                        it this time....(long pause). 

                                 LUCY
                         (gentle)
                        I think you could.

                                 BIRDMANN
                        Do you believe that?

                                 LUCY
                        I don’t know.

           He turns on the TV and they snuggle together to watch the 
           nature footage with the sound turned down.

           We see the nature footage: a marsupial mouse blinking and 
           hopping, looking direct to camera.

           EXT. CAMPUS - CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON

           Another day. Lucy – now in jeans, fresh-faced – is waiting 
           outside the lecture theatre while the outgoing STUDENTS 
           stream past. 

           One girl waves; she returns the wave.

           Her phone rings. She checks to see who it is before she 
           answers.

                                 LUCY
                        Hey Thomas. Long time, no hear.

                        I’d be happy to do what I can. Try 
                        me.

                        I understand.

                        Sorry? (Brows raised in disbelief)

                        For how long? 

                        That’s it? 

                        How much? (Again, brows raised.)

                        Smooth as a baby’s bottom. 

                        OK, yes, I understand. Bye.

           She returns the phone to her jacket pocket. She quickly looks 
           over her shoulder to see if anyone had been eavesdropping. 
           No. She disappears into the theatre.

LANEWAY - MORNING

           Lucy is walking confidently along the laneway; she is 
           casually dressed. She has her knapsack with her. It is a 
           clear blue-sky day.

           Up ahead the driver - in sunglasses - waits in the pick-up 
           spot.

           She pulls off a handful of berries as she goes past the 
           trees, scattering most as she walks along.

                                 DRIVER
                        Morning.

                                 LUCY
                        Hey. 

           He opens the door for her and she climbs aboard. 

           Inside, she opens her palm and deliberately lets the last red 
           berries drop to the floor.

           The driver activates the automatic door locks.

           They drive away.

           EXT. COUNTRYSIDE/ INT. CAR - DAY

           Lucy observes the countryside through the car window: this is 
           a long drive.

           Countryside: powerlines cut through swathes of green; filthy 
           muddied sheep; abandonned vehicles; blackened trees with fine 
           furry leaf-cover, post bushfire.

           She leans forward as if to ask the driver a question: draws 
           back.

           On second thoughts she leans forward again.

                                 LUCY
                        Can we stop at the next petrol 
                        station? I need to pee.

                                 DRIVER 
                         (long pause) 
                        Of course.

           She turns back to the countryside. Rests her cheek against 
           the glass window.

GREAT GATEWAY – DRIVEWAY - MANSION - DUSK

           As dusk falls they draw close to a great gateway. The iron-
           grille gate has a sophisticated electronic surveillance 
           system. The driver removes his sunglasses and undergoes a 
           scan of the iris.

           The gates open and they pass through. They ascend a pebbled 
           allée lined with linden trees.

           A beautiful heritage mansion comes into view. An immaculately 
           landscaped garden. A bucolic paradise.

           There is another car parked in the circular driveway.

           As Lucy gets out of her car she notices Thomas helping 
           another GIRL – same looks and age as Lucy – toward the parked 
           car. They seem to have come from around the side of the 
           house. This girl can hardly stand. One arm is slooped around 
           Thomas’ shoulder. With a curt nod he acknowledges Lucy’s 
           arrival. He bundles the second girl into the car.

           INT. MANSION - GRAND FOYER/LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Now Lucy sees Clara emerge through the front door. As ever, 
           she is impeccably dressed in a pale skirt and jacket, 
           stockings, heels. Not a hair out of place. She discreetly 
           raises a hand in welcome.

                                 CLARA
                        Come in, come through. Thank you 
                        for coming.

           She shows Lucy through the house into a luxurious but austere 
           living room.

                                 CLARA
                        Welcome to my home. I hope the trip 
                        wasn’t too gruelling.

                                 LUCY
                        No, it was fine, thank you.

                                 CLARA
                        Wonderful. Perhaps a shower might 
                        refresh you after the long drive. 
                        There’s a bathroom at the end of 
                        the corridor, on the left. You’ll 
                        find a robe behind the door. 

                                 LUCY
                        Alright.

           She heads down the corridor.

                                 CLARA
                         (afterthought)
                        Oh - try not to let your hair get 
                        wet.

           Lucy nods.

           INT. MANSION - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Clara is sitting on a sofa. On the low table in front of her 
           is a silver tray laden with an antique fine porcelain tea-
           set: a tea-pot, a cup, a saucer. There is also a slender 
           silver whisk and a square of silk cloth on the tray. Clara in 
           not doing anything at all: she sits perfectly still with her 
           hands folded in her lap.

           The sound of a door closing shut and Lucy returning to the 
           room. Clara’s expression does not change in the slightest. 
           She remains implacable.

           Lucy sits herself down nearby Clara. She, too, appears self-
           possessed, implacable. She is wearing a long silk kimono, 
           tied at the waist. She deposits her incongruously ugly 
           knapsack (filled with her clothes) by her barefeet. She takes 
           a good long look at the tea-set.

                                 LUCY
                        I’m ready.

                                 CLARA
                        Are you feeling well?

                                 LUCY
                        Pardon.

                                 CLARA
                        Are you in good health?

                                 LUCY
                        I’m fine.

           Clara is satisfied. With ceremonial grace she very slowly 
           prepares a tea for Lucy. First she opens the tea-pot and 
           stirs the tea with the whisk:  a meditative movement 
           performed with great concentration. 

           She returns the whisk to the tray and drys it carefully with 
           the silk cloth. Folds the cloth.

           She slowly pours the tea and then hands over the cup in a 
           deferential manner.

                        You will go to sleep: you will wake 
                        up. It will be as if those hours 
                        never existed.

                        You won’t even dream. For an hour 
                        or two after you wake you will feel 
                        - yes, slightly groggy - and then - 
                        fine. Perfectly fine. Not nearly as 
                        bad as a hangover. Such a sleep 
                        works wonders. You will feel - 
                        Profoundly Restored. 

           Lucy listens and slowly sips her tea.

           INT. SLEEPING BEAUTY CHAMBER - NIGHT

           This is the Sleeping Beauty bedchamber. A spare and austere 
           refinement. A low platform queen-size bed. A bedside table 
           with a delicate lamp. No windows. Lucy is asleep, naked, 
           under snowy-white sheets.

           Two figures enter the room: Clara and the host of the first 
           dinner party, MAN 1. They sit straight-backed at the end of 
           the bed; Lucy lies between them. A formal composition.

                                 MAN 1
                        Thank you, Clara.

           Clara acknowledges his thanks with a small nod.

                         (addressing the camera)
                        A few months ago a strange thing 
                        happened. For the first time in  - 
                        in a long time - I was idling 
                        through my bookshelves when - for 
                        no good reason - I noticed a book 
                        that I would have sworn didn’t 
                        belong to me. I picked it up and 
                        soon discovered that yes, it was 
                        mine. It was mine because it bore a 
                        dedication from brother, he’d given 
                        it to me for my birthday. A 
                        collection of short stories. And 
                        what’s more- I had definitely read 
                        it, once upon a time - even though 
                        I would have sworn I hadn’t - 
                        because I saw I’d turned down a few 
                        pages, dog-earred them - the way I 
                        do when I’m working through 
                        something. Well, I started to 
                        reread one of the stories.

                        It was about a year in the life of 
                        a man who one morning wakes up and 
                        can’t bring himself to get out of 
                        bed...he shuts his eyes in self-
                        defence...He re-evaluates his life, 
                        is seized by restlessness, he packs 
                        his bags and cuts all ties...He can 
                        no longer live among the people he 
                        knows, they paralyse him..He’s 
                        moneyed, he goes to Rome...is 
                        generally tormented...He wants to 
                        burrow under the earth like a bulb, 
                        like a root...but even in Rome he 
                        can’t escape people from his former 
                        life...He decides to return to the 
                        city where he was born and 
                        educated, where he pays taxes - but 
                        which he can’t quite call 
                        home...but it all goes pear-shaped 
                        or I should say..remains pear-
                        shaped...What does he do? He leaves 
                        town again, back to Rome. He 
                        desires an extreme solution to his 
                        conundrum...a desire to act 
                        ruthlessly...He aches for no less 
                        than a new world, a new 
                        language...Nothing changes. Out of 
                        indifference, exhaustion and 
                        because he can’t think of anything 
                        better to do he decides to go back 
                        to his hometown. He abandons his 
                        train journey to do some hitching. 
                        A man picks him up, they ride off 
                        into the night until - bang - they 
                        smack into a wall. The driver dies, 
                        our man is hospitalised, broken up. 
                        Months pass - his wounds heal. Now 
                        he wishes for life. He has a 
                        confidence in himself, in things he 
                        doesn’t have to prove - things like 
                        the pores in his skin, all things 
                        corporeal. He can’t wait to get out 
                        of the hospital, away from the 
                        infirm and the moribund...”I say 
                        unto thee rise up and walk, none of 
                        your bones are broken!!”..The End. 
                        When I reread those words - hearing 
                        them with my inner ear or whatever 
                        inner faculty it is that we have 
                        for absorbing language -  I say 
                        unto thee rise up and walk, none of 
                        your bones are broken - I felt a 
                        tremendous sadness. Do you know 
                        what the first line of the story 
                        is? “When a man enters his 
                        thirtieth year people will not stop 
                        calling him young.” 30!

                        I’d been given the book for my 30th 
                        birthday! “The Thirtieth Year” by 
                        Ingeborg Bachmann, an Austrian. So- 
                        I’d heard; I’d been told; I knew 
                        all along even if I didn’t really 
                        know. The great true things are 
                        unsuprising...But what did I do 
                        back then? I carried on. I carried 
                        on dutifully. We were The Happy 
                        Couple, Elizabeth and I. That’s how 
                        people saw us.  But in truth I did 
                        not cherish my wife. And I didn’t 
                        cherish my friends or even my 
                        children. I just - carried on. I 
                        was a success, I made my way but at 
                        each step I cringed...I was on the 
                        defensive, the back foot. And now - 
                        tonight I tell you,for all these 
                        years I’ve known you and now for 
                        the first time I say - my bones are 
                        broken. Broken. One day I will need 
                        your help... All of my bones are 
                        broken.

           Clara, placid, lets this speech settle between them. Long 
           pause.

                                 CLARA
                        You are safe, there is no shame 
                        here. No-one will see you.

           He nods.

                        Our rules must be respected. No

           She gracefully stands and leaves the room.

           He takes off his jacket. He unbuttons his shirt. White-wiry 
           hair on his chest. A sack of loose skin. An old man.

           He stands and unbuckles his belt. He removes his trousers. 
           And then he removes his silk boxer shorts. Now he is 
           completely and utterly naked. He sits close to the girl for a 
           minute, feels the warmth of her leg through the sheets. Then 
           he hauls himself onto the bed, under the sheets. He lies his 
           full length against her. Holds her tight.

           He pulls away from her and draws down the sheet to marvel at 
           her beauty. He tenderly tucks a strand of hair behind her 
           ear. He observes her closely; she moves a little to be more 
           comfortable, an unconscious bodily adjustment that happens 
           during sleep.

           (cid:13)           He kisses her on the back of the neck. Lucy remains in a deep 
           sleep and does not respond.

           He picks up a limp soft hand and holds it in his veined 
           mottled old hand. He carefully kisses each finger, one by 
           one. He venerates her beauty; he cherishes her.

                                 MAN 1
                        My beauty, my dearest darling.

           He begins to kiss her all over. All the way down her legs. He 
           kisses her toes. 

           He gently rolls her onto her belly. At first she is face-down 
           in the pillow – for a long moment - then he lifts her head 
           and lays it one side on the pillow so that she can breathe.

           He cups her arse in his hands. He lies down beside her and 
           gently rubs one hand in the groove of her arse cheeks. A 
           repetitive, meditative movement that brings him 
           transcendental ecstatic peace.

           EXT. MANSION DRIVEWAY - MORNING

           The next morning Lucy is being helped by Thomas to walk  from 
           the house and into the parked car on the driveway. She is 
           only slightly groggy, not staggering. 

           Clara watches from the doorway.

           Her driver holds open the door.

           She gets in, Thomas hands over her knapsack.

                                 LUCY
                         (weak)
                        Thanks.

                                 THOMAS
                        Take care. Safe trip. You’ll feel 
                        better very soon. 

           Lucy grimaces like she doesn’t believe him.

           He shuts the door. The car pulls away.

           Clara wanders over to Thomas. She waves goodbye to the 
           disappearing car.

                                 CLARA
                        Your instinct was right.

                                 THOMAS
                        We’ll see...the perfect sleeper.

           Goodbye. The car disappears from view.

STUDENT TERRACE HOUSE - KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Lucy has arrived home to find another note left for her on 
           the table. “LUCY”. It pisses her off to see it there. She 
           turns away to go to her room - leaving the note unread- then 
           on second thought turns back and begins to read it.

           Bad news. She lays down the piece of paper. Exhausted, she 
           can’t believe she has one more burden to bear.

           Behind her, Chris  appears at the entrance to the room. He 
           watches her.

           She turns to see him – surprised that he has been watching.

                                 LUCY
                        You really are a fuckwit.

                                 CHRIS
                        Two weeks then you’re out. Adios 
                        amigo.

                                 LUCY
                        Que lo pario, la puta que le pario. 
                        Vete a la mierde. Chinga tu madre.

                                 CHRIS
                        Whatever.

           Shell comes to stand beside him. She cups his elbow in a 
           placatory gesture. 

                                 SHELL
                         (kindly to Lucy)
                        I’m really sorry.

                                 LUCY
                         (conciliatory)
                        Me too.

           INT. REAL ESTATE OFFICE - DAY

           Lucy, dressed up in a conservative way, enters the small real 
           estate office. A bell tinkles.

           The AGENT is a jolly besuited man in his 30’s, working at his 
           desk behind the reception counter.

                                 AGENT
                        Good morning.

                                 LUCY
                        Hi.
                                                               (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)

He 
           leaves her to it.

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Is this Excelon still available?

                                 AGENT
                        That’s right. Fan-tastic place. 
                        Heart of the city, close to 
                        everything. I have keys and can 
                        show you if you’d like.

                                 LUCY
                        Don’t worry, I’m sure the Excelon 
                        will be excellent.

                                 AGENT
                        Right. But its better to see it.

                                 LUCY
                        It’s OK.

           The agent studies her for a long moment.

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        I have a friend in the building.

                                 AGENT
                        OK, sure, if that’s the case we can 
                        do that. No law against it. Buyer 
                        beware and all that. So do you have 
                        photo ID?

                                 LUCY
                        Yes.

           She fumbles in her bag and produces her wallet. She shows him 
           the ID. He scrutinises it.

                                 AGENT
                        Fan-tastic. There’s some paperwork. 
                        You know how it is, a stitch in 
                        time saves nine.

           Lucy pretends to be amused.

           He takes out a lease form. Starts filling in a few details. 

                                 AGENT (CONT’D)
                         (to himself)
                        Lucy. Loocy. Lucy-loo. Skip to the 
                        Loocy, my darling.

           He interrupts this form-filling to ask:
                                (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                 AGENT (CONT’D)

                        I’ll need your last two pay-slips.

           Lucy hesitates. He holds his pen mid-air then puts it down. 
           Gives her a querying look.

                                 LUCY
                        I have independent means. Family.

                                 AGENT
                        That’s fine. Fine. We’ll just need 
                        someone - Mum or Dad - to go 
                        guarantor. 

           Lucy reaches into her bag and pulls out a huge envelope of 
           cash. She forks out a large wad, hands it over to him.

                                 LUCY
                        I prefer to pay in  cash. That’s 3 
                        months rent in advance.

           The Agent looks at the cash. He counts it. He looks at her 
           without saying anything, weighing his options, undecided. 

           Lucy forks over more cash - a substantial amount.

                                 LUCY
                        Meet Daddy.

           The Agent acquiesces, takes the money. The deal is done.

           INT. BIRDMANNS’ DOORWAY - DAY

           Later that day Lucy is at Birdmann’s door. She has bottles of 
           vodka and a plastic bag of muesli slung around her wrist.

           She does the secret knock: Tap, tap-tap, tap-tap, tap.

           She waits.

           She repeats the knock. Loud. Tap, tap-tap, tap-tap, tap.

           She rests her cheek against the door, listens.

           She knocks a third time, very gently: Tap, tap-tap, tap-tap, 
           tap.

           She waits and listens. Saddened.

           She settles the bottles of vodka and bag of groceries outside 
           the door.

           (cid:13)           INT. THE EXCELON- BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The new modern bedroom. Halogen lights, mirrored built-ins. 
           Sleek and sterile. Lucy is lying naked on her old futon, 
           which is still propped up on milk-crates. Around the room are 
           cheap brightly-chequered plastic bags full of unpacked 
           clothes; an array of unpacked cardboard boxes: she has just 
           moved in.

           She lies still. Eyes open; eyes closed; eyes open She reaches 
           across to switch on a lamp that sits on the carpeted floor. 

           She gets out of bed and rummages around in one of the plastic 
           bags until she finds a pair of panties. She puts these on - 
           as though they might afford her some protection.

           She clambers back into bed and after a moment she 
           deliberately pulls up the sheet to ensure her breasts are 
           covered. There, now she is safe.

           INT. PHOTOCOPY ROOM - DAY

           Once more Lucy is patiently photocopying. Page after page 
           after page. Repetition. 

           She goes over to the documents table and picks up a new pile 
           of papers. Then she thinks better of it and puts down the 
           papers. She takes out her mobile and makes a call. Returns to 
           the machine with the papers, talking and copying at the same 
           time.

                                 LUCY
                        Hello Thomas, this is Sara.

                        Very well, thank you.

                        I was hoping Clara was out of her 
                        meeting.

                        Ok – Listen, Thomas, perhaps you 
                        can help me. The thing is I have a 
                        new lease and I need some work.

                        Thanks, if you could keep me in 
                        mind I’d be grateful.

                        OK, thanks Thomas, Bye.

           That’s done. Shhk, shhk, shhk: the machine collates a hundred 
           copies.

MEDICAL SCIENCE LAB – DAY

           On another day Lucy is back in the medical science lab. She 
           is in the chair with the plastic tube running from deep in  
           her chest to the machine. The student doctor is taking a 
           pressure measurement. 

           Finished he takes up the syringe and injects more air into 
           the tube, reconnects it. 

                                 STUDENT DOCTOR
                        And again, just a little more this 
                        time. You’re doing well, my little 
                        Frankenstein. 

           Lucy rolls her eyes. He smiles kindly at her.

                                 STUDENT DOCTOR
                        Nearly done. 

           He makes a note of the new measurement.

           Her phone rings and even though she has the tube in her mouth 
           she finds the phone in her pocket and checks to see who has 
           called.

                                 LUCY
                         (garbled)
                        Hey.

           She signals to him to get the tube out of her mouth. He 
           hurries over, very worried. Slowly, slowly he pulls out the 
           tube.

                                 STUDENT DOCTOR
                        Ok, it’s OK.

           Once the tube is out Lucy gives a little cough, wipes her 
           mouth.

                                 LUCY
                        Sorry, important call. I have to 
                        take it. I’ll be back.

           What can he do? 

                                 STUDENT DOCTOR
                        OK. Bad Frankenstein. 

                                 LUCY
                        See, I’m leaving my bag. I promise. 
                        Two minutes. 

                                 STUDENT DOCTOR
                         (shrugs)
                        OK.

           She leaves the room.

           INT. SLEEPING BEAUTY CHAMBER - NIGHT

           Lucy is asleep, naked, under snowy-white sheets, in the 
           austere Sleeping Beauty Chamber.

           Two figures enter the room: this time it is Clara and the man 
           who deliberately tripped Lucy at the first dinner party, MAN 
           2. They sit straight-backed at the end of the bed; Lucy lies 
           between them. A formal composition.

                                 CLARA
                        There is the one rule: no 
                        penetration.

                                 MAN 2
                        The only way I can get hard these 
                        days is if I take a truckload of 
                        viagra and then a beautiful woman 
                        jams her finger up my arse. I’m the 
                        one who needs penetration and I 
                        don’t expect that good fortune 
                        tonight.

                                 CLARA
                        You are quite right.

                                 MAN 2
                        Thank you, Clara.

           She gracefully stands, departs.

           He takes a silver cigarette case out his jacket pockets and 
           lights a cigarette. Inhales, exhales.

           He balances his lit cigarette on the edge of the bedside 
           table, with the glowing end off the wood.

           He slowly undresses. He is barrel-chested with a big gut.

           He retrieves his cigarette, inhales, and studies Lucy: she 
           has rolled over so that he faces her back.

           He reaches across the bed and slowly, purposefully 
           extinguishes the lit cigarette on the soft plain of Lucy’s 
           shoulder blade. She does not react.

           He returns the cigarette to the bedside table and then 
           manoeuvres into bed.

           He reaches under the sheets and pulls her knee back.

                                 MAN 2
                        Spread your cunt, dumb bitch. 
                        That’s good, good girl.

                        I’ll press your button and get you 
                        wet and fuck you with my big stiff 
                        prick, my fucking horse’s prick, 
                        till you fucking scream.

           He tires of this futile attempt to arouse her. He lies back 
           and rests his head between his hands. Then - on sudden 
           thought - he grabs her by the hair and jerks her head around.

           He presses himself close to her and starts to slowly lick her 
           face. He leers and licks every inch of her face. Her cheeks, 
           nose, forehead, eyelids. It is obscene.

                                 MAN 2
                        Whore. (Lick). Fucking bitch. 
                        (Lick). Cunt. (Lick).

           This is an excruciating scene of utter degradation.

           INT/EXT. - CAR - COUNTRYSIDE - MORNING 

           Lucy is on her way home in the car, her face pressed to the 
           window, observing the countryside.

           She turns away from the window and takes off her jacket. She 
           rolls down the shoulder of her top, trying to get a view of 
           what pains her. She wriggles but can’t see the burn mark as 
           it is in her blindspot.

           She frowns and returns to staring out the window. The driver 
           makes no comment.

           Countryside. Flat mud-ploughed fields.

           EXT. CAMPUS - CORRIDOR - TUTORIAL ROOM- DAY

           Another day. Lucy walks the length of the campus corridors. 
           She has lost the usual spring in her step. 

           A long walk.

           She enters the tutorial room and finds a seat. The rest of 
           the rows around her fill with fellow students. 

           The lecture begins: this is an advanced mathematics lecture. 

                                 LECTURER
                        Good morning.

           He writes a complex logarithm on the white board.

           Lucy copies the logarithm step by step in her notebook. The 
           other students all do the same - concentrating intently.

           She feels her phone vibrate in her jacket and quickly pulls 
           it out, checks the caller.

           (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                           (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                 LUCY
                         (whispering)
                        Hi.

           Her neighbouring student glares at her.

                                 LUCY
                        I’m coming.

           She packs up her stuff and to the chagrin of her fellow 
           students climbs over them, one by one. It’s a major 
           disruption. 

           The lecturer pauses. 

           Only when she leaves the room does he resume the proof of the 
           algorithm.

           EXT. CAMPUS - DAY

           Lucy power-walks through the campus, at times almost breaking 
           into a run. A new-found determination, vigour, urgency.

           She reaches the cab-rank and arranges a ride.

           The cab drives away.

           INT.  BOARDING HOUSE LANDING/BIRDMANN’S APARTMENT- DAY

           A little later. Lucy does the secret knock at Birdmann’s 
           door: Tap, tap-tap, tap-tap, tap.

           She listens for a response inside. Nothing.

           Quick - she has her distinctive set of keys ready in hand. 
           One of these keys fits his door; she’s had it all along. She 
           hurries down the hallway into the living area.

           The place is spotless. Birdmann is in bed. He is wearing damp 
           pyjama’s, buttoned to the neck. The mattress has a yellowed 
           sweat stain. He is gaunt, unshaven and very, very sick. His 
           eyes are heavy-lidded. He can’t move.

           There are two empty bottle of vodka on the table. Two empty 
           silver plastic pill packets. 

           She quickly inspects the packets.

                                 LUCY
                        It’s OK, I’m here. I’m here.

           He studies her; he is barely compus mentus. It takes all his 
           strength to faintly smile. She returns a tender look. He 
           tries to speak - he fails. Mmmmnnnnn makes a groaning mumble. 
           He trys to speak again.
                                      (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                          (cid:13)                                (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)
                   (cid:13)                                 BIRDMANN
                        Ta- take off -  top.

                                 LUCY
                        Yes, OK.

           She watches him lovingly as she slowly removes her jacket and 
           then unbuttons her blouse. She is topless. He forces another 
           small smile. 

           She carefully climbs into bed with him. 

           She can’t bear to watch his face so she gently turns him 
           over. She spoons against his back, her hands under his pyjama 
           top. Clasping him close.

                                 LUCY
                         (whisper)
                        Goodnight Birdmann. 

           His breath is deep and snaggled. She is resting her cheek 
           against his back, infinitesimally rising and falling with his 
           breath.

           Her lower lip begins to tremble, spasm. She bites down on it. 
           Tears stream down her cheeks. She doesn’t make a sound. 

           She gently rocks him to and fro.

           He is dying. She holds him close.

           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Late that night Lucy is clearing the tables at the 
           restaurant. All the diners have left. She is windexing the 
           tabletop: her movements are slow. Finished, she  clumsily 
           tips a chair upside down onto the table. It clatters to the 
           ground. She trys again.

           She is wiping down another table, around and around and 
           around,  when the COOK calls out on his way into the room:

                                 COOK
                        You right to lock up?

                                 LUCY
                         (calling back)
                        OK.

           He sees her and senses something amiss.

                                 COOK
                        You OK? Tough innings?

                                 LUCY
                        Yeah.
                                         (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                       (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                              (cid:13)           She quickly turns back to wiping down the table so that he 
           can’t see she is on the point of tears.

           He watches a moment, unsure of what to do. Leaves.

                                 COOK
                        See ya.

           She continues working.

           EXT. SUBURBAN BACKYARD - DAY

           A sunny day. Birdmann’s wake is being held in a modest 
           suburban backyard. A table of food and drink has been placed 
           on the lawn. A Hills Hoist.  There are about 15 
           mourners...his family and some of his old circle of friends. 
           It’s like a subdued BBQ. A plate of cut-sandwiches is being 
           handed around.  A young family member is wandering with a 
           camera making a memorial video. No-one is crying. 

           Lucy is standing at the end of the garden, aside from the 
           others, observing the scene - and talking to MARK. Mark is  
           one of the old friends: once her boyfriend. He wears a suit 
           for the occasion. She is in her best dress and heels. She is 
           drinking red wine.

                                 LUCY
                        I love drinking. I’m good at it.

                                 MARK
                        When did you last see him?

                                 LUCY
                        About three or four months ago. I 
                        took him out to dinner. I think he 
                        was wearing your old suit. The grey 
                        one.

           Mark nods.

                                 MARK
                        I hadn’t seen the Birdmann 
                        in...well, how long is it since I 
                        saw you. A year?... They say it was 
                        two weeks before his brother found 
                        him. Two weeks in this weather.

                                 LUCY
                        Will you marry me?

           Mark is taken aback: angry and astonished. He tries to keep 
           his voice down.

                                 MARK
                        What! Why now? Why now! You had 
                        your chance.

                         (sincere)
                        Go on.

                                 MARK
                        Fuck you. Fuck you to death.

                                 LUCY
                        That’s one way to put it.

                                 MARK

                        I’m with Helen now. I can’t believe 
                        you. I don’t believe you. You don’t 
                        believe you. Fuck it.

           He is visibly distressed. Lucy doesn’t speak. Her gaze is 
           provocative, bemused. She means what she says even if it is 
           an impossible ask.

                         (composing himself, 
                          priggish)
                        Helen is courteous. You should try 
                        it. Courtesy.

                                 LUCY

                        Courtesy.

           INT. SLEEPING BEAUTY CHAMBER - NIGHT

           Lucy is asleep, naked, under snowy-white sheets, in the 
           austere Sleeping Beauty Chamber.

           She adjusts herself in her sleep.

           Two figures enter the room: this time it is Clara and another 
           old man from the dinner party, MAN 3. They sit straight-
           backed at the end of the bed; Lucy lies between them. A 
           formal composition.

                                 CLARA
                        You will be safe. There is no shame 
                        here. No-one can see you.

                                 MAN 3
                        Thank you, Clara.

                                 CLARA
                        I ask, though, that there be no 
                        penetration. I also ask that you 
                        take care not to leave a mark. No 
                        marks.

           (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                 MAN 3
                         (nods)
                        Thank you.

           She gracefully stands and leaves the room.

           Soon after she is gone he stands up. He unbuttons his shirt. 
           Still in his trousers, he lifts the sheet and then pulls Lucy 
           by the legs, down to the end of the bed. He turns her so that 
           she lies horizontally across the end of the bed. It is 
           difficult to manoeuvre her limp body.

           He bends and picks her up in his arms. She is heavy, a dead-
           weight. Her head flops back; he tries to cradle it.

           He walks with her around the room, lumbering. She weighs 
           heavy. 

           He is returning to the bed, when he has a back spasm and he 
           lets her drop. She falls onto the edge of the mattress then 
           slides to the floor.

           He, too, drops to the ground and grips his back. On all 
           fours. He is in pain.

           She is splayed on the ground. Limp.

           He is alarmed by what he has done. He crawls over to her and 
           checks to see if she is still breathing, is still asleep. She 
           is.

           He clambers up and then struggles to get her back into the 
           bed. This is a long physical struggle. He has tears in his 
           eyes.

           At last he succeeds. He positions her once more as the 
           sleeper. 

           Then he sits by the bedside table and - weary - slowly 
           unbuckles his belt.

           INT. PHOTOCOPY ROOM – DAY

           The red-lipped colleague is working the photocopier. She is 
           banging papers around, muttering under her breath. To her 
           great frustration, when she tries to remove a staple from a 
           document she breaks a fingernail.

                                 COLLEAGUE 2

                          manicure)

           (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                       (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                    (cid:13)                     (cid:13)                         (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                              (cid:13)           Just as she gets back to copying Lucy shows up. Unapologetic, 
           she enters with a slight limp, as if she has a stone in her 
           shoe. She carries an injury from her fall. Dark circles under 
           her eyes from sleepless nights. 

           The colleague pointedly checks her watch.

                                 COLLEAGUE 2 (CONT’D)
                        We do fire people here, you know.

           Lucy chooses not to answer.

                                 COLLEAGUE 2 (CONT’D)
                        Well?

           Lucy remains silent.

                                 COLLEAGUE 2 (CONT’D)
                        Alright - you’re fired.

                                 LUCY
                         (without insolence)
                        Thank you.

           The colleague swallows a bitter laugh of disbelief, turns 
           back to the machine.

           INT. HYPER-MALL - DAY

           Later that day. Lucy is walking through an artificially lit 
           hyper-mall. 

           Past elaborate islands of indoor plants. Past a man who has 
           two dogs on a leash: a wolf-like Alsatian and a tiny toy-
           poodle. The universe is out of kilter.

           She walks with self-possessed determination despite her limp.

           INT.  HYPER-MALL - SPY SHOP - DAY

           Lucy peruses goods in a Spy Shop that sells CCTV, listening 
           devices, night vision, surveillance equipment, cameras, de-
           bugging, alarms, transmitters... There are CCTV cameras 
           active all around the small store. Out of the corner of her 
           eye she clocks herself onscreen.

           She checks out all the goods and then pauses before the 
           display of mini video cameras.

           The shop assistant is 19, spotty-faced. He’s not in a rush to 
           make a sale. She has to get his attention.

                                 LUCY

           He comes over.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Hi.

           She points to a mini-camera. Teeny-tiny.

                                 LUCY
                        What do you think of that one?

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Not bad.

           He gets it out of the glass cabinet.

           INT. TUTORIAL ROOM- DAY

           Lucy is sitting in the tutorial room, at the end of a row. 

           She has placed her new mini-video camera beside her notebook.  

           She is recording the lecture. 

           See: POV through her camera.

           This is a lecture on the game of Go. A complicated diagram is 
           projected on a screen: it shows the progress of a match. Some 
           black and white numbered circles represent the positions 
           (reference: The Master of Go, Yasunari Kawabata, Fourth Ito 
           session moves 122- 145 at p 127). As the lecturer laser-
           points to the various circles he narrates the game:

                                 LECTURER 

                        OK, back to the fourth session as 
                        narrated by Mr Kawabata in his 
                        novel The Master of Go...Let’s get 
                        Going...

           The students moan good-naturedly at his pun.

                                 LECTURER (CONT’D)
                        We open with Otake’s sealed move 
                        Black 121. The Master responded 
                        with white 122. Here. Three minutes 
                        later Black 123 brought Otake 
                        cutting back into White 
                        formation....here Black 127 turned 
                        again to the centre of the 
                        board...and Black 129 lashed out to 
                        decapitate this triangle here that 
                        the Master had so stubbornly put 
                        together. Black was showing an 
                        aggressive spirit, competitive. 
                        Nota bene.  And then....and

                        it? After 27 minutes of 
                        deliberation... Why did he ensure 
                        his own defeat?

           INT. TRAIN - DAY

           Lucy is taking the train home from university. She is sitting 
           opposite a sleeping woman, a HAIRDRESSER, late 30’s, who has 
           an elaborate J-Lo hair-do that is incongruous with her rough-
           tough pugilistic face. Lots of bling. Knuckles interlaced. A 
           New Idea magazine lies open on the hairdresser’s lap. 

           Lucy studies the sleeping hairdresser. 

           Train announcement: Attention travellers - maintain visual 
           contact with your possessions at all times.

           The sleeping woman doesn’t stir. Her magazine slides off her 
           lap onto the floor. Lucy retrieves it, holds it safe. She 
           continues to study the sleeper. 

           A little drool escapes from the sleeper’s mouth. Lucy moves 
           so that now she is sitting right beside the hairdresser. 
           Hesitating a moment, she bunches up her sleeve in her hand 
           and gingerly reaches out toward the stranger’s mouth. Closer 
           and closer. A delicate operation. She dabs away the drool. 

           Lucy remains seated beside the woman: as protective 
           safeguard. Her eyes shine with tears. After a while the 
           hairdresser lolls her head, startles awake. 

                                 LUCY
                        You dropped this.

           She returns the magazine.

                                 HAIRDRESSER
                        Thanks luv.

           A shared tiny smile.

           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           It’s the end of another night. Most of the chairs and tables 
           in the restaurant have been stacked. Lucy is vigorously 
           cleaning the last tabletops.

           The Cook is ready to leave.

                        You coming to the party?

                                 LUCY
                        Sorry, can’t. Big day tomorrow.

                                 COOK
                        How big?

                                 LUCY
                        I’m sleeping.

                                 COOK
                        What, live a little.

           From his pocket he produces two cling-wrapped white pills.

                                 COOK (CONT’D)
                        Ta-da!

                                 LUCY
                        What is it?

                                 COOK
                        Who knows. Something good for you.

                                 LUCY
                        Why not.

           They both drop a pill.

                                 COOK
                        There you go, back from the dead.

                                 LUCY
                        Fear of death is the number one 
                        hoax.

           She swings a chair up in the air. Holds it high: looks at 
           him, her eyes glint. Bang: she slams it down on the table 
           with full-force. Let the night begin. 

           EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

           Close on a calm sea under the night sky. Black water. The 
           Cook’s head emerges from the water, then Lucy’s. 

           They revel in the elements - high. No romantic kiss, no 
           childish waterfight. A small wave breaks over them. They go 
           under again. Hold their breath for as long as they can. 

           Up.

THE EXCELON- BEDROOM - MORNING

           Lucy and the Cook are sprawled naked on the bed in the 
           Excelon. The room is bereft of any homely touches. A 
           windowful of bright morning light. 

           The sound of Lucy’s phone: ring, ring, ring.

           Errgh, she groans and rolls over, she trys to lean across his 
           body so she can silence her phone but it’s out of reach. 

           Whoever it is keeps ringing.

                                 LUCY
                        You get it.

           He reaches out, fumbles around and finds her phone. He 
           switches it off. Drops it. Then he collapses back down into 
           bed. 

                                 COOK
                        What was that fucked-up shit, I’m 
                        so - ugh.

           They are both wretched and try to sleep some more.

           A moment later. Knock-knock-knock: someone is knocking at the 
           door. They ignore it.

           Knock! Knock! Knock! Knock! Knock! Knock!

           Lucy grumbles and gets out of bed. She picks a garment off 
           the floor and uses it to cover herself.

           Knock! Knock! Knock! Without cease.

                                 LUCY
                         (under her breath)
                        Yeah, yeah.

           Bleary, she opens the door.

           It’s her driver. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Shit. OK, sorry, give me three 
                        minutes.

           She shuts the door in his face. She returns to her bedroom. 

           The Cook opens one eye as if to say ‘what’s going on’.

                                 LUCY
                        Don’t move. Let yourself out.

           He goes back to sleep. Pulls the pillow around his head.

           (cid:13)           She hurriedly dresses. 

           She combs her knotty hair back in a lumpen ponytail. 

           She finds her knapsack. She rummages around under her mess 
           and unearths the mini-video camera. 

           She makes sure to pack it away deep in the knapsack. Leaves 
           the room.

           INT. EXCELON LOBBY - MORNING

           Lucy and the driver wait in the lobby for the elevator. A 
           lurid plastic plant in a large terracotta pot rests against 
           the wall. A group of CHINESE STUDENTS streams out of the 
           neighbouring apartment: six young men. Nods of 
           acknowledgement to Lucy and the driver. The students are 
           chattering in Mandarin about the day ahead. Some are off to 
           work, some are off to the library. 

           Lucy slumps against the wall, the driver unobtrusively props 
           her up.

                                 LUCY
                        Thanks.

           The door to Lucy’s apartment opens; the Cook appears in 
           unbuckled jeans, bare-chested.

           He gestures that she should come back to bed.

           Pause. She deflects the request with a slight shake of the 
           head. He gives her a chance to change her mind. She looks 
           away.

           He retreats. They continue their wait in the lobby. Now the 
           door to the Chinese students’ apartment opens and a girl runs 
           out in her pyjamas: she gives her boyfriend a packed lunch. 
           He kisses her on the cheek. When she is gone his friends make 
           a mummy’s-boy joke at his expense – which he good-naturedly 
           shrugs off. 

           The elevator arrives. The students politely offer Lucy a 
           right of way. She enters first, escorted by the driver. The 
           students pile in.

           INT/EXT CAR - COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

           Lucy sits in the back of the car, being driven through the 
           countryside. 

           Her face changes as her mouth fills with saliva: a sudden 
           nausea.

           She leans forward toward the driver.
                                     (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                         (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                       (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                     (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                       (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                 LUCY
                        Pull over! Pull over!

           He immediately pulls over. 

           She stumbles out of the car and vomits on the side of the 
           road.

           When she returns to the car he reaches back and hands her a 
           plastic bottle of water and a packet of mints. 

           She accepts, sinks down in the seat.

                                 LUCY
                        Thanks.

           They drive away.

           EXT. MANSION -DUSK

           Clara is waiting outside the house. Impeccably dressed, as 
           ever.

           Lucy gets out of the car and Clara comes over to greet her, 
           smiling.

                                 CLARA
                        Hello darling.

                                 LUCY
                        Hi.

           Lucy switches her knapsack to the shoulder furthest from 
           Clara.

           Clara is momentarily taken aback by Lucy’s appearance. As 
           they walk to the house she asks in a concerned voice:

                                 CLARA
                        Are you well?

                                 LUCY
                        Yes, fine thank-you.

                                 CLARA
                        Are you sure?

                                 LUCY
                        Yes, fine thanks.

           A valiant smile. They walk arm-in-arm, a gesture initiated by 
           Clara: an ambivalence between intimacy and frog-marching.

                                 CLARA

           INT. MANSION - LIVING ROOM - DUSK

           As before, Clara is sitting on a sofa in the living room. On 
           the low table in front of her is the silver tray laden with 
           an antique fine porcelain tea-set: a tea-pot, a cup, a 
           saucer. The silver whisk and square of silk cloth. Clara is 
           not doing anything at all: she sits perfectly still with her 
           hands folded in her lap. After this stillness she discreetly 
           checks her watch; briefly fidgets with her hair; then returns 
           to stillness.

           The sound of a door closing shut and Lucy returning to the 
           room - fresh from the shower. Clara gives slight deferential 
           nod to indicate her approval.

           Lucy sits herself down nearby Clara. She sits straight-
           backed, tall. Self-possessed.  She is wearing the long silk 
           kimono, tied at the waist. She deposits her ugly knapsack by 
           her barefeet. 

           Clara begins the tea ceremony. She is reaching out in a slow 
           ceremonial manner for the tea-pot when Lucy interrupts her: 
           though this is a great shock to Clara, a huge breach of 
           protocol, she disguises her surprise and returns her hands to 
           her lap. Implacable, she folds one hand over the other.

                                 LUCY
                        I would like to ask a favour.

           Clara doesn’t say anything. After a long moment her silence 
           is deemed consent: Lucy continues.

                                 LUCY
                        I haven’t been sleeping well. At 
                        home. I need to see what goes on, 
                        in there. Just once.

           Clara suppresses her displeasure. Long pause.

                                 CLARA
                        But how will this be possible?

           To Clara’s further surprise and displeasure Lucy slowly opens 
           her knapsack and scrabbles around: she retrieves the mini-
           video camera. 

           It is so small it fits inside her closed fist. She extends 
           this fist to Clara, opens her hand: displaying the tiny 
           camera on her palm.

           Clara remains implacable. Long pause.

                                 CLARA
                        I understand. I do understand. But 
                        my dear, my clients.

                        How can I expose them - to be frank 
                        - to blackmail. That’s not the way 
                        we do things.

                                 LUCY
                        Perhaps if you asked - just the 
                        once - they would agree. 

           Clara shakes her head.

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        I thought about that...We can hide 
                        the camera on the shelf, beside the 
                        vase. In the morning I will watch 
                        it here. Then you can destroy it. 

           Clara, implacable, sees Lucy is driving a hard bargain. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Otherwise...

           She deliberately does not complete the sentence/ultimatum.

           Clara remains calm. An almost imperceptible frown. Long 
           pause.

                                 CLARA
                        Very well.

                                 LUCY
                        Great.

           Clara resumes the tea-ceremony. Once more she discreetly 
           checks her watch.

                                 CLARA
                        And I can assume you are quite 
                        well?

           Lucy pauses, nods.

                                 CLARA (CONT’D)
                        In good health?

                                 LUCY
                        I’m perfectly fine, thank you.

                                 CLARA
                        Good girl.

           With slow cold grace she prepares the tea for Lucy.

           INT. SLEEPING BEAUTY CHAMBER - NIGHT

           Lucy is asleep, naked, under snowy-white sheets, in the 
           austere Sleeping Beauty Chamber.
                                     (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                      (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)           A figure enters the Chamber: it is Clara.

           This time she does not enter gracefully - but instead, 
           furtively. She approaches and hastily removes the hidden 
           camera: that is, Lucy’s hidden camera is our POV. We see 
           Clara’s face, her arms outreached and then we see the POV 
           bump along ground as she walks away with the camera in hand. 
           Double-cross. She leaves. 

           Back to surveying the Chamber.

           As soon as Clara has left - Sleeping Beauty awakes. 

           Lucy pulls herself together and stumbling, staggering, 
           disoriented, struggling to keep her eyes open - she gets out 
           of bed. 

           She goes to the side of the Chamber and opens a sliding panel 
           in the wall. This is where her knapsack is stored. She 
           fumbles inside and retrieves a second mini-camera.

           Bleary, fighting the drugs, she manages to hide this second

           She collapses back into bed. Gets under the sheets. Passes 
           out.

           She sleeps.

           Two figures enter the room: Clara and Man 1. This time Clara 
           walks with ceremonial grace. She is carrying the silver tea-
           tray laden with the antique porcelain tea-set, whisk and silk 
           square.

           They sit at the end of the bed. Clara to the left, the old 
           man to the right. The silver tray between them. 

           Man 1 is dressed in a suit. He has taken special care with 
           his appearance.

           Clara is implacable.

                                 MAN 1
                         (softly, gently)
                        Thank you, Clara.

           She gives him a small tender smile. She performs the tea-
           ceremony. With meditative grace she very slowly opens the tea-
           pot and stirs the tea with the whisk.

           She returns the whisk to the tray and drys it carefully with 
           the silk cloth. Folds the cloth.

           (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)           She slowly pours the tea - a long pour - and then hands the 
           cup to the old man in a deferential manner.

           He takes it and raises it one hand, rotates the cup so as to 
           admire its design. 

           Slowly, surely he begins to drink.

           She does not watch him drink but faces out. Implacable. Her 
           hands folded in her lap.

           He steadily sips his tea. He returns the cup to the tray.

                                 MAN 1
                        Thank you.

           A long pause. She is still facing out. He remains seated, 
           motionless.

           Eventually she slowly stands and picks up the tray. She 
           crosses in front of him and takes the tray over to the 
           bedside table. She carefully sets it down.  

           She walks back in front of the bed. Before she reaches the 
           door she stops and addresses the old man. A small bow.

                                 CLARA
                        Goodnight.

                                 MAN 1
                        Goodnight.

           She leaves.

           He stands and undresses.

           Naked, he gets into bed with Lucy, under the sheets. He 
           admires her. Feels her soft hair. Strokes the curve of her 
           shoulder with gentleness.

           He reaches over to the bedside table and pours himself a cup 
           of tea. Drinks.

           And another cup.

           Finished, he lies down beside her.

           They sleep: after a while the footage flickers the tiniest 
           fraction, the time and date code changes. Another flicker, 
           another time period.

           INT. SLEEPING BEAUTY CHAMBER - MORNING

           The morning-song of country birds.

           curtains. Bright bare daylight. She is perfectly groomed in a 
           new suit. Chignon. Pearls.

           Lucy and the old man are asleep in bed, under the snowy-white 
           sheet. 

           Clara walks around the front of the bed, over to the bedside 
           table nearby the old man. He lying on his side, facing toward 
           the wall. Eyes closed.

           With great self-control she bends down and thumbs his eyes 
           open. Deadman’s stare. 

           Then she thumbs them closed with complete sangfroid.

           She holds her hand under nose to make sure he is not 
           breathing. Implacable. Other than to take a deep breath she 
           betrays no emotion.

           She slowly moves to sit at the end of the bed. She rests a 
           long moment. She studies her folded hands.

           After a while she reaches for Lucy’s foot. Clara sits back a 
           little so that she can nestle Lucy’s foot in her lap. The 
           foot is still beneath the sheet.

           Clara finds Lucy’s big toe and gives it a wiggle. Then she 
           wiggles the next toe. Then the next. Then the next. A silent 
           game of ‘This Little Piggy’. Then she wiggles the little toe. 
           She runs her fingers up Lucy’s calf.

           Suddenly she is disconcerted that Lucy has utterly failed to 
           respond. A look of horror crosses her face. Animated, she 
           snatches Lucy’s foot from under the sheet and feels it: cold.

           Instantly, she abandons all composure. Ruptures. She panics.

           She crawls up onto the bed, crawls over Lucy’s body. 

           She desperately turns Lucy’s head so that she is lying face 
           up. We see Lucy is pale. Clara frantically slaps her cheeks. 

           Shakes her.

           No response. 

           Clara begins mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. 

           Three quick breaths in succession. One-two-three.

           She thumps hard on Lucy’s chest five times.

           Back to breathing: three quick breaths one-two-three.

           Thumps.
                                       (cid:13)                       (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)                          (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                       (cid:13)           Lucy gives a pathetic cough...comes alive. 

           Bafflement gives way to horror and dismay as she sees Clara 
           crouching over her. Face to face. 

           Once more, Clara grips Lucy’s nose and recommences breathing.

           Lucy groans - a deep instinctive animal groan. She pushes 
           Clara away.

           Clara climbs off Lucy and sits on the edge of the bed. She 
           tries refolding her shaking hands in her lap. 

           Behind her Lucy continues to groan. 

                                 LUCY
                        O! No!!!

                                 CLARA
                         (very quiet)
                        Get dressed.

           These groans and cries escalate, louder and louder. 

           Lucy sits upright: Lady Lazarus. She sobs and gags. 

           She flails against the wall. No! No! She smashes against the 
           mattress. 

           Howls and wails. She is - undone. Utter horror and pain. 

           She rails against being brought back into the world. 

           Her lamentations are unbearable. Excruciating. A long 
           unbearable scene. Screams and howls and wails. Outrage.

           Meanwhile Clara is sitting very still, her hands folded in 
           her lap. A prayerful monkey-grip.

           Close on her: tears slowly form in her eyes, run down her 
           cheeks. Surrounded by mayhem, she does not move an inch.  

           END
