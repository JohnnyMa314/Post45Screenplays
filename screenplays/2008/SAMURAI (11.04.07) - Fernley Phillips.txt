                                         (cid:13)           FADE IN:

           EXT. AN EERIE, WHITE MIST - DAY

           We're moving through it, unable to see clearly, our ears
           telling us we're in A LAND FAVORED BY CICADAS. All of a sudden
           we leave the mist behind, bursting into daylight:

           EXT. LAKE - DAY

           KOI glide gracefully through the tranquil waters. You'll
           find the CICADAS in the surrounding trees. They sound louder
           now. Strange, the mist hugs only the perimeter of the lake,
           as if concealing something.

           There in the center, a WALL OF ROCKS -- a formidable MAN-
           MADE ISLAND. A CENTURIES-OLD TEMPLE crowns it.

           EXT. TEMPLE - DAY

           MESMERIZING STONE LANTERNS dot the MANICURED PEBBLE GARDENS,
           each with mystical creature carved into its stonework. It's
           an enchanting place. Indeed, for there's magic here.

           INT. TEMPLE - DAY

           Silent. The cicadas cannot be heard inside.

           AT THE END OF A DARK CORRIDOR: a GLOW spills out from open
           shoji (sliding doors).

           THROUGH THE SHOJI: a MONK kneels on the tatami in front of
           an EASEL, paintbrush in hand. Many CANDLES light the room
           but we do not see what he is painting. Yet. 

           ON THE WALLS: paintings -- oil renderings of violent scenes.
           The CAMERA HOLDS on one image. Almost post-apocalyptic.

                                 MONK (V.O.)
                        "Anyone who thought the end of The
                        Onin War would see a period of calm
                        descend over the Land of the Rising
                        Sun was badly mistaken. 

           EXT. KYOTO - DAY

           It's the 15th century and Kyoto is the imperial city of Japan.
           A thriving, jaw-droppingly beautiful metropolis. GEISHA walk
           below cherry blossoms. SAMURAI resplendent in their kimonos. 
           TEMPLES only one facet of many ornate architectural wonders.

           SCREAMS, WAR CRIES, EXPLOSIONS fade in.

                                 MONK (V.O.)
                        The war began in 1467 as a dispute
                        over who should succeed the Shogun,
                        general of the military and true
                        leader of Japan. 

           TIME-LAPSE SEQUENCE:

           Days become nights and seasons change as we witness the brutal
           transformation of a city before our very eyes!

           A BUILDING BECOMES NOTHING BUT DUST. CORPSES CHOKE THE
           STREETS. RIVAL SAMURAI FIGHT IN FRESHLY DUG TRENCHES. A CRATE
           FULL OF HEADS APPEARS ON A STREET CORNER. ANARCHY PREVAILS.
           ANOTHER BUILDING GOES UP IN FLAMES. THEN ANOTHER AND ANOTHER
           UNTIL FINALLY WE ARE LEFT WITH JUST SMOLDERING RUBBLE.

                                 MONK (V.O.)
                        It ended ten years later with the
                        imperial city of Kyoto reduced to a
                        charred wasteland and the military
                        disgraced. 

           It is now nothing but the ghost of a city -- the image we
           saw in the Monk's painting.

                                 MONK (V.O.)
                        To all the feudal lords spread across
                        Japan -- of whom there numbered
                        approximately two hundred and sixty --
                        this meant only one thing:

           EXT. CASTLE - NIGHT

           BLACK SHADOWS drift towards the castle, becoming...

           ...NINJA scaling its walls under the cloak of darkness.

           INT. CASTLE - NIGHT

           A POISON DART flies through the air --

                                 MONK (V.O.)
                        Opportunity.
           -- striking the neck of a DAIMYO (feudal lord). Dead within
           seconds!  

           WE HEAR: the sound of a THOUSAND GALLOPING HORSES!

                                 MONK (V.O.)
                        Control of the country was up for
                        grabs. Neighbors became enemies. And
                        so, the end of one war... 

           (NB: WE ARE ABOUT TO WITNESS DIFFERENT SAMURAI ARMIES IN
           DIFFERENT PARTS OF JAPAN. OPPOSING SAMURAI WEAR
           ARMOR/HEADDRESS OF DIFFERENT COLORS/DESIGN AND IN EACH OF
           THESE SCENES NO COLOR/DESIGN IS REPEATED.)

           EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

           The ground shakes as TWO SAMURAI ARMIES collide on HORSEBACK! 

                                 MONK (V.O.)
                        ...spawned the beginning of another.
                        But this war was to prove unlike any
                        other in the history of Japan. Indeed,
                        it was to prove unlike any war in
                        the history of man. 

           SCREAMS OF AGONY swirl in the wind. They continue into --

           EXT. SNOW-COVERED REGION - DAY

           -- where another ferocious battle rages.

                                 MONK (V.O.)
                        Historians call it Sengoku Jidai... 

           TIME SLOWS: TWO SAMURAI exchange heavy sword blows. BLOOD
           sprays from the loser's wounds, staining the virgin snow.

                                 MONK (V.O.)
                        ...The Period of Warring States. 

           TIME QUICKENS: A SPEAR OUT OF NOWHERE RIPS THROUGH THE
           VICTOR'S CHEST! 

           EXT. RIVER - DAY

           MOUNTED SAMURAI attempt to cross the turbulent waters. They
           raise their SHIELDS to the Heavens -- 
                                 MONK (V.O.)
                        It raged across the entire country.

           -- as AN AVALANCHE OF ARROWS RAINS DOWN ON THEM!

           EXT. HILLTOP CASTLE - DAY

           SAMURAI lay siege to it.

                                 MONK (V.O.)
                        And it lasted for more than 150 years.

           EXT. BEACH - DAY

           A DAIMYO is buried in the sand up to his neck. 

                                 MONK (V.O.)
                        It was brutal.

           A RIVAL DAIMYO begins TO SAW OFF HIS HEAD!

           EXT. ONSEN (JAPANESE HOT SPRING) - DAY

           A DAIMYO soaks his battle-scarred body in the hot waters.
           It's a beautiful bamboo setting. 

                                 MONK (V.O.)
                        It was treacherous. 

           BEHIND THE LORD: a SHORT, BAMBOO TUBE moves his way. The 
           Lord grimaces. The water turns red. A (previously submersed) 
           NINJA climbs out of the water and disappears into the scenery.

           EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

           A SAMURAI kills his OPPONENT and pauses. He looks about and...

                                 MONK (V.O.)
                        It was exciting. 

           ...TIME SLOWS: all around him warriors ROAR. Swords CLASH.

           EXT. ROCKY PLATEAU - DAY

           A SAMURAI battles FIVE WARRIOR MONKS under a blazing sun.
                                 MONK (V.O.)
                        Never had there been a better time
                        to be a Samurai -- fearless warriors
                        for whom death on the battlefield...

           The Samurai's plight is never in doubt and although his death
           is horrific and bloody he does not succumb easily. 

           EXT. RICE FIELD - EVENING

                                 MONK (V.O.)
                        ...was the ultimate honor. 

           The BLOODIED HEADS OF WARRIORS SKEWERED ON STAKES glisten in
           the setting sun.

           INT. JAPANESE ROOM - DAY

           A group of SAMURAI kneel on tatami drinking tea.

                                 MONK (V.O.)
                        They lived their lives by the Bushido,
                        a code of conduct stressing simple
                        living, bravery and loyalty to one's
                        Lord. 

           The CAMERA PULLS BACK revealing...

                                 MONK (V.O.)
                        The Ninja were different. They served 
                        no Lord.

           ...a NINJA hiding in the shadows outside the room. 

           EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

           NINJA defend VILLAGERS from a BAND OF ARMED ROBBERS.

                                 MONK (V.O.)
                        Villages sometimes hired them for 
                        protection.

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           A FEUDAL LORD waits beneath the moonlight. 

                                 MONK (V.O.)
                        Their loyalty was anyone's for a 
                        silver coin or bag of rice.
           A NINJA slivers down a tree beside him and unwraps a bloody 
           dagger. The Lord hands him a coin.

                                 MONK (V.O.)
                        Perhaps.

           As the Lord leaves the Ninja throws the dagger at his back!

           EXT. MONASTERY - DAY

           HUNDREDS OF NINJA TRAINEES practice martial arts.

                                 MONK (V.O.)
                        Unscrupulous assassins, they thrived 
                        in these dark times...

           INT. MONASTERY - DAY

           More NINJA TRAINEES study poisons and how to make explosives.

                                 MONK (V.O.)
                        ...for while the Samurai code forbade 
                        guerrilla warfare... 

           INT. BANQUET HALL - EVENING

           A celebration is in progress. A SERVANT (whom we recognize 
           from the monastery) pours sake for a LORD and walks away. 

                                 MONK (V.O.)
                        ...the Ninja had no code.

           Seconds later, the Lord collapses.

           EXT. TOP OF A HIGH WATERFALL - DAY

           TWO SAMURAI fight to the death on the rocks.

                                 MONK (V.O.)
                        Japan's future would be decided by
                        the blades of swords... 

           One plunges his sword into the other's HEART, sending him
           toppling over the edge.

           A HUGE BOULDER behind the victorious Samurai slowly COMES TO
           LIFE... a previously invisible NINJA unfurling from the
           crevices like a deadly chameleon! 
                                 MONK (V.O.)
                        ...and the poison of darts.

           He fires a POISON DART at the Samurai's neck, sending him,
           too, over the waterfall!

           EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

           Knee-deep with SLAIN SAMURAI.

                                 MONK (V.O.)
                        Whichever Lord rose victorious from
                        the bloodshed would win the title of
                        Shogun and thus, control of Japan.  

           EXT. VILLAGE OUTSKIRTS - DAY

           A PEASANT drags A CARTLOAD OF SEVERED HEADS along a dusty
           road.

                                 MONK (V.O.)
                        It was a prize sought by all and the
                        history books celebrate the eventual
                        victor's name. 

           EXT. HOMESTEAD - DAY

           FLAMES scorch the sky as the homestead BURNS TO THE GROUND, 
           columns of billowing, black smoke blotting out the sun.

           The bodies of TWO NINJA are mounted on stakes out front.

                                 MONK (V.O.)
                        Yet there is a name you shall not 
                        find written in any such book.

           A SEAGULL 

           flies out of the smoke towards us. The CAMERA FOLLOWS IT --

           EXT. SKY - AERIAL SHOT - WITH THE GULL

           -- over TREETOPS, RICE FIELDS, MOUNTAINS. 

                                 MONK (V.O.)
                        It is the name of a man who was to 
                        play a pivotal role in Japan's future. 
           PLUMES OF SMOKE 

           dot the horizon in every direction. 

           The entire country of Japan is at war!

                                 MONK (V.O.)
                        Many believe him to be a myth. Others 
                        insist he was a demon, brought to 
                        our lands to do the Devil's work.

           The Gull heads out over THE COAST --

           EXT. SHIP - DAY

           -- alighting on THE MAST of a ship.

                                 MONK (V.O.)
                        For most, however, his story is 
                        unknown.

           The CAMERA TRACKS DOWN.

                                 MONK (V.O.)
                        Until now."

           A SIX-YEAR-OLD BOY

           stands at the ship's edge, gazing at the distant land mass. 
           He has PIERCING GREEN EYES and white skin and when he speaks 
           we will hear that he does so with an English accent.

           He is joined by SMITHY, a sailor.

                                 GREEN EYES
                        Father says they'll eat a fish 
                        straight out of the ocean without 
                        even cooking it.

                                 SMITHY
                        That's one of their more civilized 
                        traditions.

           The Boy considers this and in this moment we see inside the 
           boy. Full of curiosity. Full of fear. Full of innocence. 

           He turns around. 

           He is on board A MERCHANT SHIP and the deck is A MAZE OF
           CRATES. COLORFUL SAILORS prepare for arrival. 
           He scours the busy scene until he finds a MAN opening crates
           with a crowbar and checking their contents. This is the SHIP'S
           CAPTAIN and the Boy's FATHER.

           The Boy runs to him, tugging on his trousers to get attention. 

                                 BOY
                        We're almost there.

                                 THE BOY'S FATHER
                        Which means you'd best keep out from
                        under my feet or 'there' may become
                        'home'. 

           His tone is gruff and not at all father-like yet we should
           not judge him on first appearance. The next crate he opens
           is EMPTY.

                                 THE BOY'S FATHER
                            (to Smithy)
                        Smithy, what price do we get for
                        thin air in these parts of the world?

           Smithy comes and lifts a FEATHER out of the crate.

                                 SMITHY
                        The chickens, Captain. 

                                 THE BOY'S FATHER
                        Ah, yes. That was a good meal.

           SAILORS murmur in agreement. The Boy tugs on his Father's
           trousers again.

                                 BOY
                        You said I could steer the ship before 
                        we arrived.

                                 THE BOY'S FATHER
                        What I said was, you could take the 
                        wheel after a hundred days at sea.

           The Boy runs to the side where NOTCHES are cut into the wood, 
           each notch representing one day. He starts counting.

                                 THE BOY'S FATHER
                        There's ninety nine.

           The Boy, bitterly disappointed, puts on a brave face:

                                 BOY
                        Perhaps on the voyage home, when the 
                        wind will be against us?
                                 THE BOY'S FATHER
                        Perhaps.

           The Boy dips his head. His Father smiles at Smithy and wraps 
           an arm around his son's shoulders.

                                 THE BOY'S FATHER
                        Come.
                            (off the Boy's look)
                        Why should you miss out just because 
                        your old man's a gazelle on the ocean?

           The Boy beams with joy.

           EXT. MERCHANT SHIP - MOMENTS LATER

           Boy and Father at the wheel, the Boy gripping it tightly, 
           huge grin on face -- a nice, loving image.

                                 THE BOY'S FATHER
                        Are you ready?
                            (off the Boy's nod)
                        Now!

           The Boy spins the wheel.

                                 THE BOY'S FATHER
                        Close your eyes.

           The Boy does as told. The ship turns into A BAY.

                                 THE BOY'S FATHER
                        Open them!

           The Boy opens his eyes.

           WHAT HE SEES: a THOUSAND MASTS puncture the sky, SAILS 
           billowing in the breeze. This busy 15th century Japanese 
           harbor is a feast for the eyes.

           Sailors begin to lower the sails.

                                 BOY
                        Why are we stopping?

                                 THE BOY'S FATHER
                        We must wait for the harbor master
                        to send an escort to tell us where
                        to go.
           EXT. HARBOR - DAY

           The merchant ship follows a HARBOR ESCORT into dock. The
           escort is manned by SAMURAI. They do not wear armor -- just
           simple, dark blue kimonos.

           EXT. MERCHANT SHIP - DAY

           The Boy sits atop his Father's shoulders, enthralled. 

           WE SEE: boats of every shape and size. Off to one side,
           somewhat isolated from the other ships, are TWO GALLEONS,
           their sails full and glorious -- obscuring vision of anything
           that may lie behind.

           The Boy spots the galleons just as they begin pulling apart,
           revealing...

                                 BOY
                        Wow. 

           A SHIP 

           ...hiding behind them. It has near vertical sides towering
           100ft in the air and a bow reinforced with steel. This ocean-
           going behemoth defies the laws of what should be able to
           float. It is A SAMURAI WARSHIP. A sight to shudder at.

           And it is coming directly at the merchant ship!

                                 SMITHY
                        Have they not seen us?

           The Boy's Father notices the Samurai on the deck of the escort 
           (which lies between them and the warship). They are bristling.

           The warship gets closer, casting an ominous shadow as it 
           obliterates the sun.

           ON THE ESCORT: more Samurai appear. They draw their swords.

           The warship STRIKES the side of the escort! Samurai topple 
           overboard. There's a DEAFENING CRUNCH, the warship's bow 
           splintering through wood, SPLITTING THE ESCORT CLEAN IN TWO!

           The 'crash' halts the warship's advancement and shaken Samurai 
           get back on their feet, stare up at the monster in their 
           midst. The feeling of dread that the worst is yet to come is 
           palpable... and very true...
           HUGE TRAP-DOORS 

           in the sides of the warship drop open. From the shadowy depths 
           within --

           SAMURAI ON HORSES 

           emerge! They wear ARMOR over BLOOD RED KIMONOS and gallop 
           into the light, JUMPING OFF THE WARSHIP AND SAILING THROUGH 
           THE AIR TOWARDS THE ESCORT! 

           There are FLASHES from steel raised in the sunlight and when 
           the horses touch down, SWORDS slice through the surviving 
           Samurai!

           A LONE SAMURAI ON A HORSE

           appears at the front of the warship's bow. He wears an
           INTIMIDATING, HORNED HEADPIECE and is in charge of this
           assault, watching the carnage below him with cold, heartless
           eyes before turning his attention to the merchant ship where
           he locks eyes with the Boy's Father. 

           He backs his horse away from the edge, disappearing from 
           view. Seconds pass. 

           He reappears, horse and master leaping into the air. A demonic 
           silhouette! He lands on the deck of the quickly sinking escort 
           with an ALMIGHTY THUD!

           THE BOY'S FATHER 

           moves hurriedly to the empty crate. He lowers his son inside.

                                 BOY
                        What are you doing?

           He rubs his son's cheek and stares into his eyes, knowing he 
           shall likely never see him again, then leans in and kisses 
           him on the forehead before placing the lid onto the crate 
           and -- 

                                 THE BOY'S FATHER
                        I love you.

           -- securing it down. He drags the crate to the edge and, 
           veins bursting, hauls it up until it teeters on top.
           The Boy's hands thrust out of the slots in the side. He clings 
           desperately to his Father, not wanting to let go.

                                 BOY
                        Father!

           His Father pushes the crate overboard, the weight wrenching 
           his son's hands from his shirt. 

                                 BOY
                        No!

           The crate plummets into the water with an ALMIGHTY SPLASH! 
           It floats, bobbing up and down on the waves.

           BACK ON THE ESCORT - A WAR RAGES

           the blood red Samurai killing all in their path. Parts of it 
           are ON FIRE. Through this smoking, bloody mayhem the lone 
           Samurai comes, his horse's canter becoming a gallop as...

           ...HE LEAPS FROM THE ESCORT TO THE MERCHANT SHIP!

           SMITHY 

           grabs the crowbar and bravely rushes him. 

           THE LONE SAMURAI 

           unsheathes his sword.

           TIME SLOWS. The sword swings through the air with a TERRIFYING 
           SWOOSH. 

           SMITHY'S HEAD 

           falls to the ground!

           You now know this Samurai's name. THE DECAPITATOR. Fear him.

           More blood red Samurai arrive on the merchant ship. Sailors 
           grab MAKESHIFT WEAPONS and fight (futilely) for their lives, 
           those choosing to take their chances in the ocean picked off 
           with SPEARS.

           The Decapitator makes his way to the Boy's Father. He 
           dismounts. He stands seven feet tall at the shoulder. 

           He takes a SPEAR from his horse. 
           The Boy's Father -- unflinching. Defiant.

                                 THE BOY'S FATHER
                        May God take pity on your soul.

           The Decapitator hurls the spear! 

           But not at the Boy's Father.

           TIME SLOWS. SOUNDS ARE MUTED. The Boy's Father screams in
           anguish. Spins to the edge of the boat. Watching the SPEAR.

           IT FLIES TOWARDS THE CRATE!

           INSIDE THE CRATE: two piercing green eyes!

           WITH THE SPEAR: as it closes in on its target! 

                                                            SMASH CUT TO:

           THE MONK

           and his painting. We see it now -- a painting of the above
           attack. A crate floats in the ocean in the foreground. 

           The Monk turns his head and blows long and hard at a candle.

                                                             CUT BACK TO:

           THE SPEAR

           as IT VEERS SUBTLY OFF COURSE! It still SMASHES INTO THE
           CRATE, but a few inches to one side!

           EXT. MERCHANT SHIP - CONTINUOUS

           The ship resembles a floating Hell. Any members of his crew
           who aren't already dead soon will be. 

           The Boy's Father sinks to his knees. 

           TWO BLOOD RED SAMURAI drag a CHEST in front of The
           Decapitator. He smashes it open. 

           SILVER COINS spill out.

                                 THE BOY'S FATHER
                        We're a trade ship. A bloody trade
                        ship.
           There's a TERRIFYING SWOOSH!

           The Decapitator's sword separates the Boy's Father's head
           from his shoulders. It spins in the air landing with a THUD
           on the pile of coins, blood staining the silver.

           AN AGONIZED SCREAM 

           carries on the wind, The Decapitator turning to its source:
           the ocean.

           THE CRATE BOBS UP AND DOWN

           in the distance, spear still sticking out of one side.

           The Decapitator stares at it, his eyes finding those of the
           Boy's, staring back at him, full of hate. 

           A beat.

           The Decapitator slowly holds out a hand. 

           ONE OF HIS MEN lays a SPEAR in his grasp. 

           He readies it.

           Suddenly a cross-current picks up the crate, sending it
           twirling round and round in an eddy before pulling it out to
           sea. 

           A beat.

           The Decapitator turns back to the silver. 

           The CAMERA DRIFTS OVER HIS SHOULDER, FINDING THE CRATE...

           EXT. OCEAN - TIME-LAPSE SEQUENCE - WITH THE CRATE

           Days become nights. We lose track of time.

           WAVES IN A THUNDERSTORM pound the crate.

           The storm gives way to SUNSHINE and calm seas. A SEAGULL 
           lands on the crate with a FISH in its beak. Something 
           frightens it and it flies away, dropping the fish on top of 
           the crate.

           WE SEE: a SMALL HAND reach for the fish.
           EXT. SANDY BEACH - DAY

           A MAN AND WOMAN walk along the sand.

           They pass the WASHED-UP CRATE. Stop to consider it. 

           They peer, cautiously, through the slots. 

           A PAIR OF PIERCING GREEN EYES

           peers back at them.

                                                             DISSOLVE TO:

           THE HOOVES OF HORSES 

           trampling a HILLSIDE. The CAMERA WIDENS, revealing...

           A SAMURAI ARMY

           ...numbering over TEN THOUSAND! They wear ARMOR over GREEN
           KIMONOS and carry matching GREEN BANNERS.

           SUPER UP: ALMOST THREE YEARS LATER

           EXT. LOOKOUT POINT - DAY

           A SAMURAI sits on a horse, looking at something in the
           distance. 

           Far behind him is a CASTLE, and beyond that, MOUNT FUJI.
           Several hundred years from now this land will be known as
           TOKYO.

           This Samurai is far different from any seen so far. Modern-
           day Japanese would call him 'kakoi' -- 'cool' being the best
           English translation. His name is HIROYUKI. He wears a PALE
           BLUE KIMONO.

           His countenance is calm, despite the terrifying sight
           unfolding before his eyes:

           IN THE DISTANCE - THE 'GREEN' ARMY

           head his way. 
           EXT. CASTLE - DAY

           A compound of multiple buildings scattered around the actual
           'castle'. A vast wall marks the perimeter.

           Hiroyuki rides through the gates.

           INT. CASTLE - DAY

           LORD TAKAMOTO sits on a floor cushion.  

           13 SAMURAI sit around him in a circle, each a highly respected
           and highly feared warrior. Hiroyuki is the youngest. They
           all wear pale blue kimonos and are known as 'THE 13 ELITE.'

           MEGUMI, Lord Takamoto's wife and a beguiling beauty, watches
           them. 

           They are calm. 

           They are silent.

           They are not scared in the slightest.

           Suddenly, a shoji is flung open.

           WAKAMOTO, Takamoto's younger brother, enters. Where Taka
           cuts a serene and graceful figure, Waka is impetuous and
           combative. He resents his brother's inheritance and feels he
           would make a better, stronger Lord. 

           His dynamism excites Megumi.

           He wears a blood red kimono and black armor. 

           The Decapitator follows him in.

           (NB: FROM THIS POINT ON, ANY DIALOGUE IN ITALICS IS SPOKEN 
           IN JAPANESE WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES. NON-ITALICIZED DIALOGUE 
           IS IN ENGLISH.)

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        Have you not heard the thunder in 
                        the hillsides? Doom is coming to our 
                        lands.

                                 LORD TAKAMOTO
                        My lands.
                                 WAKAMOTO
                            (seething)
                        My army is ready. 

                                 LORD TAKAMOTO
                        Men you pay with stolen money.  

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        An army numbering over one thousand, 
                        with more men on their way. 

                                 LORD TAKAMOTO
                        But how many true warriors?

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        Your army is what, a couple of 
                        hundred?

                                 LORD TAKAMOTO
                            (re the 13 elite)
                        It is these men the enemy fears most. 

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        By this time tomorrow they will be 
                        in position. If we attack now, 
                        together, while we still have the 
                        element of surprise--

                                 LORD TAKAMOTO
                        --No.

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        Our enemy does not bring over a
                        thousand men in hopes of tea and
                        idle chat! The entire country is at
                        war! We will be annihilated unless
                        we attack. It is time to act like a
                        warrior!

                                 LORD TAKAMOTO
                        If we attack now our armies will 
                        clash in the village and hundreds of 
                        innocent lives will be lost.

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        To wait, is to invite death upon us.

                                 LORD TAKAMOTO
                        I am not afraid of dying, younger 
                        brother.

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        Then attack!
                                 LORD TAKAMOTO
                        While I am unafraid of dying I have 
                        no wish to die a fool. We're 
                        outnumbered more than ten to one. 

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        And whose fault is that? If you had 
                        spent your years amassing the 
                        resources to build a real army--

                                 LORD TAKAMOTO
                        --loyalty that is 'bought' is not 
                        true loyalty.

           Lord Takamoto glances at The Decapitator.

           Wakamoto parades around Takamoto's circle, voice laced with 
           contempt. 

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        The 13 'elite'! Feared. Revered.
                        Envied. What use are your reputations
                        now? Your walls will crumble like
                        everyone else's. Your towers will
                        burn. And you shall all die.

           He stops in front of Megumi. 

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        But it is for you I fear most.

           Takamoto clasps a reassuring hand over his wife's. He knows 
           what defeat means for her -- rape and torture. Megumi also 
           knows this, and thus it may seem odd to detect a slight smile 
           on her face. Yet it is there.

                                 HIROYUKI
                        All this talk of death confuses me. 

           A beat.

                                 HIROYUKI
                        Our enemy is hungry. Let's give them 
                        something to choke on.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           A FULL MOON

           rising into the sky, revealing beneath it:
           EXT. IN FRONT OF THE CASTLE WALLS - NIGHT

           TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY BRAVE SAMURAI IN PALE BLUE KIMONOS AND 
           ARMOR stand motionless.

           Ready for battle. 

           Ready to die. 

           INT. TOWER - DAY

           Megumi watches THE GREEN ARMY'S CAMP in the distance. They 
           are not advancing. She turns to Hiroyuki. Lord Takamoto and 
           his brother, Wakamoto, are also present.

                                 MEGUMI
                        It seems their hunger has deserted 
                        them. Why do they not attack?

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        They're probably too busy laughing 
                        at us!

           He gestures to their men in front of the castle walls

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        This is not bravery. This is insanity.

                                 HIROYUKI
                        They're letting the sun sap our men's 
                        strength. They will attack at night.

                                 LORD TAKAMOTO
                        And tomorrow both wise men and fools 
                        shall celebrate together.

           EXT. COURTYARD - DAY

           MEN are busy carving ARROWS.

           The sky DARKENS.

           The sound of TEN THOUSAND GALLOPING HORSES fades in...

           EXT. OUTSIDE THE CASTLE WALLS - NIGHT

           The MOON is full and high.
           The Samurai wait, the ground TREMBLING as THE GREEN ARMY 
           advances, the sound of their horses getting louder and louder 
           until ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING! 

           THE GREEN ARMY 

           is almost upon them -- a TSUNAMI OF SPEARS powered by TEN 
           THOUSAND WARRIORS on HORSEBACK! All charging at once! Horses 
           snarling, their nostrils pumping hot air into the cold night!

           Still the Samurai wait. 

           Not moving. 

           Not even breathing.

           And now THE GREEN ARMY is upon them! Spears fly in the air! 
           Swords glint in the moonlight! WARRIORS roar like LIONS!

           HEADS AND ARMS FALL LIKE RAIN. 

           TIME SLOWS: a head soars through the air, THUDDING against 
           the castle wall, losing its headpiece and falling to the 
           ground where its PAINTED ON EYES stare upward. It is made of 
           wood. 

           The waiting Samurai are nothing but MANNEQUINS -- something 
           known as A SCARECROW RUSE! 

           Confusion quickly usurps confidence. THE GREEN ARMY, out of 
           formation, exchange puzzled looks, puzzlement turning to 
           fear as SOMETHING EXTINGUISHES THE MOON! Heads look upwards -- 
           a big mistake.

           THE FIRST ARROW

           hits a man STRAIGHT IN THE EYE. He gets no opportunity to 
           scream. 

           THE SECOND ARROW

           pierces a man's clavicle -- HIS SCREAM, pitiful, now one of 
           many as...

           ...HUNDREDS OF ARROWS POUR OUT OF THE DARK SKIES!

           As the arrows fall the moon becomes visible once more, 
           revealing a very different scene. The GREEN ARMY is now in 
           total disarray. Thousands dead. More bleeding to death. And 
           before they can regroup...
           ...the moon VANISHES AGAIN, plunging the Hellish landscape 
           into darkness...

           ...a darkness unleashing MORE ARROWS!

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. BEHIND THE CASTLE WALLS - CONTINUOUS

           MULTIPLE ROWS OF ARCHERS, encouraged by the MOANS and SCREAMS 
           from the other side of the wall, fire TORRENT AFTER TORRENT 
           OF ARROWS TOWARDS THE MOON...

                                                             CUT BACK TO:

           EXT. THE BATTLEFIELD - CONTINUOUS

           A THIRD then FOURTH deluge of arrows strikes their targets, 
           razor-sharp points ripping THE GREEN ARMY to shreds! 

           The devastation takes on a surreal quality in the moonlight.
           Arrows pin bodies -- men and horses -- to the earth, some
           victims with thirty arrows or more to their name. Survivors
           pull shafts from limbs. The lucky uninjured -- there are
           still several hundred -- are in a state of shock.

           FOCUS ON: a MAN, pulling an arrow out of his leg when suddenly
           a FLAMING SPEAR slices through his back!

           MORE FLAMING SPEARS

           come hurtling down from the castle walls. We FOLLOW ONE as
           it sails silently through the night, PASSING EFFORTLESSLY
           THROUGH ONE MAN, ending his life instantly, AND CONTINUING
           ON, BURYING ITSELF IN A SECOND MAN, ENGULFING HIM IN FLAMES!

           The spears do more than simply pick off two or three score
           of enemy -- they also act as MACABRE LANTERNS, endowing the
           grim surroundings with flickering light.

           A FEW OF THE GREEN ARMY attempt to climb the castle walls... 

           ...only to have THEIR FACES BURNED WITH HOT OIL!

           Ten thousand is now perhaps three thousand. Time for...

           THE CASTLE GATES

           ...to burst open! 
           THE '13 ELITE' 

           lead TAKAMOTO'S ARMY out, followed by ONE THOUSAND OTHER
           SAMURAI -- the latter led by The Decapitator. 

           The elite and Takamoto's army wear pale blue kimonos, The
           Decapitator and his men, blood red. Both factions wear armor.

           THE DECAPITATOR

           immerses himself deep amongst the combat, gleefully swinging
           his sword with brute strength, SOMETIMES SEVERING MULTIPLE
           HEADS WITH ONE STROKE! To watch him, and his men, is to watch
           a very different animal to... 

           THE '13 ELITE' 

           ...and we quickly understand why Takamoto's men are so
           monikered -- their fighting skills deadly yet effortless. 

           The CAMERA CUTS QUICKLY from each of the 13, showing a kill
           for each, until IT FINDS...

           HIROYUKI

           ...withdrawing his sword from a man's heart! He spies a DOZEN 
           MEN on foot standing isolated from the battle. 

           He sheathes his sword and charges towards them, sliding from 
           his saddle at the last moment, landing on his feet just before 
           them. 

           They come for him in two columns. 

           Hiroyuki stands his ground, choosing to wait until the very 
           last moment, then whips out TWO SWORDS -- for this is his 
           signature style -- his right hand drawing the sword to his 
           left, his left drawing the sword to his right. 

           He makes his way between the two columns, his hand movements 
           a blur. 

           He stops upon reaching the far end. Behind him, the dozen 
           men still stand. Then, as if God just snapped his fingers, 
           BODY PARTS FALL TO THE GROUND! They are all dead.
           A MAN

           stands before Hiroyuki -- the LORD OF THE GREEN ARMY.

           He casts a sad, despairing gaze at the huge loss of life 
           around him. He witnesses the last of his men be cut down and 
           turns his eyes back to Hiroyuki.

           Hiroyuki puts his swords away.

                                 THE LORD OF THE GREEN ARMY
                        No. There can be no honor for me.

                                 HIROYUKI
                        It is your right as Lord.

                                 THE LORD OF THE GREEN ARMY
                        I thank you, but, I choose to die as
                        my men did.

           Hiroyuki -- conflicted. This is not the Samurai way.  

                                 THE LORD OF THE GREEN ARMY
                        Please.

           A SPEAR

           suddenly rips into the Lord's chest! He got his wish.

           THE DECAPITATOR 

           stands thirty yards away. He smiles at Hiroyuki.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           PEASANTS

           lifting CORPSES onto HUNDREDS OF BLAZING FUNERAL PYRES.

           MUSIC comes from over the castle walls.

           EXT. CASTLE GROUNDS - DAY

           A SUMO WRESTLER grabs his MUCH BIGGER OPPONENT by his mawashi
           and forces him out of the ring!

           Lord Takamoto watches the SUMO TOURNAMENT off a floor cushion
           inside A HUGE MARQUEE, Megumi at his side. 
           The elite 13 sit scattered around him. 

           Takamoto roars at the smaller rikishi's win.

                                 LORD TAKAMOTO
                        You see? The biggest does not always
                        win! 

           WE SEE: SUSHI CHEFS pack ornate shells with ice then decorate
           them with sashimi. BEAUTIFUL GEISHAS tend to weary warriors'
           every need. Sake flows freely. There is DANCING and MUSIC.

           The victory celebration is in full swing. 

           Unlike everyone else, Megumi is in low spirits.

                                 LORD TAKAMOTO
                        Why so glum? Anyone would think we 
                        lost.

                                 MEGUMI
                        It is nothing.

                                 LORD TAKAMOTO
                        When a beautiful woman is not smiling 
                        in her husband's finest hour, then 
                        it is most definitely something. 

                                 MEGUMI
                        You defeated an enemy you could see. 

                                 LORD TAKAMOTO
                        This tired old argument again. I 
                        should have guessed.

                                 MEGUMI
                        The real threat lies hidden in the 
                        countryside.

           Taka waves his hand, dismissively.

                                 ELITE SAMURAI #1
                        What is this threat you speak of, 
                        Megumi?

                                 LORD TAKAMOTO
                        She speaks of ninja.

                                 ELITE SAMURAI #1
                        Ninja? Samurai do not fear ninja.

                                 ELITE SAMURAI #2
                        Samurai fear no one!
           The Samurai raise their sake cups and toast.

                                 MEGUMI
                        You call yourselves Samurai, men who
                        live their lives according to the
                        Bushido? Yet doesn't your fancy little
                        code preach honor above all else?
                        Ninja are cowards, untrustworthy
                        traitors who sell their soul to the
                        highest bidder and while you mock me
                        their black arts continue to grow
                        unchecked.
                            (to Takamoto)
                        You are a good Lord and dream of
                        uniting Japan. But I say its future
                        will forever be in doubt while we
                        allow these black-clothed assassins
                        to stalk our countryside. 

                                 HIROYUKI
                        Ninja are nothing more than assassins
                        for hire. It is the men who hire
                        them who are the true cowards.

           He meant no malice yet Megumi gives Hiroyuki a truly icy
           stare.

                                 MEGUMI
                        Perhaps if you had had a father you
                        would speak differently.

           She rises to her feet and leaves abruptly. 

                                 LORD TAKAMOTO
                            (off Hiroyuki's look)
                        Her father died by the dart of a 
                        ninja, a ninja he himself had hired 
                        to kill a rival warlord.

           Off Hiroyuki's look we... 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. A 2ND FLOOR VERANDAH - CONTINUOUS

           Megumi storms out into the cool night air and leans against 
           the balcony.

           The BLAZING FUNERAL PYRES SERVE AS A SOMBER BACKDROP.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Can I offer you a drink?
           WAKAMOTO

           stands in the shadows nursing a bottle of sake.

                                 MEGUMI
                        I am in no mood for the company of a 
                        warrior.

           She stares at him, fully expecting him to leave her in peace. 
           He doesn't, and offers this as his argument:

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        I was here first.

                                 MEGUMI
                        You are just like your brother.

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        I am nothing like him. Takamoto is 
                        weak. This victory should have been 
                        mine.

                                 MEGUMI
                        His downfall shall not be weakness 
                        but arrogance. 

           She takes the bottle from Wakamoto and drinks.

                                 MEGUMI
                        He does not hesitate to kill one
                        thousand men because they carry swords
                        that all can see, yet one thousand
                        others who conceal their weapons are
                        untouchable!
                            (baiting him)
                        You would be no different.

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        Do not tempt me to demonstrate my
                        strength... or you may find yourself
                        unable to sit for the coming week.

           Their eyes meet. Excitement registers for both. 

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        Violent times demand violent measures.
                        If I were Lord I would rule this
                        land with such venom the entire
                        country would fall to its knees. 
           Off Megumi's look we... 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. CASTLE GROUNDS - LATER

           The Decapitator soaks in AN OUTDOOR BATH with FOUR NAKED
           BEAUTIES. The CAMERA TRACKS FROM THIS to the dohyo (sumo
           ring), where two of the elite 13, stripped to loincloths,
           try to push a sumo wrestler out of the ring. Others can be
           found mingling with Wakamoto's men, playing Go (Japanese
           chess), gorging on sushi, filling their bellies with sake,
           and 'enjoying' the geisha. 

           The CAMERA COMES TO REST on Hiroyuki -- by himself in 
           thoughtful mood. 

           Lord Takamoto joins him. 

                                 LORD TAKAMOTO
                        I owe you my thanks.

           He holds out a cup of sake.

                                 LORD TAKAMOTO
                        A cup of sake for your thoughts?

           Hiroyuki accepts the cup and drinks.

                                 HIROYUKI
                        A thousand men died today for one 
                        man. I would die a thousand times 
                        for you. 
                            (a beat)
                        Why would their Lord refuse an 
                        honorable death?

                                 LORD TAKAMOTO
                        Sometimes, there can be things more 
                        important than honor.

                                 HIROYUKI
                        What are such things?

                                 LORD TAKAMOTO
                        Each man must ask that of himself. 

                                 HIROYUKI
                        What would your answer be?

                                 LORD TAKAMOTO
                        Peace. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LORD TAKAMOTO (CONT'D)
                            (a beat)
                        We are Samurai, Hiroyuki, and as
                        such have sworn to live and die by
                        the Bushido. But we are also human
                        and ultimately must follow what is
                        in our heart if honor is to have
                        true meaning.

                                 HIROYUKI
                        You mean, by choosing the path he 
                        did, he achieved an honor of his own 
                        making?

           Lord Takamoto smiles.

                                 LORD TAKAMOTO
                        Only he can tell you that.

           A thoughtful beat.

           MEGUMI 

           rejoins the celebrations. Lord Takamoto waves at her. She 
           responds with a cold stare before walking off. 

                                 HIROYUKI
                        I'm sorry if my tongue has soured 
                        her mood.

                                 LORD TAKAMOTO
                        It is many moons since she warmed my 
                        bed. Tonight will be no different.
                            (a beat)
                        What she said to you earlier was not 
                        fair.

                                 HIROYUKI
                        Yet it was true.

                                 LORD TAKAMOTO
                        As someone who thinks of himself as 
                        a father to you, I do not agree.

           He puts an affectionate hand on Hiroyuki's shoulder. 

                                 LORD TAKAMOTO
                        If I had a son, you would be his 
                        greatest threat.

           Hiroyuki -- touched.
           EXT. CASTLE GROUNDS - SEVERAL HOURS LATER

           All is quiet. All is still.

           INT. HIROYUKI'S SLEEPING QUARTERS - NIGHT

           Hiroyuki awakes from a nightmare.

           He goes to the open window. Inhales the cool, fresh air. 
           Gazes into the quiet, night sky. 

           VIEW THROUGH THE WINDOW 

           the castle's main building stands a hundred yards away. 

           SOMEONE DRESSED IN BLACK

           jumps from an upper floor window! They land a perfect 10
           forward roll and scamper off.

           EXT. CASTLE GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS

           Hiroyuki runs to the spot where the person landed. Although
           they left behind a FOOTPRINT, whoever it was is long gone. 

           He looks up at the window. A feeling of dread washes over
           him.

           INT. LORD TAKAMOTO'S BED CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

           Hiroyuki BURSTS THROUGH a set of sliding doors. The sight
           awaiting him stops him in his tracks: 

           LORD TAKAMOTO

           lies on a futon on the floor.

           A DAGGER

           sticks out of his blood-soaked chest. 

           He is dead.
           A NIGHTSHIRTED MEGUMI

           steps into the torn doorway.

                                 MEGUMI
                            (re the doors)
                        What is the meaning of this--

           Hiroyuki tries to shield her from the view but is too late. 
           She SCREAMS. Pushes past. Runs to her dead husband's side. 

           She freezes. Eyes fixated on the dagger.

           Wakamoto enters, followed by members of the elite 13. All 
           approach Takamoto. 

           Megumi points at the dagger and snarls with pure hatred:

                                 MEGUMI
                        Ninja. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           A SNAKE

           carved into THE HILT OF THE DAGGER. 

           The CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL:

           INT. CASTLE - DAY

           LORD TAKAMOTO'S BODY lies on a mahogany altar in a GREAT 
           HALL. The dagger is still in his chest. Megumi mourns nearby.

           Wakamoto, his men, and The Decapitator line the walls. The 
           mood somber. All eyes on... 

           THE 13 ELITE 

           ...kneeling in a line in the center of the room. They wear
           fabulous, WHITE KIMONOS. 

           A READER finishes a DEATH POEM:

                                 READER
                        ...the winter is cold, yet in your
                        world it's warm still."

           He adds the poem to a pile of 12 others.
                                 WAKAMOTO
                        No doubt my brother would be proud
                        of such literary brilliance. He'd be
                        prouder still if one of you had not
                        been in a sake induced coma the night
                        a shadow stole his soul.

           He steps forward.

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        As is the Samurai way, I give you
                        the chance to wipe away your
                        transgressions and regain your honor.

           He nods at The Decapitator. 

           He walks behind the 13 Samurai stopping behind #1.

           What follows is as amazing as it is heartbreaking -- SEPPUKU,
           the Samurai form of RITUAL SUICIDE: 

           Each of the Elite 13 tuck their sleeves beneath their knees. 

           ELITE SAMURAI #1 

           picks up a SHORT SWORD. 

           Opens his kimono. 

           Looks at Takamoto. 

                                 ELITE SAMURAI #1
                        I have failed you, Lord.

           HE PLUNGES THE BLADE DEEP INTO THE LEFT SIDE OF HIS ABDOMEN, 
           DRAWING IT FORCIBLY ACROSS TO THE RIGHT, WITH A SHARP, UPWARD 
           CUT AT THE END!

           ONE SECOND LATER: The Decapitator swings his sword! It's a 
           skillful, controlled movement, SEVERING #1'S HEAD YET LEAVING 
           A SLIGHT BAND OF FLESH KEEPING IT ATTACHED TO THE BODY! 
           AMAZINGLY, THE HEAD DOES NOT FALL.

           ON THE GROUND: #1's BLOOD seeps towards #2 and, as it stains 
           his neighbor's kimono...

           ELITE SAMURAI #2 

           ...picks up a SHORT SWORD.

           He opens his kimono. 
           Looks at Takamoto. 

                                 ELITE SAMURAI #2
                        I have failed you, Lord.

           He also PLUNGES THE BLADE DEEP INTO THE LEFT SIDE OF HIS
           ABDOMEN, DRAWING IT FORCIBLY ACROSS TO THE RIGHT, WITH A
           SHARP, UPWARD CUT AT THE END!

           ONE SECOND LATER: The Decapitator swings his sword! THE CUT
           LEAVES A SLIGHT BAND OF FLESH KEEPING THE HEAD ATTACHED TO
           THE BODY! AGAIN IT DOES NOT FALL.

           ON THE GROUND: #2's BLOOD seeps towards #3 and, as it stains
           his neighbor's kimono...

           ELITE SAMURAI #3 

           ...picks up a SHORT SWORD. 

           You've never seen anything like this before, and it is to
           play out in its full, glorious length, the room deadly silent
           as each member of the elite repeats the identical actions of
           his predecessor.

           The only deviation comes with ELITE SAMURAI #11 whose head
           falls from his neck, hanging gruesomely by its thread in
           front of his chest.

           We end with a line of TWELVE BODIES -- ELEVEN BEAUTIFULLY
           POISED AND ONE MACABRELY SO. 

           There's only one left.

           ELITE SAMURAI #13 - AKA, HIROYUKI.

           A beat.

           He takes his SHORT SWORD.

           He opens his kimono.

           He looks at Takamoto. His Lord. His Master. A man who thought 
           of him as a son. 

                                 HIROYUKI
                        I have failed you, Lord.

           He presses the tip of the blade to his skin...
           ...yet his stare continues. Everyone's eyes burn into him, 
           the tension level in the room rising dramatically.

           A nail-biting beat.

           And then he does the unthinkable: HE RISES TO HIS FEET!

           A CLAMOR goes up.

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        You dare to defy the Bushido? 

           Hiroyuki walks up to Lord Takamoto's body. 

           Reaches for the dagger.

           Pulls it out.

           Megumi GASPS.

                                 HIROYUKI
                            (to Wakamoto)
                        Sometimes there can be things more 
                        important than honor.

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        Enlighten me. Enlighten us all!

           A beat.

                                 HIROYUKI
                        Justice. 

           He turns to Megumi.

                                 HIROYUKI
                        Before I die I shall return this
                        dagger to its rightful owner.

           He dips his head to her in respect. 

           Megumi approaches him. Stares into his eyes. Whispers:

                                 MEGUMI
                        Do not spare his brothers or sisters.

           She kisses him lightly on the cheek then bows her head.

           Hiroyuki wipes the blood from the blade, tucks it inside his
           kimono, then turns and heads for the door.

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        You dishonor my brother even in death! 
           The Decapitator steps into Hiroyuki's path. Hiroyuki (who,
           like all 13 elite, has his swords by his side) looks him in
           the eye. 

                                 HIROYUKI
                        Too many warriors have died today.

           The Decapitator glances at the line of twelve corpses.

                                 THE DECAPITATOR
                        Tomorrow is another day. 

           He moves aside, allowing Hiroyuki to pass.

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        You are Samurai no more. You are
                        ronin! You hear me? RONIN! 

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           A BEAUTIFUL, YOUNG WOMAN defends herself with WOODEN STAFF
           from a similarly armed MAN AND WOMAN -- the same man and
           woman from the beach where the crate washed ashore. Their
           names are KENJI and AYAKO. The Young Woman's is MAYUMI.

           Kenji and Ayako take turns to attack Mayumi, their younger 
           adversary blocking their moves easily.  

           Ayako vaults herself into the air, landing behind Mayumi.
           She and Kenji rush in for the kill only for Mayumi to drop
           quickly to the ground doing splits. She swings her staff 360
           degrees, taking their legs out from beneath them and bounces
           back to her feet. Kenji and Ayako follow her up.

           Mayumi considers her attackers. She throws something at her 
           feet, disappearing in A PUFF OF SMOKE. 

           She reappears behind Ayako and sidekicks her into a tree, 
           winding her, then launches into an assault against Kenji, 
           pummeling him through the woods and up against a tree... 
           with a DAGGER at his throat. 

           A beat. 

           Kenji smiles. Mayumi looks back at Ayako who also smiles. 

                                 MAYUMI
                            (to Ayako)
                        Did I hurt you?

                                 AYAKO
                        No. But the tree did.
           Mayumi grins and releases Kenji. 

           She is their daughter.

                                 KENJI
                            (in English)
                        You can come out now.

           THE BOY, NOW 9 YEARS OLD

           steps out from his hiding place behind a tree.

           Mayumi high-fives him on her way out of the woods.

                                 BOY
                            (to Kenji)
                        Is it my turn now? 
                            (off Kenji's look)
                        Is it my turn now?

           EXT. CASTLE APPROACH - DAY

           HUNDREDS OF SAMURAI WARRIORS in blood red kimonos -- the 
           rest of Wakamoto's men -- file through the castle gates.

           INT. CASTLE - DAY

           MAPS OF JAPAN cover the walls. They show lands and armies of 
           rival warlords.

           Wakamoto engages in hushed conversation with Megumi.

           The Decapitator enters. Megumi leaves -- the hint of a smile 
           on her face.

                                 THE DECAPITATOR
                        The remainder of your army has 
                        arrived. Word of your recent victory 
                        has spread to our neighbors. 

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        Good. The time is ripe for cementing 
                        their fears.

           The Decapitator walks to a map.

                                 THE DECAPITATOR
                        Our neighbors to the west are your 
                        intended target?
                                 WAKAMOTO
                            (nods)
                        Before we attack, let our enemy know
                        our gates are open to any man wishing
                        to switch allegiance. In the meantime,
                        my brother's murder roams freely in
                        our countryside.  

                                 THE DECAPITATOR
                        Hunting the ninja is pointless. His 
                        friends will lie and send us in 
                        circles, if they tell us anything at 
                        all. 

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        Then bring me the head of every ninja 
                        we can find.
                            (a beat)
                        There can be no obstacles in my path 
                        to Kyoto and being the Shogun.

           EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

           A scared PEASANT points out a HOMESTEAD WITH A THATCHED ROOF 
           to a SAMURAI wearing a blood red kimono. 

           The Samurai gestures to other blood reds (we shall have seen 
           all these Samurai before, e.g. at the seppuku ceremony).

                                                                 CUT TO:

           A FLAMING ARROW

           hitting the thatched roof. Then another. And another. 

           EXT. NINJA HOMESTEAD #1 - CONTINUOUS

           SMOKE pours into the sky. 

           A MAN AND A WOMAN DRESSED IN BLACK flee from inside, coughing, 
           only to be MERCILESSLY CHOPPED DOWN BY WAITING SAMURAI!

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           The Boy focuses on a tree. He runs at it. Leaps onto the 
           trunk. Scrambles a few feet up. And crashes to the ground.
                                 KENJI
                        Remember, the tree is not an 
                        adversary, but an accomplice. Watch.

           Kenji runs at a tree, leaping onto the trunk and vanishing 
           effortlessly into the branches. The Boy peers up, trying to 
           find him. 

           Kenji reappears behind him, hanging upside down from a branch 
           like a bat.

                                 KENJI
                        All you have to do is believe it is 
                        possible.

           The Boy tries again -- with similar results.

                                 BOY
                        When do I get to practice with a 
                        weapon?

                                 KENJI
                        A weapon is merely an extension of 
                        your body. First you must master 
                        your body.

           EXT. NINJA HOMESTEAD #2 - DAY

           Surrounded by EIGHT SAMURAI ON HORSES.

           INT. NINJA HOMESTEAD #2 - CONTINUOUS

           Tatami floors. Shoji. Sparse furnishings. A simple home. Yet 
           not so simple for look again... 

           WE SEE: hidden in wall crevices / ceiling nooks -- NINJA. 

           SUDDENLY - EIGHT SPEARS

           pierce the walls! One IMPALES a NINJA, PINNING HIM IN PLACE, 
           UNABLE TO BREAK FREE.

           EXT. NINJA HOMESTEAD #2 - CONTINUOUS

           The Samurai grip the ends of the spears tightly to their 
           stomachs (as if oars) and CIRCLE THE HOME ON THEIR HORSES! 
           INT. NINJA HOMESTEAD #2 - CONTINUOUS

           The spears CUT A HORIZONTAL PATH THROUGH THE WALLS, the pinned 
           Ninja SCREAMING as he is dragged sideways! The OTHER NINJA 
           emerge from their hiding places only for the roof TO COLLAPSE 
           IN ON THEM!

           EXT. MARKET SQUARE - DAY

           Mayumi chooses octopuses off a slab of ice.

           A distressed PEASANT runs into the square, shouting:

                                 DISTRESSED PEASANT
                        They're hunting ninja! 

           He points to a COLUMN OF SMOKE rising into the sky. The place 
           erupts in furor. 

           Off Mayumi's worried look...

           INT. KENJI AND AYAKO'S HOMESTEAD - DAY

           The Boy nurses his bruises.

           Ayako cooks while Kenji sets the table for four. 

           Ayako's ears prick up.

           WE HEAR: the OMINOUS SOUND OF HORSES APPROACHING.

           EXT. KENJI AND AYAKO'S HOMESTEAD - CONTINUOUS 

           It's a picturesque setting with RICE FIELDS on all sides and 
           the WOODS in the background.

           A DOZEN SAMURAI ride up. Stare suspiciously at the home.

           Kenji comes out.

                                 KENJI
                        Do your horses require water? Or 
                        grain, perhaps?

           The Samurai turn their gaze on him. 
           INT. KENJI AND AYAKO'S HOMESTEAD - CONTINUOUS

           Ayako kneels innocently at the table with a bowl of rice. 
           The Boy is nowhere to be seen. All twelve Samurai are inside. 
           The scene has the feel of an inquisition to it.

                                 THE LEAD SAMURAI
                        How many live here?

                                 KENJI
                        Just who you see.

           The LEAD SAMURAI peers past an open shoji. The homestead 
           appears to have many rooms. 

                                 THE LEAD SAMURAI
                        A large dwelling for only two?

                                 KENJI
                        It was my parent's home. I have many
                        brothers and sisters.

           The Lead Samurai nods to HIS MEN. They snoop about. Each
           returns with a shake of the head -- having found nothing.

           The Lead Samurai looks at Ayako. Draws his sword. Using the
           tip he begins to peel back her kimono... revealing nothing
           but a simple undergarment. 

           He looks at Kenji. Replaces his sword. Heads to the door.

           He pauses. Something in the kitchen area draws his gaze.

           TWO BOWLS

           sit on the counter.

           Kenji and Ayako watch him closely -- turning back to the
           table... seeing another TWO BOWLS on it...

           A beat.

           He turns towards Kenji... Ayako's hands moving stealthily
           beneath the table... the Lead Samurai's moving for his
           sword...

           He draws it quickly. But not quick enough.
           A RAZOR-SHARP SHURIKEN (THROWING STAR)

           hits him in the forehead, courtesy of a flick of Ayako's
           wrist! 

           There's a lot of SHOUTING. Each Samurai draws his sword.
           Ayako jumps up from the table, disappearing into another
           room, shoji SLAMMING shut behind her. Kenji vanishes in like
           manner behind a different set of shoji.

           What we have now is a deadly game of cat and mouse!

           The Samurai form a circle in the center of the room. Nervous.

           We hear their BREATHING. Heartbeats quickening. We also hear
           SCURRYING. From behind shoji. From above. From below.

           A shoji slides open! There's A BLUR OF BLACK as a figure
           cartwheels out! Vanishing behind another shoji.

           Seconds later, ONE OF THE SAMURAI DROPS DEAD!

           ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE!

           The Samurai CHARGE shoji, cutting them to shreds with their
           swords. They overturn furniture. Kick walls. Throw things.

           A FIGURE IN BLACK (AYAKO)

           drops out of A SECRET HATCH IN THE CEILING onto one of the
           Samurai. She sinks a DAGGER into his neck and, as Samurai
           rush her, she backflips to a wall and climbs up it, MATRIX-
           STYLE -- aided by the pair of TIGER CLAWS ('FREDDY KREUGER'
           GLOVES) on her fingers!

           A SECOND FIGURE IN BLACK (KENJI)

           bursts through a shoji brandishing A LONG SWORD and KAGINAWA
           (hooked rope)! He trades blows with two Samurai then throws
           the kaginawa at one, yanking the sword from his grasp then
           stabbing him through the heart!  

           MEANWHILE - AYAKO

           scurries back and forth across the ceiling, flicking DARTS 
           at the Samurai below! They try to JAB HER WITH SPEARS as 
           they DODGE THE DARTS!
           BACK WITH KENJI

           as his long sword IS BROKEN IN TWO! He dashes to a wall and 
           opens A CONCEALED COMPARTMENT FULL OF WEAPONS! He grabs two 
           daggers and throws them over his shoulder!

           WITH THE DAGGERS: spinning through the air, embedding in the 
           chests of two approaching Samurai!

           FOUR SAMURAI

           come at Kenji -- now armed with two more daggers. He defends 
           himself valiantly until the Lead Samurai appears behind him, 
           sinking a sword into his back! Kenji coughs up blood and 
           slumps to his knees.

                                 AYAKO
                        Kenji!

           She drops from above and runs to his side, fending off Samurai 
           with a dagger. She pulls Kenji close. He dies in her arms.

           The Samurai stare at Ayako. She is trapped.

           The Lead Samurai walks towards her, blood oozing from his 
           forehead. He starts untying his kimono...

           AYAKO

           flips her DAGGER inward and, protecting her honor, PLUNGES 
           IT DEEP INTO HER BELLY! She smiles at the Lead Samurai as 
           her life ebbs away.

           A beat.

                                 THE LEAD SAMURAI
                        There are others here. 

           They tear down walls. Move furniture. Lift tatami. 

           THERE'S A TRAP-DOOR IN THE FLOOR! A TUNNEL!

           EXT. KENJI AND AYAKO'S HOMESTEAD - CONTINUOUS

           The Samurai race out. There are EIGHT of them left. They 
           scour the surroundings. 

                                 SAMURAI #1
                        There!
           He points into a rice-field.

           THE BOY 

           is running for the woods!

           EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS

           The Boy cuts desperately through the brush to A WINDING PATH 
           and races off. He looks over his shoulder.

           THE SAMURAI APPEAR BEHIND HIM ON HORSEBACK!

           He runs faster. Tears around a BEND. Screams to a stop. 

           ANOTHER SAMURAI IS AHEAD OF HIM!

           There is nowhere to hide. Only, we recognize this other 
           Samurai. He is Samurai no more. He is Ronin.  

           IT IS HIROYUKI.

           Hiroyuki peers at the Boy. Curious. After all, he is white-
           skinned and this is Japan. He dismounts. The Boy backs away. 

           Hiroyuki follows the Boy and as he comes around the bend he 
           sees the OTHER SAMURAI GALLOPING TOWARDS THEM! 

           He sees the Boy's fear. Strides up to...

           ...and past him.

           THE APPROACHING SAMURAI

           pull up on their reins! There is about 70 feet between them.

                                 THE LEAD SAMURAI
                            (shouts)
                        Give us the boy, Ronin.

                                 HIROYUKI
                        What do you want with him?

                                 THE LEAD SAMURAI
                        We want his head. He's ninja.

                                 HIROYUKI
                        Ninja? Are you blind? He's not even 
                        Japanese.
                                 SAMURAI #1
                        Sorcery! 

                                 HIROYUKI
                        He's just a boy. Seven, eight years 
                        old at most--

                                 BOY
                        --I'm nine.

           Hiroyuki frowns at him.

                                 THE LEAD SAMURAI
                        Hand him over and we will let you 
                        leave with your life, or this path 
                        will be your final resting place. 

           A wry smile forms on Hiroyuki's face.

                                 HIROYUKI
                        Nice and shady. The ground's a touch 
                        hard for my liking, though.

                                 THE LEAD SAMURAI
                        Your insolence matches your dishonor 
                        and seals your fate.

           He nods to two of his men. 

           THE TWO SAMURAI 

           break into a gallop... bearing down on Hiroyuki... swords 
           raised above their heads...

           HIROYUKI

           stands his ground. Unflinching.

           The Two Samurai are almost upon him. Still he doesn't move. 
           Thirty feet. Twenty. Ten. Five. At the very last minute:

           HIROYUKI

           unsheathes his swords and pulls them quickly into the air, 
           suspending them horizontally -- each blade hanging in the 
           air directly in the path of each horse!

           THE LIGHT GLINTS OFF THE RAZOR-SHARP STEEL AND...

           ...THE HORSES, SCARED, REAR UP ON THEIR HIND LEGS!
           The Two Samurai fight to stay in the saddle, oblivious to...

           ...HIROYUKI WHO LEAPS INTO THE AIR!

           TIME SLOWS: HIROYUKI SOMERSAULTS OVER THE HORSES, DROPPING 
           BEHIND THE MEN'S BACKS, RAMMING HIS SWORDS INTO THEIR SPINES 
           ON HIS WAY DOWN! 

           TIME QUICKENS: HIROYUKI LANDS. GIVES EACH HORSE A SLAP ON 
           THE BUTT! THE HORSES TAKE OFF AGAIN -- THE TWO SAMURAI DEAD 
           IN THEIR SADDLES!

           A beat.

           Hiroyuki keeps his swords out, for...

           FIVE OF THE REMAINING SIX SAMURAI

           ...get off their horses and come his way on foot (the Lead 
           Samurai stays). 

           Hiroyuki beckons for the Boy to come to him. The Boy does. 
           Hiroyuki holds one hand behind his back, protecting him.

           The Five Samurai form a circle around them. True to the 
           Samurai code of honor, THEY ATTACK ONE AT A TIME -- beginning 
           with --

           -- SAMURAI #3.

           Hiroyuki is just as deadly with one sword, fending off blows 
           effortlessly, seeming to toy with his rival until... SWOOSH!

           Samurai #3 stops. Looks down at his gut. A TRICKLE OF BLOOD 
           APPEARS, SPANNING HIS ENTIRE GIRTH. Hiroyuki jabs him with 
           the end of his sword -- his torso falls in two halves!

           The four remaining Samurai exchange looks. 

           The code of honor is forgotten -- THEY ATTACK ALL AT ONCE. 

           HIROYUKI 

           tucks the Boy in closer and takes them all on, alternating 
           arms between protecting him and fighting the Samurai. 

           Interspersed between his blocks and jabs are DEADLY SWOOSHES 
           (immediately after which TIME SLOWS AS THE SEVERED LIMBS 
           FALL TO THE GROUND, THE PACE QUICKENING AGAIN STRAIGHT AFTER).

           SAMURAI #4 dies. 
           SAMURAI #5 dies.

           SAMURAI #6 dies.

           And then SAMURAI #7 dies.

           A beat.

           Hiroyuki looks at the Lead Samurai. 

           The Lead Samurai turns his horse around and flees!

           The Boy steps out from behind Hiroyuki's back and stares at 
           the dead Samurai. 

           He turns to Hiroyuki. 

                                 BOY
                        Why--
                            (a beat; in Japanese)
                        Why aren't you like them?

                                 HIROYUKI
                        Because I remember what it is like 
                        to be nine years old. 

                                 BOY
                        You speak English?

           Hiroyuki nods. He gets back on his horse.

                                 HIROYUKI
                        You should learn to make better 
                        friends if you want to reach ten.

           He takes one last look at the Boy and rides off.

           The Boy looks at the dead Samurai... and their swords...

           EXT. CASTLE - DAY

           Wakamoto's army prepares for battle.

           The Lead Samurai rides through the gates.

           INT. CASTLE - DAY

           The Lead Samurai kneels before a furious Wakamoto and The 
           Decapitator. 
                                 WAKAMOTO
                        Hiroyuki dares to defy me? 

                                 THE DECAPITATOR
                            (to the Lead Samurai)
                        This boy has the skin of a ghost, 
                        you say?

           The Lead Samurai nods. 

           The Decapitator -- thoughtful.

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        You know of this curious creature?

                                 THE DECAPITATOR
                        There is a chance he represents some 
                        unfinished business.

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        If they are traveling together 
                        Hiroyuki will be easy to find. Kill 
                        them both.

                                 THE DECAPITATOR
                        What of our battle plans?

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        I will lead the army.

                                 THE LEAD SAMURAI
                        And of me, Master?

           Wakamoto caresses The Lead Samurai's shuriken scar then turns 
           to The Decapitator.

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        Make sure this man's courage is 
                        suitably rewarded.

           His look lingers -- something unspoken passing between them.

                                 THE LEAD SAMURAI
                        Thank you, my Lord. I shall not 
                        disappoint again.

           Wakamoto smiles, wryly. 

           MEGUMI

           looks in from the VERANDAH. 
           EXT. VERANDAH - CONTINUOUS

           MEGUMI SEES: Wakamoto comes towards her. Behind him, THE 
           DECAPITATOR LOPS OFF THE HEAD OF THE STILL KNEELING LEAD 
           SAMURAI!

           As Wakamoto exits:

                                 MEGUMI
                        Trouble?

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        Not anymore.

           She takes his hand and leads him to the wall. 

           THE SKY

           is a PECULIAR COLOR and hazy from THE SMOKE OF NUMEROUS, 
           DISTANT FIRES.

                                 MEGUMI
                        The sky is so pretty when it's tinged 
                        with death.

           She kisses him. Softly at first, then becoming harder...

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Hiroyuki follows the path. There's a NOISE. He stops and 
           looks behind him. Continues on his way.

           ANOTHER NOISE. He turns his horse around. Stares at a tree.

                                 HIROYUKI
                        Show yourself.

           He takes out his spear.

                                 HIROYUKI
                        I will not ask again.

           Something moves on the other side of the path -- not where 
           Hiroyuki's looking. He spins around, spear at the ready...

           ...to find the Boy watching him. He holds up A SAMURAI SWORD.

                                 BOY
                        If this was a bow you'd be dead by 
                        now.
                                 HIROYUKI
                        If you could fire it.

           He dismounts. Approaches the Boy.

                                 HIROYUKI
                        Last time we met we were headed in 
                        different directions. Why are you 
                        now following me?

                                 BOY
                        I want to reach ten.

                                 HIROYUKI
                        Then you shouldn't be carrying this.

           A deft hand movement relieves the sword from the Boy's grasp.

                                 BOY
                        Hey! Give that back.

           Hiroyuki throws the sword upwards, EMBEDDING IT IN THE BRANCH 
           OF A TREE -- way out of reach. He gets back on his horse and 
           rides away once more.

           The Boy looks at the sword. Tries to scale the tree. Fails.

           EXT. KENJI AND AYAKO'S HOMESTEAD - DAY

           THE BODIES OF KENJI AND AYAKO lie on the ground out front. 
           Each is on a BED OF FIREWOOD.

           A tearful Mayumi stands over them holding a LIT TORCH. 

           She sets light to the firewood.

           Flames rise quickly, cremating the bodies.

           She stares into the flames, lost, then studies HOOFPRINTS IN 
           THE SOIL. They lead to the woods.

           A beat.

           Mayumi enters her former home.

           INT. KENJI AND AYAKO'S HOMESTEAD - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Mayumi opens a SECRET COMPARTMENT FULL OF NINJA WEAPONS.
           EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS

           Mayumi, NOW DRESSED AS A NINJA, gazes at a patch of path 
           stained with blood. 

           All of a sudden she LOOKS DIRECTLY AT US. She starts running. 
           She is incredibly nimble. She gets closer and closer then 
           SPRINGS INTO THE AIR, SAILING AT, THEN OVER US!

           REVERSE ANGLE: she clings to a tree trunk! Climbs up with 
           amazing dexterity. 

           EXT. IN THE TREE TOP - CONTINUOUS

           It towers far above others and serves as a fantastic lookout 
           point. 

           Mayumi reaches the top and scans the surroundings. 

           WE SEE: evidence of numerous fires. 

           A beat.

           EXT. VILLAGE INN - DAY

           A raucous drinking/eating hole in a clearing in the heart of 
           the woods.

           INT. VILLAGE INN - DAY

           Hiroyuki makes his way to the bar. The INNKEEPER greets him.

                                 INNKEEPER
                        What'll it be?

           He reaches behind his neck and pulls THE DAGGER out of his 
           kimono, laying it on the counter.

           EXT. VILLAGE INN - A SHORT WHILE LATER

           The Boy peers at the Inn from the tree-line. He sees 
           Hiroyuki's horse. A WIDE-BRIMMED RICE FARMER'S HAT rests on 
           the saddle of the MULE beside it.
           INT. VILLAGE INN - CONTINUOUS

           The Boy weaves through the crowd, the HAT tipped low to hide 
           his face. He spies Hiroyuki sitting at a corner table, showing 
           the dagger to some MEN.  

           A PATRON walks past with A BOWL OF FOOD, distracting him. He 
           is hungry. 

           Looking about, he sees THREE MEN sit at a nearby bench laden 
           with food and drink. They are a little drunk. He crawls 
           beneath the table. Watches the Men through cracks. Slips his 
           hand above the table, reaching for AN APPLE. 

           He is just about to find it when a hand grabs his wrist! The 
           Man (#1) pulls him up, The Boy keeping his head low.

                                 1ST DRUNK
                        Think you can steal from me, huh?

           The Man cocks his head to peek at the Boy. He frowns. Pulls 
           the hat down. The three Men GASP. They stare at the Boy, 
           fascinated.

                                 2ND DRUNK
                        Eyes of a demon!

           #1 picks up the APPLE (green).

                                 1ST DRUNK
                        The very same!

           He offers it to the Boy.

                                 1ST DRUNK
                        Come and get it, demon child.

                                 BOY
                        I'm not a demon.

                                 3RD DRUNK
                        It speaks!

                                 1ST DRUNK
                        What else does it do, I wonder?

           He teases the Boy with the apple.

                                 2ND DRUNK
                        Careful or it'll cast a spell on 
                        you!
                                 3RD DRUNK
                        Turn you into a cockroach!

                                 BOY
                        Somebody already beat me to it.

           #2 and #3 roar with laughter, taunt #1 with lines like "He 
           called you a cockroach!" 

           The Boy grabs the apple, angering #1 even more and he rises 
           to his feet. It's now the Boy's turn to tease him with the 
           apple and he does so magnificently, holding it out, switching 
           hands, making it disappear up his sleeve, etc. 

           The Man draws HIS SWORD. The Boy stops, lets him take the 
           apple. The Man does. Suddenly... 

           A DAGGER SAILS THROUGH THE AIR

           ...piercing the apple, knocking it out of the Man's hand and 
           embedding itself in a wall!

           #1 looks at Hiroyuki -- the dagger's owner.

           #1 advances. 

           Hiroyuki picks up a chopstick. He holds it as if a sword. 

           #1 rushes him. Hiroyuki throws the chopstick in his face, 
           startling him, using the opportunity to rob him of his sword, 
           throw him to the ground, and ram the sword through his sleeve 
           and into the floorboards, staking him in place. 

           #2 and #3 rise, drawing their own swords.

           Hiroyuki picks up the chopstick.

           #2 rushes him. Hiroyuki throws the chopstick at #3, confusing
           #2. And in his confusion he suffers the same fate as #1!  

           Hiroyuki faces #3 and points to the stick -- on the floor in
           front of #3.

           #3, not wanting to lose face, bends for the chopstick.
           Hiroyuki kicks him in the face and before he knows anything
           about it, he too is staked to the floor courtesy of his own
           sword! 

           Hiroyuki retrieves his dagger from the wall and grabs the
           Boy by the scruff of his neck.
           EXT. VILLAGE INN - CONTINUOUS

           Hiroyuki drags the Boy outside.

                                 HIROYUKI
                        Are you brave, or just stupid?

           The Boy stares at him.

                                 HIROYUKI
                        Do you have a name?

                                 BOY
                        George.

           He crouches down. They are eye level.

                                 HIROYUKI
                        I will call you Midori Metsuki.
                            (a beat)
                        Green Eyes.

           The Boy (now GREEN EYES) looks at him --

                                 GREEN EYES
                        Green Eyes?

           -- and smiles.

                                 HIROYUKI
                        My name is Hiroyuki.

           Green Eyes smiles.

                                 GREEN EYES
                        I will call you Hiro.

           INT. CASTLE, LOOKOUT TOWER - DAY

           A RIVAL WARLORD WEARING A WHITE KIMONO stares at a BLOOD RED
           STAIN ON THE HILLSIDE. 

           It is coming his way.

           EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY

           Wakamoto marches his BLOOD RED ARMY towards the castle. 

           They are on foot.
           A FIREBALL

           appears in the air...

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        Here it comes!

           He lowers his head and raises his SHIELD! All around him,
           men do the same, simultaneously bunching up closer until
           shields overlap.

           THE FIREBALL 

           slams down on top of the impenetrable steel mass, skittering
           off and down the hillside!

           MORE FIREBALLS hit their mark, FIRE dripping through any
           gaps in the shields!

           Still Wakamoto's army advances. 

           As they get closer... 

           A DELUGE OF ARROWS 

           ...replaces the fireballs. 

           Again the shield tactic is adopted. 

           Again Wakamoto's men survive unscathed. 

           They reach the castle walls. All of a sudden THE SCREEN OF
           SHIELD STARTS TO RISE UPWARDS as warriors climb onto each
           other's shoulders.

           The shields reach the top of the castle walls. 

           WARRIORS IN BLOOD RED KIMONOS

           pour over the walls into the castle's grounds, swords at the
           ready.

           SAMURAI IN WHITE KIMONOS

           rush them -- their white kimonos soon red with blood.
           WAKAMOTO 

           clambers over the wall. He holds a SPEAR in one hand and a
           SWORD in the other, thrusting his spear into an onrushing
           WHITE SAMURAI as he swings his sword at another! 

           He's not as graceful as Hiro or as brutal as The Decapitator,
           but more ruthless than both put together.

           He searches for the RIVAL WARLORD. Finds him. Starts heading
           his way...

           All around, a vicious battle rages. Wakamoto's men continue
           to pour over the walls. A contingent fights their way to the
           gates and opens them, allowing the rest of the BLOOD REDS to
           storm inside.

           SPEARS 

           sail through the air. Too many to count. 

           One strikes an ARCHER in a WHITE KIMONO in the TOWER, pinning
           his body against the wall!

           Another hits a BLOOD RED just as he climbs over the wall,
           the force knocking him back over the other side!

           WAKAMOTO

           plows through man after man, chopping them down with his
           sword or ramming his spear into their chests, until he reaches
           the Rival Warlord. 

           They fight, mano a mano. 

           As they do, surrounding Samurai gradually stop fighting and
           watch... the sensation spreading throughout the battle until
           only the two Lords duel.

           The Rival Warlord matches Wakamoto, blow for blow, until
           suddenly Wakamoto PLUNGES HIS SPEAR INTO HIS LEG, shattering
           his knee! He stumbles to the ground but does not scream.

           Wakamoto knocks his enemy's sword out of his grasp.

           The Rival Warlord kneels before him, bloody, and at his mercy.

           Wakamoto shows him none, chopping off his right arm at the
           wrist, then his left.
           Finally, there's a SWOOSH.

           He CUTS OFF THE WARLORD'S HEAD.

           Turns to look at all the White Kimonos around him.

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        You dedicate your lives to this man?
                        I give you the opportunity to serve
                        a real warrior! 

           He rams his spear through the Warlord's severed head and
           hoists it into the air.

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        But first you must prove your
                        allegiance. 

           He stakes the spear in the ground. 

           A beat.

           A SAMURAI IN WHITE suddenly takes a sword and chops off the
           head of ANOTHER SAMURAI IN WHITE who is lying on the ground,
           wounded. 

           He daubs his kimono in his blood then picks up a spear and
           STAKES THE MAN'S HEAD.

           The SAMURAI IN WHITE next to him hesitates.

           Wakamoto kills him without a second thought.

                                                             DISSOLVE TO:

           WAKAMOTO 

           leading a now vastly increased army out of the castle, leaving
           behind...

           HUNDREDS OF HEADS ON SPEARS

           staked into the ground inside the castle walls. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

           Green Eyes rides with Hiro.
                                 HIRO
                        I am sorry about your father. A true
                        Samurai does not enjoy killing.

                                 GREEN EYES
                        Then why do they do it?

                                 HIRO
                        Because we believe in someone, and
                        have promised to protect them.

                                 GREEN EYES
                        Who do you believe in?

                                 HIRO
                        My Master is dead. I am no longer
                        Samurai. I am... Ronin.

                                 GREEN EYES
                        What does that mean?

                                 HIRO
                        It means... I get to make my own
                        rules now.

                                 GREEN EYES
                        So what are you going to do?

                                 HIRO
                        I seek my Master's murderer.

                                 GREEN EYES
                        You want revenge?

                                 HIRO
                        Justice. 

                                 GREEN EYES
                        What's the difference?

           Silence.

                                 GREEN EYES
                        Where are you taking me?

                                 HIRO
                        To a place where you will be safe.

           EXT. TEMPLE - DAY (FEATURED ON PAGE 1)

           An APPRENTICE MONK rakes the pebble garden.
           INT. TEMPLE - DAY

           The Monk kneels at his easel, painting. His back is to the
           doorway.

           The Apprentice approaches, quietly, and peers inside.

           A beat. Without turning round:

                                 MONK
                        A better view can be gained from
                        within.

           The Apprentice steps into the room. 

           THE MONK'S PAINTING

           is of the temple being consumed BY FLAMES. A WARRIOR, a BOY,
           and a HORSE stand beside a WOODEN BRIDGE in the foreground.
           The Boy has a ghostly complexion and piercing green eyes.

           It terrifies the Apprentice.

                                 MONK
                        You disapprove.

           The Apprentice doesn't respond at first -- unable to take
           his eyes off the painting. He gestures to others on the walls,
           the naval battle now one of them.

                                 APPRENTICE MONK
                        You paint the future...

                                 MONK
                        I paint what my mind shows me.

           The Apprentice looks back at the unfinished painting.

                                 APPRENTICE MONK
                        But that's... here? 
                            (accusingly)
                        Them.

           He points at the Warrior and Boy. They feature in a painting
           on the wall also -- SURROUNDED BY SEVEN DEAD SAMURAI ON A
           SHADY PATH.

                                 APPRENTICE MONK
                        Who are these harbingers of doom?
                                 MONK
                        You may ask them for yourself. They
                        are to be our guests tonight. 

                                 APPRENTICE MONK
                        They're coming here? Tonight?

           He GASPS.

           WE SEE: the unfinished painting. The Monk is in the process
           of adding ANOTHER PERSON to it -- lying on the ground at the
           Warrior's feet. Decapitated.

                                 APPRENTICE MONK
                        Who is that?

                                 MONK
                        A fool. Every tragedy needs a fool
                        to set the wheels in motion. 
                            (a beat)
                        You should go to the village and buy
                        supplies. You must hurry. Time is
                        not on your side.

           The Apprentice hurries out, fearful.

           EXT. WOODEN BRIDGE - DAY

           Connecting the temple to the mist-shrouded forest.

           The Apprentice rides across on A MULE. He stops halfway,
           frozen in horror.

           HIRO AND GREEN EYES

           emerge from the mist and ride past him.

           EXT. TEMPLE - DAY

           Hiro lifts Green Eyes from the horse. 

                                 MONK (O.S.)
                        Welcome.

           The Monk sits on a stone bench with a TEA-POT and THREE CUPS.
           He pours the tea and offers for them to join him.

                                 GREEN EYES
                            (whispers to Hiro)
                        How did he know we were coming?
                                 HIRO
                        People say he's a mystic.

                                 GREEN EYES
                        What's that?

                                 HIRO
                        Old and crazy. Come. 

           Hiro bows to the Monk. Green Eyes copies him.

           The Monk studies Green Eyes closely.

                                 MONK
                        You are small for a nine-year-old. 

                                 GREEN EYES
                        How do you know how old I am?

           The Monk smiles.

                                 MONK
                        Why don't you take a look around?
                        There are fish in the lake.

           Green Eyes wanders off, uncertain. Hiro sits beside the Monk.

                                 MONK
                        You are Ronin, now.

                                 HIRO
                        I have brought dishonor to your name.

                                 MONK
                        No. You have restored my faith in
                        our country's future.

           He gazes at Green Eyes -- leaning over the wall to see the
           fish.

                                 HIRO
                        Our people killed his father.

                                 MONK
                        He is an orphan.

                                 HIRO
                        Why do you speak to me in his
                        language?

                                 MONK
                        You understand it.
                                 HIRO
                        Because you taught me.

                                 MONK
                        Perhaps now you know why.

           A beat.

                                 MONK
                        He is a blank canvas. He needs someone
                        to help select the colors that will
                        paint his future. 

                                 HIRO
                        That is why I've brought him here.
                        To you.

                                 MONK
                        His mentor must be someone who has
                        walked his path before him. 

           GREEN EYES

           studies a stone lantern. He looks back at Hiro only to see
           him disappear into the temple with the Monk.

           INT. TEMPLE - DAY

           We are in a room we haven't seen before. The Monk takes a
           ROLLED-UP BUNDLE OF PAINTINGS from a drawer. He finds one
           and hands it to Hiro.

           Hiro unrolls it.

           IT IS A PAINTING OF HIM AND GREEN EYES -- Hiro with SWORDS
           raised in fighting style, Green Eyes crouching beneath him
           with a DAGGER in one hand and A PAIR OF TIGER CLAWS on the
           other. (This could very well be our one-sheet.)

                                 HIRO
                        The boy is not my destiny. 

                                 MONK
                        Destiny is not the path you choose
                        for yourself, but the path that is
                        chosen for you.

                                                                 CUT TO:
           VIEW FROM THE SHADOWS 

           in the corridor outside the room -- the Monk returns the
           paintings to the drawer and exits. He stops in the doorway.
           Sensing something. A smile forms on his face. He walks off.

           Hiro takes one last look at the drawer and follows him.  

           A beat.

           GREEN EYES steps out of the shadows.

           He gazes at the drawer, curious. Goes to it. Lifts the
           paintings out. Unrolls them.

           THE PAINTING ON TOP

           is of A DOOR IN THE GROUND. IT IS OPEN AND A STONE STAIRCASE
           DESCENDS FROM IT.

           Green Eyes frowns. 

           THE NEXT PAINTING 

           is the image of him and Hiro. 

           Green Eyes -- fascinated.

           EXT. MARKET PLACE - DAY

           The Apprentice Monk buys supplies. The MARKET TRADER takes
           his money and says in a hushed tone:

                                 MARKET TRADER
                        As if civil war and a ninja hunt
                        isn't enough -- now they're searching
                        for a dangerous Ronin and a child
                        with skin like the moon.

           He nods into the crowd where SAMURAI are asking questions.
           One speaks to the Three Drunk Men. 

           The Apprentice Monk's face registers a glimmer of hope, the
           CAMERA HOLDING on his reaction then drifting to a nearby
           stall.
           STANDING IN THE SHADOWS WITHIN

           is a FIGURE DRESSED IN BLACK -- Mayumi. She is also watching
           the Samurai.

           INT. TEMPLE - EVENING

           The Monk, Hiro and Green Eyes eat dinner. Hiro is quiet,
           brooding.

                                 GREEN EYES
                        Hiro says I'm to stay here for a
                        while.

                                 MONK
                        A while can be a life-time... or
                        just a few hours.

                                 GREEN EYES
                        You taught Hiro how to fight? Will
                        you teach me?

                                 MONK
                        I was much younger then. 
                            (looks at Hiro)
                        You will need to find someone closer
                        to your own age.

                                 GREEN EYES
                        How old are you?

                                 MONK
                        I do not know.

                                 GREEN EYES
                        How can you not know how old you
                        are?

                                 MONK
                        It is not how long we live that is
                        important.

                                 HIRO
                        It's time for you to go to bed.

                                 GREEN EYES
                        But I'm not tired.

           Hiro glares at him.
                                 GREEN EYES
                            (to the Monk)
                        Can I ask one more question?

           The Monk nods.

                                 GREEN EYES
                        Hiro says you're a 'mystic'. Does
                        that mean you see the future?

                                 MONK
                        It means I see things others do not. 

           He beckons Green Eyes closer. Looks into his eyes.

                                 MONK
                        I see a warm, soft futon awaiting
                        you upstairs. 

           He smiles. Green Eyes smiles back.

                                 GREEN EYES
                        Can we talk again tomorrow?

                                 MONK
                        I hope we will speak again many times.

           Green Eyes leaves, followed, seconds later, by Hiro.

           THROUGH A DOORWAY: the Apprentice Monk watches.

           INT. TEMPLE, GUEST SLEEPING QUARTERS - EVENING

           TWO FUTONS are on the floor. 

           Green Eyes changes into a smock. Gazes at Hiro's swords
           leaning against a chair. He unsheathes one, nervous. It is
           incredibly light for something so dangerous. He holds it,
           menacingly.

                                 HIRO (O.S.)
                            (harsh)
                        Put that back.

           Hiro stands in the doorway. Green Eyes puts the sword back.

                                 HIRO
                        It is against the law to draw a sword
                        inside a temple.

           Green Eyes gets under the covers.
                                 GREEN EYES
                        Will you tell me a story?

                                 HIRO
                        The stories I know would not make
                        for a good night's sleep.

           He blows out a candle.

           INT. TEMPLE - EVENING

           Hiro finds the Monk meditating, eyes closed. 

                                 HIRO
                        He is not a warrior.

                                 MONK
                        That is what people said about you.
                            (eyes open)
                        They were wrong. 

           INT. TEMPLE, GUEST SLEEPING QUARTERS - EVENING

           It is dark and shadowy, lit only by the glow from a lantern.

           Hiro stands in the doorway, gazing at a sleeping Green Eyes.

           A SHADOW MOVES!

           THE SHADOW MOVES AGAIN!

           Hiro slides the shoji fully open. He sees nothing until:

           A FIGURE DRESSED IN BLACK, AKA MAYUMI

           steps out from the shadows.

                                 HIRO
                        Ninja. 

           Mayumi brandishes a LONG, WOODEN STAFF.

                                 MAYUMI
                        What's wrong, warrior? Naked without
                        your sword?

           She throws one of Hiro's swords at his feet.

           Hiro does not take it, instead glancing at a staff on the
           wall. Mayumi realizes.
                                 MAYUMI
                        But of course. We are in a temple.
                            (re the staff)
                        Doh-zo.

           Hiro takes the staff. He bows to Mayumi.

                                 HIRO
                        You will have honor in defeat, Ninja.

                                 MAYUMI
                        The Ronin speaks of honor. How ironic.

                                 HIRO
                        Judge me again when you are a ghost.
                            (re a still sleeping
                             Green Eyes)
                        Let us go somewhere a little more
                        suitable.

           EXT. TEMPLE - EVENING

           Hiro bows once more at Mayumi. When he raises his head she
           has gone. 

           The stone lanterns provide many a hiding place.

           MAYUMI 

           emerges behind Hiro, staff raised.

           HIRO

           spins at the last second and PARRIES HER BLOW!

           INT. TEMPLE, GUEST SLEEPING QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

           Green Eyes awakes. He hears the fight from an open window.

           EXT. TEMPLE - CONTINUOUS

           The duel is breathtaking, Mayumi's agility canceling out
           Hiro's superiority with a staff.

           They clash staffs. Their faces are close.
                                 HIRO
                        You fight well. If you possessed a
                        conscience you may have made a good
                        Samurai.

                                 MAYUMI
                        The same could be said of you.

           She shoves him away then flicks A DART at him. Hiro catches
           it on his staff and tosses it into the lake.

                                 HIRO
                        Any more tricks up your sleeve?

           His composure is clearly rattling Mayumi and she sends a
           SWARM OF DARTS his way. Again Hiro catches them all in his
           staff and tosses them into the lake. Mayumi comes at him,
           staff flailing. He endures her attack and then...

                                 HIRO
                        My turn.

           ...he comes at her, knocking her staff from her grasp and 
           forcing her backwards until she is up against a wall. She 
           flips over him. Hiro thrusts his staff high in the air, 
           hitting her mid-flight, sending her tumbling to the ground.

           He keeps her on the ground with his foot.

                                 MAYUMI
                        Let me go!

                                 HIRO
                        Tell me, do you hide your face out 
                        of ugliness?

           He pulls off her mask.

           Mayumi's beauty takes him completely by surprise.

           They gaze at each other a moment. 

                                 MAYUMI
                        Take your lecherous eyes off me.

                                 HIRO
                        My lecherous eyes?

           Mayumi kicks him where it hurts and springs to her feet. She 
           grabs her staff and is about to connect it to Hiro's head 
           when--
                                 GREEN EYES (O.S.)
                        Mayumi!

           --she freezes. She and Hiro look upward.

           GREEN EYES

           peers down at them from a window.

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

           The Decapitator and TEN SAMURAI ride at pace.

           A portentous image.

           INT. TEMPLE, GUEST SLEEPING QUARTERS - NIGHT

           Hiro peers through a crack in the shoji at Mayumi. 

           She is telling Green Eyes a bedtime story.

           INT. TEMPLE - NIGHT

           The Monk hangs a painting. Hiro enters.

                                 MONK
                            (re painting)
                        Is this straight?

           The painting is the one he was working on earlier, except 
           now a BEAUTIFUL, YOUNG NINJA WOMAN stands with the WARRIOR, 
           the BOY, and the HORSE.

                                 HIRO
                        Paint whatever you like. I told you, 
                        the boy is not my destiny. She is 
                        not my destiny. 

           He reaches behind his neck and pulls THE DAGGER out of his 
           kimono. He hands it to the Monk.

                                 HIRO
                        That is my destiny.

           EXT. TEMPLE - NIGHT

           The Monk leads Hiro to the wall and stares into the mist. 
           The GLOW OF DISTANT FIRES gives it an eerie quality. 
           The Monk still has the dagger.

                                 MONK
                        Evil is spreading. Japan's future 
                        hangs in the balance.

           IMAGES APPEAR IN THE MIST

           as if projected onto the swirling, eerie canvas by an 
           invisible source. 

           WE SEE:

           -- GLIMPSES OF NUMEROUS BATTLES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. 

           -- HUGE ARMIES BEING ASSEMBLED.

           -- FIRES RAZING BUILDINGS TO THE GROUND.

           -- PEOPLE GETTING SLAUGHTERED... SKINNED ALIVE... POISONED... 
           STABBED... BEHEADED... TRAMPLED UNDER HORSES... ETC. 

           MAYUMI

           exits the temple. She makes her way quietly through the
           minefield of stone lanterns. 

                                 MONK
                        Takamoto wanted to unite our country.
                        You are all that is left of his dream. 

                                 HIRO
                        I am just one.

                                 MONK
                        No. You are three. 

           He turns to a lantern. Mayumi steps out from behind it.

                                 HIRO
                        She is Ninja. I am Samurai.

                                 MONK
                        The boy will learn from both of you.

                                 HIRO
                        He is just nine years old.

                                 MONK
                        Boys grow up to be men... as you
                        know all too well.
           He studies the dagger. Hands it back to Hiro.

                                 MONK
                        Visit the Takada family in the
                        foothills of Fuji. The father will
                        be able to assist you with this.

                                 MAYUMI
                        I know who you speak of. 

                                 HIRO
                        We leave with the sunrise. 

                                 MONK
                        I fear that will be too late.

           Mayumi's ears prick up.

           WE HEAR: the far-off sound of HORSES.

                                 MAYUMI
                            (worried)
                        Are you expecting company?

           EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS

           The eerie, white mist obscures the view to one side.

           The Decapitator and Samurai ride up to the Apprentice Monk. 
           He waits for them beside a tree.

           He leads them to the edge of the mist, pointing out the WOODEN 
           BRIDGE...

           INT. TEMPLE, GUEST SLEEPING QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

           Mayumi wakes Green Eyes. Hiro puts on his swords. 

           EXT. WOODEN BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           The Decapitator and Samurai ride across.

           INT. TEMPLE - CONTINUOUS

           The Decapitator and Samurai storm inside. MONKS and 
           APPRENTICES greet them (we will have seen these in the 
           background in previous scenes).
                                 THE DECAPITATOR
                            (addressing A MONK)
                        Where are they?

           He gets no answer and SLICES OFF THE MONK'S HEAD. He turns 
           to AN APPRENTICE MONK.

                                 THE DECAPITATOR
                        Talk.

                                 APPRENTICE MONK #2
                        It is forbidden to draw swords here.

           The Decapitator SLICES OFF HIS HEAD. 

           HIRO, GREEN EYES, MAYUMI AND THE MONK

           run along the balcony of the floor above.

           The Decapitator addresses his Men.

                                 THE DECAPITATOR
                            (re the Monks)
                        Kill them all.

           SAMURAI start killing the Monks and Apprentices.

           INT. TEMPLE, 2ND FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

           The Monk leads Hiro, Mayumi and Green Eyes through a maze of
           corridors.

           They pass a STAIRCASE. Seconds later, The Decapitator comes
           up it. 

           GREEN EYES 

           glances over his shoulder. He sees The Decapitator walking
           after them. 

           FLASHCUT: THE DECAPITATOR KILLS GREEN EYES' FATHER!

           Green Eyes stops running and just stares at his father's
           killer -- immobilized by fear.

                                 MAYUMI
                        Georgie!

           Mayumi SCREAMS at him. He doesn't respond.
           The Decapitator gets closer.

           He draws his sword.

           Hiro races back. The distance is too great.

           The Decapitator smiles at Hiro... prepares to swing...

           Mayumi flicks her wrists.

           A DOZEN SHURIKEN

           whistle past Hiro! They TEAR into The Decapitator's arm, 
           lacerating it!

           He merely switches his sword to his other hand.

           But Hiro has closed the gap. He draws his own swords and 
           steps into The Decapitator's path.

           A beat.

           Mayumi races back and scoops up Green Eyes.

           And then The Decapitator makes his move, summoning all his 
           strength and superior reach to batter Hiro.

           ON THE FLOOR BELOW

           Samurai stop and watch.

           HIRO

           weathers the storm, slowly getting the upper hand and pushing 
           The Decapitator back down the corridor to the top of the 
           staircase.

           One final barrage forces The Decapitator over the top step 
           and tumbling down the stairs!

           INT. TEMPLE - CONTINUOUS

           Mayumi carries Green Eyes around a corner.

                                 MAYUMI
                        It's a dead end!

           The Monk pushes a panel. 
           A SECRET PASSAGEWAY opens up!

           Hiro arrives as Mayumi and Green Eyes enter the passageway.

                                 HIRO
                            (to the Monk)
                        You first.

                                 MONK
                        I am not going with you.

                                 HIRO
                        He will kill you.

                                 MONK
                        He will try.

           Hiro -- conflicted.

                                 MONK
                        Go. Death comes to each of us when 
                        the time is right.

           Hiro embraces the Monk and slips into the passageway. The 
           Monk seals it shut and waits next to a FLOOR-STANDING, WROUGHT 
           IRON CANDLE HOLDER.

           The Decapitator strides around the corner, plucking bloody 
           shuriken from his arm. He analyzes the dead end. 

                                 THE DECAPITATOR
                        Open it.

           The Monk looks into his eyes.

                                 THE DECAPITATOR
                        I won't ask again.

                                 MONK
                        If a man wishes his innermost dreams 
                        fulfilled he must make sacrifices.
                            (a beat)
                        This is one of yours.

                                 THE DECAPITATOR
                        I have heard the rumors about you, 
                        old man. 

           He raises his sword above his head.

                                 THE DECAPITATOR
                        Magic is no match for steel.
           He swings his sword!

           The Monk THRUSTS THE CANDLE HOLDER EFFORTLESSLY INTO THE 
           AIR, miraculously blocking the attack.

                                 MONK
                        But wrought iron is.

           The Decapitator swings again and again. Each time the Monk 
           meets his sword with the candle holder, his actions at odds 
           with the holder's weight. 

           The Decapitator launches into frenzied combat, raining blow 
           after blow on the Monk. None hit their target.

           The Decapitator stops fighting. He is out of breath. 

           The Monk now goes on the attack, using the candle holder as 
           a shield no longer, but as a weapon. His skill is mesmerizing. 
           His movements seem to defy gravity. 

           The showdown ends with The Decapitator pinned up against a 
           wall, the candle holder at his throat.

                                 THE DECAPITATOR
                        What do you know of my dreams?

           EXT. TEMPLE - NIGHT

           A Samurai unties Hiro's horse. It rears up on its hind legs 
           and bolts for the bridge, vanishing into the distant mist. 

           The Decapitator leads the Monk from the temple, watching 
           carefully as he climbs onto a horse. 

           In the background, Samurai DIP ARROWS INTO A BLAZING FIRE 
           PIT...

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           The Decapitator and Samurai emerge from the mist with the 
           Monk -- their prisoner.

           Beyond the mist, THE TEMPLE IS BURNING.

           The Apprentice Monk steps out from behind a tree. He lowers 
           his head in shame.

           The Decapitator beheads him as he passes.

           A beat.
           HIRO, GREEN EYES AND MAYUMI

           emerge from a CAVE-LIKE OPENING at the base of AN ENORMOUS 
           TREE. 

           Hiro approaches the Apprentice Monk. He lies, decapitated, 
           in front of the wooden bridge, eerie white mist and temple 
           engulfed in flames behind him. 

           Green Eyes and Mayumi stand beside Hiro.

           A beat. We hear a SNORT.

           HIRO'S HORSE

           trots through the trees to Hiro's side.

           The scene is exactly as the Monk painted.

           Hiro -- deep in thought.

           EXT. CASTLE - MORNING

           Wakamoto and his army return from battle. 

           The Decapitator approaches. Wakamoto looks about, expectantly. 

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        Why do I not see Hiroyuki's head on 
                        a stake?

                                 THE DECAPITATOR
                        His escape is only temporary. We 
                        returned with a far greater gift.

           INT. CASTLE DUNGEONS - MORNING

           The Monk etches onto a sheet of paper with charcoal.

           TWO SAMURAI stand guard at the foot of a spiral staircase.

           Wakamoto descends.

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        Leave us.

           The Samurai leave.
           Wakamoto watches the Monk. He continues to sketch -- yet to
           even acknowledge Wakamoto's presence.

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        So you are the Monk who raised
                        Hiroyuki? I am willing to overlook
                        your recent indiscretions if you
                        tell me where I will find him.
                            (no response)
                        You do not answer. You do not even
                        look at me. I frighten you that much?
                        You are wise indeed.
                            (still no response)
                        I am Lord. You will speak to me!
                            (a beat)
                        This childish game only delays the
                        inevitable. Hiroyuki. Will. Die. 

                                 MONK
                        We will all die.

           The Monk lifts his head.

                                 MONK
                        Some sooner than others.

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        You save your breath for what -- a 
                        thinly veiled threat?

           The Monk resumes sketching.

                                 MONK
                        Hiroyuki is only one man. It is odd 
                        that someone who desires to be Shogun 
                        would fear him.

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        I fear no one. I gave Hiroyuki the 
                        chance of an honorable death. He 
                        repays me by killing my men. 
                            (a beat)
                        I offer you your freedom.

                                 MONK
                        I am not imprison.

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        Then get used to these walls for 
                        they are the last ones you will see.
                                 MONK
                        Walls cannot imprison a man. Only 
                        his actions can.

           Wakamoto walks to the staircase. Stops. Stares at the Monk.

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        If what they say about you is true, 
                        I suggest you start sketching a 
                        skeleton on a stone floor.

                                 MONK
                        I can do better than that.

           He turns his sketch over for Wakamoto to see.

           THE SKETCH

           shows Wakamoto LYING IN A POOL OF HIS OWN BLOOD SURROUNDED 
           BY A CIRCLE OF NINJA.

           Wakamoto stares at it. Fearful.

           EXT. BY THE SIDE OF A STREAM - MORNING

           Mayumi splashes her face with water.

           Hiro attaches the carcass of a wild animal to a spit. Mayumi 
           kneels beside him.

                                 MAYUMI
                        I haven't thanked you. 
                            (off Hiro's look)
                        For killing the men who took my 
                        parents' lives.

                                 HIRO
                        I did not do it for you.

                                 MAYUMI
                        I know. You did it for him.

           She gestures to Green Eyes -- sitting quietly by a small 
           fire.

                                 HIRO
                        He hasn't said a word since last 
                        night.

           Both of them gaze at Green Eyes. Their destiny.
           INT. CASTLE, SPA - DAY

           Wakamoto sits in the water, deep in thought.

           Someone enters behind him. He spins around, on edge.

           It is Megumi. She disrobes and stands before him, naked. 

                                 MEGUMI
                        Does the sight of your dead brother's 
                        naked wife unsettle you? Or is it 
                        the etchings of a crazy old monk? 

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        Perhaps you should see if he has 
                        anything in store for you? 

                                 MEGUMI
                        The future is what we make it. 

           She wades through the water towards him.

                                 MEGUMI
                        With your last victory your army has 
                        swelled. 

           Whispers into his ear, manipulatively.

                                 MEGUMI
                        If you cleanse Japan of every Ninja
                        alive there can be none left to hurt
                        you...

           Wraps her legs around his hips.

                                 MEGUMI
                        ...my Lord.

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

           The sleeping giant of MT. FUJI makes a spectacular backdrop.

           Hiro, Green Eyes and Mayumi all ride together on Hiro's horse.
           There are rice fields on either side. 

           UP AHEAD: a small house. It has been RECENTLY BURNED. 

           As they approach, Mayumi blocks Green Eyes' view.
           THE HEADS OF A MAN AND A WOMAN

           are IMPALED ON STAKES in front of the house.

           Hiro slows. Stares at the macabre sight.

                                 MAYUMI
                        These people are the Takada's
                        neighbors. They are not ninja.

           A SCREAM pierces the air. It comes from further up the road.

                                 HIRO
                        Wait here.

           Mayumi and Green Eyes get off the horse. Hiro gallops away. 

           EXT. THE TAKADA HOMESTEAD - DAY

           The TAKADA's are a FAMILY OF FOUR (FATHER, MOTHER, and TWO 
           CHILDREN). Currently they are on their knees in front of 
           their home covered in CUTS and BRUISES with hands tied behind 
           their backs. They are dressed as ninja.

           SIX SAMURAI surround them. 

           One of the Samurai draws his sword. 

                                 1ST SAMURAI
                        Who should die first?

           He steps in front of MR. TAKADA. He draws his word. Prepares 
           to kill him... but doesn't.  

           He moves in front of MRS. TAKADA. Prepares to kill her... 
           but doesn't again. 

           He moves in front of THEIR SON, 14. Prepares to kill him. 
           But doesn't. 

           He moves to THEIR DAUGHTER, 12. 

           Mrs. Takada sobs.

                                 MOTHER
                        Please.

           DAUGHTERS'S POV: the Samurai stands in front of her. He raises
           his sword above his head, two-handed. This time he means
           business. Suddenly...
           A SPEAR  

           rips through his chest! Blood sprays from his mouth!

           THE SAMURAI

           slumps to the ground.

           HIRO

           sits on his horse beyond.

                                 2ND SAMURAI
                        Hiroyuki.

           He smiles at Hiro -- who had only the one spear -- and raises
           his sword above the Takada Daughter's head.

           A SMALL 'BOMB' FILLED WITH METAL FILINGS (METSUBUSHI)

           'explodes' in his face!

           MAYUMI

           stands in the middle of a rice field, ninety degrees to Hiro's 
           side.

           She runs forwards. Hiro gallops. The Samurai split into pairs 
           and run to meet them. 

           WITH HIRO

           letting go of his reins and drawing his swords...

           WITH MAYUMI

           as she closes in on the Samurai...

           HIRO

           rides straight at the oncoming Samurai. TIME SLOWS: he swings 
           both swords, CUTTING CLEAN THROUGH the swords of the Samurai. 

           He turns his horse around. Dismounts.
           MAYUMI

           springs into the air, somersaulting over the Samurai, dropping
           to her feet just behind them. 

           She attacks the startled Samurai with her staff.

           HIRO

           walks towards his Two Samurai, each hand cutting fancy shapes
           in the air with a sword. 

           The Samurai rush him with daggers. 

           Hiro stabs each of them in the chest, simultaneously.

           MAYUMI

           runs up one side of the Takada homestead and down another,
           coming up behind the Samurai. She knocks one of their swords
           out of his hand, pulls A CONCEALED BLADE out of one end of
           her staff and kills him. 

           The last Samurai chooses to flee. Mayumi takes out a POISON
           DART...

                                 HIRO
                        Let him go.
                            (off her look)
                        He'll be our messenger.

           He cuts the Takadas free. The children hug their mother. 

           Mr. Takada looks at the Samurai who was hit with the
           metsubishi bomb. He's on his knees, hands clutched to his
           face, groaning.

           Mr. Takada picks up the Samurai's sword and GUTS HIM,
           viciously. 

           He turns to Hiro, his gaze shifting over Hiro's shoulder.

           GREEN EYES

           watches from a distance.

                                 MR. TAKADA
                        You are the Ronin and boy people are 
                        whispering about.
           He turns to Mayumi, recognizing her.

                                 MR. TAKADA
                        You are the daughter of Kenji and 
                        Ayako? 

           Mayumi nods. Mr. Takada dips his head.

                                 MR. TAKADA
                        My condolences.

           INT. THE TAKADA HOMESTEAD - A SHORT WHILE LATER

           Mr. Takada studies the dagger that killed Takamoto. 

                                 MR. TAKADA
                        There is only one swordsmith capable 
                        of such craftsmanship. His work 
                        commands a high price.

                                 HIRO
                        Where do I find him?

           Mr. Takada walks to the door. He points at MT. FUJI in the 
           distance.

                                 MR. TAKADA
                        He lives in the snow. But you must 
                        take great care. There is magic in 
                        the hills.

                                 MAYUMI
                        What kind of magic?

                                 MR. TAKADA
                        The worst kind.
                            (a beat)
                        I shall take you to a path that will 
                        lead you to his cave -- if you get 
                        that high.

           He looks at Green Eyes.

                                 MR. TAKADA
                        Perhaps the boy should remain here?

                                 HIRO
                        No. He comes with us.
           EXT. THE FOOTHILLS OF MT. FUJI - DAY

           Mr. Takada leads Hiro, Green Eyes and Mayumi (each with horse
           from one of the dead Samurai) to A CONCEALED PATH.

                                 MR. TAKADA
                        Good luck. My family and our entire
                        village are forever in your debt. 

           EXT. MT. FUJI - DAY

           Hiro, Mayumi and Green Eyes climb the path. Trees flank either
           side. 

           Mayumi slows. She stares into the trees. It is dark and
           shadowy but she senses movement within. But then it is gone.

           EXT. MT. FUJI - EVENING

           Our trio are in the land of rocks -- about 50 yards out of
           the tree line -- and sleeping around a small fire, except...  

           ...Green Eyes is not asleep. 

           He rises to his feet and tiptoes to Hiro, taking one of his
           swords.

           He walks to the edge of the trees and swings the sword against
           a tree trunk. It makes a LOUD THUD. 

           He looks back at Hiro and Mayumi -- still sleeping. 

           He moves DEEPER INTO THE TREES and continues practicing. The
           blade sticks in a trunk. As he struggles to free it...

           ...he hears A LOW GROWL.

           WITHIN THE TREES: movement. Some kind of creature... 

           AN ABOMINATION 

           ...the like of which has never been seen before, similar to 
           a big cat but with skin instead of fur, the skin possessing 
           a translucent nature -- veins are visible beneath its surface. 
           It has a grotesque head. Yellow eyes. 

           It circles Green Eyes then turns to face him.

           IT HAS TWO HEADS! 
           Green Eyes frees the sword and backs away, flailing the weapon 
           at the Abomination as it closes in on him.

           The Abomination leaps into the air!

           Green Eyes dives out the way! 

           He's on his feet in seconds and racing through the trees... 
           the Abomination hot on his trail.

           Green Eyes focuses on a tree ahead... runs straight at it...

           ...and scrambles up the tree trunk into the branches out of 
           the Abomination's reach!

           The Abomination's two heads BOTH ROAR THUNDEROUSLY! It starts 
           slamming its body angrily against the trunk, shaking the 
           tree.

           Green Eyes loses his grip and is just about to fall when...

           MAYUMI

           ...sails through the trees, landing on the branch above him 
           and plucking him from the Abomination's jaws!

           THE ABOMINATION 

           backs up, preparing to launch itself at the trunk once more. 
           It pauses, nostrils SNORTING in the cold air.

           HIRO

           approaches, spear in hand.  

           Trees prevent a clear shot. He backs up to the path, luring 
           the Abomination out into the open -- even more hideous in 
           the moonlight.

           Hiro throws his spear.

           The Abomination 'CATCHES' it -- its tail wrapping around the 
           shaft and plucking it out of the air! It twirls it around 
           like a baton then extends its tail backwards and LAUNCHES IT 
           BACK AT HIRO!

           He dives out of the way! The spear SLAMS into a tree!

           The Abomination advances.
                                 GREEN EYES
                        We have to help him!

           Mayumi holds him close. 

           He studies the blade of his sword. Breaks free of her grasp... 

                                 MAYUMI
                        Georgie!

           ...and drops to the ground, running out onto the path in 
           front of the Abomination! 

           Green Eyes hurls the sword, spear-like, at the creature.

           The Abomination's tail catches it again. The blade cuts 
           through it, severing it. The Abomination HOWLS.

           Hiro grasps the opportunity, attacking with his sword but 
           the Abomination's fangs snap at him, prevent him from getting 
           close enough. He looks up at a BRANCH hanging over the path.

           Mayumi follows his gaze. She moves from branch to branch 
           until she is directly above the Abomination. 

           Hiro continues to attack, choosing his moment carefully.

           He throws his sword high in the air.

           Mayumi drops from the branch. She grabs the sword and, landing 
           on the Abomination's back, thrusts it into its neck!

           The Abomination rears back violently then slumps to the 
           ground. Dead. 

           A beat.

           Hiro nods at Mayumi in respect and helps her down. They gaze 
           at the Abomination. Green Eyes joins them.

                                 GREEN EYES
                        What kind of creature is it?

                                 HIRO
                        An abomination. 

                                 MAYUMI
                        Let's just hope it wasn't anyone's 
                        pet.

           She shares a worried look with Hiro.
           INT. CASTLE - DAY

           Wakamoto paces. He is with The Decapitator and Megumi.

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        How many did he kill?

                                 THE DECAPITATOR
                        Five. There is a woman now traveling 
                        with him.

                                 MEGUMI
                        Who is this little whore keeping him 
                        company?

                                 THE DECAPITATOR
                        She is ninja.

                                 MEGUMI
                        Ninja?

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        His dishonor knows no limits. 

                                 MEGUMI
                        You must stop him. He is mocking 
                        you.

                                 THE DECAPITATOR
                        First we must find him. His movements 
                        have been... erratic. He is now headed 
                        south.

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        South?

           He walks to a window. Gazes in a southerly direction.

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        Perhaps our search is over. Tell my 
                        army to be ready for battle.

           Megumi goes to him. She follows his gaze.

           MT. FUJI

           rises in the distance.
           EXT. NEAR THE TOP OF MT. FUJI - DAY

           Hiro, Mayumi and Green Eyes make their way through A MINEFIELD 
           OF HUGE ROCKS BLANKETED WITH SNOW.

           UP AHEAD: the path ends at the MOUTH OF A CAVE. The snow in 
           front of it has thawed.

           WE HEAR: the HAMMERING OF STEEL from within.

           Mayumi and Hiro dismount.

                                 GREEN EYES
                        I'm coming with you.

                                 HIRO AND MAYUMI
                            (united)
                        No.

           INT. SWORDSMITH'S LAIR - DAY

           WE SEE: raised rock pools full of lava, furnaces built into 
           the walls, torches burning brightly. This is a hot place. 

           Exotic, lethal weapons glisten in racks.

           IN A CORNER: a small mountain of silver/gold/jewels, etc.

           A DOZEN, BEAUTIFUL WOMEN IN KIMONOS

           work here -- carrying big rocks of iron ore out of the depths 
           of the cave... stirring pots of molten liquid... pounding 
           slabs of virgin steel under heavy hammers... folding steel 
           strips over on itself until razor-thin. 

           Their mesmerizing beauty and presence in this setting distract 
           the eye from what should appear obvious -- the hammers are 
           too heavy, rocks too big. The women are unnaturally strong.

           HIRO AND MAYUMI

           enter. The Women stop what they're doing and stare at them. 

                                 HIRO
                        I am looking for the swordsmith.

           Two of the Women step aside, revealing:
           THE SWORDSMITH.

           He is shirtless and of scrawny physique. His skin glistens 
           with sweat. 

           He stands behind a long, granite table where he works a thin 
           strip of soft steel, transforming it into a beautiful, deadly 
           blade. 

           THE FINGERS ON HIS LEFT HAND 

           are MERE BONES! 

           Hiro and Mayumi approach. They watch in awe as --

           -- he dips his fingers into A POT OF MOLTEN LAVA then caresses 
           the blade, creating a stunning design. 

                                 SWORDSMITH
                        You wish to buy a sword?

           Hiro reaches behind his neck and lays the dagger on the table.

                                 HIRO
                        Is this your work?

           The Swordsmith looks at it and smiles. 

                                 SWORDSMITH
                        That was a commissioned piece. They 
                        cost extra.

                                 HIRO
                        I am not here to buy. I simply wish 
                        to know for whom this was made.

                                 SWORDSMITH
                        I sell swords, not information.

                                 MAYUMI
                        Hundreds of people are dead because 
                        of this dagger.

                                 SWORDSMITH
                        I do not make toys.

                                 HIRO
                        Tell me who you made it for and I 
                        will leave in peace.
                                 SWORDSMITH
                        I have already given you my answer.

           The Swordsmith returns to his work.

           Hiro draws his sword.

           TWO WOMEN 

           step between him and the Swordsmith.

                                 HIRO
                        I have never taken a woman's life
                        and do not wish to start now.

           The Women do not move.

                                 MAYUMI
                        I am not of the same moral high ground
                        as my friend here.

           She jabs at one of them with her staff. 

           The Woman HISSES at Mayumi and, for a split second only,
           morphs into...

           A HIDEOUS GIANT 

           ...with SHARP CLAWS, WILD HAIR and TWO HORNS growing from
           its head! It wears a LOINCLOTH and has RED skin. In one hand
           it holds A SPIKED, IRON CLUB. It is known as --

                                 MAYUMI
                        Oni.

           -- an ogre-like creature from Japanese folklore.

           The other Women begin to close in on Hiro and Mayumi.

           Mayumi backs away. Hiro stays rooted to the spot.

                                 MAYUMI
                        They are not women. If you think of
                        them as such they will crush your
                        bones with their clubs.

           The Women sense Hiro's weakness. They move closer and closer
           to him...

           Mayumi flings a SHURIKEN at one! It cuts into the Woman's
           flesh. 
           She HOWLS and becomes ONI, flailing at Mayumi with her club.

           Hiro flashes his sword.

           THE ONI'S WRIST 

           falls to the ground.

           THE OTHER ELEVEN WOMEN 

           instantly MORPH INTO ONI!

           HIRO 

           draws his other sword.

           The battle that ensues is mesmerizing -- two mortals against
           a dozen ogres in a setting that rivals Hell.

           ONE OF THE ONI

           rushes Hiro. 

           HIRO

           ducks to the side, and, crouching low, slashes at the Oni's
           ankles! The Oni ROARS and topples to the ground with a THUD.

           ANOTHER ONI

           targets Mayumi, swinging its club ferociously. Mayumi blocks
           with her staff only for the force to knock it clean out of
           her grasp. The Oni swings again... 

           MAYUMI 

           cartwheels away towards THE WEAPON RACKS. 

           ONI

           chase after her.
           MAYUMI

           grabs swords and flings them one after the other over her 
           shoulders at her attackers.

           HIRO

           fights two Oni, one with his left hand, one with his right. 
           His swords make no impact on their clubs and they steadily 
           back him up against a wall.

           THE ONI

           grin to each other and lift HUGE ROCKS above their heads... 

           HIRO

           puts his swords away and grabs TWO TORCHES off the walls.  

           THE ONI

           throw the rocks.

           HIRO

           dives forwards, rolling in between each ONI and, as the rocks 
           CRASH against the wall he...

           THRUSTS THE TORCHES

           ...into each Oni's loincloth! The Oni's SCREAM as the cloth 
           bursts into flame.

           MAYUMI 

           grabs the last weapon from the racks. She spins around to 
           find an Oni right behind her. Several Oni lie dead in the 
           background, weapons sticking out of their bodies.

           THE ONI

           swings its club. 
           MAYUMI 

           blocks. Again. And again. The Oni's might forces her towards 
           a LAVA POOL! Mayumi slips a TIGER CLAW over a hand.

           The Oni flails away until Mayumi teeters at the edge of the  
           pool. Mayumi smiles at the Oni and...

           ...throws A SMOKE BOMB at the ground, vanishing into the 
           smoke! We see her shadow leap upward, grip the roof of the 
           cave, and flip behind the Oni's back.

           She shoves the Oni into the lava pool!

           BACK WITH HIRO

           as he kills one Oni and then another. He doesn't see the 
           last Oni coming up behind him...

                                 GREEN EYES
                        Hiro!

           Green Eyes stands in the mouth of the cave. Hiro turns to 
           him, seeing the Oni's shadow on the wall. The Oni SMASHES 
           HIS CLUB DOWN...

           ...just as Hiro dives out of the way.

           The Oni turns to Green Eyes -- and goes for him, club raised.

           Hiro runs past the Oni and throws Green Eyes out of the way. 

           The Oni swings his club. Lightning fast, Hiro puts one sword 
           away and, using a two-handed sword grip, stops the club INCHES 
           FROM HIS OWN HEAD!

           His arms are about to buckle under the Oni's immense strength. 
           He drops to his knees, the sudden movement sending the Oni 
           crashing head over heels to the ground. 

           HIRO

           stands over it. 

           He raises his sword.

           THE ONI 

           morphs back into a beautiful woman and pleads:
                                 ONI/WOMAN
                        Please don't hurt me. 

           Hiro pauses. Then he brings his sword plummeting down, burying 
           it into the woman's chest! 

           A beat.

           Hiro bows to Green Eyes -- who beams.

           Hiro looks at the Swordsmith. Pulls his sword out of the 
           woman. Walks towards him.

           The Swordsmith looks about. There are tears in his eyes. 

                                 HIRO
                        Who commissioned the dagger?

           He pulls out his other sword and traps the Swordsmith's left 
           hand between both blades.

                                 HIRO
                        I will not kill you. But you will 
                        lose your livelihood.

           He applies pressure, his blades drawing blood.

           A beat.

           The Swordsmith nods. 

           Hiro releases him.

           The Swordsmith shuffles towards the mouth of the cave.

           He points a bony finger into the distance... where we see...

           ...TAKAMOTO'S CASTLE.

           A beat.

           EXT. MT. FUJI - NIGHT

           A sheltered spot surrounded by rocks.

           Hiro unpacks a blanket from his horse. 

           WE SEE: several of the Swordsmith's swords.

           Hiro drapes the blanket over a sleeping Green Eyes. He looks 
           to Mayumi -- sitting on A HUGE, FLAT ROCK staring up at the 
           sky.
           He joins her.

           It's a clear night. You can see a BILLION STARS.

                                 MAYUMI
                        I used to think there was a star for 
                        each person. 

           She turns her gaze to THE VALLEYS FAR BELOW. Flickering lights 
           tell us people's homes are still burning.

                                 MAYUMI
                        Another five or six days... there 
                        will be no ninja left.

                                 HIRO
                        This war ends tomorrow.

                                 MAYUMI
                        Going to the castle is suicide. 

                                 HIRO
                        You do not need to come. The men who 
                        killed your parents are dead. Your 
                        journey is over.

                                 MAYUMI
                        What about everything the Monk spoke 
                        of?

                                 HIRO
                        He was wrong. We are just three
                        people.

                                 MAYUMI
                        Three orphans.

           A beat.

                                 MAYUMI
                        What are you planning on doing?
                        Waltzing up to the castle gates and
                        knocking? Does nothing scare you? 

                                 HIRO
                        I am Samurai. I do not fear death.

                                 MAYUMI
                        But it's suicide. 

           Hiro takes out the dagger.
                                 HIRO
                        I made a promise. 

                                 MAYUMI
                        To Samurai, we ninja are cowards
                        because we hide under masks and the
                        black of night, yet you hide under a
                        different mask, a mask you call
                        'honor'. 

                                 HIRO
                        I do not expect you to understand.

                                 MAYUMI
                        I understand the sadness of losing
                        someone you love.

                                 HIRO
                        No one will shed tears at my death.

           Mayumi looks at Green Eyes.

                                 MAYUMI
                        He will.

           A beat.

           Mayumi turns to Hiro. 

           She opens her tunic.

           Guides his hand to her heart. 

           A beat.

           She moves it to her breast. 

           Kisses him. He responds.

           They begin to make love... Mayumi with tears in her eyes...

           INT. CASTLE DUNGEONS - NIGHT

           There are no windows down here and we can just make out the 
           silhouette of the Monk -- sitting, cross-legged, in a corner. 

           WE HEAR: a door opening, followed by footsteps.

           Megumi comes down the staircase. She holds a CANDLE.

           The Monk seems to be asleep. CHARCOAL SKETCHES litter the 
           floor around him.
           Megumi moves from sketch to sketch, studying them in the 
           candlelight. 

           She comes to the one lying nearest the Monk. She picks it 
           up, holding it close to her face. 

           What she sees affects her in a very bad way, the blood 
           draining from her face.

           As she turns to leave WE SEE THE MONK'S EYES.

           They are open.

           EXT. MT. FUJI - SUNRISE

           Hiro awakes to find Green Eyes watching him.

                                 GREEN EYES
                        Mayumi's gone.

           He looks about suddenly. Mayumi's horse is missing. 

           A beat.

           Hiro walks to the mountain edge and stares at the castle in 
           the distance. Green Eyes joins him.

                                 GREEN EYES
                        She's not coming back, is she?

           Hiro does not answer but Green Eyes can tell the answer is 
           'no'.

           He follows Hiro's gaze.

                                 GREEN EYES
                        You're going to the castle, aren't
                        you?

           Hiro nods, solemnly.

                                 GREEN EYES
                        The man who came after us at the
                        temple? Will he be there? 

           Another nod.

                                 GREEN EYES
                        I am going with you.
                            (off Hiro's look)
                        He is the man who killed my father. 
           A beat.

                                 HIRO
                        If you are coming with me there is
                        something you must learn.

           He goes to his horse and draws one of THE SWORDSMITH'S
           SWORDS...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           MONTAGE - GREEN EYES LEARNS TO FIGHT

           Hiro and Green Eyes face each other on the huge, flat rock. 

           Hiro teaches him how to hold the sword. He recommends he
           adopt a two-handed grip and the importance of strong but
           supple wrists.

           Green Eyes does not ask questions. He listens. He learns.

           Hiro demonstrates basic moves. Green Eyes at his side, copying
           him. 

           The moves become more advanced.

           Green Eyes duels with Hiro.

           Hiro teaches an over the head swing -- similar to swinging a 
           cat above your head.

           He stands a tree trunk in the center. Five feet high. Nine 
           inches in diameter. 

           Green Eyes practices the move on the trunk. 

           Again. 

           And again.

           The MONTAGE DRAWS TO AN END with Green Eyes swinging the 
           sword at the trunk...

           ...and slicing right through it!

           INT. WAKAMOTO'S BED CHAMBER - MORNING

           Wakamoto puts on BATTLE CLOTHES as he gives instructions to 
           The Decapitator.
                                 WAKAMOTO
                        I want men on the gates at all times. 
                        The walkways, too. And keep someone 
                        stationed in the tower.

                                 THE DECAPITATOR
                        Why are you so convinced he will 
                        come? To do so is a tactical mistake. 

           Wakamoto stares out a window at Mt Fuji.

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        He will come.

           EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

           Hiro and Green Eyes trot down the main road. There are houses 
           on both sides. 

           Some are burned. 

           Some are ransacked.

           All are deserted.

                                 GREEN EYES
                        It's a ghost town. 

           Hiro lowers his head -- saddened.

           EXT. THE FAMILY OF FOUR'S HOMESTEAD - DAY

           Green Eyes waits on his horse. 

           INT. HOMESTEAD - CONTINUOUS

           Hiro stands in the open doorway.

                                 HIRO
                        Hello?

           The place is deserted.

           EXT. CASTLE GROUNDS - DAY

           THOUSANDS OF SAMURAI are present -- the full force of 
           wakamoto's army. They are everywhere -- lining the walkways 
           at the top of the castle walls, guarding the gates, doorways, 
           etc.
           IN THE CENTER OF THE COURTYARD - WAKAMOTO 

           hones his sword-fighting against THREE 'SPARRING PARTNERS' -- 
           his own men. His enthusiasm is high and he comes very close 
           to actually hurting them -- but doesn't.

           Megumi approaches. 

                                 MEGUMI
                        I know how to handle a sword.

           She draws her sword and charges one of the sparring partners, 
           battering him with blows until... 

           ...she thrusts her sword through his heart, killing him!

           A SHOUT rings out from THE LOOKOUT TOWER:

                                 SAMURAI LOOKOUT
                        Hiroyuki!

           The SAMURAI LOOKOUT points into the distance...

           EXT. CASTLE APPROACH - CONTINUOUS

           Hiro and Green Eyes stare at the castle. 

           It is a truly daunting image -- one man and one boy against 
           hundreds.

                                 GREEN EYES
                        What do we do now?

                                 HIRO
                        We wait.

           EXT. CASTLE WALKWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Wakamoto and Megumi gaze at Hiro. The Decapitator orchestrates 
           the defense.

                                 THE DECAPITATOR
                        Prepare your arrows.

           SAMURAI draw arrows. Prepare to fire.

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        No.
                                 (MORE)
                                 WAKAMOTO (CONT'D)
                            (to The Decapitator)
                        I will not allow history to remember 
                        me as the Lord who needed a thousand 
                        arrows to end one life. 
                            (smiles)
                        One and a half. Besides...

           He turns to Megumi.

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        ...I want my queen to see Hiroyuki 
                        bleed.
                            (a beat)
                        Let them in. 

           EXT. CASTLE APPROACH - CONTINUOUS

           IN THE DISTANCE: the castle gates OPEN.

           Hiro rides forward. 

           Green Eyes follows.

           EXT. CASTLE GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS

           Wakamoto's entire Samurai army watches Hiro and Green Eyes 
           pass through the gates into the courtyard. It's a hostile 
           reception.

           They stop in front of Wakamoto, Megumi and The Decapitator, 
           the army closing in around them until they are surrounded. 

           A beat.

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        Won't you introduce us to your unusual-
                        looking friend?

                                 GREEN EYES
                        My name is Green Eyes.
                            (to The Decapitator)
                        You murdered my father.

           His use of Japanese startles the crowd.

                                 THE DECAPITATOR
                            (stuttering English)
                        I... have... murdered... many.
           Samurai whisper to each other -- trying to figure out what 
           The Decapitator just said. Wakamoto notices this -- and 
           decides to use it to his advantage.

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        The man you stand beside is no angel.
                            (to Hiro)
                        You have the blood of a lot of my 
                        men on your hands, Hiroyuki.

                                 HIRO
                        How much blood is on yours? Or should 
                        I say, whose blood?

           He pulls out the dagger. 

                                 HIRO
                            (to Megumi)
                        I vowed to return this to its rightful 
                        owner.

           He looks Wakamoto straight in the eye.

                                 HIRO
                        Today I fulfill my vow.

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        Really?

           He looks at his huge Samurai army.

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        You and whose army?

                                 MAYUMI (O.S.)
                        Mine.

           Heads look upwards. People GASP.

           MAYUMI

           stands on the roof of the castle. She is dressed from head 
           to toe in the black of a ninja.  

           She throws a GRAPPLING ROPE to a building opposite and sails 
           through the air, landing with a flip by Hiro's side.

           She crouches beside Green Eyes and pulls off her mask.

                                 GREEN EYES
                            (whispers)
                        I thought you'd left us.
                                 MAYUMI
                        Never. 

           She rises back to her feet. 

           Megumi looks at her, menacingly.

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        Someone should have taught you how
                        to count, ninja. Three does not an
                        army make.

                                 MAYUMI
                        Look again. 

           A beat.

           A SERIES OF SHOTS:

           as THE SURROUNDINGS COME TO LIFE, NINJA EMERGING FROM OUT OF
           NOWHERE AND EVERYWHERE!

           -- they spill out of a well, like a free-flowing, black
           liquid.

           -- step out of shadows.

           -- flow out of cracks in walls.

           -- crawl from under staircases.

           -- beneath bushes.

           -- drop from the branches of trees.

           -- the eaves of the castle.

           ROPES

           sail down from rooftops and over walls. 

           NINJA 

           climb quickly down them.

           Their stealth and ingenuity is not confined to outdoors 
           however.  
           INSIDE THE CASTLE:

           -- a black onyx vase suddenly unfurls, becoming three ninja!

           -- others step out of paintings on the walls! 

           -- emerge from behind curtains. 

           -- climb out of laundry baskets. 

           -- a ceiling revealed as a mass of interlocking bodies.

           It is miraculous to watch.

           BACK IN THE COURTYARD

           the spectacle continues its entrancement.

           MAYUMI

           signals to a rooftop. 

           FOUR NINJA

           appear on the roof. They are unmasked and we recognize them
           instantly -- THE TAKADA FAMILY! They throw their hands up in
           the air, releasing FIRECRACKERS AND SMOKE BOMBS INTO THE
           WIND!

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        Kill them. LET THEM EAT STEEL!

           All hell breaks loose.

           HIRO

           strides forward -- a DOZEN SAMURAI immediately blocking him
           from reaching... 

           WAKAMOTO 

           ...who drives his sword into a NINJA'S CHEST!

           MAYUMI

           shields Green Eyes, striking out with her staff. 
           MEGUMI

           zooms in on her, raising her sword, causing Mayumi to release 
           Green Eyes to block her attack. The two women glare at each 
           other and square off, staff vs sword.

           GREEN EYES

           is knocked to the ground. He stays on his hands and knees, 
           crawling through the mayhem to the fringes where he finds a 
           SMALL, WOODEN HUT... 

           WE HEAR: firecrackers... explosions... the SWOOSH of swords... 
           the WHISTLE of poison darts!

           Everywhere you look it is Samurai versus Ninja.

           Samurai weapons are SWORDS! DAGGERS! SPEARS! BOWS AND ARROWS!

           Ninja weapons are SHURIKEN! DAGGERS! LONG SWORDS! STAFFS!
           TIGER CLAWS! POISON DARTS! SPIKED BALLS ON CHAINS! Their
           prized asset however is their AGILITY!

           WE SEE: a SAMURAI picking off Ninja with arrows from a tower.
           THREE NINJA run below him and form a circle, hands joined in
           the center. A FOURTH NINJA runs up and, using their hands as
           a TRAMPOLINE, springs into the air! The Samurai Archer
           reloads. He aims. Is about to fire when... the Ninja appears
           in front of his eyes! The Ninja stabs him in the face with a
           dagger and drops back out of view!

           WE SEE: ANOTHER NINJA runs at a wall, TWO SAMURAI hot on his
           heels. The Ninja scales the wall with tiger claws and flips
           backwards, landing behind the Samurai!

           WE SEE: a NINJA falls to the ground, a sword in their chest!

           WE SEE: a SAMURAI is hit in the neck by a poison dart!

           WE SEE: a SPIKED BALL ON A CHAIN coming right at us!

                                                                 CUT TO:

           GREEN EYES 

           watches the war through a window. He is inside the SMALL,
           WOODEN HUT.
           THE DECAPITATOR

           passes right in front of his eyes, sending Ninja heads
           spinning through the air! He stops. Turns towards the hut.

           Green Eyes ducks. The Decapitator moves on.

           Green Eyes grips his sword, summoning up courage. 

           He frowns suddenly. There is nothing in this hut except A 
           DOOR IN THE GROUND. It's padlocked.

           FLASHCUT: GREEN EYES LOOKS AT THE MONK'S PAINTINGS. THE TOP 
           ONE IS OF A DOOR IN THE GROUND -- OPEN WITH STONE STAIRCASE 
           DESCENDING FROM IT.

           A KEY

           hangs on the wall. Green Eyes unlocks the door, revealing... 

           ...A STONE STAIRCASE. 

           INT. CASTLE DUNGEONS - CONTINUOUS

           Green Eyes comes down the stairs. 

           The Monk is waiting for him.

           A SKETCH on the floor draws Green Eyes' gaze. 

           He picks it up. We do not see it.

                                 GREEN EYES
                        Is this the future? 

           Off the Monk's look we...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           A SAMURAI SCREAMING - HIS BODY

           lacerated by metal filings! We are:

           IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WAR!

           TIGER CLAWS 

           rip at Samurai's faces! 
           SPEARS 

           impale Ninja!

           SMOKE BOMBS 

           explode in front of Ninja enabling them to vanish!

           MAYUMI AND MEGUMI

           are still trading blows.

                                 MEGUMI
                        Black suits you, but you look much
                        better with your mask on.

                                 MAYUMI
                        I'm still waiting for you to take
                        yours off.

           They continue trading... move inside the castle...

           HIRO 

           blazes his way past Samurai with his two swords towards
           Wakamoto.

           He kills the last man between them only for...

           THE DECAPITATOR 

           ...to step into his path.

                                 THE DECAPITATOR
                        This time you will not be so lucky.

           He strikes immediately, Hiro using both swords to block.

           They duel, brute force vs grace, the CLANG of steel against 
           steel deafening, a perfectly matched battle.

           THE DECAPITATOR 

           grabs a NEARBY NINJA by the scruff of his neck with one hand 
           and hurls him at Hiro, knocking both to the ground!

           He POWERS forwards... sword raised high in the air... 
           Hiro shoves the Ninja aside, saving his life, only for The 
           Decapitator's sword to sink into his own arm.

           The Decapitator, sensing victory, prepares to strike again.

           Just as he is about to land the fatal blow...

           FOUR NINJA 

           ...trap him in a net!

           HIRO 

           gets to his feet. Pulls the arrow out of his shoulder. 

           He looks for Wakamoto. Finds him. Their eyes meet.  

           Wakamoto steps inside the castle.

           INT. CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

           Hiro enters. He sees Mayumi and Megumi trading blows.

                                 HIRO
                        Where did he go?

           Mayumi points to a STAIRCASE. 

           Megumi takes advantage of this distraction and cuts her down
           the stomach!

                                 HIRO
                        Mayumi!

                                 MAYUMI
                        It's just a scratch.

           She launches into a spectacular counter-attack, pulverizing
           Megumi with the staff.

           Hiro disappears up the staircase.

           Megumi flees after him. Mayumi gives chase, but... 

           ...on reaching the top of the staircase, Megumi SLAMS down a
           hatch -- cutting Mayumi off!
           EXT. CASTLE GROUNDS - DAY

           The Monk and Green Eyes come out of the hut. Green Eyes scours
           the battle. Sees The Decapitator cutting through the net and
           chopping the NINJA in half.

           Green Eyes looks at the Monk. 

           He draws the Swordsmith's sword. 

           Walks through the battlefield. 

           The Decapitator sees him coming. 

           Green Eyes stops in front of him.

                                 GREEN EYES
                        The future is bright... for one of
                        us.

           The Decapitator looks past Green Eyes at the Monk.

           A beat.

           He swings his sword at Green Eyes, only...

           GREEN EYES

           ...is no longer in front of him!

           A beat.

           There's A SWOOSH.

           The Decapitator flinches. Peers down at his legs. 

           BLOOD TRICKLES FROM HIS CALVES.

           All of a sudden, his legs crumple. THEY HAVE BEEN SEVERED AT
           THE CALF!

           He collapses to the floor on two bloody stumps. 

           GREEN EYES

           steps in front of him.

                                 GREEN EYES
                        That was for my Father.
           He stares at The Decapitator with pure hatred.

                                 GREEN EYES
                        This is for me.

           He swings his sword above his head...

           ...AND DECAPITATES THE DECAPITATOR!

           INT. CASTLE - 2ND FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

           Hiro walks slowly towards the waiting Wakamoto. 

                                 HIRO
                        He was your brother.

                                 WAKAMOTO
                        Our father made a huge error in making
                        him Lord over me.

           Normally Wakamoto would be no match for Hiro and Wakamoto
           knows it. But he can see that Hiro is injured and so he
           attacks, focusing on Hiro's injured side. 

           Yet Hiro's injury has a freeing effect on Hiro. There is no
           longer any grace to his attack -- and it is replaced by pure
           anger.

           He destroys Wakamoto in a display of venom. 

           Megumi watches from the edge of the room as he forces Wakamoto
           up against a wall with a sword to his throat. 

           He reaches behind his neck with his free hand and pulls out
           the dagger. 

                                 HIRO
                        I once offered an enemy Lord an
                        honorable death. You shall not get
                        the same luxury.

           He thrusts the dagger into Wakamoto's heart, twisting it,
           giving it a little more 'juice'.

           Wakamoto dies.

           Hiro lets him keep the dagger, allowing Wakamoto's body to
           slump to the ground with it still inside.

           A beat.

           Hiro GASPS. 
           He looks down at his stomach.

           THE TIP OF A SWORD

           emerges from it. 

           Hiro looks at his new adversary and... frowns. 

           IT IS MEGUMI.

                                 HIRO
                        He killed Takamoto.

                                 MEGUMI
                        No he didn't.

           Hiro -- confused. 

           Megumi leans in close and whispers.

                                 MEGUMI
                        He supplied the dagger. It is I who
                        supplied the touch. 

           She whips the sword out of Hiro's stomach. 

           He slumps to his knees.

           She raises her sword for the final blow.

                                 MEGUMI
                        Now my Father's ghost can finally
                        rest in peace...

           She scratches her neck. 

           A POISON DART 

           sticks into her skin!

           MAYUMI

           crouches in a window opening. She holds A BLOW GUN.

           MEGUMI 

           sees her. And dies.
           MAYUMI 

           runs to Hiro. Suddenly...

           THE HATCH TO THE STAIRCASE

           ...smashes open.

           NINJA 

           pour in, forming a circle around the dead Wakamoto.

           GREEN EYES 

           follows them in. He approaches Hiro and Mayumi. Looks at
           Hiro's wound.

                                 GREEN EYES
                        This isn't how you die. 

           Hiro and Mayumi both look at him, curious. Green Eyes turns
           at the doorway, where... 

           THE MONK 

           ...watches.  

                                 MONK (V.O.)
                        It didn't take long for the rumors
                        to begin. 

           EXT. CASTLE GROUNDS - DAY

           The war is over. Mr. Takada will be Lord. His army will be a
           mixture of the survivors -- Samurai and Ninja.

                                 MONK (V.O.)
                        In the shadows of Mt. Fuji, a ronin,
                        a ninja, and a green-eyed, white-
                        skinned boy had defeated evil. 

           The CAMERA rises over the castle walls.

           HIRO, MAYUMI AND GREEN EYES

           ride away on horseback.
                                 MONK (V.O.)
                        But this was the time of Sengoku
                        Jidai. Peace was a long way off.

           EXT. MONASTERY - DAY

           Snow falls on this invincible fortress carved out of rock at
           the top of a mountain. 

                                 MONK (V.O.)
                        He had survived the past. He had
                        conquered the present. And he had
                        seen the future. 

           INSIDE ITS WALLS 

           we find Green Eyes, stripped to the waist, the SWORDSMITH'S
           SWORD in one hand and a WOODEN STAFF in the other.

                                 MONK (V.O.)
                        If they were to free Japan from its
                        darkest period in history, then
                        preparation was needed.

           HIRO AND MAYUMI

           stand in front of him. Dressed for battle.

           Suddenly, Green Eyes attacks, wielding both sword and staff
           with amazing skill and speed and within seconds he has both
           Hiro and Mayumi at his mercy, pinning Mayumi to the monastery
           wall with the staff while the sword is up against Hiro's
           throat.

           The SCREEN FREEZES on this image.

                                 MONK (V.O.)
                        And so the myth began.

                                     THE END.
