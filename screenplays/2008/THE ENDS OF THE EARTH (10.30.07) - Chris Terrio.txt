                                 VOICE OF GERALD FORD 
                        As we begin our Bicentennial, 
                        America is still one of the 
                        youngest nations in recorded 
                        history.

           INT. MARRIOTT, WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT (1976)

           SCENES around the hotel at night.  LAUNDRY WOMEN toss bunched 
           white sheets into industrial washing machines. A JANITOR mops 
           the marble floor of the lobby. A BELLBOY hits the glass of a 
           vending machine in the break room: his bag of potato chips is 
           stuck mid-fall.

                                 VOICE OF GERALD FORD
                        Long before our forefathers came to 
                        these shores, men and women had 
                        been struggling on this planet to 
                        forge a better life for themselves 
                        and their families.

           INT. MARRIOTT, WASHINGTON D.C, LAFAYETTE SUITE - CONTINUOUS

           A COCKTAIL PARTY is winding down. Piano jazz and black-tie 
           POLITICOS saying their goodbyes. The tasteful catering in the 
           room has a patriotic theme. A TELEVISION plays, inaudible, in 
           the background. It’s DAN RATHER interviewing a TALKING HEAD 
           in anticipation of a big speech.

                                 VOICE OF GERALD FORD
                        In man's long, upward march from 
                        savagery and slavery, one peak 
                        stands highest in the ranges of 
                        human history. That is the United 
                        States of America.

           A MAID (70s) enters the suite. Quietly, with the practiced 
           invisibility of hotel workers. A MAN IN BLACK TIE at the 
           door, the party’s host, says something to her that’s 
           inaudible underneath the party sounds, and points her toward 
           the bathroom. She pushes her cart there.

           At the suite’s bathroom: a POLITICAL WIFE, drunker than is 
           prudent at these things, balances herself on the door-frame. 
           She looks the MAID in the face and walks away toward her 
           husband, who is waiting with her FUR COAT.
           INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The MAID enters the bathroom. Champagne glasses on the sink. 
           Vomit fills the toilet to the lid, and is all over the floor.

           As she surveys the room, we get a better look at the MAID. 
           Severely wrinkled and missing most of her front teeth. Gray 
           hair, large drooping eyes. She’s in bad shape.

                                 VOICE OF GERALD FORD
                        I am proud of America, and I am 
                        proud to be an American. Life will 
                        be a little better here for my 
                        children than for me.

           Now, while Ford’s voice plays: The MAID uses a plunger to 
           unclog the toilet. Now she’s on her hands and knees scrubbing 
           the vomit from the floor. Using a toilet brush vigorously. 
           Tossing a broken glass in a plastic bag. Two used condoms 
           into the bag. Squirting disinfectant. Aerosol de-odorizer. 
           Washing her sponge and brushes in the bathtub. Scrubbing the 
           bathtub. 

           INT. MARRIOTT, WASHINGTON D.C, LAFAYETTE SUITE - TEN MINUTES 
           LATER

           Guests gone, the Maid is cleaning up the room.

           She removes dirty plates from on top of the television and, 
           in the foreground, we see the source of the voice we’ve been 
           hearing. It’s: *PRESIDENT GERALD FORD, giving the 1976 State 
           of the Union address to Congress, on CBS.

                                 GERALD FORD (ON T.V.)
                        We have not remade paradise on 
                        Earth. We know perfection will not 
                        be found here. But think for a 
                        minute how far we have come in 200 
                        years. It has happened here in 
                        America. It has happened to you and 
                        to m--

           The sound of the MAID’s vacuum drowns out the voice of the 
           President.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           Presentation credits.
           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           The MAID is waiting for an elevator. Trashbags from the pre-
           speech party hang off her cart.

           Washington, D.C. Winter, 1976.

           The MAID’s reflection parts in the middle of the metallic 
           doors as an elevator arrives. Inside it is a MAN in his 70s, 
           carrying a briefcase.

           Maid steps forward, realizes the elevator is occupied, and 
           steps back (that is, “I’ll get the next one.”)

           But she glances up and her eyes meet those of the Man. A 
           moment. He stares at her. He’s seeing a ghost.

           The doors start to close. He steps forward.

                                 MAN
                        Excuse me --

           The doors have closed. The silver elevator now reflects the 
           Maid’s image back to her again and she looks at herself. 
           Paralyzed. 

           She turns and hurries down the hall with her cart. Going 
           anywhere that is away from the elevator. Fast. Then, a loud 
           voice behind her.

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        WAIT. Excuse me!

           He’s coming through the FIRE-STAIRS DOOR. She turns a corner. 
           His FOOTSTEPS, urgent. He’s close behind. She takes her 
           master key from a ring on her apron. Opens the door to a 
           SUPPLY CLOSET. Goes inside.

           INT. SUPPLY CLOSET - NIGHT

           Locks the door. It’s dark in here. Stacks of white towels, 
           small shampoo bottles, soap. The Maid is catching her breath.

           RAP. She’s startled by a firm knocking on the closet door.

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        Hello? Hello. 

           She’s trying not to breathe. More knocking. 

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                             (quieter)
                        Can you open the door?
           Then the knocking stops. He’s gone away?

           No. A note, scrawled on a piece of Mariott paper, slips under 
           the door. The Maid looks down at it. 

           It says: IS YOUR NAME LYDIE?

           Now she’s shaking. She lowers herself to the ground, in the 
           darkness.

           Hold there.

                                 TRAIN CONDUCTOR (O.S.)
                        Hey! S’your name Lydie? HEY!

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TRAIN - MORNING

                                 TRAIN CONDUCTOR (O.S.)
                        IS YOUR NAME LYDIE ROBERTS?

           A TRAIN CONDUCTOR with a handlebar moustache is speaking to a 
           lump of clothing in the shape of a girl. The lump has pulled 
           her clothes over her head and is holding on to the seat. She 
           doesn’t answer.

                                 TRAIN CONDUCTOR
                        SPEAK UP! 

           Still doesn’t answer. The Train Conductor pulls her forward, 
           yanks her dress down. Looks at a tag that has been pinned to 
           her dress, identifying her: LYDIE ROBERTS. DEST: MR. ERNEST 
           MARLAND. ARCADE HTL. PONCA CITY, OKLA TERR. 

           This is LYDIE, age 5. A small girl. Beautiful, though her 
           seriousness would keep you from calling her cute. She’s dirty 
           and wears a dress that looks like she’s worn it every day for 
           a month, or six.

           She holds a FEATURELESS DOLL (home-sewn, a blank face) tight 
           to her chest.

                                 TRAIN CONDUCTOR
                        Time to get off. Let’s go!

           He pulls her firmly. She doesn’t relent.

           He grabs her by the waist forcibly to pick her up. Hard 
           enough to bruise her. She struggles and, realizing he’s 
           stronger, she BITES him.

           He recovers and SLAPS her in the face.
           She stares down at the ground, stoically. A purple hand-
           shaped mark across her cheek.

           EXT. TRAIN PLATFORM, OKLAHOMA - MORNING

           Super: Cherokee Outlet, Oklahoma Indian Territory. 1906.

           A train station, no more than a platform in the middle of the  
           plains. A couple of hastily constructed buildings and some 
           roads leading away.

           Train Conductor pushes Lydie forward. A Coach Driver, 40s, is 
           chewing tobacco.

                                 TRAIN CONDUCTOR
                             (to a Coach Driver)
                        Goddamn animal! Little bitch bit 
                        me!

           Shows his marked arm. Conductor raises a hand to Lydie. She 
           doesn’t flinch.

                                 TRAIN CONDUCTOR
                             (to Coach Driver)
                        Will you drop her in town?

           Coach Driver nods. Lydie, holding a suitcase and her DOLL.

                                 TRAIN CONDUCTOR
                        That gets infected, I’m gonna track 
                        you down and do for you, girl. I’ll 
                        do for you!

           The Coach Driver manages Lydie toward his waiting horse-drawn 
           coach, where two other PASSENGERS are waiting. 

           EXT. ROAD TO PONCA CITY - DAY

           Lydie sits in a horse-drawn coach with the other passengers, 
           who look at her. 

           She looks over the side. Plains and prairie. Cottonwood and 
           elm trees. And construction. Men building fences.  

           A hand-painted billboard of a cowboy in a rodeo, advertising: 
           MILLER BROS 101 RANCH REAL WILD WEST SHOW!

           A couple of PONCA INDIANS on horses. They are dressed in a 
           hybrid of native and European clothing: loincloths over 
           trousers, holding black London-style umbrellas over their 
           heads.  
           Now, we’re entering town. It’s the set of a John Ford 
           Western. Ponca City, Oklahoma Territory.  The only twentieth-
           century flourish is the line of telegraph poles down Main 
           Street.

           The coach pulls over at a two-story building with a widow’s 
           walk and the sign ARCADE.

           INT. ARCADE HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

           A steamer trunk is heaved onto a pile. The sweaty HOTEL 
           MANAGER, 40s, is trying to organize dozens of pieces of 
           luggage as he speaks to the Coach Driver.

                                 HOTEL MANAGER
                             (as he piles bags)
                        Well I don’t know why because I 
                        sent the tellie myself. The aunt’s 
                        upstairs but she’s bed-ridden with 
                        pneumonia or some goddamn thing, 
                        and the uncle’s away. We told them 
                        don’t send her.
                             (then, a thought)
                        Her uncle’s working out in the Red 
                        Beds, three hours’ ride. There’s a  
                        3:30 from the Cross if you’re 
                        quick. 

           Coach Driver pushes Lydie forward and hurries out. Hotel 
           Manager goes back to the luggage. 

           We linger on the stairs of the hotel. A woman in a shawl, 
           30s, is watching the scene. We will later recognize her as 
           VIRGINIA MARLAND.

           EXT. OIL FIELD - DUSK

           A coach arrives at a work-site carrying a dozen LABORERS. The 
           men are dusty and leather-skinned, would make Dorothea Lange 
           portraits look like glamor photos. 

           EXT. OIL FIELD - DUSK

           The field foreman, SPOT BENNETT, 27, is counting out the 
           number of workers needed as they come off a coach.

                                 BENNETT
                        Three, four, five ... 
                             (to a Young Hand, who is 
                              maybe 14)
                        Hold. You done rig before?
                                 YOUNG HAND
                        Two seasons in Tunk Field, sir.

           He nods and waves the Young Worker on.

                                 BENNETT
                        Six, seven ...

           Bennett looks onto the coach, and noticing the small girl 
           behind the couple of remaining workers..

           He climbs into the wagon, looks at the note and envelope 
           pinned to her dress.

           EXT. OIL FIELD - MOMENTS LATER

           The noise of an OIL DERRICK. It’s deafening. Details of the 
           machinery, plumbing the depths of the earth for buried 
           treasure.

           Lydie watches Bennett go to confer with a MAN IN A COWBOY HAT 
           who is dangling from the top of the derrick tower, blackened 
           with grease, attending to some mechanical problem.

           The conversation, although shouted, is inaudible over the 
           noise of the well and plays out in pantomime. Bennett hands 
           Cowboy Hat the envelope that was pinned to Lydie.

           Bennett points at Lydie, and Cowboy Hat takes a long look at 
           her. Then he orders Bennett toward her.

           Bennett returns to Lydie, takes her hand, leads her toward an  
           ENCAMPMENT OF TENTS.

           EXT. THE OIL FIELDS - DUSK

           The whistle that signifies the end of the work day. Men 
           descend from the wells, jumping one after another. It’s a 
           kind of ballet, dark figures descending from towers as far as 
           the eye can see.

           EXT. ENCAMPMENT - EVENING

           Cowboy Hat splashes water on his face.

                                 BENNETT (O.S.)
                        D’int say a word all day.

           Cowboy Hat dries his face with a rag.
                                 COWBOY HAT
                        She’s terrified. 
                             (taking the envelope from 
                              his pocket; to Bennett)
                        Her mother didn’t even tell her 
                        where she was going. Packed her off 
                        in Pittsburgh while she slept.

           INT. TENT - NIGHT

           The flap of the tent opens and Cowboy Hat enters, holding a 
           lantern in one hand and a single pear flower in the other. 

           Now that we get a better look at him, Cowboy Hat is 30; 
           ruggedly handsome; covered in dust.

           He looks at the cot where Lydie should be. It’s empty.

           He scans the room. An untouched dinner tray. A moth 
           fluttering around a lamp. She’s gone.

           But now he sees something move very slightly.

           It’s Lydie. Sitting on the floor, next to an apple crate. She 
           is covered to her head with a blanket, looking down and 
           almost imperceptibly rocking back and forth. Her Featureless 
           Doll’s head sticks out along with hers.

           Cowboy Hat pulls up an apple crate and sits in front of her. 
           She doesn’t look up.

                                 COWBOY HAT
                        It was a rude welcome you got and 
                        I’m sorry. I’m Ernie Marland. I’m 
                        your uncle.

           He offers her the pear flower. She still doesn’t look up. He 
           withdraws it. Cowboy Hat, hereafter ERNEST, speaks quickly, 
           unsentimentally.

                                 ERNEST
                        I don’t know how to talk to 
                        children so I’m just gonna talk how 
                        I talk.
                             (then, quietly)
                        What we’re lookin’ at’s this. Your 
                        mother loves you a great deal but 
                        she can no longer afford to take 
                        care of you. Your aunt and I can’t 
                        have children but we can afford to. 
                        So your mother’s decided to 
                        terminate her parental rights and 
                        send you to live with us.
           Lydie looks at the ground.

                                 ERNEST
                        Now, I know you and me aren’t blood 
                        kin and this looks like a bad hand. 
                        You’ll have a mind to run away and 
                        I don’t blame you. I want to run 
                        away from home myself half the 
                        time.

           Still nothing. She’s stone. 

                                 ERNEST
                        Point is, we’re very happy to have 
                        you here and we’re going to look 
                        after you like you were ours.

           He offers his hand, but she doesn’t move. Now Ernest notices 
           the dinner tray on the table she’s crouching near. There is a 
           fork and spoon, which are untouched. Next to them, a knife. 

           In the glow from the lanterns, he can see there’s BLOOD on 
           the knife that has rubbed onto a white napkin CLOTH. But the 
           meat on the plate is uncut. 

           Ernest looks at Lydie. He goes forward and pulls the blanket 
           off her.

           Lydie’s arms are red with blood. SHE HAS CUT HER ARMS in two 
           dozen places and she is bleeding.

                                 ERNEST
                        Oh my God. Oh my God oh my God.

                                                                CUT TO:

           LATER. By candlelight.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Mrs. Rhoades has brought up six of 
                        her own, she’d take good care of 
                        her --

                                 ERNEST
                             (end of discussion)
                        She’ll stay here.

           Ernest looks back at Lydie, who is asleep and bandaged. She 
           is holding her Featureless Doll, which is stained with her 
           blood.

                                 ERNEST
                        She doesn’t leave my sight til 
                        she’s healed. Thank you, Doctor.
           Doctor hesitates, opens his mouth to speak. But Ernest is 
           holding the entrance flap of the tent open. The Doctor 
           shrugs, leaves. Ernest looks at the sleeping Lydie, then 
           follows the Doctor out. 

           When they have left, Lydie opens her eyes. 

           EXT. THE OIL FIELDS - DAWN

           The sun casts the long shadows of the derricks on the fields.

           Ernest takes Lydie’s hand and walks her to the encampment 
           near the derricks. She is wearing a MAN’s SHIRT tailored with 
           scissors, long sleeves to cover her bandages.

           Ernest sits her on an apple box and puts two thick books in 
           her hands: Audobon’s Birds of America, volumes one and two. 

           EXT. OIL FIELD - MORNING

           Men in line, being served breakfast by a COOK. 

           Nearby, on her apple box, now outfitted with a makeshift sun-
           shelter around it, is Lydie. She looks at the men.

           The Cook is heaping potatoes on the Rigger’s plate.

                                 RIGGER
                             (looking past the Cook, at 
                              Lydie)
                        Girl’s the goddamn Grim Reaper. Sat 
                        starin’ at us all yesterd’y too. 
                        Don’t talk, don’t smile.

           The person behind them, who has overheard them, is ERNEST.

                                 ERNEST
                             (holding out two plates to 
                              be served)
                        Seems to me most people’s smiles 
                        are a lot of cowshit, don’t you 
                        think?

           The Cook dishes out food to Ernest.

                                 RIGGER
                        Course, Mr. Marland. Yes, sir.

           He smiles at Ernest, then decides he shouldn’t smile. Then 
           turns away.
           EXT. ENCAMPMENT - MORNING

           Ernest puts down a plate for himself and one for Lydie. He’s 
           brought her to a table to eat with him and Bennett. He looks 
           over Lydie’s shoulder: two MEN ON HORSEBACK are approaching.

           The Men on Horseback are Indians. Chief White Eagle, 60s, 
           dressed in a cowboy hat and a European-style coat, is 
           attended by WILLIE CRIES-FOR-WAR (known as Willie Cries), 25, 
           his translator.

           The Indians look at the rigs as they approach.

           Ernest and Bennett stand. The Indians dismount.

                                 ERNEST
                        Good morning. Offer you some 
                        breakfast?

           White Eagle and Willie Cries look at the potatoes and oozing 
           stew on their plates. Cries shakes his head and Ernest 
           gestures for them to sit.

                                 ERNEST
                             (gesturing at her)
                        My niece, Lydie. 

           White Eagle and Willie Cries look at her.

                                 WILLIE CRIES
                             (to Ernest)
                        Chief White Eagle regrets that he 
                        comes today to revoke his 
                        hospitality.

                                 ERNEST
                             (thrown)
                        Did you get my letter? I asked if 
                        he could just be patient -- 

           White Eagle speaks to Willie Cries in PONCA, their tribal 
           dialect, and Cries translates. 

                                 WILLIE CRIES
                        This Chief feels he’s been more 
                        than patient. He reminds Mr. 
                        Marland that you are standing on 
                        land that is sacred to the tribe. 

           Cries talks back to White Eagle, who in turn speaks fervently 
           in Ponca; Cries relays to Ernest. Lydie stares at the 
           Indians.
                                 WILLIE CRIES
                        This Chief told you that drilling 
                        here was making bad medicine. You 
                        told this Chief there would be 
                        profits for him. He must not remind 
                        Mr. Marland that there is no rock 
                        oil and there are no profits. 

                                 ERNEST
                        Well, not yet, but we’re--

           White Eagle is speaking passionately.

                                 WILLIE CRIES
                        This Chief says the reason there’s 
                        no oil is that the earth doesn’t 
                        want the rivers underground 
                        disturbed. He informs Mr. Marland 
                        that he is ending the lease now.

                                 ERNEST
                             (under his breath)
                        Oh Jesus Christ --

           He stands, then regains composure, sits.

                                 ERNEST
                        Tell him that we’ve come upon an 
                        anticline, which always means crude 
                        beneath. Almost always, 90 percent 
                        guaranteed. Now, that’s not a 
                        hunch, that’s science.
                             (to the Chief, miming a 45-
                              degree angle)
                        Rocks. Pfffwwwwww!

           That is, a child’s approximation of a spurt of oil. Bennett 
           raises his eyebrows. Chief remains unmoved.

                                 ERNEST
                             (turning to Willie Cries, 
                              desperate, quiet)
                        Willie. My friend. Every penny I 
                        have is sunk into this. We can work 
                        the rigs through the night, 24 
                        hours, I just need another month, I 
                        promise --

           Cries turns and translates this for the Chief, who says 
           something in Ponca. 

           Then, unexpectedly, the Chief leans over the table and 
           touches Lydie’s face. Lydie stares back, emotionless. 
           Cries looks at White Eagle, surprised, and responds in Ponca. 
           White Eagle speaks back, then indicates for Cries to 
           translate.

                                 WILLIE CRIES
                        This Chief says he will extend your 
                        option for two weeks. But it’s not 
                        for you he does this. It’s for your 
                        niece. 

           Ernest takes a breath, smiles at the Chief.

                                 ERNEST
                        Thank you, sir. Thank you.

           Now White Eagle stands and walks a few yards away. Willie 
           Cries nods to Ernest and Bennett, and walks after him. When 
           they’ve gone:

                                 BENNETT
                        90 percent guaranteed, huh?

                                 ERNEST
                        Wha’d you want me to tell him? That 
                        we were going after a mouse in a 
                        haystack with a harpoon?

                                                                CUT TO:

           A short distance away, White Eagle is kneeling in the soil. 
           Lowers his head to the ground. Willie Cries watches, and 
           Ernest comes alongside him.

                                 WILLIE CRIES
                             (by way of apology for the 
                              spectacle)
                        He’s asking the earth for 
                        forgiveness.
                             (a beat)
                        He’s a foolish old man. He doesn’t 
                        see yet that all the old things are 
                        already dead.

           White Eagle puts dirt on his face. 

                                 ERNEST
                        Why did he change his mind for my 
                        niece?

                                 WILLIE CRIES
                        Just some nonsense. 
           White Eagle’s actions are creating a scene among the MEN. A 
           few of the Field Workers, making their way toward their 
           stations, point and watch, some laughing.  

                                 WILLIE CRIES
                        Our tribe aren’t from this place, 
                        Mr. Marland. We were evicted from 
                        home and marched here by soldiers 
                        forty years ago.

           White Eagle on his knees, intoning to himself.

                                 WILLIE CRIES
                        This Chief says the Ponca are 
                        ghosts because we’re always 
                        searching for home, but now we’ll 
                        never find it. Not in this world. 

           Chief bows down again, hiding his face.

                                 WILLIE CRIES
                        When he looked at your niece, he 
                        said he could see she was a ghost 
                        like us. 

           Ernest looks over at Lydie.

                                 WILLIE CRIES
                        I told you. Just some nonsense.

           Cries nods to Ernest and goes to the Chief.

           A beat. Then Ernest approaches Lydie, takes her by the hand, 
           and leads her back toward her apple box in the field.

           EXT. THE OIL FIELDS - NIGHT

           A gramophone is playing a song -- “I’m Tying the Leaves So 
           They Don’t Come Down.”  A dog is barking at the phonograph.

           We move past a poker game in progress.

                                 FIELDHAND
                        You’ll raise shit, y’ain’t got shit 
                        left to bet with!

           The crew is working through the night.

           There are kerosene lamps illuminating each of the oil 
           derricks. 

           In the lower framework of the tower, a DRUNK MAN sleeps. It’s 
           so loud here, it’s a wonder he can.
           One of the Field Workers stokes a cooking fire a few meters 
           away.

           Suddenly, an unfamiliar SCREECH from the well. 

           The cooking fire FLARES up ten feet in the air. GAS. Which 
           precedes oil deposits. 

           The man sleeping in the tower is jolted awake.

           EXT. CAMP NEAR THE OIL FIELDS - NIGHT

           Ernest and Lydie are in cots near each other, sleeping under  
           the stars.

           A high-pitched whistle then piercing SCREAMS can be heard 
           from the direction of the wells, startling Ernest, then 
           Lydie, awake.

                                 ERNEST
                        Stay here. 

           He takes his RIFLE from underneath his cot and goes to 
           investigate.

           EXT. THE OIL FIELDS - NIGHT

           The screams are screams of joy.

                                 RIGGER 2
                        LAMPS! LAMPS! LAMPS!

           Two BUCKET BOYS are pouring water on the kerosene lamps which 
           are flaring up dangerously with the release of gas.

           Now the scene is lit only by moonlight. The SCREECH 
           continues, deafening. A couple of the men turn and turn and 
           turn a pipe with a giant wrench. 

           In a moment, the well is SPURTING OIL from the top.

           A sleeping giant is awake. The oil GUSHES down to the dry 
           ground in thick rivers.

           The wind picks up the spray so that a thin black mist spreads 
           over the entire camp, now awake and celebrating.

           When Ernest arrives, faces are already painted black by the 
           spray. Fire and primal howls. A pagan rite.

           Ernest puts down his rifle and closes his eyes.
           The DOG, also turning black, doesn’t know whether to bark at 
           the still-spinning gramophone or at the more colossal event 
           nearby.

           And now LYDIE, against orders, appears next to Ernest. He 
           doesn’t notice her.

           She takes his hand.

           He looks down at her. Then picks her up and lifts her to the 
           sky, getting her as soaked in oil as he is. 

           He swings her around fast, dizzy... until she SHRIEKS. It’s 
           the first sound she’s made in the film and, for the first 
           time, she is smiling.

           EXT. THE OIL FIELDS - DAY (A WEEK LATER)

           Ernest is now cleaned up, looking respectable. Cars have 
           pulled up and DISTINGUISHED OLD MEN are congratulating him. 

           Ernest looks to the side. His POV: Lydie sits with Audobon’s 
           Birds, the Plains behind her.

                                 ERNEST (V.O.)
                        My dear wife, I’m writing today 
                        with more good news. 

           INT. TENT - NIGHT

                                 ERNEST (V.O.)
                        The wildcat has held at 5,000 
                        barrels and the surveyers say it’s 
                        a sure gusher. 

           Ernest writes by candlelight. The camera moves past him and 
           the following MONTAGE happens during Ernest’s letter:

           EXT. ARCADE HOTEL - DAY

           A 1906 Ford Model N stops in front of the hotel. Out step 
           Ernest and Lydie.

                                 ERNEST (V.O.)
                        Lydie is improving every day. She 
                        turned 6 last week, making her the 
                        same age as the century.

           Waiting at the door is VIRGINIA MARLAND, 32, pale and pretty. 
           She shakes Lydie’s hand, and Lydie hands her field flowers.
                                 ERNEST (V.O.)
                        She calls me Father now, soon 
                        she’ll call you Mother. 

           INT. ARCADE HOTEL - DAY

           A GOVERNESS takes off Lydie’s dress.

           Lydie is in a bathtub, having her hair washed. The bathtub 
           water turns black with dirt and oil.

           Lydie appears at the door of the DINING ROOM of the hotel. 
           Scrubbed, dressed, hair combed and neat.

           INT. PONCA CITY HALL - DAY

           A hand slides papers across a table and we pan up to Ernest, 
           Virginia, and Lydie, standing between them.

           They are signing adoption papers.

           EXT. FIELD - DAY

           Lydie is sitting at a desk that has been set up in a field. 
           With her TUTOR, a woman in her 50s.

                                 ERNEST (O.S.)
                        One of the fieldhands calls 
                        Oklahoma the Garden of Eden, 
                        because the only history here is 
                        the memory of us who live here now.

                                 TUTOR
                        Je prends. 

                                 LYDIE
                        Je prends.

           INT. PHOTO STUDIO - DAY

           C.U. of a FLASH POLE. It ignites, flashes, and smokes. A 
           PHOTOGRAPHER pulls the flash cartridge out and installs 
           another.

                                 ERNEST (V.O.)
                        Maybe that’s true. Maybe you and I 
                        can start over here. Maybe we can 
                        be happy again.
           The reverse: Ernest, Virginia, and Lydie Marland stare at the 
           camera, posing in a family portrait. Another flash.

           INT. GRAND AVENUE MANSION - DAY

           The black-and-white portrait is now in the hand of Virginia, 
           who places it on a mantel-piece. 

                                 ERNEST (O.S.)
                        I’m taking Lydie outside.

           Virginia turns and we follow her gaze to a room full of NEW 
           FURNITURE, which is being unwrapped by MOVING MEN. Ernest is 
           carrying two TENNIS RACKETS and a ball.

                                 VIRGINIA
                        We still have all of upstairs. 

                                 ERNEST
                             (he kisses Virginia)
                        We have a tennis court now. She has 
                        to learn to play.
                             (to Lydie)
                        Come.

           EXT. GRAND AVENUE MANSION, TENNIS COURT - AFTERNOON

                                 ERNEST
                        Knees bent like before. Right, 
                        left. Right, left. 

           Ernest serves the ball, gently. Lydie misses it.

                                 ERNEST
                        That’s all right. Now, again. 

           He serves and she misses again.

                                 ERNEST
                        Get behind the ball. Don’t be 
                        scared of it. 

           Ernest serves. Again, gently.

           This time Lydie HITS the ball, and the following is a 
           continuous shot: Lydie returns the serve, as above; the 
           camera follows the ball back over the net to Ernest, who hits 
           it back to her gently; Lydie returns the serve, and again we 
           follow the ball over the net to Ernest who hits it back; and 
           when we arrive back on the other side of the net, Lydie hits 
           the ball much harder. Lydie is now 22 years old. 
           It’s 15 years later. Lydie is much better at the game, and so 
           is Ernest, who is in his mid forties. 

           If anything, Ernest is more handsome. He has that brand of 
           rugged good looks that only appear at 40.  

           They’re playing vigorously.

           Lydie hits a deep back-hand to the left corner and Ernest 
           can’t get there in time. He exclaims. She’s won. Ernest walks 
           toward her, shaking his head.

                                 ERNEST
                        Only because of my elbow.

                                 LYDIE
                        Your elbow always suddenly hurts 
                        when you lose.

           Super: 1922

           They go toward the house: a mansion with formal gardens 
           behind. And now we get our first good look at the adult 
           LYDIE. She’s carelessly beautiful. The childhood wariness in 
           her eyes is gone, or at least hidden, and she moves with 
           confidence and certainty.

           INT. GRAND AVENUE MANSION - AFTERNOON

           Virginia, also 15 years older, is supervising the last 
           activities of food preparation.

                                 VIRGINIA
                             (looking off-screen to 
                              Lydie and Ernest)
                        I sent Margaret to call you half an 
                        hour ago.

           Lydie and Ernest enter.

                                 LYDIE
                        He’s 0 for 3 now.

           Lydie comes up behind Virginia and puts her arms around her 
           neck, stealing one of the hors d’oeuvres.

                                 VIRGINIA
                        You’re soaked! Go and get cleaned 
                        up. They’re arriving.
                                 ERNEST
                        The only guests who arrive on time 
                        are bankers and bores. They can 
                        wait.

           Virginia shakes her head, then looks into the dining room, 
           where one of the servants, MARGARET, in her 60s, is laying 
           out silver.

                                 VIRGINIA
                        Oh what is she doing? She’s using 
                        the wrong set... Margaret!

           Virginia goes off to scold Margaret. Meanwhile, Ernest is 
           leaning down looking at some cannisters of seltzer water that 
           the servants are preparing for the bar.

                                 ERNEST
                        Lydie, come look at this...

           She comes to see what he’s doing and Ernest lifts up a 
           pressurized cannister and SQUIRTS it at Lydie’s face, soaking 
           her. She screams out.

           He keeps squirting until the cannister runs out of seltzer, 
           Lydie, dripping wet, goes for another cannister. Presses the 
           top and retaliates, chasing Ernest out of the room in a 
           stream of water. 

           The SERVANTS look at each other and suppress smiles.

           EXT. GRAND AVENUE MANSION - LATER THAT EVENING

           Red, white, and blue decorations around the formal gardens. 
           It’s a Fourth of July party in full swing. A BAND plays jazz.

           Ernest and Lydie, drinks in hand, are raising their glasses 
           in a toast with PEARCE, 70s.

                                 ERNEST
                        I’m afraid in Ponca City we do not 
                        recognize the state of Prohibition. 
                        We do recognize the state of 
                        Inebriation.

           Bennett approaches, overhearing.

                                 BENNETT
                             (mock-pious)
                        Decadence don’t belong in the 
                        wholesome heartland. I call it un-
                        American.
                                 ERNEST
                             (to Pearce)
                        I believe you know Spot Bennett, my 
                        right-hand man. 

           Bennett shakes Pearce’s hand.

                                 ERNEST
                             (to Bennett)
                        And since when is decadence un-
                        American? 

           Pearce, Barclay’s of London: a Noel-Coward English accent.

                                 PEARCE
                        Decadence is quintessentially 
                        American! America is the only 
                        country that went from barbarism to 
                        decadence without civilization in-
                        between! ...

           Pearce engages Bennett, and Ernest and Lydie see an 
           opportunity to sneak away. They walk arm-in-arm, through the 
           crowd.

                                 ERNEST
                        I’ll give him that the ‘barbarism’ 
                        bit was clever.

                                 LYDIE
                        Clever, but not his. He stole that 
                        from Oscar Wilde. 

                                 ERNEST
                        And how is it that my innocent 
                        flower has been exposed to Oscar 
                        Wilde?

                                 LYDIE
                             (casually, cheerfully)
                        I chewed through the restraints and 
                        made a break for the library. By 
                        the time they noticed the empty 
                        cage, I’d been through all of Wilde 
                        and half of Lawrence.

                                 ERNEST
                             (shaking his head)
                        I was warned: “Don’t send her to 
                        college. She’ll return more 
                        intelligent than you and completely 
                        ruined.”

           A man is waving at Ernest from a few feet away. 
                                 ERNEST
                             (under his breath)
                        If it isn’t the vice president of 
                        the Bank of New York. Big smiles.

                                 LYDIE
                             (cheerfully)
                        On your own.

           She lets go of his arm, smirks.

                                 ERNEST
                        Wicked girl.
                             (to an OLD MAN, as Lydie 
                              leaves and he approaches)
                        Cotty! Welcome!

           EXT. GRAND AVENUE MANSION - EVENING

           A large red firework explodes.

           EXT. PARTY, NEAR THE POOL - NIGHT

           The orchestra is now playing a riff on the Star-Spangled 
           Banner in the background.

           A couple of the YOUNG MEN are manning the fireworks cannons, 
           gin glasses in hand.

           A few are having a swimming race, fully clothed. Two others 
           do handstands on the side of the pool, and fall into the 
           water from there. The Jazz Age, Fitzgerald’s Lost Generation 
           losing themselves.

           Angle on BEN WILCOX, 26, handsome. And at the moment, more or 
           less drunk. He sees Lydie from a few feet away, gets his 
           balance, and plants himself next to her. She hasn’t yet seen 
           him.

                                 WILCOX
                             (whispers)
                        Can you talk to me?

                                 LYDIE
                             (turning)
                        Sorry?

                                 WILCOX
                             (conspiratorially)
                        I have a problem. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 WILCOX (cont'd)
                        I am drunk and my new boss is 
                        watching and I need to appear 
                        normal. So can you pretend to be 
                        riveted by my conversation?

           Lydie turns casually and sees that Ernest is watching her and 
           Wilcox. She checks in with Ernest with her eyes, then back to 
           Wilcox.

                                 LYDIE
                        But I’m not good at pretending. 
                        You’ll have to tell me something 
                        riveting about yourself if you want 
                        to rivet me.

           Now she stands in front of him and lets him talk. He’s drunk, 
           but not incoherent. After a moment ...

                                 WILCOX
                        When I was in France during the 
                        War, there were these birds whose 
                        song was exactly the same pitch as 
                        the sound of an incoming rocket. I 
                        was so terrified of those birds 
                        that I used to shoot them out of 
                        the trees. Even after we’d won the 
                        War, when there were no more 
                        rockets, I’d shoot the bastards 
                        anyway because, as far as I was 
                        concerned, guilty by association.

                                 LYDIE
                             (kind of riveted, 
                              actually)
                        Not bad.

                                 WILCOX
                        Thank you. My name is Ben, by the 
                        way. Wilcox.

                                 LYDIE
                        I’m Lydie.

                                 WILCOX
                        Your turn, I’m-Lydie. Confess 
                        something. Rivet me.

           She looks toward where Ernest is going into the house. Ernest 
           gestures with his head for Lydie to follow.

                                 LYDIE
                        But look. Your boss is going 
                        inside. I think you’re safe now. 
                             (shaking his hand)
                                 (MORE)
                                 LYDIE (cont'd)
                        Thank you for the pretend 
                        conversation.

                                 WILCOX
                        You’re pretend-welcome.

           She smiles and starts to leave.

                                 WILCOX
                        I didn’t catch your last name, I’m-
                        Lydie.

                                 LYDIE
                        I didn’t say it.

           INT. GRAND AVENUE MANSION, THE GRAND ROOM - NIGHT

           Lydie walks into the Grand Room, a ballroom of sorts, where 
           Ernest is standing off to the side. She’s intercepted by MRS. 
           MARSDEN, 40s, wife of a local grandee.

                                 MRS. MARSDEN
                        Where’s your mother got to? We’re 
                        sending a search party!

                                 LYDIE
                        She wasn’t feeling well, she’s gone 
                        to bed. I’ll tell her you were 
                        asking for her?

           Ernest has now approached Lydie, smiling his apology to Mrs. 
           Marsden as he takes Lydie away.

                                 ERNEST
                        Do you know any unspeakably 
                        beautiful women who’d be willing to 
                        dance with me?

                                 LYDIE
                        I can’t think of any, so I’ll have 
                        to do.

           Ernest holds out his hand and Lydie takes it. They go to the 
           floor and dance. 

           ANGLE on Wilcox watching. The couple is graceful and radiant.

           Wilcox walks over to PRONER, 20s, a Marland Oil employee.

                                 WILCOX
                        Who is that girl with Marland?

           Proner, drunk, puts his arm around Wilcox. 
                                 PRONER
                        That, amigo, is the sole heir to 
                        the millions. They keep her fenced 
                        in like the unicorn in the 
                        tapestry. 

           On Lydie and Ernest.

                                 PRONER (O.S.)
                        Her Majesty, Miss Lydie Marland. 
                        Princess of the Prairie.

           This news sobers Wilcox up fast. He watches Lydie and Ernest 
           dance, now trying to recall his conversation with the boss’s 
           daughter. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           The dance-floor from the stairs. Virginia Marland, a shawl 
           pulled over her party dress, watches Ernest and Lydie 
           together.

           EXT. GRAND AVENUE MANSION -- 3 A.M. 

           The party has wound down. A few stragglers help each other to 
           their cars.

           INT. ERNEST AND VIRGINIA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Lydie, still in her party clothes, enters Virginia’s bedroom. 
           Empty bottles of pills, Virginia half-asleep in bed. Margaret 
           sits next to the bed.

                                 LYDIE
                             (whispers)
                        Get some sleep, Margaret. 
                             (looking at the empty 
                              bottle)
                        All of these?

           Margaret nods and goes. 

           Virginia opens her eyes and sees that Lydie has replaced 
           Margaret. She touches Lydie’s face.

                                 VIRGINIA
                        You’re a good girl. You’re a good 
                        girl, right? You’re good. You’re 
                        good.
           EXT. OUTSIDE PONCA CITY - MORNING

           Early morning over the Plains.

           INT. GRAND AVENUE MANSION - EARLY MORNING

           Lydie comes down the stairs. She stops in the hallway, where 
           she sees Ernest sitting on the couch of his office. Goes to 
           the door.

           INT. GRAND AVENUE MANSION, ERNEST’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           A bottle of whiskey next to him and a foggy amber glass in 
           his hand.

                                 LYDIE
                        Early for that.

           Ernest looks at her, sits up a bit.

                                 ERNEST
                        Not if you haven’t slept.
                             (he holds up a milk 
                              bottle)
                        If you mix it with this, it’s a 
                        kind of breakfast drink.

                                 ERNEST
                        Sit. Napoleon spent another night 
                        on Elba. Your mother wanted to be 
                        alone.

           Lydie sits on the couch next to him, putting her arm around 
           him and looking at the papers spread around.

                                 LYDIE
                        You look like you’ve seen every sad 
                        thing twice. Is business so bad?

                                 ERNEST
                        Business has never been better. 
                        Tonkawa came in at 8,000. Almost 
                        too good, act of God or the devil.
                             (then, as much to himself 
                              as to Lydie)
                        When your mother gets into her 
                        states, we can’t hold it against 
                        her. It’s my fault, you know. She 
                        was never ill before we married.

                                 LYDIE
                        How is it your fault?
           He offers her the milk-and-whiskey concoction, she refuses 
           it. He takes a drink.

                                 ERNEST
                        There are things, Lydie. That’s the 
                        thing -- that there are always 
                        things. She was pregnant back in 
                        Pittsburgh. I went out to work the 
                        Cumberland, door to door asking  
                        toothless farmers for their mineral 
                        options. She got sick, I wasn’t 
                        there, she had a miscarriage. “With 
                        complications.”
                             (beat)
                        And the world stopped turning, 
                        round and round.

                                 LYDIE
                        What could you have done?

                                 ERNEST
                        Not a thing. Not a goddamn, blessed  
                        thing. But I should have been 
                        there. 
                             (a long moment)
                        And now it’s time to start the day.

           He gets up, kisses Lydie on the forehead, leaves.

           EXT. PRAIRIE - VARIOUS ANGLES 

           New grass. Birds. A couple of clouds in a blue sky.

           INT. GRAND AVENUE MANSION - DAY 

           Lydie enters smiling, carrying two white flowers.

           Margaret is in the hallway.

                                 LYDIE
                        Look, trout lily. That means 
                        winter’s broken.

           When she looks at Margaret’s face, her expression changes. 
           Pre-lap the sound of screaming.

           INT. ERNEST AND VIRGINIA’S BEDROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Virginia is in her bed, suffering the painful very last 
           stages of stomach cancer.
           Lydie enters to find: Ernest kneeling at Virginia’s bed. A 
           doctor, ABRAHAM SOPHIAN, attending to her. 

           Virginia sees Lydie appear at the door.

                                 VIRGINIA
                        I don’t want her in here! Get her 
                        out!

           Lydie stops at the door.

                                 VIRGINIA
                        I never wanted her! She brought it 
                        into this house!

           Ernest turns and shakes his head at Lydie (”Pay her no 
           mind”), who goes pale.

                                 ERNEST
                             (back to Virginia)
                        Shhhh. We’re here, my love. We’re 
                        here.

                                 VIRGINIA
                             (through her teeth)
                        You didn’t love me. You never loved 
                        me.

                                 SOPHIAN
                             (whispers across the bed, 
                              to Ernest)
                        [It’s] morphine, Mr. Marland.

           Ernest moves close to put his arms around her.

                                 VIRGINIA
                        Don’t you touch me! You get out! I 
                        know! 

           Sophian puts more morphine into the drip.

                                 VIRGINIA
                             (to Ernest)
                        I know you! I KNOW.

           INT. GRAND AVENUE MANSION, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Lydie collects herself outside the door to Virginia’s room.

                                 VIRGINIA (O.S.)
                             (from the other room)
                        I know! I know.
           EXT. CEMETERY - AFTERNOON

           Ernest and Lydie stand at the front of a crowd of mourners as 
           a preacher reads a Biblical verse.

           EXT. CEMETERY - LATER

           The mourners are breaking up. Lydie puts her arm around her 
           father and they walk away from the grave. 

                                 ERNEST
                        Ride with me.

           EXT. THE PLAINS - AFTERNOON

           A silver Bentley drives down a road in the middle of the 
           plains. Suddenly it turns off road, toward a swell in the 
           landscape, kicking up dust. 

           It’s an odd sight to see this bejewelled car baja-ing in the 
           dirt, as if Merchant and Ivory took a wrong turn into a 
           western.

           EXT. HILL - DUSK

           The Bentley is parked at the bottom of the hill. Ernest and 
           Lydie, their mourning clothes dirty from sitting on the 
           ground, look west toward the sun on the horizon. 

                                 ERNEST
                        She did love you. 

                                 LYDIE
                        I know.

           INT. ERNEST’S OFFICE - LATE NIGHT

           Ernest, his sleeves rolled, has stacks of papers spread in 
           front of him. 

           On his desk is a picture of VIRGINIA. He moves the picture to 
           where he can see it better, looks at it for a moment, then 
           continues to read.

           INT. MARLAND OIL OFFICE, PONCA CITY - MORNING

           The Marland Oil board having a meeting around a table in an 
           elaborately carved wooden room. The door opens fast and 
           Ernest enters.
           The Board men look up. Bennett, bewildered.

                                 BENNETT
                        We weren’t expecting you in today.

           Ernest looks exhausted. He’s still wearing the shirt from 
           last night. Hasn’t slept, but he’s all business. He drops a 
           stack of papers on the table, takes his seat at its head.

                                 ERNEST
                        When Sudik came in, up blackjack 
                        country, we didn’t make an offer. 
                        Tell me why’s that.

           BOSKIRK, an executive in his late thirties, speaks up.

                                 BOSKIRK
                        We knew Standard wanted it, sir. No 
                        chance in hell of outbidding them.

                                 ERNEST
                        That’s what we thought. That’s what 
                        they wanted us to think.

           Ernest reaches into his briefcase and produces a stack of 
           documents.

                                 ERNEST
                        Last night I had a look at the 
                        Standard lease from public records. 
                        Came across something of interest.
                             (holding up the stack)
                        The dates.

           He drops the stack on the table.

                                 ERNEST
                        According to this, Standard Oil 
                        took twenty-one days to make their 
                        deal with Old Lady Sudik. Those 
                        boys they sent sat starin’ at their 
                        shoes from breakfast to bed three 
                        weeks before they had go-ahead from 
                        New York on their numbers. This 
                        tells me something. 

           The board is quiet.

                                 ERNEST
                        This tells me those suits can’t 
                        piss in a puddle without approval 
                        from Rockefeller two thousand miles 
                        away. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ERNEST (cont'd)
                        We could’ve been in Old Lady 
                        Sudik’s kitchen with a cherry pie 
                        and an offer before they could even 
                        ask directions to her farm. 
                             (beat)
                        We kissed off 10,000 barrels a day. 
                        We were lazy.

           The board is quiet. Suddenly, Ernest stands up.

                                 ERNEST
                        Stand up. 

           The Board members look at each other.

                                 ERNEST
                        Go on, stand up. STAND. Out of your 
                        seats, up! 

           The men awkwardly stand.

                                 ERNEST
                        It starts now. Now on, we’re not 
                        gonna sit blueballed waiting for 
                        some boardroom back east to decide 
                        what bones we can pick over. We see 
                        good dirt, we move in for the kill, 
                        we do it fast.

                                                                CUT TO:

           ERNEST and BENNETT stand in a field with a map, pointing to a 
           field next to an OLD FARMER. A goat strains on a rope to 
           reach them. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           BACK WHERE WE LEFT OFF IN THE BOARD ROOM.

                                 ERNEST
                        Standard’s size is their advantage, 
                        but it’s also their liability. 

           Ernest is now walking around the room. The men, even the 
           graybeards, are getting excited.

           Pre-lap the sound of drilling.

                                                                CUT TO:

                        Takes an elephant a long time to 
                        turn around. By then, the mouse 
                        already has the peanut. 

           Pre-lap the sound of a TRAIN WHISTLE.

           A FIELD OF OIL DERRICKS as far as the eye can see -- 
           Christmas Tree wells, conical assemblies of pipes and valves. 

           TRAINYARD AGAIN: A wide shot reveals that the Painter has 
           already painted the red MARLAND OILS LOGO on a dozen other 
           tanker cars.

           The sound of flashbulbs, and we begin to hear a big-band 
           version of the song “I Guess I’ll Have To Change My Plans,” 
           which continues throughout this MONTAGE:

           EXT. OMAHA, NEBRASKA - DAY

           A ceremony in front of a sign that features the red Marland 
           triangle. 

                                 ERNEST
                        On behalf of the board and 
                        employees, I declare the 400th 
                        Marland Oils station... open!

           ON THE DAIS. Ernest and Lydie cut the ribbon with giant 
           oversized scissors. Flashes. Applause. 

           A 12-piece BAND is playing the song we’ve been hearing.

           EXT. PONCA CITY - DAY

           Ernest and Lydie cut another ribbon in front of the large 
           Marland Oil Headquarters, a stucco ten-storey building. 
           Next to them is WILLIE CRIES-FOR-WAR, now dressed in an 
           expensive suit. Flashes.

           EXT. KANSAS - DAY

           Ernest and Lydie cut another ribbon. Flashes. Applause.

                                                                CUT TO:

                                 ERNEST
                        Lemme tell you something about 
                        “experts.” “Experts” said four 
                        years ago that only a gopher’s got 
                        good reason for digging a hole in 
                        Texas. So tell Dry Hole Charlie I 
                        said damn right we’re going 
                        ahead...

           Ernest is speaking to the Press. Ten or twelve Reporters and 
           Photographers, after the event. He is arm in arm with Lydie.

           Two REPORTERS watch from within the press hordes.

                                 REPORTER 1
                             (eye on Lydie)
                        She sticks close by him.

                             (sotto)
                        Do you blame her? Every eligible 
                        woman in America wants to be her 
                        step-mother. Not to mention half 
                        the ineligible ones. 

                                 REPORTER 1

                        million?

           INT. TRAIN, MARLAND’S PRIVATE COACH - LATER

           Mahogany and leather. Gold-trim. Large M’s carved into the 
           wainscoting.

           Ernest and Lydie are still dressed in their clothes from the 
           Kansas station opening. They are finishing a bottle of wine. 
           Sitting opposite each other, feet up on the seats.

           They are laughing. It’s that time of night and stage of 
           drinking where everything is hilarious.
                                 ERNEST
                        What about Mrs. Allen? Did you meet 
                        her?

                                 LYDIE
                        The Emily Dickinson of Wichita. But 
                        she only writes Bible poetry.
                             (imitating Mrs. Allen’s  
                              thick Wichita accent)
                        All I need to know, dear, is “God” 
                        rhymes with “good” and “evil” 
                        rhymes with “devil.”

                                 ERNEST
                        I’ll go you ten-to-one she’s making 
                        bathtub gin between revival 
                        meetings.

           The laughter abates. A moment of eye contact between them.

                                 ERNEST
                        Sleep. 

           He kisses her on the cheek. Gets up and goes to his cabin. 

           ON Lydie. Her face is reflected in the window, over the dark 
           plains passing by.

           EXT. PONCA CITY MAIN STREET - DAY

           Thriving now. The money from the Ponca wells is spreading. 
           Cars everywhere. New Art Deco-inspired buildings. No longer 
           the Wild West, but a 1920s boom city.

           EXT. PONCA CITY MAIN STREET - DAY

           Lydie leaves a shop and walks down the street with packages.

                                 WILCOX (O.S.)
                        Excuse me.

           She turns.

                                 WILCOX
                        You won’t remember me. We met about 
                        year ago. More than that.

                                 LYDIE
                        The pretend-conversation.
                             (offering her hand)
                        Mr. Wilcox.
                                 WILCOX
                             (shaking her hand)
                        Miss Marland.

                                 LYDIE
                        You’ve learned my last name.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A moment later. They are walking.

                                 WILCOX
                        I can’t say it’s a hoot and a 
                        holler, exactly. I crunch numbers, 
                        write checks. Keep up the royalties 
                        on the Newkirk and Tonkawa lines, 
                        wherever those are.

                                 LYDIE
                        You haven’t been out to the Red 
                        Bed?

           Shakes his head.

                                 LYDIE
                        Then the fields are just a piece of 
                        paper to you. You should go there.

           Lydie’s 1927 Mercedes-Benz 36 has now pulled up alongside 
           them. Her Driver gets out and holds the door for her.

                                 LYDIE
                        I have to exercise the horses 
                        tomorrow, the Red Bed’s as good a 
                        way as any. Do you ride?

           EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

           From overhead. Lydie and Wilcox are riding horses westward. 

                                 LYDIE (O.S.)
                        The first thing my father made me 
                        do when I arrived was learn the 
                        names of the flowers and the birds.

           EXT. FIELDS - DAY

           They have stopped near a stream where the horses are 
           drinking. 

                                 LYDIE
                        In English and in Latin.
           Lydie and Wilcox are sitting on the ground drinking from 
           canteens. In a field of yellow flowers. She stretches out a 
           garland of flowers she’s tied together. Judging its length.

                                 LYDIE
                        Maybe a few more.
                             (he hands her more)
                        He used to march me out as a girl 
                        to test me on what I’d learned. I 
                        hated him for it, but now I’m 
                        grateful.

                                 WILCOX
                        What’s the name of that, then? That 
                        bird that’s singing.

           Birdsong nearby.

                                 LYDIE
                        I’m being tested now?

                                 WILCOX
                        Absolutely.

                                 LYDIE
                             (she’ll play along)
                        Sturnella neglecta. The western 
                        meadowlark. I don’t see her, 
                        though.
                             (scanning, then pointing)
                        There.

           She whistles to the bird.

                                 LYDIE
                        They look the same as the eastern 
                        kind, but they have a completely 
                        different song. They’re like 
                        people. You can tell where they’re 
                        from by their accent. 

           Wilcox makes a sound, trying to imitate Lydie’s whistle. He 
           can’t do it.

                                 LYDIE
                        You are from Boston, you’ll never 
                        survive out here. Lips like this. 
                        Look at me.

           She does it, he imitates; fails again. She whistles again, he 
           emits a screech that alarms the horses.

                                 LYDIE (O.S.)
                        Why here?
           EXT. A LOW RISE IN THE PLAINS - DAY

           They are riding again. Lydie’s horse (CYRUS) is not 
           necessarily happy that he is wearing the garland of yellow 
           flowers.

                                 WILCOX
                        Why what?

                                 LYDIE
                        Why choose here after the War? Why 
                        not seek your fortune in Chicago or 
                        New York?

                                 WILCOX
                        Space.

           Lydie looks at him. 

                                 WILCOX
                        I decided that if I ever made it 
                        out of Argonne Forest alive, I was 
                        coming to the wide open West. No 
                        more living in foxholes or trenches 
                        or graves. Just empty space. A 
                        place where you can breathe.

           They’ve now come to the crest of the rise in the ground and 
           are at a promontory. Spread out before them, the Ponca field.

           It’s no longer a back-woods camp of a few oil derricks but a 
           sprawling city of rigs, rails, towers, and men. Beyond the 
           field, the vast expanse of the Great Plains. 

           EXT. GRAND AVENUE MANSION -- AFTERNOON

           It’s raining. From a distance, we watch Lydie and Wilcox 
           descend from their horses. A GROOM takes the horses away.

           Lydie extends her hand to shake Wilcox’s in saying goodbye. 
           He responds by kissing her on the lips. A moment. Then:

                                 WILCOX
                        Tomorrow?

                                 LYDIE
                        Tomorrow.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. GRAND AVENUE MANSION, ERNEST’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Ernest has been watching the scene from his window.

           EXT. GRAND AVENUE MANSION - A MOMENT LATER

           Lydie hurries inside, wet. Ernest comes to the door of his 
           office.

                                 ERNEST
                        Good day?

           She looks up, surprised. Smiles.

                                 LYDIE
                        Until the rain. Cyrus hates getting 
                        wet.

           She comes to him, kisses Ernest on the cheek, heads upstairs. 

                                 LYDIE
                             (re: her soaked jacket)
                        It came on so suddenly. 

           ON Ernest, standing at the door.

           EXT. PONCA CITY - MORNING

           A sunny day. Cloudless skies.

           EXT. GRAND AVENUE MANSION - MORNING

           Wilcox is bouncing a tennis ball up and down on his racket.  
           He is wearing tennis clothes. Walking through the gardens 
           toward the house. 

           Before he arrives at the house... ERNEST intercepts him and 
           says something we can’t hear. They turn and begin to walk 
           away from the house, talking.

           INT. GRAND AVENUE MANSION - CONTINUOUS

           Lydie comes down the stairs wearing tennis clothes and 
           carrying a tennis racket. She looks at a clock.

                                 LYDIE
                        Has anyone been by?

                                 MARGARET
                        No, miss.
           INT. GRAND AVENUE MANSION - NIGHT

           Lydie is still in her tennis clothes, sitting slumped in a 
           chair.

           INT. MARLAND OIL OFFICE, PONCA CITY - DAY

           Lydie, smartly dressed, approaches ALICE, 30s, the secretary 
           at the main reception desk.

                                 LYDIE
                        Is Mr. Wilcox in today, Alice? 

                                 ALICE
                        Mr. Wilcox has been transferred to 
                        Los Angeles, the Seal Beach field. 
                        Happened yesterday.

           Lydie is at a loss. Turns. As she leaves, Alice calls to her.

                                 ALICE
                        Would you like to leave a message?

           EXT. BOARDING HOUSE, PONCA CITY - DAY

           Outside the more or less respectable boarding house where 
           Wilcox has been living, he is loading up a 1927 Ford truck 
           with boxes and suitcases.

           Lydie appears next to him. He looks at her, then continues 
           packing things.

                                 WILCOX
                             (not looking at her)
                        He said if I saw you again, I would 
                        never work in the oil business. He 
                        can ruin anyone he chooses. It’s 
                        not my fault.

           He is cold, emotionless, keeps doing what he’s doing. She 
           walks away. When she’s a few feet from him--

                                 WILCOX (O.S.)
                        Tell him I wasn’t after your money.

           She turns back. He’s looking at her.

                                 WILCOX
                        Tell him when I met you I didn’t 
                        even know who you were.
           He goes back to packing. Lydie thinks for a moment, then 
           leaves.

           INT. GRAND AVENUE MANSION, GRAND ROOM - NIGHT

           Lydie is crouching in front of the fireplace. She hears a 
           door open, doesn’t look up. Footsteps. 

           Ernest crouches next to her, also looking at the fire. After 
           a moment --

                                 ERNEST
                             (quietly)
                        In our position, we have to 
                        question people’s motivations. 
                        We can’t have these jackals biting 
                        at our heels.

                                 LYDIE
                             (not looking at him)
                        You think everyone is a jackal 
                        because you are. 

           Silence.

                                 ERNEST
                        I would have held my tongue and 
                        given him the keys to the kingdom--

           She turns and looks him in the face.

                                 ERNEST
                        If I thought you could ever fall in 
                        love with him.

           He gets up to leave the room and she turns to the fire again. 

                                 ERNEST
                             (before leaving)
                        He didn’t protest. His first 
                        thought was protecting his career, 
                        not protecting you. That’s when I 
                        knew he wasn’t worth the dirt 
                        beneath your feet.

           He leaves. Lydie keeps looking into the fire.

           EXT. GRAND AVENUE MANSION - AFTERNOON

           Ernest’s car and driver pull up in front of the house.
                                 CHAUFFEUR
                        Are we waiting for Miss Marland, 
                        sir?

                                 ERNEST
                        I don’t think she’ll be joining us   
                        tonight.

           He starts to get in the car, then looks up at the front door. 

           It is LYDIE. She is dressed impeccably, descends the stairs, 
           and gets in the car behind Ernest.

           INT. CAR - AFTERNOON

           The car pulls away. They sit on opposite sides, not speaking.

           INT. WYNN HOUSE - A FEW HOURS LATER

           The dessert course of a well-appointed dinner party. A few 
           empty bottles of wine. Spirited, ebullient, and sparring 
           conversation.

           Ernest and Lydie sit at a table with WYNN, 60s, and his wife 
           ARLENE; JESSE, 40s, and his wife LILLIAN; POTTER, 60s; and 
           SHAW, avuncular, 70s.

                                 WYNN
                        But why should the Indians work? 
                        They’ve got everything they need. 
                        If you teach them to want things, 
                        then they’ll work. 

                                 JESSE
                        We’ve introduced enough diseases to 
                        the Indians, thank you very much, 
                        we don’t need to give them 
                        capitalism as well...

           Laughter and here-he-goes-again groans.

                                 SHAW
                             (passing the dessert)
                        For which there is no known cure.

                                 POTTER
                             (he’s been drinking)
                        But surely we owe them. And not 
                        just the Indians for that matter. 
                        Those of us who have, owe. Ernest, 
                        for example... 
                             (over groans)
                                 (MORE)
                                 POTTER (cont'd)
                        No, let me finish. Ernest has a 
                        business, a very successful 
                        business, in which he has worked 
                        hard. But his wealth comes out of 
                        the earth. He didn’t make the oil. 
                        He has a claim on the land, but 
                        essentially he is taking something 
                        that -- you could argue -- like 
                        air, belongs to everybody. So, 
                        therefore, does he owe me anything?

                                 JESSE
                        Well certainly not you in 
                        particular.

           Lydie, sitting staring at her glass.

                                 ERNEST
                             (choosing words carefully)
                        What I owe everyone is to be 
                        prosperous. When business is 
                        prosperous, people work, people 
                        eat. That’s the way to lift people 
                        up, not Red October and blood in 
                        the snow ...

                                 SHAW
                        Oh, that’s just the robber barons’ 
                        old stand-by! A-rising-tide-lifts-
                        all-boats...

                                 JESSE
                        Which means damned little if your 
                        boat is leaking and surrounded by 
                        sharks.

           Laughter.

                                 POTTER
                        May I suggest that we continue this 
                        over something stronger than wine?

           Ernest and the men get up to go into the drawing room. Lydie 
           starts to follow. But the hostess intercepts her.

                                 ARLENE
                        Miss Marland? The smoking room is 
                        for the gentlemen. 

           Lydie locks eyes with Ernest as Arlene leads her, arm in arm,  
           away from the drawing room toward the parlor. Where the 
           ladies are retiring for tea and cake.
           EXT. GRAND AVENUE MANSION, FOYER - LATER THAT NIGHT

           The front door opens in the dead-silent foyer.

           Ernest and Lydie enter, she starts to go up the stairs. 
           Before she goes:

                                 ERNEST
                        I know you had a miserable time. 
                        But thank you for coming.

           She finally looks him in the eye.

                                 LYDIE
                        What I can’t figure out is how you 
                        could do what you did to me and 
                        still have me not hate you.

           She walks up to Ernest and SLAPS him on the face. Then hits 
           him again. Hard. Again and again. Finally, he takes her arms 
           to stop her from striking him. 

           The way he holds her is more than a position of restraint. 

           In black silhouette, in front of the lit stairway, he holds 
           her and they lean into each other, forehead to forehead. 

                                 ERNEST
                             (whispers)
                        When I saw him kissing you, I 
                        nearly killed him.

           They stand like that for another beat, breathing hard.

           Ernest loosens his grip and leaves.

           INT. POOL - LATE NIGHT

           Underwater. The sound of Ernest’s breathing. 

           In the indoor pool, Ernest is swimming hard, doing laps. The 
           pool is lit by moonlight and the lamps that line its 
           perimeter.

           Ernest’s swimming and breathing become more and more labored, 
           and finally he grabs hold of the side of the pool.  Pulls 
           himself out, onto the ceramic tile floor. 

           He lies on the cold tiles, thinking. 
           EXT. MARLAND GAME RESERVE - DAY

           A BOY opens a cage where a RED FOX WITH A SILVER TAIL is 
           cowering. The FOX springs out of the cage and bounds out 
           toward some undergrowth.

           EXT. MARLAND GAME RESERVE - DAY

           A pack of hounds come over a hill, followed in close pursuit 
           by a dozen RIDERS on horses in a mix of earth-tone and 
           scarlet hunting coats. Riding hats. It looks more like an 
           English estate than western Oklahoma. Among them is the 
           English M.F.H., Master of Fox Hunt.

                                 M.F.H.
                             (galloping to Ernest)
                        They lost her scent, sir. We should 
                        cover ground in cross-lines.

                                 ERNEST
                             (also on horseback)
                        I’ll circle the rise. Lydie, you go 
                        toward the pond.

           Lydie turns Cyrus and gallops away. She jumps the horse over 
           a log into a hollow of low bushes and trees, slows him down 
           to scan the bushes. Something moves.

           It is the SILVER-TAILED FOX.

           The fox looks at Lydie and Lydie looks at the fox. A long 
           moment.

           She opens her mouth to alert the others. But she hesitates.

           The fox shows no fear. She holds Lydie’s gaze, long and 
           intense. Lydie can’t move, doesn’t want to. Then the fox 
           darts into the bushes.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A MOMENT LATER.

           Lydie comes up the hill on her horse. Ernest, Bennett, and 
           the MFH at the crest.

                                 ERNEST
                        Any sign of her?

                                 LYDIE
                        No. No sign.
           EXT. MARLAND GAME RESERVE, PICNIC GROUNDS - DAY

           An elaborate lunch for the hunting party, attended by 
           servants, laid out on picnic tables. Lydie sits at one table, 
           Ernest at another.

           DAVIS, 26, is arguing with his girlfriend GEORGIANE, 22.

                                 DAVIS
                        Not at all. What I said was that 
                        there are predators in the wild 
                        anyway.

                                 GEORGIANE
                        And what I said was, For instance? 
                        What predators eat foxes? Foxes 
                        don’t even live here. I’m glad you 
                        didn’t catch her. Good for her.

           As Georgiane speaks, Lydie gets up and walks into the woods, 
           her exit barely noticed.

           Ernest, at his table, spots Lydie going into the woods.

                                 ERNEST
                        S’cuse me.

           He follows her at some distance behind.

           EXT. MARLAND GAME RESERVE, FIELD - CONTINUOUS

           His POV: Lydie stands in the tall grass, thinking. Perhaps 
           she’s hoping to see the fox again.

           Her right hand is on her hip and she’s silhouetted in the 
           setting sun over the hunting grounds. The sight of her figure 
           in riding clothes in that pink light is breathtaking.

           Ernest approaches her, through the grass. She doesn’t see or 
           hear him coming. He touches her on the shoulder, startling 
           her. She turns around.

           Then, very suddenly, Ernest grabs and kisses Lydie on the 
           lips. It’s a long and deep kiss. She puts her arms around 
           him, kisses him back.

                                 BENNETT (O.S.)
                             (from a distance)
                        Ernest?! We’re doing the toast! 
                        Where have you got to?

           The kiss is broken. They look at each other, both in a kind 
           of disbelief. Ernest goes back the way he came. 
           Lydie touches her mouth. He’s kissed her so hard her lip is 
           bleeding.

           EXT. MARLAND GAME RESERVE, ENTRANCE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Lydie rides off the game reserve and down the street.

           INT. GRAND AVENUE MANSION - EVENING

           Ernest enters. A young BUTLER -- CLAY BATES, 20s -- takes his 
           hunting coat.

                                 ERNEST
                        Is Lydie back?

                                 CLAY
                        No, sir.

           Ernest starts to walk away. He stops, turns back.

                                 ERNEST
                        Who the hell are you?

                                 CLAY
                        I’m Clay, sir. The new under-
                        butler. You hired me Tuesday.

                                 ERNEST
                        Right, good. Welcome. If my 
                        daughter comes in, let me know.

                                 CLAY
                        Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

           Ernest goes up the stairs.

           EXT. GROVE - EVENING

           Lydie sits, her arms around her knees, at the foot of one of 
           some trees. In the moonlight, she can see the Plains 
           stretching out in front of her.

           EXT. GRAND AVENUE MANSION - NIGHT

           Lydie arrives back at the house. A porter takes her horse.
           INT. LYDIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           She enters her bedroom, removes her riding boots. Takes off 
           her jacket. When she turns, she notices:

           Taped to her mirror is a piece of paper on which is written: 
           a very large ?

           Lydie takes down the paper, sits on her bed. Her finger 
           traces the curve of the question mark. Again and again, as if 
           it were someone’s body, the curve of someone’s back.

           INT. MARLAND OIL, BOARD ROOM - AFTERNOON

                                 BOSKIRK
                        Now if you look at the map, it’s 
                        plain as anything that Humble got 
                        around the 4800 by incorporating 
                        the old claims as Indian charter.

           A SECRETARY approaches Ernest quietly with a white envelope 
           with his name on it.

                                 SECRETARY
                             (whispers)
                        I was told it was urgent, sir.

           Boskirk keeps talking as Ernest opens the envelope. Inside is 
           a piece of paper.

           He unfolds it. Written on it is a very large !

                                 BOSKIRK (O.S.)
                        Ernest?

           Ernest is smiling. Boskirk hands him an annotated map but 
           Ernest doesn’t respond. He gets up and leaves the room.

           General confusion. Before the board members have even had a 
           chance to react, the Secretary pokes her head into the room.

                                 SECRETARY
                        Mr. Marland says the meeting’s 
                        adjourned.

           We begin to hear Bach on piano, the aria from the Goldberg 
           Variations...

           INT. GRAND AVENUE MANSION, PARLOR - AFTERNOON

           Lydie is playing the piano alone.
           Ernest, still wearing his clothes from the board meeting, 
           comes to the door of the room where she’s playing.

           He stands watching her. She doesn’t notice him for a long 
           time. Then she looks up, stops, mid musical phrase.

           He has taken the folded paper with the ! out of his pocket 
           and is holding it up toward her. They stare at each other.

           INT. ERNEST’S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

           He closes his door, pushes her up against it.

                                 ERNEST
                        We can’t.

                                 LYDIE
                        I know.

           Ernest kisses her and they cling to each other. It’s almost 
           brutal, the release of years of pent-up energy and longing. 

           He steps back, away from her. Shaking his head. But Lydie 
           steps toward him. Now she is the aggressor, kisses him.

           She holds his shirt collar hard and it rips. Slowly, he gives 
           in. He undoes her dress, exposing her breast. 

           In a moment, it’s a kind of sexual frenzy.

           Jump-cuts and time cuts. It feels like time repeating, 
           fracturing; slowed-down, accelerated.

           Now they’re naked. Ernest enters her. She cries out. She has 
           never done this before. Then she takes a breath and lets him 
           continue. She looks in his eyes. She is happy. 

           INT. ERNEST’S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

           Lydie is lying awake, in Ernest’s arms. She untwines herself. 
           He doesn’t wake up.

           She gathers her clothes from the floor, looks at him 
           sleeping.

           INT. HALLWAY - EARLY MORNING

           Lydie, having put on some of her clothes, closes the door 
           gently.
           She turns from the door and is startled. Margaret, with her 
           gray hair and penetrating eyes, is standing watching her. She 
           looks at Lydie, Lydie at her. 

                                 LYDIE
                             (as casual as possible)
                        Good morning, Margaret.

           Lydie goes past her, enters her own room, and closes the 
           door. 

           ON Margaret. Pre-lap the sound of applause.

           EXT. POLO FIELDS - DAY

           A well-dressed CROWD watches a ceremony preceding a polo 
           match. 

                                 WILL ROGERS
                        But ‘fore any of that, we would 
                        like to thank Mr. E.W. Marland for 
                        sponsoring today’s event. Round of 
                        applause, please.

           Applause. On a stage constructed at the end of the field: The 
           POLO PLAYERS, wearing distinguished uniforms. Ernest and 
           Lydie, dressed in fine clothes. WILL ROGERS, 50s, in his 
           trademark cowboy hat, at the microphone, speaking.

                                 WILL ROGERS
                        Course, the papers say he owns ten 
                        percent of the oil in the world, so 
                        the S.O.B. can afford it!
                             (laughter)
                        Ernie Marland removed the cushions 
                        of his couch last week and found a 
                        million dollars down there!
                             (laughter; then, 
                              scratching his head)
                        “Now, I wondered where that went!”

           More laughter.

           EXT. POLO FIELD - DAY (AN HOUR LATER)

           Close to the ground, we watch a polo ball fly across the dirt 
           and a thunderous stampede of sinew and hoof follow in 
           pursuit.
           EXT. POLO CLUB STANDS - DAY

           Ernest sits between Lydie and Bennett. They are watching the 
           match from the VIP area.

                                 BENNETT
                             (leaning in to whisper to 
                              Ernest)
                        Don’t look now. You’re being stared 
                        at.

           Ernest casually looks across the stands. His POV: a BLOND 
           WOMAN in her early 40s is staring at Ernest.

                                 BENNETT (O.S.)
                        Janice Young. Oklahoma’s most 
                        eligible widow.

                                 ERNEST
                             (out loud)
                        It’s no use. Lydie is the only girl 
                        in my life. Aren’t you dear?

           Lydie smiles. Ernest’s hand is secretly rubbing her thigh.

           EXT. RECEPTION, AFTER THE POLO MATCH - DAY

           Lydie and Ernest are holding hands, speaking with a couple of 
           the Polo Players. Lydie is radiant and laughing.

           Mrs. Marsden, whom we last saw at the Fourth of July party, 
           is watching them.

                                 MRS. MARSDEN
                        Something’s changed. Don’t you 
                        think she’s different?

                                 MRS. JAMES
                        She’s always so different from 
                        everyone else in the world that 
                        it’s hard to say when she’s 
                        different from herself.

           INT. POLO CLUB STABLES - LATER

           Lydie is pressed up against the wall of one of the horse 
           stalls.

           Ernest is inside her. His hand is over her mouth. The polite 
           conversation of the polo match crowd outside, audible.

           He climaxes.
           INT. GRAND AVENUE MANSION, ERNEST’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Margaret is making Ernest’s bed. She knocks a cuff-link off 
           his night table; it clinks on the floor; she bends to pick it 
           up.

           Reaching under the bed, she sees a white mass underneath, and 
           reaches in to retrieve it. Crumpled in a ball are white 
           sheets that have on them a prominent red stain, like a 
           Japanese flag. 

           INT. GRAND AVENUE MANSION, ERNEST’S OFFICE - DAY

                                 CLAY
                        Margaret has quit, sir. She left 
                        this morning.

           Ernest, sitting at his desk opening mail. He looks up on 
           hearing this.

                                 ERNEST
                        After twenty years, she quit 
                        without telling me? Why on earth?

                                 CLAY
                        She asked me to give you this.

           Clay hands Ernest an envelope and turns to leave. 

           Ernest opens the envelope. Inside is a black-and-white photo 
           of Margaret with Virginia Marland. Before Clay can exit--

                                 ERNEST
                        Clay.

           Clay, at the door, turns.

                                 ERNEST
                        I no longer intend to lie about the 
                        recent developments in my life, at 
                        least not in my own house. So if 
                        there is any reason you would like 
                        to be relieved of your duties, I 
                        will give you full severance pay 
                        and not raise any objections.

           A beat. 

                                 CLAY
                        I can’t think of any reason, sir.

           Ernest smiles slightly and nods. Clay bows and leaves. 
           Ernest looks at Margaret’s envelope. Then turns toward the 
           window, thinking. It’s starting to rain.

           EXT. GRAND AVENUE MANSION - AFTERNOON

           In the rain, Ernest leaves the house with a suitcase. His 
           Chauffeur takes it from him and holds open the door.

                                 ERNEST (V.O.)
                        Dear Lydie, When you read this I 
                        will be on my way to Lubbock. I’ve 
                        been asked to have a look at the 
                        Desdemona field and decided to do 
                        it now.

           INT. CAR - AFTERNOON

           Ernest stares out the window, the reflection of the Plains 
           superimposed over his face.

                                 ERNEST (V.O.)
                        I wanted to give you time to be 
                        alone. To think. To give you the 
                        chance to leave, if that’s what you 
                        want. 

           INT. GRAND AVENUE MANSION - LATER

           Lydie is let in, out of the rain, by Clay. Carrying a handful 
           of packages. 

           She sees an envelope sitting on the table near the stairway. 
           It says LYDIE.

                                 ERNEST (V.O.)
                        If you choose to go to New York or 
                        Chicago or Paris, you will be given 
                        everything you could ever want for 
                        a life there.

           She picks up the envelope, opens it.

           EXT. GRAND AVENUE MANSION, GARDENS - AFTERNOON

                                 ERNEST (V.O.)
                        I’ll be back in a month’s time. If 
                        you’ve gone when I return, I’ll 
                        love you forever as my daughter. 

           Lydie walks out to the lawn, in the rain with the letter.
                                 ERNEST (V.O.)
                        If you are here, then we must set 
                        about making the impossible 
                        possible.

           She finishes reading the letter and stands in the garden, 
           soaking wet, as the rain pours down.

           EXT. TRAIN STATION, PONCA CITY - MORNING

           No longer just a platform in the middle of the Plain, but a 
           proper station.

           Ernest descends from his private carriage and scans the 
           crowd. People kissing, parents greeting children, porters 
           fussing with luggage.

           Now, a porter with a luggage cart stacked high pulls his cart 
           away, revealing: LYDIE. Looking at him. Waiting.

           INT. CAR - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Ernest and Lydie are in the back of the car in an embrace. 
           They are holding on to each other as if for dear life.

           It’s not sexual, exactly, but it’s bizarre. The DRIVER looks 
           in the rear-view mirror at them.

           Pre-lap a loud crack.

           INT. GRAND AVENUE MANSION SQUASH COURT - DAY

           Ernest and Bennett are playing a vigorous game of squash. 
           Loud echoes of ball on racquet. A volley of a few hits. Now 
           Bennett hits the ball into the side wall. Reckless.

                                 ERNEST
                        Again? What’s wrong with you today?

           Bennett catches his breath. Then, because he can’t avoid it 
           any longer:

                                 BENNETT
                             (quietly)
                        People know now. It’s dangerous.

           On ERNEST.

                                 BENNETT
                        You’re going to destroy everything. 
                        We’ve worked too hard.
           Now, in a sudden burst of energy, Ernest throws his racket at 
           the wall. It smashes and breaks.

                                 BENNETT
                        You can’t do what you’re doing! 
                        You’re not above the rules! 

                                 ERNEST
                        You think I CHOSE this... ? 

                                 BENNETT
                        THERE ARE RULES, ERNEST! 

           Now, Ernest RUSHES Bennett and pins him against the wall.

                                 ERNEST
                        ... YOU THINK I WOKE UP AND SAID, 
                        TODAY I’M GOING TO INVITE YOUR 
                        SCORN AND STARES AND YOUR GODDAMNED 
                        PITY?!  YOU DON’T CHOOSE! YOU DO 
                        NOT CHOOSE.

           A moment. They look eye to eye. Ernest is going to punch him. 
           No. He lets go and smooths the shoulders where he grabbed 
           Bennett’s shirt.

           INT. GRAND AVENUE MANSION SQUASH COURTS - HOURS LATER

           It’s the middle of the night. Ernest is drenched in sweat and 
           hitting balls against the wall vigorously. Over and over 
           again until he’s ready to collapse. 

           He lets himself fall to the ground, catching his breath.

           Pan up to reveal that: LYDIE, in her nightgown and bathrobe, 
           has been watching him from the window that looks over the 
           squash courts.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A black screen with light poking out at the top and bottom.

                                 LYDIE (O.S.)
                        This is insane. You’re insane.

           EXT. GRAND AVENUE MANSION - DAY

           It is the POV of Lydie, who is blindfolded, being led out of 
           the house by Ernest. She reaches to remove the blindfold.
                                 ERNEST
                        Don’t you dare!
                             (helping her down)
                        Careful. Step.

           EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE GAME RESERVE - DAY

           Ernest drives his own Rolls down the road. He drives past 
           construction vehicles.

           EXT. MARLAND GAME RESERVE - DAY

           The car drives up a temporary road and comes upon a clearing. 
           Part of the hunting grounds have become a massive 
           construction site.

           EXT. MARLAND GAME RESERVE, CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

                                 ERNEST
                        Ready.

           He removes the blindfold from her eyes.

           She takes in the scene: woods. Dirt overturned and workmen 
           everywhere.

                                 LYDIE
                        The game reserve.

                                 ERNEST
                        No longer only the game reserve. 
                        The future site of the single most 
                        glorious house ever built on the 
                        American Plains.

                                 LYDIE
                        But who will live in it?

           He grins.

                                 LYDIE
                        We already have a house.

                                 ERNEST
                        We have a house where you were my 
                        daughter. This is the house where 
                        you’ll be my wife.

           He gets down on one knee in front of her and takes a ring 
           from his pocket.
                                 ERNEST
                             (very matter-of-fact)
                        Saying yes will make your life  
                        unbearable.

           She looks down at him.  

                                 LYDIE
                        Saying no will make my life 
                        unbearable. So I suppose we’re 
                        stuck.

           She extends her hand for him to put the ring on. We pull out 
           to a wide shot of them in front of the construction site.

                                 CLERK
                             (pre-lap)
                        And also at the bottom. Perfect.

           INT. PONCA CITY HALL - DAY

           Ernest signs a document.

                                 CLERK
                             (to Lydie)
                        And now you, please, Miss Marland.

           Clerk indicates two places where Lydie should sign. She does.

                                 CLERK
                             (stamping the papers)
                        We have officially annulled the 
                        adoption of Ms. Lydie Roberts 
                        Marland by Mr. Ernest Marland. 
                        These are your copies.

                                 ERNEST
                             (he takes the papers)
                        While we’re here, we’d like to sort 
                        out some other paperwork. 

                                 CLERK
                             (looking down at his 
                              files)
                        Certainly, sir.

                                 ERNEST
                        We’d like to apply for a marriage 
                        license.

           Clerk looks up, laughs. Ernest isn’t joking.
           EXT. THE PALACE - DAY

           A CROWD DRESSED FOR A WEDDING, leaving their cars, entering 
           majestic stone gates. They are seeing the grounds of the now-
           completed house on the hunting grounds for the first time. 

                                 JUDGE (O.S.)
                        And do you, Lydie Roberts, take 
                        Ernest Marland as your husband...

           As we hear the sound of the wedding vows, the guests look up 
           and around in awe. Ernest wasn’t exaggerating. It is the most 
           glorious house ever built on the Plains. It is already being 
           called the Palace on the Prairie.

           It’s a grand mansion that is somewhere between Spanish-style 
           hacienda and Roman villa. Every inch either custom-built or 
           imported from a Florentine palace or Venetian villa or some 
           grand place. 

                                 JUDGE  (O.S.)
                        ... to have and to hold, in 
                        sickness and in health ...

           ANGLE on lake with islands, and water stocked with fish and 
           birds. 

           ANGLE on the painted wooden ceiling of the Great Room. 
           Painted figures and scenes depict the history of Oklahoma in 
           long narrative lines. 24 karat gold trim, hammered leaf-thin.

           EXT. THE PALACE, LAWNS - DAY 

           And finally we settle on the Palace lawn small wedding party, 
           two dozen guests, including BENNETT and his wife. Ernest and 
           Lydie exchanging vows. 

                                 JUDGE
                        ...from this day forth, for as long 
                        as you both shall live?

                                 LYDIE
                        I do.

           EXT. THE PALACE, FORMAL GARDENS - LATER

           A small wedding reception. In formal gardens that are 
           literally modelled on those at Versailles.
           Around the reception: Lydie and Ernest are cutting a modest 
           wedding cake. Guests -- including two society women, MRS. 
           IVORY and MRS. BYRD -- watch. A Waiter gives them drinks.

                                 MRS. IVORY
                             (quietly, to Mrs. Byrd)
                        All little girls think they’re 
                        going to grow up to marry their 
                        daddies. She’s actually done it.

           POV on Lydie cutting the cake.

                                 MRS. BYRD
                        It’s not as if they’re blood 
                        relatives. I think they’re 
                        romantic, in a way.

                                 MRS. IVORY
                        I think they’re a walking Greek 
                        tragedy.

           Applause for Lydie from the crowd gathered around her and 
           Ernest. He kisses her.

           EXT. THE PALACE - DAY

           MEN unload a very large WOODEN BOX from a truck.

           EXT. THE PALACE, GARDENS - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Ernest is walking back and forth, speaking to workmen off-
           camera.

                                 ERNEST
                        Back a bit. Back, back. Good.

           EXT. THE GARDENS - DUSK 

           A couple of RACCOONS drink from one of the fountains in the 
           gardens. They look up, alarmed to hear footsteps.

           Lydie and Ernest are taking a walk in the garden.

                                 ERNEST
                        Did you know that this end of the 
                        garden was the old field in the 
                        game reserve? The clearing over the 
                        rise with the bunchgrass?
                                 LYDIE
                             (putting it together)
                        The place where you kissed me.

           Ernest smiles, nods once. As they come over a hill. 

                                 ERNEST
                        I came over the hill and out of the 
                        trees and saw you standing... right 
                        there. 

           They come out of the shrubs.

                                 ERNEST
                        Most perfect sight I have ever 
                        seen.

           Their POV coming out of the shrubs: in the pink light of the 
           sun setting behind, in the exact spot where he saw Lydie in 
           the field, now the garden -- is a MARBLE STATUE OF LYDIE with 
           her right hand on her hip, looking off into the trees. 

           It’s Ernest’s earlier POV, during the hunting party, re-
           created in white Carrara marble.

           ON Lydie. She looks at Ernest and then approaches the statue 
           like it’s alive, like it might move or bite. She touches its 
           face. Turns and looks at Ernest again.

           INT. ERNEST AND LYDIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           They are lying in bed, naked. Ernest holds her. She’s looking 
           at the ceiling. She says the following very slowly, even 
           sadly.

                                 LYDIE
                        I don’t ever want to think about 
                        how much I love you. Because if God 
                        read my mind and found out-- He’d 
                        kill you to punish me. 

           EXT. PONCA CITY - DAY

           Lydie walks down the street, beginning her shopping errands. 
           A Woman with a Child looks at Lydie and pulls her Girl 
           closer. Lydie has a “That was odd” moment, but continues 
           walking.
           INT. GENERAL STORE - DAY

                                 LYDIE
                             (to a Clerk, cheerfully)
                        Writing paper, please. Usual kind.

           The Clerk goes off to get it and Lydie glances down at the 
           newspaper rack: On top, the Ponca City News, a tabloid type 
           of paper.

           The headline: SCANDAL IN PONCA CITY. “Princess of the 
           Prairie” Marries Her Father! A photo of Lydie and Ernest 
           beneath. 

           Another: Marland’s Daughter Becomes His Bride. (*New York 
           Times, July 15, 1928.)

                                 CLERK
                        Here you go, Miss Marland.
                             (a beat)
                        Mrs. Marland.

           INT. THE PALACE, LYDIE’S DRESSING ROOM - MORNING

           Lydie is getting dressed for a semi-formal affair, looking in 
           a mirror, trying on different hats. Ernest sits trying on 
           hats to make her laugh.

                                 ERNEST
                        So what do the good ladies talk 
                        about at the Founders’ Luncheon?

                                 LYDIE
                        Themselves. What’s in the dessert. 
                        Raising money for an opera house in 
                        Tulsa that they are never going to 
                        build. 
                             (re: a feathered hat on 
                              Ernest)
                        Oh that one suits you.

           He appears behind her and puts his arms around her waist.

                                 LYDIE
                        I suppose someone has to go to 
                        these things.
                             (re: a hat)
                        How’s this one? 

                                 ERNEST
                        Kiss me.
                             (she does)
                        Again.
                                 (MORE)
                                 ERNEST (cont'd)
                             (she does)
                        Again.
                             (she does)

                                 LYDIE
                             (shaking her head)
                        This could go on for hours.

                                 ERNEST
                        That was the plan. Again.

           EXT. FOUNDERS’ LUNCHEON, OKLAHOMA CITY - DAY

           It’s a garden party of society ladies -- or as close as 
           Oklahoma City gets to society ladies in the late 20s. Well 
           dressed women, champagne, sun-dresses, hats, and gloves.

           Lydie steps up to the table at the entrance where a forty-ish 
           woman, Mrs. Blake, is the gatekeeper.

                                 LYDIE
                             (smiling)
                        Good morning. Lydie Marland.

           Mrs. Blake scans, or pretends to scan, a list in front of 
           her.

                                 MRS. BLAKE 
                        I’m afraid you’re not on the list, 
                        Mrs. Marland.

                                 LYDIE
                             (cheerfully)
                        Oh, but surely I am. I used to be 
                        on the committee.

                                 MRS. BLAKE
                        Space was very limited this year. 
                        I’m sorry, we just didn’t have the 
                        room.

           Lydie’s POV: It’s a sparsely attended garden party. Lydie 
           spots Mrs. Marsden, who makes eye contact with her for a 
           moment. Then quickly turns away.

           Lydie recovers quickly, looks back to Mrs. Blake.

                                 LYDIE
                             (pleasantly)
                        My mistake.

           She smiles. Walks away, out of the garden.
           Once she’s out of sight, her smile disappears. She takes off 
           her hat. Takes a deep breath and collects herself.

           INT. ERNEST AND LYDIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ernest and Lydie are having sex in bed. He is close to 
           climaxing and he suddenly stops, rolls off Lydie, next to 
           her. As they catch their breath.

                                 LYDIE
                        Why not?

           He hesitates. Then--

                                 ERNEST
                        Virginia got pregnant and that was 
                        the end. Not you. Never you.

           HOLD on Lydie, staring away. 

           EXT. THE PALACE, GARDENS - DAY

           Two IRISH WOLFHOUNDS make a fuss near Ernest’s ROLLS. 

           Ernest and Lydie stand in the driveway. He is packed for a 
           business trip, and his car idles. 

                                 ERNEST
                        I won’t go unless you promise 
                        you’ll be all right.

                                 LYDIE
                        I will pout and brood and be 
                        inconsolable for two weeks. But, 
                        yes, I will be all right. 

           He kisses her.

                                 LYDIE
                        Be safe.
                             (to Bennett)
                        You too, Spot! And make sure he 
                        sleeps!

           Lydie waves as the car pulls away and the wolfhounds pursue.

           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Ernest and Bennett. As they depart.
                                 BENNETT
                        The women have been damned cruel to 
                        her. Crueller than men could ever 
                        be. We don’t have the imagination 
                        for it.

                                 ERNEST
                        They’re not counting on the fact 
                        that she has, and always has had,  
                        something they never will.

                                 BENNETT
                        And what’s that?

                                 ERNEST
                        The talent to be alone.

           Lydie gets smaller and smaller as the car recedes. She 
           whistles for the wolfhounds to follow her inside.

           INT. THE PALACE - MORNING

           Clay is ironing the morning paper, the Oklahoma Gazeteer. He 
           folds the paper and looks down at an item at the bottom of 
           the front page. 

           A photo of Lydie and Ernest. The headline: FAMILY AFFAIR: New 
           Secrets From the Shame of Ponca City.

           Clay thinks. He removes the page from the newspaper.

           INT. THE PALACE, DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Red wine is poured into a glass. Lydie is finishing a 
           candlelight dinner alone in the enormous room.

           Clay waits on her.

                                 LYDIE
                        Page one and page three of the 
                        paper were missing today. Do you 
                        know anything about that?

           Clay hesitates. Then:

                                 CLAY
                        No ma’am. Delivery boy must have 
                        made a mistake.

           He is now putting food on her plate.
                                 LYDIE
                             (quietly)
                        Please have a word with the 
                        delivery boy. Tell him he doesn’t 
                        have to make mistakes any more.
                             (she looks up at him; a 
                              moment between them)
                        Tell him it’s all right.

                                 CLAY
                             (quietly)
                        I will, ma’am. I’ll tell him.

           Clay starts to leave the room.

                                 LYDIE
                        And Clay ...

           He stops, turns.

                                 LYDIE
                        Tell him I said thank you. If you 
                        see him.

           ON Clay. He bows. We begin to hear music in a MONTAGE:

           EXT. THE PALACE, GARDENS - DAY

           The music is a very late Beethoven piano sonata, one of his 
           last. It continues over the next scenes.

           Lydie is planting flowers, on her hands and knees.

           INT. THE PALACE - AFTERNOON

           Lydie, her sleeves rolled up, supervises the placement of a 
           PAINTING in the cavernous Great Room. It depicts a Ponca 
           Chief.

           EXT. THE PALACE, GARDENS - ANOTHER DAY

           Lydie finishes planting a flower, her last one. She looks at 
           her work. A WIDE SHOT reveals that she’s planted hundreds of 
           them in a line.

           INT. THE PALACE, BALLROOM - DUSK

           The piano music we’ve been hearing is Lydie’s playing, on a 
           grand piano. She’s getting used to being alone. 
                                 CLAY
                             (entering)
                        Mrs. Marland. There’s a woman at 
                        the door who wants to come in.

           Lydie barely looks up from her music.

                                 LYDIE
                        Oh, it’s too dark to see the 
                        gardens properly now. But she can 
                        have a look if she likes.

                                 CLAY
                        Mrs. Marland?

           Now Lydie looks up.

           INT. THE PALACE, HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER

           ON Lydie. She hurries through the very long corridor until 
           she arrives in the foyer.

           Where a couple of servants, bouncer-style, are ready to toss 
           out a WOMAN IN HER EARLY FIFTIES. 

           She’s dressed in her best clothes, but they are fifteen years 
           out of date; ragged at the seams; and of a completely 
           different color palate than the clothes we have seen thus 
           far. Her skin and bearing are those of an alcoholic.

                                 WOMAN
                        Hello, Lydie.

           Lydie walks up close to look at her.

           Then, the servants are astonished when Lydie takes the WOMAN 
           by the hand and leads her through the Palace like a child 
           leading an adult to see some wonder, a rainbow puddle or a 
           dead bird.

           Through the grand rooms of the Palace. The Woman regards the 
           place almost with suspicion, like the ceiling might fall in 
           on her. 

           Lydie brings the Woman to a spot on a sofa. Sits her down. 
           Reaches for a photo in a frame that has a prominent spot on  
           the table next to the sofa. Puts it in the Woman’s hand.

           ON the photo. The 5 year-old Lydie we saw earlier, with her 
           Featureless Doll. She’s in the lap of a WOMAN in her late 
           twenties. 
           The Woman looks at the photo with more brittleness than 
           nostalgia.

                                 WOMAN
                        I was pretty, wasn’t I?

           Lydie sits on the floor with her head on the lap of her 
           mother, JEAN ROBERTS.

           INT. THE PALACE, SMALL DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Lydie and Jean are eating an intimate dinner. The table is 
           the only warmly lit spot in a dark room.

           Clay puts a bowl of vegetables on the table.

                                 LYDIE
                        No one knew anything. Sarah stopped 
                        getting letters. Then, nothing.

           Jean waits until Clay is gone from the room. Watches him  
           leave. 

                                 JEAN
                        I suppose Virginia told you my 
                        drink troubles, to turn you against 
                        me.

           When Jean speaks, it’s almost always to the objects in front 
           of her. She hardly ever makes eye contact.

                                 LYDIE
                        She didn’t.
                             (beat)
                        She died.

                                 JEAN
                        I know. It made the national 
                        papers.
                             (beat)
                        Just like you.

           She leans across the small table. Now she looks Lydie in the 
           eye.

                                 JEAN
                             (almost conspiratorially; 
                              but it’s a compliment)
                        You did good. You didn’t let him 
                        go. That was the right thing. That 
                        was just the right thing.
           Jean’s hand is shaking from alcohol withdrawal. She pulls it 
           back.

                                 LYDIE
                        If you knew where to find me, I 
                        don’t understand why you didn’t 
                        come.

           Jean is suddenly very serious. Takes a moment.

                                 JEAN
                        The only thing I ever did in my 
                        life that I’m proud of was putting 
                        you on the train that night.

           Now her eyes don’t move from her plate of vegetables.

                                 JEAN
                        I was afraid if I ever came to see 
                        you-- it would all go away. 

           ON Lydie. 

           INT. THE PALACE, GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT

                                 LYDIE
                             (putting towels down on 
                              the dresser)
                        I’ve put two here and there are 
                        more in the closet. But if you need 
                        anything at all, you just come down 
                        the hall and get me.

                                 JEAN
                        Lydie?

           Jean gestures for her to come and sit on the bed next to her. 
           Which Lydie does. Jean says the following looking at the 
           floor.

                                 JEAN
                             (very quietly)
                        You make sure you protect yourself 
                        in case he ever puts you out. You 
                        put some money away. A little every 
                        time he gives you some. And you 
                        keep a suitcase packed so if you 
                        need to go, you can go. And you 
                        don’t need to ask him for nothing.

           This advice is the only thing she has to give her daughter. 
           So Lydie listens, says nothing. Touches Jean’s hand.
           Now Lydie stands and kisses her mother on the forehead like a 
           child.  Jean is looking at the floor.

                                 LYDIE
                        Ernest is back tomorrow. You’ll 
                        meet him.

           Jean nods, not looking up.

                                 LYDIE
                        You promise.

           Jean nods again. 

           Lydie leaves, quietly closing the door.

           Jean sits on the bed in the dark room. Hold there.

           EXT. THE PALACE, LYDIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Later that night, Lydie is lying awake.

           EXT. THE PALACE - MORNING

           A couple of prairie chickens are feeding on the grass 
           outside.

           INT. THE PALACE, UPSTAIRS HALL/ GUEST BEDROOM - MORNING

           Lydie walks down the hall smiling, holding a breakfast tray 
           with everything she could think to put on it. 

           She knocks, opens the door of the guest bedroom...

           JEAN IS GONE. Lydie puts the tray down and sits on the bed.

           EXT. THE PALACE, LAWNS - DUSK

           The wolfhounds sprint ahead to greet Ernest, who is getting 
           out of a car. Lydie follows. Runs into his arms.

           INT. THE PALACE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Lydie and Ernest are on a sofa in front of a fire. He strokes 
           her hair.

                                 ERNEST
                        She didn’t say goodbye?
           Lydie shakes her head. A moment.

                                 LYDIE
                        I thought she might not, so I left 
                        money under her towels. A lot. 
                        That’s what she came for. I wanted 
                        to save her the indignity of 
                        asking.
                             (pause)
                        I shouldn’t have.
                             (a beat)
                        Before, she couldn’t afford enough 
                        to drink herself to death.

           Now, we hear the sound of wood hitting wood, hard.

           EXT.  THE PLAINS - AFTERNOON

           It’s a polo mallet hitting a ball. Lydie rides Cyrus in the 
           polo fields. She’s practicing hitting balls. It’s just her.

           Pre-lap the sound of a neigh.

           INT. THE PALACE, RIDING STABLES - DAY

           Lydie combs Cyrus’ mane as Paul, a stable boy, works nearby.

                                 LYDIE
                        Woah. Calm. Calm. 
                             (to Paul)
                        He’s had a mean eye all day. 
                             (to Cyrus)
                        Why are you grumpy?
                             (as she looks at his ears)
                        I wonder if his ear problem is   
                        back.

                                 PAUL
                        Should I bring him to the vet, 
                        ma’am?

           Cyrus bristles when Paul tries to touch him.

                                 LYDIE
                        I’m not sure he’d let you. He’s 
                        been bucking like a rodeo bull. 
                        I’ll take him.
                             (stroking Cyrus; to him)
                        You need to go to the doctor? Huh? 
           EXT. PONCA CITY - DAY

           Lydie rides Cyrus through the street, alongside automobiles.

           INT. VETERINARY STABLE - DAY

           The wide-open, Guernica-like eye of a horse, seen up close.

           DR. PENDER, a veterinarian, shines a light into Cyrus’ eye, 
           while Lydie pets and comforts him.

                                 PENDER
                        In my professional opinion, our 
                        friend’s problem is... 

           He puts down the light, shakes his head.

                                 PENDER
                        That he is in a bad mood.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Lydie is mounted on Cyrus again. Pender strokes him. Lydie 
           and the vet are talking. Pender’s a kind old man, and it’s 
           nice to talk to someone.

                                 PENDER
                        I’ve always found that horses are 
                        hypochondriacs, while dogs can be 
                        half dead, they’ll still wag their 
                        tails and lick your face. Which 
                        begs the question...

                                 LYDIE
                        Why do we say “healthy as a horse” 
                        and “sick as a dog” ?

                                 PENDER
                        [Exactly.]

                                 MOTHER (O.S.)
                        He’s worse! He’s worse he’s worse.

           A MOTHER carrying a REDHEADED BOY, 2 or 3 years old, enters 
           the stable.

           Pender goes to the Redheaded Boy, feeling his forehead.

                                 PENDER
                        We’ll cool him down. Go and get 
                        water from the pump. 

           Mother goes off to get water. She’s terrified.
                                 LYDIE
                             (bewildered)
                        You treat children here?

                                 PENDER
                             (lifting the Boy)
                        I help when I can. 
                             (putting the Boy onto a 
                              table)
                        But I’m an expert in bovine joint 
                        diseases, not children. 

           He opens the Boy’s mouth, looks down his throat.

                                 LYDIE
                        Why didn’t she take him to a 
                        doctor?

                                 PENDER
                        She can’t afford it. Hardly any of 
                        them can.

                                 LYDIE
                        Any of who?

                                 PENDER
                             (feeling the boy’s throat)
                        The locals. The workers from the 
                        fields. 

                                 LYDIE
                        But the workers from the fields are 
                        our employees.

           EXT. THE PALACE, DRIVEWAY - DAY

           Dr. Pender’s old car pulls up in the driveway amidst a dozen 
           Rolls Royces, Bentleys, Duesenbergs. A semi-annual meeting of 
           the Marland Executive Board is in progress.

           Lydie gets out of Pender’s car, carrying the Redheaded Boy.

           His Mother follows behind, carrying the boy’s things.

           INT. THE PALACE, FOYER - DAY

           Clay is startled by the sight of Lydie charging ahead with 
           the Redhaded Boy in her arms.
                                 LYDIE
                             (to Clay)
                        A doctor’s been called. Let me know 
                        the second he arrives.

           Lydie starts to go up the stairs with the Redheaded Boy in 
           her arms, followed by his Mother. But on her way up, Lydie 
           sees a half open door where the Marland Oil board meeting in 
           the dining room, over lunch, is taking place.

           She stops, turns around, goes to the door. Gestures to the 
           boy’s Mother to wait a moment. Lydie goes in.

                                 LYDIE
                        DYING!

           INT. THE PALACE, DINING ROOM - DAY

           Heads turn as Lydie, covered in dirt and sweat, stands 
           holding the Redheaded Boy in her arms.

           In this room of gold-plated silverware and floral 
           arrangements and impeccable suits, her entrance is like Medea 
           in the last act wandering onto the stage of a comedy of 
           manners.

                                 LYDIE
                        I found him dying!

                                 ERNEST
                             (standing, bewildered)
                        My God, Lydie. What’s --?

                                 LYDIE
                        This is how Marland Oil treats the 
                        children of our workers! Cared for 
                        by a horse doctor because he can’t 
                        afford a real one!

           Lydie seizes a crystal glass of water from a place setting in 
           front of an EXECUTIVE BOARD MEMBER, pours some on a silk 
           napkin, places it on the child’s forehead.

                                 ERNEST
                        Lydie, you need to calm down. 

           Ernest approaches her, but she pulls away.

                                 LYDIE
                        Us living here in all this, 
                        children dying under our noses! 
                        They should guillotine us, all of 
                        us...
           Clay pokes his head into the room, nodding at Lydie. The 
           doctor has arrived. Lydie turns around and leaves. The room, 
           in a quiet state of shock.

           INT. THE PALACE, UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

           DR. GORDON, 60s, and Lydie confer at the end of the hall. She 
           shakes the doctor’s hand, and he leaves. She enters a  
           bedroom.

           INT. THE PALACE, A BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Lydie is sitting next to the Redheaded Boy, who is tucked 
           into bed. The Boy now has his eyes open, and is drinking from 
           a glass. His mother is asleep.

                                 LYDIE
                             (to Redheaded Boy)
                        The doctor says you need to get 
                        some sleep.

           Lydie looks at the Boy, who just stares back at her. Then she 
           gets an idea.

           INT. CLOSET - NIGHT

           Lydie turns on the light and looks among the suitcases and 
           boxes. She finds a box toward the back, pulls it out.

           INT. THE PALACE, A BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Lydie opens the box. Dust rises as she reaches in and pulls 
           out her FEATURELESS DOLL, which we haven’t seen since the 
           early train and oil field scenes. We may notice that the DOLL 
           has very faint pink stains -- what remains of the blood of 
           Lydie’s cuts to her arms all those years ago. 

           Lydie dusts the doll off, kneels next to the bed where the 
           Redheaded Boy is lying.

                                 LYDIE
                        When I was five, this was my best 
                        friend. He has magic powers to make 
                        you sleep. And you’re going to 
                        borrow him.

           She puts the doll in Redheaded Boy’s hands.
                                 LYDIE
                        What I love best is that his face 
                        is empty. So he can be anybody you 
                        want.

           She is quiet for a moment. Then she gets in bed next to 
           Redheaded Boy. She strokes his hair. Begins to hum him to 
           sleep.

           INT. THE PALACE, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Ernest is watching Lydie lying next to the Redheaded Boy. She 
           would have made a good mother.

           INT. THE PALACE, ERNEST’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Ernest is already in bed, lying awake, when Lydie gets into 
           bed beside him. 

           They are quiet for a beat.

           Ernest turns and puts his arm around Lydie. She doesn’t 
           flinch. She’s staring at the wall.

                                 LYDIE
                        Did you recognize that boy?

           A long pause. Ernest shakes his head.

                                 LYDIE
                        He’s me.

           INT. MARLAND OIL OFFICE, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

                                 DERRAH
                        With all due respect, this is   
                        beyond absurd. No company does 
                        this. U.S. Steel couldn’t afford 
                        medical care for every single one 
                        of its employees and their 
                        families. It would cost ridiculous 
                        amounts of money.

                                 LYDIE
                        We make ridiculous amounts of 
                        money.

           Meet TOM DERRAH, 40s, the Chief Financial Officer of Marland 
           Oil.
                                 DERRAH
                        We do what employers are supposed 
                        to do. We pay our employees. We’re 
                        not their parents, we can’t see to 
                        their every need and tuck them into 
                        bed at night. Look, Ernest ...

                                 LYDIE
                             (suddenly very severe)
                        You may address me, Mr. Derrah. As 
                        his heir, I am a voting member of 
                        the Board and your superior at this 
                        company, thank you. 

           Derrah, shaken by her ferocity. He (and we) didn’t know she 
           could talk like this -- a Hapsburg queen putting a 
           disrespectful courtier in his place. He takes a deep breath, 
           addresses Lydie.

                                 DERRAH
                        Look, Mrs. Marland. Lydie. We can’t 
                        just think of what we personally 
                        might like to do. We have to think 
                        of the good of the company.

                                 LYDIE
                        We are the company. The company’s 
                        name is our name. We are  
                        responsible. We can’t buy people 
                        and use them and then drop them 
                        when they become something other 
                        than names on paychecks to be 
                        signed.

                                 DERRAH
                             (conciliatory)
                        Why don’t we make a point of 
                        looking into this at the board 
                        meeting in the spring...?

                                 LYDIE
                             (to Ernest)
                        Now. They need this now. The only 
                        thing that counts is now.

           An uncomfortable moment. Ernest, who has been silently taking 
           all this in, turns calmly to Derrah.

                                 ERNEST
                        It seems to me, Tom, that the most 
                        efficient way to do this, is to do 
                        it.
           INT. PONCA CITY CLINIC - DAY

           Lydie comes around a corner, where a CROWD of a hundred 
           people -- Marland Oil employees -- wait in line.

                                 NURSE
                             (addressing the crowds)
                        I promise that everyone will be 
                        seen. If you’ll please just be 
                        patient and form the line over to 
                        this side. This side please, thank 
                        you.

           Lydie takes in the scene. Then a voice takes her out of her 
           reverie.

                                 WOMAN WITH CHILD (O.S.)
                        Are you in line, ma’am?

           Lydie gets out of the way. Smiles at the Woman.

                                 LYDIE
                        No. Please, go ahead.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Headline of Newspaper: NEW YORK SUN. Oklahoma Oil Company to 
           Guarantee Employee Health Care. Workers Will Receive Free 
           Doctor, Dental Visits; Medicine. Subhead: A Precedent?

           This is being read in a room at ...

           INT. STANDARD OIL COMPANY, PARK AVENUE, NY - MORNING

           The 1928 New York skyline is visible out the window. 

           A Young Man with a wry smile. 

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        Free cough syrup for babies today, 
                        storming the Bastille tomorrow. Has 
                        Mr. Rockefeller seen this?

           Young Man hands the newspaper to someone sitting across a 
           desk, and we follow the paper across. Sitting at the desk, 
           now older and wearing a distinguished suit, is BEN WILCOX.

           Wilcox looks at the headline and shakes his head at the 
           question. Thinking.
           EXT. OUTSIDE THE CLINIC - DAY

           Lydie joins Ernest, who is waiting for her outside. People 
           continue to gather inside the clinic.

           Ernest and Lydie walk away, arm in arm.

                                 ERNEST
                        It’s a success.

           She nods.

                                 LYDIE
                        It’s not enough. It’s not nearly 
                        enough.

           EXT. MARLAND OIL REFINERY - DAY

           A man hands out envelopes with employee wages.

           As various workers open their envelopes, there is a buzz. 
           Confusion. Men comparing the contents of their envelopes with 
           those of their neighbors.

           ANGLE on a Shift Boss, reading the note enclosed with his 
           salary, to the Refinery OFFICE WORKER next to him.

                                 SHIFT BOSS
                             (reading)
                        Upon careful consideration, Mrs. 
                        Marland and I have decided that it 
                        is necessary to implement not only 
                        a living wage, but a saving wage 
                        for Marland Oil employees. We have 
                        therefore ordered an immediate and  
                        universal wage increase of twenty 
                        percent. Best wishes. E.W. Marland.

           Shift Boss puts the note down.

                                 OFFICE WORKER
                        Say again?

           EXT. GRAND STREET, PONCA CITY - DAY 

           Lydie walks along the street on her way to a store. As she 
           passes a Woman with Two Children.

                                 WOMAN
                        Morning, Mrs. Marland.

           Lydie smiles, nods. Another, older WOMAN, with shopping bags.
                                 OLDER WOMAN
                        Lovely breeze today, Mrs. Marland.

                                 LYDIE
                        Lovely.

           She walks further on. A couple of MEN tip their hats to her.

           INT. BENNETT’S HOUSE - EVENING

           A STRING QUARTET plays Vivaldi. Waiters serve hors d’oeuvres. 

           Bennett, the host, pours champagne for Lydie. Fifteen or so 
           Guests, and Bennett’s wife JOYCE, circulate. 

                                 BENNETT
                             (quietly)
                        That man talking to Claudia is 
                        Reverend Engell. Pastor of First 
                        Methodist.

           Bennett indicates JAMES ENGELL, a balding man in his fifties 
           wearing clerical clothes.

                                 BENNETT
                        Try and talk to him tonight. Get 
                        him on your side. Rumor has it 
                        you’ve rubbed him wrong.

           He gives her the glass of wine.

                                 BENNETT
                        As you know, the power dynamic in 
                        any town is a-- delicate balance. 
                        He feels threatened by the way you 
                        and Ernest have been talking to 
                        some of the local honchos.

           ON Lydie. She doesn’t respond.

                                 BENNETT
                        Just promise you’ll try and win him 
                        over. All right?
                             (lifting his own glass to 
                              toast with her)
                        Make friends.

           INT. BENNETT’S HOUSE, DINING ROOM - EVENING

           The fifteen guests sit at a long dinner table. The dessert 
           course.
                                 ERNEST
                        Well, the clinics are only the 
                        beginning of what we intend to do. 
                        The next thing is going to be a 
                        school for the field workers. So 
                        they don’t always have to be field 
                        workers. 

           On Engell. Shaw, pouring Ernest more wine.

                                 ERNEST
                        Lydie and I have decided that Mr. 
                        Horatio Alger’s stories are fairy 
                        tales unless ambition is backed by 
                        education.

           Shaw, his tipsy avuncular self, claps Engell on the shoulder.

                                 SHAW
                        Seems to me they’re filling the gap 
                        where the Church should be, 
                        Reverend! They’re upstaging you, my 
                        man!

           Engell responds quietly.

                                 ENGELL
                        The Lord tells us that material 
                        success will not come to all of us 
                        in this lifetime. I think we risk  
                        pride to think that we can 
                        eradicate suffering by worldly 
                        means alone.

           ON Lydie.

                                 ERNEST
                             (with good humor)
                        Well we can’t eliminate it, 
                        Reverend, but we can certainly do 
                        our part to alleviate it.

                                 ENGELL
                             (smiling, but emphatic)
                        A paternalistic stance on the part 
                        of employers discourages 
                        independence, Mr. Marland. It 
                        creates a society of deadbeats with 
                        outstretched palms.

           Then, a voice from the end of the table.
                                 LYDIE
                        What is your first memory, Reverend 
                        Engell?

                                 ENGELL
                        I can’t say I recall, Mrs. Marland.

                                 LYDIE
                        Mine is rooting through the trash 
                        for food. 

           Uncomfortable silence at the table. Even Ernest has never 
           heard this. Mrs. Bennett, bravely, offers--

                                 MRS. BENNETT
                        Perhaps the ladies wish to retire 
                        for cake?

           Lydie doesn’t flinch.

                                 LYDIE
                             (to Engell)
                        My mother wasn’t a deadbeat. She 
                        worked in a factory that made 
                        leather undersoles for shoes.

           She takes off her high-heeled shoe and puts it on the table, 
           indicating the undersole.

                                 LYDIE
                        See, God didn’t make this. A person 
                        had to make this. 

           Bennett averts his eyes, studies the tablecloth. At a loss.

                                 LYDIE
                        My mother made some mistakes. But  
                        when you’re poor you have to do 
                        everything right. So she had no 
                        second chance. She sent me away and 
                        fell down and never got up again.

           She takes a red-wine stained napkin from the Guest next to 
           her.

                                 LYDIE
                        But, you see, this is the east 
                        coast, where my mother lived. 
                             (that is, the napkin)
                        Layer upon layer of history and 
                        misery and the old way of doing 
                        things.
           Now she takes her own napkin from her lap. It’s unstained. 
           Perfect white.

                                 LYDIE
                        This is Oklahoma. 
                             (a beat)
                        Things can be different here. We 
                        can give people a chance in hell of 
                        succeeding by providing them with 
                        dignity and security so that if 
                        they fall they can stand up again. 
                        Here. In this world.

           She puts the napkins down on the table.

                                 LYDIE
                        That’s what we intend to do.
                             (then, smiling to Mrs. 
                              Bennett)
                        Can you pass the sugar, please?

           INT. BENNETT’S HOUSE, FOYER - LATER

           Two Guests in evening clothes are watching Lydie and Ernest 
           say goodbye to the Bennetts in the hall.

                                 GUEST
                        She’s not what I expected. 

                                 GUEST 2
                        What were you expecting?

           He shrugs, shakes his head.

                                 GUEST
                        Any woman with a hundred million 
                        dollars and a dream is dangerous. 
                        But an educated, attractive one -- 
                        that is very nearly untenable.

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           Lydie leans in and puts her head on Ernest’s shoulder. He 
           kisses her on the cheek and leans his head into hers.

                                 ERNEST
                        You know, you ask an awful lot of 
                        the world.

                                 LYDIE
                        Who knows? Maybe I’ll get it.
           EXT. MARLAND INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL - DAY

           Lydie is on a construction site, sweating in the heat, 
           speaking to an architect.

           He holds plans in his hands, and Lydie gestures and points at 
           a wall to the school, apparently changing something about the 
           design.

                                 LYDIE (O.S.)
                        Two names?

           INT. CONSTRUCTION OFFICE, MARLAND INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL - DAY

           A hut on the grounds of the future school, construction going 
           on outside. The school ADMINISTRATOR, Johnson, has given 
           Lydie a list.

                                 LYDIE
                        Two people have signed up for the 
                        school when we have the capacity 
                        for four hundred?

                                 JOHNSON
                        The list was circulated to every 
                        employee, Mrs. Marland. I saw to 
                        it.

                                 LYDIE
                        Then why? 

           INT. CAR - DAY

           Lydie looks out the window. Her car is heading into the Ponca 
           Field Refinery.

                                 LYDIE
                             (to Chauffeur)
                        Stop here please. I’ll walk from 
                        here.

           EXT. OIL FIELD - DAY

           LOUD NOISE of the oil wells as Lydie walks into the field. 
           The Ponca Field is not recognizable as the once-desolate 
           stretch of frontier. It’s now a full-fledged industrial site, 
           the noisiest five miles in America.

           From a distance, we watch Lydie say something we can’t hear 
           to the Field Foreman. He nods vigorously.
                                 LYDIE (O.S.)
                             (pre-lap, loud)
                        My name is Lydie Marland and I’ll 
                        be very brief.

                                                                CUT TO:

           ANOTHER, QUIETER PART OF THE FIELD. 

                                 LYDIE
                        First of all, I know you’re making 
                        the company proud with the hard 
                        work you’re doing in these fields. 
                        Without you, there is no company, 
                        and Mr. Marland and I will never 
                        forget that. 

           Lydie is standing on a wooden table to address the FIELD 
           WORKERS in this section -- about two hundred of them -- who 
           have been gathered together in a large open space. There’s a 
           bit of Joan of Arc about the whole thing.

                                 LYDIE
                        But my hope is that you won’t 
                        always be working here. My hope is 
                        that you’ll move up the ladder. At 
                        our company, or at another.

           ON the Workers.

                                 LYDIE
                        But the only way to do that is 
                        through education. Because a man 
                        with a school diploma, who’s half 
                        as smart as you are, is right at 
                        this moment getting hired somewhere 
                        to do a job that pays twice as 
                        much. That doesn’t seem fair to me.

           A few of the MEN look at each other.

                                 LYDIE
                        I know you’ve heard of the new 
                        school, and I’m leaving a sign-up 
                        list here. The classes will be held 
                        after working hours and I hope... I 
                        hope you’ll give it some thought. 
                        Thank you for taking the time, and 
                        good day.

                                 FIELD WORKER 1
                        Excuse me, ma’am? Can I say 
                        somethin’?
           Lydie nods.

                                 FIELD WORKER 1
                        We sure appreciate what you’re 
                        doin’, ma’am, treating us like 
                        people, you of all people. Thing 
                        about all this is, we’re still 
                        working after working hours. Near 
                        every one of us does overtime, 
                        works second, third jobs. Even with 
                        the new wages, we got to.

           General agreement from the men. ON Lydie.

                                 FIELD WORKER 1
                        If you could wave a magic wand, 
                        ma’am, and take away the payments 
                        on my house, I’d be more’n happy to 
                        work normal hours and go to school. 
                        But I’m afraid the way things 
                        stand, it just ain’t rigged in our 
                        favor.

           INT. MARLAND OIL BOARD ROOM - DAY 

           Sitting around the table. The Board, including LYDIE.

                                 BENNETT
                        We can subsidize the cost of land 
                        on the north side. The company has 
                        a stake in some of those lots, we 
                        can take a voluntary deferral.

                                 ERNEST
                        Good. What else?

                                 LYDIE
                        I don’t understand why we don’t 
                        just provide housing.

                                 BOSKIRK
                        You give people houses, you’re 
                        telling them where to live.

                                 ERNEST
                        People have their dignity. You 
                        can’t feel proud of a home you’ve 
                        acquired through someone else’s 
                        charity.

           A moment. Ernest stands, thinking. Then--
                                 ERNEST
                        You know, the real reason the men 
                        can’t get a leg up is that they’re 
                        borrowing for their houses, then  
                        paying extortionate interest rates 
                        at the banks. There’s the root of 
                        the problem.

                                 LYDIE
                        So why don’t we just buy a bank?

           All look at Lydie, and Lydie looks at Ernest, who raises his 
           eyebrows.

           INT. SECURITY STATE BANK OF PONCA CITY - DAY

           EMPLOYEES are assembled in the small bank lobby.

                                 ERNEST
                        Good morning, gentlemen. I want to 
                        let you know that under my 
                        ownership, bank business will carry 
                        on exactly as it was before, with 
                        just one change.
                             (to the bank manager)
                        Lance, how much are interest rates 
                        for home loans at the moment?

                                 LANCE
                        Twelve percent, sir.

                                 ERNEST
                        All right, then. Now they’ll be six 
                        percent. 
                             (tips his hat)
                        Good day, gentlemen.

           General confusion among the bankers. He heads for the door.

                                 ERNEST
                             (an afterthought)
                        Come to think of it, make it five. 
                        It just sounds better, doesn’t it?

           EXT. THE PALACE, LAKE  - DAY

           People stream into the open wrought-iron gates of the Palace. 
           A sign that reads: MARLAND ESTATE OPEN HOUSE EVERY SUNDAY -- 
           BRING YOUR FAMILY!

           Dozens of people are having picnics, throwing balls, swimming 
           on the grounds of the Palace.
           LYDIE, in her swimsuit, is having a water fight with some 
           local kids. 

           ERNEST watches her from the side of the lake. 

           ON THE HILL NEAR THE MAIN HOUSE: a CAR pulls up on the road 
           with a screech, parks at an angle on the grass. Out steps a 
           MAN IN A SUIT -- JAMES BARKER, bank president, 50s. He may 
           have been drinking.

           Bennett, nearby, approaches. Barker looks straight past 
           Bennett and spots Ernest -- who is far away at the lake, 
           unaware of the scene. Barker is headed toward the lake, but 
           Bennett intercepts and blocks him. 

                                 BARKER
                             (to Bennett)
                        Get outta the goddamn way. EY. EY!

           Bennett holds him back. BARKER’S WIFE, by now, has gotten out 
           of the car and hurries after her husband. Their KIDS (boy and 
           girl, ages 5 and 9) watch from inside the car.

                                 BARKER
                             (to Bennett)
                        You give Ernie Marland a message. 
                        You tell him... You tell him the 
                        president of Ponca National wants 
                        to know, how can other banks 
                        compete with somebody who doesn’t 
                        care if he takes a loss?! You tell 
                        me that. You know, I’ve got kids, 
                        Bennett...

           Barker’s Wife now takes him by the arm and directs him back 
           toward the car. By now, various picnic-goers are watching the 
           scene.

                                 BARKER
                        Goddamn circus. 
                             (then, to Bennett, as he’s 
                              led away)
                        You tell him that! You tell him.

           Bennett watches them go, then turns back toward the lake, 
           thinking. 

           EXT. MARLAND INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL, CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

                                 LYDIE
                        But we have to be finished in time. 
                        People have signed up. Classes 
                        start in four days.
                                 ARCHITECT
                        We’re using every available worker 
                        within 100 miles, ma’am. We’ve sent 
                        to Tulsa for more, but they haven’t 
                        arrived yet.

           She looks up at the building and sees a CREW of dozens 
           working. But the building is nowhere near finished.

                                 LYDIE
                        Put me to work.

           EXT. MARLAND INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL - DAY

           The Architect carries a large blueprint, consulting with a 
           Builder. The camera follows him and pans up to:

           LYDIE. She is wearing a kerchief. Standing on a ladder with 
           her sleeves rolled up. Painting the side of the school. She’s 
           been at it for hours.

           Construction crews do the more skilled work at the other end.

           Now, a group of SIX WOMEN approach from behind Lydie’s back: 
           Mrs. Marsden, Mrs. Blake, Mrs. Matthews and the SOCIETY 
           LADIES.

           They look at each other when they see Lydie. She’s dirty and 
           covered in paint.

           Mrs. Marsden screws up her courage.

                                 MRS. MARSDEN
                        Mrs. Marland?! Lydie?

           Lydie looks down from the ladder, wipes her brow.

                                 MRS. MARSDEN
                        They told us at the house you’d be 
                        here. We wanted to-- well, Mrs. 
                        Blake will...

                                 MRS. BLAKE
                        We know that in the past there’s 
                        been some confusion about your 
                        invitation to the Founders’ Lunch. 
                        So we wanted to personally extend 
                        the invitation this year.

                                 MRS. MATTHEWS
                        Over tea, perhaps.
                                 LYDIE
                        That’s very kind. But just now, I’m 
                        afraid I have work to do. 

           She nods politely, smiles. Goes back to work.

           Mrs. Marsden, Mrs. Blake, and the society women look at 
           Lydie; and the unpainted school; and at each other.

                                                                CUT TO:

           The SOCIETY WOMEN are on ladders and apple-boxes, their fine 
           clothes rolled up at the sleeves and splattered, helping 
           Lydie paint the school.

           ON Lydie. She turns and looks at fifty-something Mrs. Blake 
           on the ladder next to her, painting with surprising vigor. 
           Lydie turns back to the wall she’s painting and smiles to 
           herself.

           INT. THE PALACE - NIGHT

           Lydie is asleep in her painting clothes. Ernest puts a 
           blanket over her and turns out the light.

           EXT. AROUND THE PALACE - MORNING

           Quiet morning on the grounds of the Palace.

           ANGLES ON: The topiary of the formal gardens. A DUCK extends 
           his wings to scare off a rival in the pond.

           ON THE TERRACE: Lydie reads a newspaper. Suddenly, a low 
           rumble. She looks up.

           A BIPLANE flies low overhead, then circles and comes back 
           again.

           Lydie stands, puzzled.

           Now the biplane gets lower, and lower, and LANDS with a 
           bounce on the lawn of the Palace.

           Clay has come outside, as perplexed as Lydie.

                                 LYDIE
                        Are we being invaded?

           Now the PILOT lifts the glass to the cockpit and removes his 
           aviator goggles. It is Ernest.
           EXT.  THE PALACE, LAWNS - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           From a distance, we watch Ernest lead Lydie by the hand 
           toward the plane. She’s resisting.

                                 ERNEST
                        I had a lesson this morning, 
                        nothing to it! Your projects have 
                        monopolized your attention long 
                        enough. Today I’m monopolizing you. 

           Pre-lap the sound of the engine.

           EXT. SKY ABOVE THE PLAINS - DAY

           Virgin prairie. Undulating swells where the land rises and 
           falls.

           Ernest and Lydie flying over a part of the continent that 
           will never again be Lewis-and-Clark pristine. The last gasps 
           of the American frontier.

           ON LYDIE looking down. It’s stunning. Ernest makes the plane 
           dive lower. She screams as if on a roller coaster.

           They fly above part of the NORTH AMERICAN CRANE MIGRATION -- 
           thousands of majestic white birds on their way to their 
           nesting grounds on the Platte River. It’s one of the most 
           miraculous sites in all of nature.

           Now they’re flying low. They pass over a group of FARMKIDS 
           who are playing stickball. 

           The kids jump and scream and wave their arms as the plane 
           passes. They’re fascinated. They’ve never seen an airplane. 

           Lydie screams like one of them and motions for Ernest to turn 
           back and do it again.

           The plane turns and zooms just twenty feet over the heads of 
           the Farmkids. Lydie is loving it, turns back to watch the 
           jumping children get smaller and smaller.

           EXT. FIELDS - SUNSET

           Quiet now on the plains. The middle of nowhere. The biplane 
           on the grass in the distance. 

           Ernest and Lydie are on the ground. He lies across her lap. 
           There’s a pile of picked flowers on the ground next to him. 
           He holds a blue flower up to her. She speaks slowly and 
           quietly.
                                 LYDIE
                        Viola sagittata. Arrow-leaved 
                        violet.

           Another.

                                 LYDIE
                        Evigeron strigosus. Daisy fleabane.

           An incantation, a private poetry between them. He holds up 
           another, but before she can answer:

                                 ERNEST
                        Do you hate me that you’re not a 
                        mother? 

           She takes a long moment. Then, almost imperceptibly, she 
           shakes her head and takes the flower in her hand.

                                 LYDIE
                        Hypoxis hirsuta. Star grass. 

           A wider shot. The sun’s setting.

           INT. BOARD ROOM, STANDARD OIL COMPANY - DAY

                        to industry than the making of

           INT. THE PALACE, GREAT ROOM - NIGHT

           Two weeks before Christmas, 1932.

           Lydie emerges from the kitchen with a tray of red cookies.

                                 LYDIE
                        They’re supposed to be Santa 
                        cookies, but they didn’t come out 
                        right. They look more like devils, 
                        don’t you think?  Satan cookies.

                                                                CUT TO:

           They are decorating a very large Christmas tree. Each manning 
           a ladder on a different side of the tree.

                                 ERNEST
                        Morgan wants to broker a deal to 
                        take the financial pressure off us. 
                        So I won’t have to run around the 
                        country any more to secure loans.
                                 LYDIE
                        I don’t understand why you even 
                        need to secure loans. We own our 
                        own bank, for God’s sake.

                                 ERNEST
                        The new Texas options are in the 
                        tens of millions. Even Marland Oil 
                        needs to be bankrolled that. 
                             (re: an ornament made by a 
                              child. It says LYDIE.)
                        Look.

           She smiles.

                                 ERNEST
                        Morgan’s drawn up an agreement that 
                        will get us cash and let us keep 
                        control. 

                                 LYDIE
                        And what’s the downside?

                                 ERNEST
                        I haven’t found one yet. Standard 
                        would have a stake in the company, 
                        but Morgan’s found a mom-and-pop 
                        company to take the other chunk. 
                        The Clover Oil Company. 

           Lydie looks quizzical.

                                 ERNEST
                        That’s their real name, I swear. 
                        Founded by Mr. Jed Clover. They’re 
                        Episcopalians from Gunnersburg, 
                        Ohio, with old family money. 
                        Prepared to buy a 22 percent share.
                             (going down to a stack of 
                              cards in a box)
                        They even sent a Christmas Card... 
                        Gracious family photo enclosed.

           He hands the card across the tree to her ladder.

           The photo: A black-and-white portrait of churchy people -- a 
           mother, father, and four children -- standing in front of a 
           photo studio background.

                                 LYDIE
                        “The Clovers wish you and yours a 
                        blessed Christmas Season.” My God, 
                        the daughters look dour.
                                 ERNEST
                        And so would you be if you lived in 
                        Gunnersburg, Ohio.

                                 ERNEST
                        The Clovers keep Rockefeller at 
                        bay. Investment capital without 
                        bankers. No more running from coast 
                        to coast. More time here with you. 
                        Where’s the downside to that?

           The dour Clover daughters stare ahead in the photo.

           INT. CHURCH RECTORY - DAY

           An Old Woman leads Engell into the living room where a man in 
           a suit is sitting. Engell looks at the man.

                                 ENGELL
                        Can I help you?

           The man stands, extends his hand.

                                 WILCOX
                        Good morning, Reverend. My name is 
                        Wilcox. Ben Wilcox.

           INT. AN EMPTY BANQUET ROOM IN A PONCA CITY RESTAURANT - NIGHT 

           Wilcox is sitting on the edge of a long table addressing two 
           dozen or so Ponca City residents: they include BARKER, the 
           bank president; a PRIEST; a SCHOOL PRINCIPAL; the PONCA CITY 
           NEWS EDITOR; some CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS.

           Wilcox’s eastern sophistication is suddenly absent. He speaks 
           in a laid-back, folksy way.

                                 WILCOX
                        First-off, I’d like to thank the 
                        Reverend for gathering you together 
                        today.

           He gestures to Engell, who nods.

                                 WILCOX
                        Now, I know you’re busy folks, so 
                        I’ll talk straight and fast with 
                        you. Bottom line is that we are 
                        thinking of investing heavily in 
                        this community, but we feel it’s 
                        important to win over the hearts of 
                        the people first.

                        That’s where community leaders like 
                        yourselves come in.

           On the faces of those gathered.

                                 WILCOX
                        You may read about Standard being a 
                        big heartless octopus in the press, 
                        but I can’t say that the press has 
                        ever given a big business a fair 
                        shake. Truth is, we’re just regular 
                        hard-workin’ folks like yourselves. 
                        We represent the simple values of 
                        self-reliance and, maybe unlike 
                        some other folks you know about, we 
                        insist on the very highest moral 
                        standards for ourselves and for our 
                        families. Cause, as the Book says, 
                        “No good fruit can come of a 
                        poisonous tree.”

           INT. THE PALACE, HALLWAY - DAY

           The decorated Christmas tree in the background.

           Lydie is taking cards from the box of Christmas cards we saw 
           earlier. 

           Removing them from their envelopes and arranging the cards on 
           a table.

           She gets to: “The Clovers wish you and yours a blessed 
           Christmas season” with the photo of the Clover family. Lydie 
           smiles. She looks at the envelope, with a hand-written return 
           address of Gunnersburg, Ohio.

           But Lydie looks to the right of the return address. The 
           postmark says : PARK AVENUE STATION. NEW YORK, NY 10022.

           ON Lydie.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THE PALACE, ERNEST’S OFFICE - DAY

           Lydie rifles through stacks of papers on Ernest’s desk. 

           She comes upon a letter from John Rockefeller, STANDARD OIL 
           COMPANY. Now she looks at the engraved return address on the 
           stationery. 620 Fifth Avenue.
           Clipped to it is the envelope it came in. The envelope says 
           PARK AVENUE STATION. NEW YORK, NY 10022.

           Lydie compares the Clover Oil Christmas Card postmark with 
           the Standard Oil postmark. They’re identical.

           INT. MARLAND OIL OFFICE, PONCA CITY - DAY

           A PHOTOGRAPHER takes a picture of Ernest shaking hands with 
           John Rockefeller. Then of Ernest and Rockefeller sitting.

           EXT. MARLAND OIL OFFICE, PONCA CITY - CONTINUOUS

           Lydie hurries out of her car, holding the envelopes.

                        They’re still at the signing, Mrs. 
                        Marland. We can’t disturb --

           Lydie bursts into the room.

           INT. MARLAND OIL OFFICE, RECEPTION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Where Ernest is being congratulated by well-wishers. 

           A reception to celebrate the signing of the deal. Standard 
           executives and Marland Oil executives. Drinking champagne and 
           eating finger foods.

           Heads turn as Lydie walks into the room and pulls Ernest 
           away, by the arm.

                                 ERNEST
                             (to a Guest, as he’s 
                              dragged)
                        Excuse me.

           As soon as they’re a few feet away.

                                 LYDIE
                        Don’t sign the deal.

                                 ERNEST
                        Done already.
                             (looking at her face)
                        Are you all right? 
                                 LYDIE
                        Have you ever met Jed Clover and 
                        his family?

                                 ERNEST
                        I’ve been corresponding with him 
                        for months--

                                 LYDIE
                        No, in person. Have you ever laid 
                        eyes on him?

           Ernest very slightly shakes his head. Lydie produces TWO 
           ENVELOPES and holds them in front of Ernest.

                                 LYDIE
                        The postmarks.

           She hands him the envelope from the Clover Christmas card, 
           then the one from Standard Oil. Ernest looks at the 
           postmarks. Identical.

                                 LYDIE
                        Jed Clover doesn’t exist. He’s a 
                        front. He is Standard Oil. 

                                 ERNEST
                        But that’s fraud.

                                 LYDIE
                        Not if they did the paperwork to 
                        incorporate as Clover Oil.

           Now Ernest is in complete shock. He has to sit down.

                                 ERNEST
                        The stock we sold to Rockefeller 
                        plus the stock to the Clovers --

                                 LYDIE
                        The non-existent Clovers.

                                 ERNEST
                        -- amounts to fifty-five percent. 
                        Controlling interest in the 
                        company.

           Ernest, now sitting, looks across the room to where John 
           Rockefeller is having his picture taken. Smiling. 

                                 ERNEST
                        That sonofabitch just bought 
                        Marland Oil.

                        Stay cordial. Hope for the best.
                             (beat)
                        Maybe they’ll sit back and collect 
                        their checks and won’t interfere.

                        Mr. Bennett, the gentleman from 
                        Standard is here.

           INT. MARLAND OIL BOARD ROOM - DAY

           The eleven board members are standing around getting coffee 
           and settling in. 

           The Receptionist leaves as Wilcox enters the room with a 
           briefcase. Bennett goes to him.

                                 BENNETT
                             (shakes his hand)
                        Ben, my friend. Ernest will be 
                        happy to see you back in the Outlet 
                        again.

                                 WILCOX
                        Mr. Marland won’t be attending 
                        today.

           Wilcox sits in Ernest’s seat, begins to remove documents from 
           a briefcase.

                                 WILCOX
                             (pre-lap)
                        The first item for discussion on 
                        your list will be the leadership 
                        changes. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           A moment later. He’s passing around papers.
                                 WILCOX
                        Standard has a responsibility to 
                        maintain its aura of respectability 
                        to its shareholders. There are 
                        aspects of Mr. Marland’s personal 
                        life that are not well regarded in 
                        the press and we no longer wish to 
                        have him as the public face of the 
                        company.

                                 BOSKIRK
                        But his name is the name of the 
                        company. How can he not be the 
                        public face?

                                 WILCOX
                        We will also be phasing out the use 
                        of the name Marland Oil.

           The board members look at each other.

                                 WILCOX
                        Now, I’d like to jump right in to 
                        our evaluation of the expenditures 
                        report.

           He picks up a copy of the papers he’s been passing.

                                 WILCOX
                        Expenses to be eliminated are 
                        flagged in the right column and 
                        include but are not limited to: 
                        Subsidized home loans. Employee 
                        medical benefits. The operation of 
                        Marland Industrial School. Stock 
                        grants, life and accident insurance 
                        for employees.
                             (amused at this one)
                        Free golf and equestrian lessons.
                             (turning a page)
                        Moving on to page two...

           INT. MARLAND OIL BOARD ROOM - LATER

           The meeting is emptying out. Wilcox is packing up his papers. 
           He lifts his briefcase from the table and walks out the door, 
           running into ERNEST.

           Who has been waiting for him at the door to the board room. 
           Wilcox steps to the side, Ernest blocks his exit. Now they’re 
           face to face.
                                 ERNEST
                             (quietly)
                        You’re not going to win.

                                 WILCOX
                             (equally quiet)
                        We’ve already won.

                                 LYDIE (O.S.)
                        Ernest?

           He turns. Lydie waits with her hand extended for him to come. 
           For a moment, it’s a triangle of the three standing within a 
           few feet of each other. Wilcox looks at Lydie. It’s the first 
           time he has seen her since the day he left Ponca City. 

           Now Ernest turns from him, goes to Lydie, takes her hand. As 
           she leads him away, he looks back to Wilcox. 

           INT. THE PALACE, GREAT ROOM - EVENING

           Lydie is pacing the room, smoking a cigarette.

                                 LYDIE
                        The only way is to start a 
                        revolution. If the town rises up 
                        against it, Rockefeller won’t want 
                        the bad press. He’s got enough anti-
                        trust trouble as it is...

                                 BENNETT
                        It’s too late, Lydie. They’ve 
                        gotten to people all around town 
                        already.

                                 LYDIE
                        Why would people act against their 
                        own interests?

           Bennett holds up a Ponca City News headline: RISE OF THE 
           TYCOON. Under the headline is the FAMILY PHOTO of ERNEST, 
           VIRGINIA, and the 6 YEAR-OLD LYDIE that we saw taken in 1906. 
           It’s next to a WEDDING PHOTO of Ernest and Lydie.

                                 BENNETT
                        They’ve convinced people that you 
                        two are the Macbeths, that they’ve 
                        all been duped. You’re not morally 
                        fit to be pillars of the community 
                        and Standard is doing the people of 
                        Ponca City a favor by taking over.
                                 LYDIE
                        Who, for instance? Who have they 
                        convinced of this?

                                 BENNETT
                        Everyone. The YMCA. Walt at the 
                        American Legion. Tucker and Snow in 
                        the mayor’s office. The press. 
                        Obviously.

           He slaps and tosses the newspaper. 

                                 BENNETT
                        For God’s sake, Reverend Engell has 
                        been preaching that you’re the 
                        devil, that Standard is saving the 
                        city from going up in flames like 
                        Gomorrah.

           Lydie extinguishes what’s left of her cigarette.

                                 LYDIE
                        I’ll go have a talk with Engell 
                        tomorrow. 
                             (lighting another 
                              cigarette)
                        The devil’s going to church.

           EXT. CHURCH, PONCA CITY - MORNING

           Lydie, dressed formally in a hat, hurries to the door of the 
           church. The service has already started.

           INT. CHURCH - MORNING

           The celebrant, ENGELL, stands and goes to the podium. From 
           this height, he can see the congregation. 

                                 ENGELL
                        The reading today is from the Book 
                        of--

           Lydie discreetly enters and takes a seat in a pew.

           Engell focuses on Lydie in the congregation. He thinks. 

           Now, he turns the Bible page from where he was going to read 
           and goes to a new one.

                                 ENGELL
                        From the Book of Genesis. Chapter 
                        19. “
                                 (MORE)
                                 ENGELL (cont'd)
                        Thus it came to pass: when God 
                        destroyed the Cities of the Plain, 
                        Lot was afraid to stay in Zoar. He 
                        and his two daughters went up from 
                        Zoar and settled in the hill 
                        country, where he lived with his 
                        two daughters in a cave.” 

           On Lydie.

                                 ENGELL (O.S.)
                        “The older one said to the younger: 
                        "Our father is getting old, and 
                        there is not a man on earth to 
                        unite with us. Come, let us ply our 
                        father with wine and then lie with 
                        him, that we may have offspring by 
                        our father.”

           Whispering, turning of heads. Even children seem to be 
           buzzing.

                                 ENGELL
                        “So that night they plied their 
                        father with wine, and the older one 
                        went in and lay with her father; 
                        but he was not aware of her lying 
                        down or her getting up. Next day 
                        the older one said to the younger: 
                        ‘Last night it was I who lay with 
                        my father.’ “

           By now, Lydie can feel a hundred sets of eyes on her.

           She looks to the side of her for a sympathetic gaze. 
           Suddenly, the WOMAN next to her looks down at her lap. 

           Then all the churchgoers around Lydie seem suddenly 
           fascinated by their hands or laps. None will meet her eyes.

           She stands. She and Engell are the only people in the room 
           standing. They stare at each other.

           Lydie turns and leaves the church, slowly, with dignity, her 
           shoes echoing in the large room.

           INT. HOTEL, PONCA CITY - EVENING

           Wilcox, drinking a glass of port. A stack of documents on the 
           table in front of him. 

           The telephone rings. Wilcox answers.
                                 WILCOX
                        Hello. Thank you, I’ll hold.

           Wilcox picks up the phone and its wire and goes to stand by 
           the window.

                                 WILCOX
                        Yes, sir. I’ve been going through 
                        the statements and I have some very 
                        good news.

           Wilcox looks out the window.

                                 DERRAH (O.S.)
                             (pre-lap)
                        No, I won’t call it that because 
                        it’s not malfeasance.

           INT. MARLAND OIL OFFICE, ERNEST’S OFFICE - DAY

                                 DERRAH
                             (arguing emphatically)
                        He never drew a clear line between 
                        the books of the company and his 
                        own accounts. If the company needed 
                        something, he’d write a personal 
                        check. If salaries needed to be 
                        paid, Ernest paid them out of 
                        pocket. As a way of doing business, 
                        yes, it was a little bit...

                                 WILCOX
                        Illegal?

                                 DERRAH
                        I was going to say “old-fashioned.”

                                 WILCOX
                        This is no longer Mr. Marland’s 
                        personal duchy. 
                             (standing)
                        A substantial portion of the funds 
                        used for building his house can be 
                        traced back to company accounts. 
                             (closing his briefcase)
                        The Marland house is now an asset 
                        of the Standard Oil company. We are 
                        filing for a court order for him to 
                        vacate by the first of the year. 
                        Thank you, Mr. Derrah. That will be 
                        all.
           INT. ERNEST’S CAR - DAY

           Driving from Oklahoma City to Ponca City. Bennett hands 
           Ernest a thick stack of papers.

                                 BENNETT
                        These are the terms of the suits. 
                        They’re challenging just about 
                        every one of your assets.

                                 ERNEST
                        But not the personal accounts.

                                 BENNETT
                        On paper, the personal accounts 
                        aren’t distinguished from the 
                        business accounts.

           It takes a moment for this to sink in. Then, hope:

                                 ERNEST
                        They can’t touch the stocks. The 
                        stocks are in Lydie’s name. We’ve 
                        got the stocks.

                                 BENNETT
                        ... which, since the Crash, aren’t 
                        worth the paper they’re printed on.

           Beat. Ernest steels himself.

                                 ERNEST
                        The house.

           Bennett nods once, can’t even look at Ernest.

                                 BENNETT
                             (quiet, shaking his head)
                        That was the first thing they went 
                        after.

           This is a bomb exploding and Ernest sinks down into the 
           crater it left behind. He looks out the window. The car is 
           passing the PONCA CITY RAILYARDS.

           ERNEST’S P.O.V.: a PAINTER, 30s, is at work on one of the 
           tanker cars. He has a bucket of BLUE PAINT. He is painting 
           over the red Marland Oils logo on a tanker, replacing it with  
           the blue logo for STANDARD OIL.

           The painter has already finished work on a few tanker cars: 
           there are blue cars to his left, red to his right.
                                 ERNEST
                             (to Driver)
                        Stop the car.

           Driver, puzzled.

                                 ERNEST
                        STOP THE CAR.

           EXT. ROAD ADJACENT TRAINYARD - DAY

           Ernest gets out of the car. He stomps like Goliath toward the 
           PAINTER, who is working on a step-ladder. Painter’s back is 
           turned to the road so he doesn’t see Ernest approach.

                                 BENNETT
                             (in the distance)
                        Ernest?

           Ernest YANKS the Painter off the step-ladder, throwing him to 
           the ground. His bucket spills on the ground, blue paint 
           everywhere. On the Painter, on Ernest.

                                 ERNEST
                        Who instructed you to do this?! I 
                        didn’t instruct you to do this!

           Painter, on the ground, bruised, moaning. By now Bennett has 
           caught up.

                                 BENNETT
                        ERNEST!

                                 ERNEST
                        WHO TOLD YOU TO DO THIS?

           Ernest, half-blue like a Scot in war-paint, kicks the 
           painter.

                                 PAINTER
                             (disoriented, crouching)
                        The company office...

                                 BENNETT
                             (restraining him)
                        Ernest!

                                 ERNEST
                        I’M the office, you asshole! I’M 
                        the company! I’M THE COMPANY!!

           Before Ernest can kick the Painter again, Bennett drags him 
           back toward the car. Painter stands, catching his breath. 
           He watches this madman, who is still straining back toward 
           him, all daggers.

                                 ERNEST
                             (as he’s pulled back)
                        I’M THE COMPANY! I’M THE COMPANY!! 
                        I’M THE COMPANY! I’M THE COMPANY!!

           EXT. THE PALACE, GARDENS - NIGHT

           Lydie comes outside wearing a shawl. Scans the gardens.

           She spots Ernest sitting at the base of the statue of her.

           AT THE STATUE: Ernest, parts of his skin crusted with blue 
           paint, is drinking, nearly drunk. A bottle of whiskey open.

           Lydie sits on the ground next to him.

                                 ERNEST
                        You know, my father -- your 
                        grandfather, your father-in-law -- 
                        never lived to see me make a 
                        fortune. But [on the other hand] he 
                        never lived to see me lose it. 

           Another drink. Lydie discreetly puts the bottle beyond his 
           reach. Puts her arm around him.

                                 ERNEST
                        Old Man Marland said I should have 
                        settled down in Pittsburgh. He said  
                        my problem was, I was always 
                        looking at the terra incognita part 
                        of a map. Here be monsters. Wanting 
                        the impossible, looking for the 
                        thing over the horizon. “Read the 
                        Book of Proverbs, boy. ‘Only the 
                        eyes of a fool wander to the ends 
                        of the earth.’” Sonofabitch was 
                        right.

           INT. THE PALACE, LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           Handing Ernest a document to sign.

                                 BOSKIRK
                        Part of the agreement is that you 
                        leave Ponca City. They feel your 
                        presence would be a distraction to 
                        the new board.
           Ernest is silent. Lydie jumps in.

                                 LYDIE
                             (brightly; trying to buoy 
                              him up)
                        We’ll go to Oklahoma City. I’ve 
                        always wanted to try living in 
                        Oklahoma City. 

           She takes his hand, but he’s very, very low.

           INT. THE PALACE, HALLWAY - DAY 

           Wilcox walks down the hall with a group of men in suits. 

           Their footsteps echo on the tiles. They walk as if they own 
           the place, which, in fact, they do.

           Lydie, her hair in a kerchief, is carrying a box of her 
           things down the hall. Moving out is in progress.

           She comes around a corner and locks eyes with Wilcox. He 
           looks at her and she stares straight back at him. 

           He braces for rage, but what he gets is something more like 
           pity.

                                 LYDIE
                        I defended you once. I was wrong.

           Then she continues the way she was going.

           Wilcox stands alone, listening to her footsteps recede.

           EXT. THE PALACE, LAWN - DAY 

                                 LYDIE
                        Joseph.

           Lydie is saying goodbye to the servants. They stand in a 
           line. One by one she shakes their hands, looks into their 
           eyes, and says their names.

                                 LYDIE
                        Ada.

                                 LYDIE
                        Michael.

           Now she’s at the end of the line, where Clay stands.
                                 LYDIE
                        Clay.

           She looks at him for a long time.

           She takes his hand, then thinks again and embraces him.

                                 LYDIE
                        You will go very far in the world.

           We pull out to a wide shot of Lydie embracing Clay at the end 
           of the line of servants on the lawn.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           Now, over black: bright trumpet music and the crow of a 
           rooster.

           The words: NEWS AT HOME in large font fill the screen.

                                 VOICE OF ANNOUNCER
                        Meanwhile, back in the heartland, 
                        the suffering continues!

           We’re watching a black-and-white RKO-Pathé newsreel. The 
           Announcer’s voice is bright and exclamatory.

                                 VOICE OF ANNOUNCER
                        The dust storms first spotted in 
                        South Dakota have continued to 
                        spread over the Great Plains, 
                        leaving their trail of misery 
                        behind them!

           Documentary footage of a great black cloud on the horizon. A 
           farm made barren. A car buried in three feet of dust. A 
           farmer and his family standing, looking at the wasteland that 
           was their field.

                                 VOICE OF ANNOUNCER
                        Crops wither north and south! Black 
                        snow falls in Chicago! As elections 
                        loom, an Oklahoma farmer asks, “Who 
                        will help and how long can this go 
                        on?” 

           The RKO trumpets sound again.

                                 VOICE OF ANNOUNCER
                        This has been RKO’s News on Parade! 
                        For March 1934. Until next time... 

           The Pathé cock crows again. Screen fades to black in a ...
           INT. MOVIE THEATER, OKLAHOMA CITY - DAY 

           Lydie, dressed inconspicuously in a hat, sits alone watching. 

           The screen now fades into the RKO “transmitter” logo -- a 
           radio tower on top of a globe that looks like the tower of an 
           oil derrick. Then, music and the main title of George Cukor’s 
           “Little Women.”

           EXT. OKLAHOMA CITY COTTAGE - LATER THAT DAY

           Outside, it is the dead of winter. Snow on the ground. Lydie 
           walks toward a small cottage outside Oklahoma City carrying 
           grocery bags. This is her new home.

           INT. OKLAHOMA CITY COTTAGE - DAY

           Lydie opens the door.

                                 LYDIE
                        Ernest?

           No response. She puts down her bags and looks into the living 
           room.

           Ernest sits in a chair, looking at the wall, lost in thought.

           INT. OKLAHOMA CITY COTTAGE, KITCHEN - EVENING

                                 ERNEST
                             (touching a radiator)
                        I think I can feel it now.

           He blows out a match and sits at the dinner table with Lydie, 
           who is wearing a coat.

                                 LYDIE
                        You didn’t tell me about lunch with 
                        Bennett.

                                 ERNEST
                             (looking down, cutting his 
                              food)
                        He didn’t show.
                             (beat)
                        Twenty years of working for me, he 
                        was never a minute late. Now he’s 
                        always got a last-minute conflict.

           Silence for a long moment.
                                 LYDIE
                        I’ve been thinking about something.
                             (a beat)
                        I’ve been thinking you should run 
                        for governor.

           More silence.

                                 LYDIE
                        The elections are coming, you need 
                        a job. Governor is a job.

           Now he finally looks up from his food.

                                 ERNEST
                        Don’t.

                                 LYDIE
                        We’re down, but so is all of 
                        Oklahoma-- 

                                 ERNEST
                        Just don’t.

                                 LYDIE
                        You could inspire people, you 
                        could.--

                                 ERNEST
                        FOR CHRIST’S SAKE!

           He throws down his fork, startling her. Suddenly, he’s 
           volcanic.

                                 ERNEST
                        OPEN YOUR EYES, LYDIE! Stop acting 
                        like a goddamned child! It’s my 
                        fault I raised you in the land of 
                        sugar-plum fairies, but now it’s 
                        over! I’ve failed you, and you need 
                        to live in the WORLD. It’s a wolf 
                        world full of wolves and I was 
                        stupid to think something else. 
                        Look around you! THIS IS WHAT THERE 
                        IS. 

           He tosses his plate at the wall and it shatters.

                                 ERNEST
                        This is all there is.

           He gets up, knocking his chair over, and leaves the room. 
           Lydie hears the front door slam.
           INT. OKLAHOMA CITY COTTAGE, LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Lydie sits in a chair, in the dark.

           EXT. OKLAHOMA CITY COTTAGE - NIGHT

           It is snowing.

           Lydie leaves the house in her coat. The car is there. She 
           scans the lawn. No Ernest.

           She walks around the side of the house, sees a shape in the 
           snow. It is Ernest. On the ground, shivering, covered in 
           snow. 

           Lydie hurries to him. She takes off her coat and places it on 
           him like a blanket.

           She sits in the snow next to him and lifts him off the 
           ground, against her breast. She sits rocking him in her arms.

                                 LYDIE
                             (whispers)
                        Come back inside. Come back. Come 
                        back. Come back.

           We pull out to a wide shot of the two of them in the snow, 
           Lydie cradling Ernest, like a mother and child. She’s rocking 
           him back to life, until he’s no longer numb. Hold there.

                                 ERNEST (O.S.)
                             (echo-ey, through a 
                              microphone)
                        I’m standing in front of you today 
                        having lost my job...

           INT. OKLAHOMA DEMOCRATIC PARTY STATE HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           Lydie watches Ernest walk into an office within an office.

                                 ERNEST (O.S.)
                        My money. My house. I’ve lost 
                        nearly everything. Except my will 
                        to continue.

           Lydie watches the scene through a large window to the 
           interior office.

           It plays out in pantomime. Ernest shakes hands with a few 
           PARTY OFFICIALS. Sits at a table with them. Starts to talk.
                                 ERNEST (O.S.)
                        I’ve been disowned by my former 
                        colleagues, who think I should feel 
                        ashamed of how low I’ve been 
                        brought in the last two years. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           A large BANNER that says MARLAND FOR GOVERNOR. We are at a...

           EXT. MARLAND FOR GOVERNOR RALLY - DAY

           He’s at a podium on a stage. 

           The CROWD consists mostly of farmers and laborers. The 
           victims of the Dust Bowl. Tom Joad is probably here. 

           There is a breaking quality in Ernest’s voice now. His tone 
           is no longer the assured tone of a mogul but is more nuanced, 
           vulnerable. More human.

                                 ERNEST
                        But I’m standing here to tell you I 
                        feel just the opposite. I’ve never 
                        felt prouder to be an Oklahoman 
                        than I do today, here with you.

           There is literally dust blowing throughout the scene. People 
           hold signs like “$50 Old Age Pensions” and “Those Who Till 
           the Land Should Own It.”

                                 ERNEST
                        Because now that I’ve suffered some 
                        of what the people of this state 
                        are suffering every day, I can 
                        finally look them in the eye. I can 
                        look you in the eye.

           EXT. SOONER SOCIETY DINNER, GOVERNOR’S MANSION - NIGHT 

                                 M.C.
                        Ladies and gentlemen, our host and 
                        keynote speaker, the governor of 
                        the great state of Oklahoma -- Mr. 
                        Ernest Marland.

           Rousing applause. 

           Find Ernest sitting at a table with Lydie. They are four 
           years older.  Their formal clothes are not ostentatious, as 
           they were in the high decadent period. The colors are more 
           muted and the excessiveness of the Jazz Age is gone.
           Ernest stands, walks toward the podium. Lydie watches him.

           (The following speech, though four years later in time, plays 
           like a continuation of the campaign speech).

                                 ERNEST (O.S.)
                             (pre-lap)
                        I’ve changed a lot in the last few 
                        years. Lots of things have changed. 
                        Even the land has changed. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           He’s been speaking for a few minutes. At a microphone.

                                 ERNEST
                        There is no longer a frontier left 
                        in America. We’ve filled in all the 
                        spaces on the map and we live in 
                        the Garden after the Fall. We woke 
                        up from our pioneer dream to find 
                        that there was no perfect world to 
                        be found here. 
                             (beat)
                        So now I say the time for talk is 
                        done. Now is the time for action 
                        and work, and all that counts is 
                        Now. Someone much wiser than I am 
                        taught me that. 

           ON Lydie.

                                 ERNEST
                        I do still believe we can make 
                        things better in America, at least 
                        a little bit. We’ll start in 
                        Oklahoma. We’ll go to Washington, 
                        maybe someday to the White House or 
                        to the moon. But we’ve got to keep 
                        working, we have no other choice. 
                        There is no Promised Land and there 
                        is no shining city past the 
                        horizon. 
                             (then, off-book; directed 
                              at Lydie)
                        We are the shining city. We are the 
                        frontiers.

           LATER.

           People are dancing in the room. An orchestral version of the 
           song “Sometimes I’m Happy.”
           Ernest leaves a GROUP of supporters near the stage and is 
           apprehended by a young, businesslike AIDE.

                                 AIDE
                        Sir? Senator Thomas is waiting to 
                        do the photos.   

           But Ernest is looking elsewhere. His POV: Lydie is standing 
           alone.

                                 ERNEST
                             (eyes fixed on Lydie)
                        The Senator can wait. Right now, I 
                        need to dance with my wife.

           Ernest leaves the Aide and walks across the floor. He taps 
           Lydie on the shoulder. She turns. Smiles. He offers his hand.

           She takes it and they start to dance. She puts her head on 
           his shoulder.

           We slowly move out to a wide shot. It has been 15 years now 
           since we saw them dance at the Fourth of July party at the 
           Grand Avenue Mansion. While they’re dancing, each is not 
           aware of anyone or anything but the other.

           INT. GOVERNOR’S MANSION, DRAWING ROOM - MORNING

           Ernest and Lydie are still wearing their clothes from the 
           dance, asleep on the couch from the night before. Ernest 
           opens his eyes. Gently maneuvers from her embrace.

           He gives her another pillow. Takes a moment to look at her. 
           In the morning light, she’s beautiful.

           He goes into the hall.

           INT. GOVERNOR’S MANSION, HALLWAY - DAY

           In silhouette. Ernest suddenly stops. Leans over. Tries to 
           balance himself on the wall. His legs give out. He falls.

           He is dead.

           INT. GOVERNOR’S MANSION, DRAWING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Lydie opens her eyes when she hears the thud on the floor.
           EXT. GRAVEYARD, PONCA CITY - DAY

           Ernest’s funeral. Various politicians, Democratic Party 
           officials, former business associates; Bennett; Boskirk; Mrs. 
           Marsden; some friends and former friends.

           A Minister reads the mandatory there-is-a-season passage.

           Lydie, wearing black, stands looking at the casket.

           EXT. GRAVEYARD, PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON

           After the funeral. Guests socialize.

           Lydie has lingered at the grave. Two WOMEN look at her.

                                 WOMAN 1
                        She hasn’t said a word. Just 
                        stopped talking.

                                  WOMAN 2
                        It’s bad luck, burying your husband 
                        and your father on the same day.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Now BENNETT approaches Lydie. He reaches out his hand to take 
           Lydie’s, but she doesn’t offer hers back. 

           She looks him in the eye and walks away, alone.

           INT. PONCA CITY HOTEL - NIGHT

           Lydie lies in bed, looking at the place where Ernest should 
           be.

           LATER

           Now the bed is empty. 

           We move slowly through the room to FIND LYDIE, sitting on the 
           floor next to a table. She is rocking very slightly back and 
           forth. Looking down, with a kind of fascination, at her arms. 

           There are the remains of the cuts from when she was five.

           They are still very faintly visible, pink lines at odd 
           angles. Her fingers move over them, as if they’re hieroglyphs 
           to be deciphered.

           Then she stops. She’s made a decision.
           EXT. THE PLAINS - PRE-DAWN

           The fog just before the sun has risen. Headlights. 

           EXT. THE PALACE, GARDENS - PRE-DAWN

           A car drives over grass through the now-neglected formal 
           gardens of the Palace. 

           The car stops near the STATUE OF LYDIE, its headlights 
           trained on the white marble figure. The white statue looks 
           like an apparition, a ghost, in the glare of the headlights.

           Weeds and grass are grown up around the statue.

           The car door opens and LYDIE gets out, leaving the headlights 
           on. She walks to the statue.

           Now we realize she’s carrying something in her hand. It’s a 
           tire iron.

           She SMASHES the statue of herself.

           She’s hitting it again and again, until the face is broken in 
           a dozen places and it is all but destroyed.

           INT. HIGHWAY 24 MOTEL, INDEPENDENCE, MISSOURI - NIGHT

           Brown curtains and an auto-garage calendar on the wall.

           A 50-ish MOTEL WOMAN is glancing through an issue of Look 
           Magazine (”House Beautiful with Mrs. Jameson”). A fan blowing 
           her hair.

           Motel Woman looks up when she hears a car outside and she’s  
           lit momentarily by headlights through the window. The car 
           parks. Sleigh-bells on the door ring when it opens.

           A woman dressed in black clothes with uncombed hair enters.

                                 MOTEL WOMAN
                        Just yourself?

           Lydie nods.

                                 MOTEL WOMAN
                        Three dollars.

           Lydie takes the money out of her pocketbook, places it on 
           Look Magazine.
                                 MOTEL WOMAN
                        Sign your name here for me.

           Motel Woman slides the guest book across the desk. 

           Lydie takes the pen-on-a-string in her hand and writes: MISS 
           JEAN ROBERTS.

           The Motel Woman slides Lydie a key.

                                 MOTEL WOMAN
                        Warm tonight.

           Lydie nods. She turns and disappears out the door.

                                                           THEN, A SLOW 
                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           WHERE WE HOLD FOR A MOMENT IN THE DARK.

           Then, the sound of breathing. Then loud knocking.

           INT. SUPPLY CLOSET - NIGHT

           A REPLAY of a scene we saw earlier. The sound of knocking 
           stops.

           Then: a note, scrawled on a piece of Marriott paper, slips 
           under the door. The woman we knew as the Maid looks down at 
           it. 

           It says: IS YOUR NAME LYDIE?

           ON Lydie. She looks down at the note, lowers herself to the 
           floor.

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           The Man from the elevator waits on the other side of the 
           door.

           A moment. Nothing. Then, the paper, turned over, is slipped 
           back under the door. There is something written on the 
           reverse in pencil.

           It reads, in writing that looks like a child’s: 

           NOT  ANY  MORE

           On the MAN. Who hesitates, then:
                                 MAN
                             (very gently)
                        Lydie, it’s Clay.

           He hears the door of the supply closet unlock, and the door 
           creaks open.

           His POV: Sitting on the floor is Lydie. Age 76, the same age 
           as the century.  She looks down at her feet for a long 
           moment, then finally, up at the Man.

                                 LYDIE
                        Clay.

           INT. BELTWAY DINER - DAY

           Lydie and Clay are sitting at a booth in a greasy-spoon 
           diner. He’s showing her a photo.

                                 CLAY
                        That’s them. Twins. Married, 
                        divorced, married again. After the 
                        Palace, I worked for an insurance 
                        company, then an advertising firm. 
                        Then IBM, right back in Ponca City. 

           A WAITRESS arrives with cups of coffee for them both.

                                 CLAY
                             (now, because he can no 
                              longer skirt the issue)
                        Northcutt stayed at the hotel a 
                        month ago. He thought he saw you. 

           Lydie looks down into her coffee.

                                 CLAY
                        There’ve been so many sightings 
                        over the years, but by the time I 
                        could follow them up, you’d 
                        disappeared again.

           Clay reaches into his briefcase and slides some papers across 
           the table to Lydie.

           It’s a magazine. The Saturday Evening Post. A large picture 
           of Lydie at the governor’s inauguration, more than thirty 
           years before. The headline reads: GOVERNOR’S WIDOW VANISHES: 
           WHERE IS LYDIE MARLAND? (*Saturday Evening Post, November 22, 
           1958).

           Another article: HAVE YOU SEEN LYDIE MARLAND?  (*Washington 
           Post, October 23, 1955).
           A Tulsa newspaper, 1974. A blurry photo, with a circle around 
           a figure in the background. “FACE TO FACE WITH A GHOST”: IS 
           THIS WOMAN MRS. MARLAND?

                                 CLAY
                        The FBI stopped looking twenty 
                        years ago. They think you died.

                                 LYDIE
                        They’re right, I suppose.

           EXT. BELTWAY DINER, PARKING LOT - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Moving down from the neon glow of the diner sign to the 
           purple Cutlasses and angular Cadillacs of 1976. 

                                 LYDIE (O.S.)
                        The truth isn’t romantic. The truth 
                        is that we were naive. 

           We’re now on Lydie and Clay as they walk.

                                 LYDIE
                        We thought, if this kind of 
                        happiness is attainable for us, 
                        then anything is attainable for 
                        anyone. But it was an imaginary 
                        world we lived in. It was never a 
                        possible world.

           They’ve now arrived at his rental car. 

                                 LYDIE
                        The worst sin is to misremember.

           A moment.

                                 CLAY
                        They’re going to tear down the 
                        Palace.

           ON Lydie.

                                 CLAY
                        Some developers want to buy the 
                        property. They want to build 200 
                        semi-detached houses, something 
                        like that.

                                 LYDIE
                        That has nothing to do with me.
                                 CLAY
                        Come back to Ponca City. Convince 
                        them not to knock down your house. 

           He touches her on the shoulder. She looks away.

                                 CLAY
                        It’s time now. Come home.

           Lydie bristles at the word. While she looks away, the red 
           neon light illuminates her face. Then, back to him.

                                 LYDIE
                             (unsentimentally)
                        If I look back, I will turn to salt 
                        and I will die.

           Now she turns and goes away, carrying a plastic supermarket 
           bag, toward the dark sidewalk and the bus stop.

                                 CLAY
                        Mrs. Marland --

           She stops and turns.

                                 CLAY
                        I never believed all the fuss was 
                        because you were in love with your 
                        father. I think it was because you 
                        were in love with your husband. To 
                        some people that’s a very 
                        frightening thing.

           Lydie, caught off-guard by this; she thinks, turns, and 
           continues toward the bus stop.

           INT. HOTEL BATHROOM, MARRIOTT - DAY 

           Lydie is back at work at the hotel. Cleaning a bathtub. The 
           shower head is on a long, snake-like extension. She uses it 
           to wash away the bleach in the bathtub.

           Then, seemingly out of nowhere, she starts CRYING.

           She hasn’t cried like this since before Ernest died, or maybe 
           even since she was sent to Ponca City. It’s a whole lifetime 
           worth of emotion coming out all at once. Weeping like a 
           child.

           Sitting on the floor next to the bathtub, she takes the 
           shower-head and points it at her face. Water goes everywhere.

           with her eyes closed, letting the warm water wash over her.

           An AERIAL VIEW. America from above. The Great Plains.

           INT. TWA 767 - DAY

           It is the POV of Lydie. The last time she was on a plane, it 
           was a biplane and Ernest was flying.

           Now the landscape of the Plains is one of interstates, 
           industrial parks, and football fields.

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT (O.S.)
                        Ladies and gentlemen, please put 
                        your seats in the full upright 
                        position for landing...

           EXT. THE PALACE - DUSK

           ANGLE on: A wheel runs over some weeds on an overgrown road, 
           and stops. A foot steps out of a door.

           A TAXI has pulled up in a driveway, and Lydie is paying the 
           Driver. 

           The taxi pulls away and she looks up. 

           Her POV: The Palace, which is now in disrepair. She hasn’t 
           seen it in 40 years. It’s falling apart. 

           There is a chain-link fence around the property, which local 
           kids have cut a hole through. LYDIE GOES THROUGH IT.

           Broken windows. An abandoned, burnt out car in front. Boarded 
           up doors. Graffiti. One of the boarded up doors has a human-
           sized space in it. LYDIE ENTERS.

           INT. THE RUINS OF THE PALACE - DUSK

           More graffiti, beer cans, condom wrappers. Some wooden crates 
           with furniture inside. Some of the original furniture of the 
           house, colonized by generations of spiders. 
           An old couch that’s been brought in by local kids. A couple 
           of hypodermics. 

           And it’s still the grandest place on the Great Plains.

           Even age hasn’t diminished the soaring scale and the 
           cathedral buttresses. The frescoed ceilings and the marble 
           vaults, the light inside.

           Now Lydie steps into the main foyer. A pile of debris that 
           looks like a barricade from a street riot.

           Pieces of antique furniture, curtains covered in 3 inches of 
           dust, garden vases, architectural flourishes that have fallen 
           down over the years, and a white fragment poking through the 
           pile. It is the head of the statue of Lydie. 

           Lydie takes it in her hands and looks down at it. It’s like 
           leaning into a reflecting pool and seeing a ghost of herself.

           INT. PONCA CITY GOLF CLUB - DAY

                        STRIKING!

           Lydie is sitting in a chair, in a room with a mural of men on 
           horses in the background. Bright lights shine in her eyes, 
           and she squints.

           Another part of the room:

                                 NEWS 7 REPORTER
                             (to a Cameraman)
                        How wide are you? Getting the 
                        background, yeah?
                             (she makes an imaginary 
                              box around her head)
                        Is that safe for the boom?

           Back to Lydie. Clay goes to Lydie in her chair.

                                 CLAY
                        You’re all right?

           Lydie nods. The camera focuses on her. In her deteriorated 
           state, sitting in front of a camera is a kind of heroism.

                        elaborate picnics and pool parties

                        as the former oil mogul

                        Mrs. Marland, why is the so-called 
                        Palace on the Prairie worth saving?

                                 LYDIE
                        Because--

           We move closer to her as she thinks for a long moment. Then 
           she starts to speak, slowly, as if trying to figure something 
           out for herself, not for the camera

                                 LYDIE
                        Because my husband built that house 
                        in a particular place at a 
                        particular time...

                        ... when Oklahoma was still an 
                        idea. It was a place off the map 
                        where anything was possible. 

           We are watching the report on a television above the small 
           boxes of breakfast cereals on the counter.

           PATRONS -- truck drivers, retirees -- sit at the counter and 
           watch. A WAITRESS has stopped with plates in hand, looking 
           up.

           INT. SHOPPING MALL -- CONTINUOUS

           A few SHOPPERS with Sears and K-Mart bags watch a television 
           at a department store.

                        That idea is what built this city -- 
                        the idea that something better 
                        could happen here. That’s what he 
                        left us. That’s our inheritance.

           A MECHANIC and his Assistants are watching on a black and

                        When I went back to that house, I 
                        breathed again the air when we 
                        could dream.

           A WHITE-HAIRED MAN, 50s, surrounded by a couple of grandkids  
           playing with action figures, watches the report.

                        And I think that’s a thing-- that’s 
                        a thing worth saving.

                        Look, nostalgia for the Marland 
                        house is lovely.

           INT. PONCA CITY HIGH SCHOOL, AUDITORIUM - EVENING

           On the stage: Five members of the Ponca City Council, 
           including the Council CHAIRMAN. Horn-rim glasses, thick 70s 
           ties.  And SCOTT MILLS, real estate developer, also sitting 
           at a long table on the stage. Each with a microphone.

                                 MILLS
                        But the fact is, it’s 
                        sentimentality the city can’t 
                        afford. In the middle of a 
                        recession, we are offering to take 
                        the elephant off your hands, 
                        provide tax revenues, and create 
                        over 100 construction jobs. Sir? 

           In the back of the auditorium, a WOMAN IN A HAT quietly 
           enters, sits. It is LYDIE.

                                 CITY COUNCIL CHAIRMAN
                        Thank you, Mr. Mills.
                             (another member whispers 
                              something to him)
                        Under the circumstances, as no one 
                        has presented a viable alternative 
                        plan, I think we can put the matter 
                        to vote.

           The White-Haired Man we saw in his living room raises his 
           hand. Stands.

                                 WHITE-HAIRED MAN
                        I beg your pardon, sir. There is an 
                        alternative plan.

           Heads turn. A rumble in the crowd.
                                 WHITE-HAIRED MAN
                        Some of us got together and worked 
                        out that if we vote for a one and a 
                        half percent sales tax until the 
                        Palace is paid for, then we could 
                        raise the 1.4 million in about two 
                        years.

           White-Haired Man is holding a document.

                                 WHITE-HAIRED MAN
                        There’s a petition here. A thousand 
                        names.

           City Council look at each other. A surprise. The Chairman  
           gestures for the document to be passed up to him. 

           As it’s passed up to the Council Chairman:

                                 MILLS
                             (speaking into his 
                              microphone)
                        If I may, Mr. Chairman. I think we 
                        can agree that the people of this 
                        city do not want to pay any more 
                        sales tax than they already do. 
                        Some preservationists may have 
                        circulated a petition, but I’m 
                        confident that the working people 
                        of Ponca City aren’t willing to  
                        volunteer their money for such a 
                        purpose.

           A hand raises. It’s a woman in a denim jacket whom we may 
           recognize as the Waitress we saw earlier.

                                 WAITRESS
                        I will.

           She stands up. The room is silent, and stares at her.

           The Man next to her, in a leather jacket, also stands.

           Now, an Old Man stands. Then a couple of High School 
           Teachers. 

           A Girl with Piercings and her Boyfriend.

           A Mom and her Neighbors. Clay and his wife.

           Three more people stand. Then ten more. Then a dozen, twenty. 

           It’s a popular uprising. Row by row, the town is standing up 
           and staring ahead at the stage and the Council members. 
           The council members whisper to each other or look on with 
           their mouths open.

           Now, the entire high school auditorium is on its feet. 

           Except one. Then, the last person to stand -- albeit frailly -
           - is Lydie.

           The Developer, petulant and defeated, sighs and shakes his 
           head. The City Council Chairman and members look at each 
           other. 

           The room has spoken.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A few minutes later. The meeting is breaking up.

           The City Council Chairman leans over to another Council 
           Member.

                                 CITY COUNCIL CHAIRMAN
                             (under his breath)
                        Well Don, hell just froze over and 
                        the devil’s eatin’ a Sno-Cone. We 
                        just passed a voluntary sales-tax. 

                                 COUNCIL MEMBER
                        I need a beer fast.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Lydie sits in her chair, silently. Now, the White-Haired Man, 
           the man with the petition, approaches her.

                                 LYDIE
                        I don’t know what to say to thank 
                        you.

           She offers her hand to shake.

                                 LYDIE
                        I don’t believe we’ve met.

                                 WHITE-HAIRED MAN
                        I beg your pardon, ma’am. I think 
                        we have.

           He takes something from behind his back. At first, Lydie 
           can’t make out what it is, but he holds it out toward her: 
           it’s her FEATURELESS DOLL. 

                                 WHITE-HAIRED MAN
                        I’ve been meaning to return this.
           Now she looks up at the White-Haired Man. It’s the REDHEADED 
           BOY from almost fifty years ago. He’s now in his fifties and 
           is surrounded by his THREE GRANDCHILDREN, two of whom have 
           red hair. 

           Lydie takes the Featureless Doll in her hand and holds it 
           tight, like she did on the train when she was five.

           Now, people from all over the room start to approach the 
           place where she’s sitting, surrounding Lydie.

           people of her town.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           ANGLE on: A bright view of a stone breezeway, illuminated by 
           sun. 

           Then, three majestic Roman arches under a blue sky.

           former glory.

           INT. THE PALACE, GREAT ROOM - DAY

           A Tour Guide (college student, summer job) presides over a 
           crowd of visitors. Typical mix of tourists: a dad with a tour 
           guidebook; a bored girl in a Duran Duran shirt; some 
           weekenders with cameras.

                        The ceiling above us was painted by 
                        a world-renowned Italian muralist 
                        and reflects the history of 
                        Oklahoma from pre-Columbian times 
                        to the 1920s.

                                 TOUR GUIDE
                        Now if you look down to your 
                        left...

           Now we’re in a different room. Heads turn, and the camera 
           moves. It’s the STATUE OF LYDIE. It’s intact again. Gleaming 
           white.
                                 TOUR GUIDE (O.S.)
                        The statue of Lydie Marland was 
                        restored last year after it was 
                        found shattered in pieces on the 
                        grounds of the estate. It 
                        originally stood in the formal 
                        gardens, which are today the 
                        parking lot through which you 
                        entered. Legend has it that Mrs. 
                        Marland destroyed the statue 
                        herself, though the more likely 
                        story is that it was damaged in 
                        transit over the years. 
                             (moving toward the door)
                        Now if you’ll follow me outside, 
                        we’ll have a look at the terrace.

           EXT. THE PALACE - DAY

           The Tour Guide leads the group toward the terrace, through 
           the gardens. 

           As the Tour Guide talks about the gardens, a Girl on the 
           tour, 6, wanders off between some bushes, to a bench at the 
           edge of a parking lot, where an OLD WOMAN (80s) is sitting. 

           The old woman, of course, is Lydie.

           The Girl is not precious or cute. She’s reserved and serious.

                                 GIRL
                        Hi.

                                 LYDIE
                        Hi.

           The Girl is eating a Twizzler from a bag. They sit like two 
           men, looking straight ahead, up at the house. After a moment, 
           the Girl volunteers

                                 GIRL
                             (matter-of-fact)
                        A princess used to live here.

                                 LYDIE
                        Is that right?

           The Girl nods. Holds out a Twizzler to Lydie.

                                 LYDIE
                             (taking it)
                        Thank you.
           Then something catches Lydie’s eye. She stares at the bushes, 
           crouches down to the Girl’s level.

                                 LYDIE
                        Look.

           She points. A few feet from them, having emerged from the 
           bushes, is a RED FOX WITH A SILVER TAIL. The red fox stares 
           at Lydie and the Girl, they at it. 

           After a moment, the Red Fox is joined by two fox CUBS, who 
           hide underneath their mother.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Jennifer? Jennifer!

           The Cubs run off and, after another moment, the Red Fox 
           follows them. The Girl smiles at Lydie, Lydie at her. 

                                 GIRL
                        Bye.

                                 LYDIE
                        Bye.

           The Girl runs off. Lydie stays sitting for a moment. Then she 
           stands up and walks away, slowly, toward a small house on the 
           property.

           We pull out to a wide shot of the parking lot and garden, so 
           that Lydie is a small figure, receding from our view.

           Text appears on the grass:

           Ernest Marland is credited with being decades ahead of his 
           time in his ideas about corporate responsibility and in the   
           benefits and opportunities offered to his employees. 

           The picture starts to fade. 

           Lydie Marland lived in a small house on the grounds of The 
           Palace until she died in 1987. 

           She was buried next to her husband.

           The Palace on the Prairie is today the permanent property of 
           the people of Ponca City, Oklahoma.

           The picture fades, not to black but to white.

                                                               THE END.
