                                                               FIRST DRAFT
                                                                  MAY 2008
           EXT. MEDIEVAL ENGLAND - TWILIGHT

           A crowd of SCREAMING PEASANTS charges over the rolling green 
           hills of sixth-century Britain.

           But just when you start to worry that this is going to be a 
           shitty historical drama, we push in close on one of these 
           moaning peasants to reveal WORMS crawling through the flesh 
           of its reanimated corpse-face.

           Oh, okay, neat.  These marauding farmhands are actually an 
           ARMY OF THE UNDEAD.

                                 ZOMBIE
                        REEARRRGHHHRG!

           SHINK!  Before the zombie can finish that thought, it’s 
           swiftly DECAPITATED by a glistening broadsword.

           This feudal weapon belongs to SIR LANCELOT, a handsome blonde 
           knight in shimmering gold armor riding a majestic white steed 
           as he bravely leads THREE OTHER KNIGHTS into mounted battle 
           against these decomposing monsters.

                                 SIR LANCELOT
                        Ready your blades for blood, my 
                        brothers!  We shant let these 
                        deviled creatures make mock of us!  
                        By my hilt, we will fight until--

           KZZZZAXX.  Without warning, Sir Lancelot is BLASTED with a 
           bolt of mystical purple energy that crackles about his 
           metallic armor before cooking his body to ash.

           Nearby, a dark-haired knight named SIR GALAHAD finishes 
           HALVING a zombie with his sword just in time to watch in 
           horror as his best friend is atomized.

                                 SIR GALAHAD
                        LANCELOT!

           And now we see that the late Lancelot was felled by the 
           zombies’ leader, a devastatingly gorgeous young woman wearing 
           an ornate jeweled CROWN atop her raven-haired head.  This is 
           MORGANA LE FAY.  She is LEVITATING several feet above the 
           battlefield as her hands sparkle with mystic lightning.

                                 MORGANA
                        Dry your eyes, Sir Galahad.  You’ll 
                        be reunited with your fair-haired 
                        squire boy soon enough.

           Galahad confidently holds his ground as he’s FLANKED by two 
           more of his fellow knights, SIR TRISTAN and SIR PERCIVAL.
                                 SIR TRISTAN
                        Nay, Morgana.  Your “coronation” 
                        was a crime against our Lord.  And 
                        like your dread soldiers, we shall 
                        cleave to this side of the dirt 
                        until your reign is ended.

                                 MORGANA
                            (a wicked smile)
                        Your bluster is no match for my 
                        sorcery, children.

                                 SIR PERCIVAL
                        ‘Tis wise we brought a sorcerer of 
                        our own then, aye?

           Morgana hears a high-pitched SCREECH, and turns to see a 
           FALCON flapping its majestic wings as it comes to rest on the 
           arm of the man who’s just MATERIALIZED at Morgana’s back.

                                 MORGANA
                        MERLIN?!

           Yep, we’re looking at the most famous wizard of all time... 
           but for reasons that will become clear later, instead of a 
           gray-maned old man, our Merlin should be portrayed by a 
           younger American comic actor, more JACK BLACK or SETH ROGEN 
           than Sean Connery or Patrick Stewart.

           But for right now, our bearded American actor should be 
           playing this role ABSURDLY STRAIGHT, speaking in his best 
           medieval accent as his badass black cloak whips in the wind.

                                 MERLIN
                        Deus ex mortis!

           With that incantation, Merlin summons a powerful storm that 
           SCATTERS the howling zombies to pieces.

                                 MORGANA
                        Impossible!  I imprisoned you in 
                        the Granite Bands of Fwatoom!

                                 MERLIN
                        Did you truly believe your teacher 
                        could be bested by one of the 
                        spells he taught you?

           Raising his arms, Merlin then fires GLOWING BANDS OF FORCE 
           from the palms of his hands.  These enchanted chains ENTWINE 
           around Morgana’s shapely body, DRAGGING her to the ground.

           As she struggles against her bonds, Morgana SPITS at Merlin 
           with derision.
                                 MORGANA
                        I curse ye, old man!

                                 MERLIN
                        There is little you can do to break 
                        my heart more than you already 
                        have, witch.

                                 MORGANA
                        I curse ye... to be banished from 
                        this empire... should you so much 
                        as set a single toe off its soil.

                                 MERLIN
                            (disappointed)
                        Oh, Morgana.  What makes you think 
                        I would ever leave my beloved 
                        Britain?

           The three surviving knights dismount their horses, draw their 
           weapons, and cautiously approach the writhing Morgana.

                                 MORGANA
                        Get on with it then.  Execute a 
                        helpless woman.

                                 SIR GALAHAD
                        You, my lady, are no woman.  

           Together, the knights then PLUNGE theirs swords deep into 
           Morgana’s heart.  As she screams, her body begins to CHANGE.  
           Merlin and the knights take a few steps back, and watch with 
           amazement as Morgana DISSOLVES into the earth before SPOUTING 
           back up in the form of a fully grown WEEPING WILLOW TREE.

           All that’s left of the sorceress is the ornate CROWN she was 
           wearing.  Merlin picks it up, holds it before his eyes.

                                 MERLIN
                        And now, we must return this crown 
                        to our one true sovereign, the 
                        fount of all our power. 

                                 SIR TRISTAN
                        But what if Morgana returns?

           PUSH IN on the crown in Merlin’s hands.

                                 MERLIN
                        Then other men shall be called to 
                        wage your noble battle.  For so 
                        long as our kingdom has her 
                        knights... darkness will never fall 
                        on England.
           INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE CORRIDOR - MORNING

           We then PULL WIDE from this same crown to reveal that we’re 
           now in the modern-day United Kingdom, where the crown is 
           resting on a velvet pillow in the gloved hands of one of two 
           YEOMEN OF THE GUARD standing watch inside Buckingham Palace.

                                 YEOMEN #1
                        Bloody hell, this thing weighs more 
                        than a Volvo.

                                 YEOMEN #2
                        Yeah, it’s a wonder it don’t snap 
                        the old bird’s neck.

                                 ANOTHER VOICE (O.S.)
                        And it’s a wonder I don’t snap 
                        yours.

           Both men straighten to attention as QUEEN ELIZABETH II enters 
           this hallway, feisty as hell despite being eighty years old.

                                 YEOMEN #2
                            (frightened)
                        Uh-uh-apologies, your majesty.

                                 QUEEN ELIZABETH II
                        Let’s get on with this bullshit, 
                        shall we?

                                 YEOMEN #1
                        Of course, your highness.

           The two men place the crown atop the Queen’s head.

                                 QUEEN ELIZABETH II
                        Who’s up first?

                                 YEOMEN #1
                        Bloke named Simon Mintz, ma’am.

                                 QUEEN ELIZABETH II
                        And what has he done to distinguish 
                        himself from the unwashed masses?

                                 YEOMEN #2
                        Something to do with newts, your 
                        majesty.

           The Queen just stares at him.

                                 YEOMEN #2 (cont’d)
                        It’s kind of like a salamander.
                                 QUEEN ELIZABETH II
                        I know what a sodding newt is, why 
                        does it entitle anyone to 
                        knighthood?

                                 YEOMEN #1
                        He’s a scientist, ma’am.  Made some 
                        kind of big discovery about them.  
                        Newts, that is.  Not scientists.

           The Queen impatiently grabs a nearby SWORD.

                                 QUEEN ELIZABETH II
                        I knighted Churchill, for Christ’s 
                        sake.  And all they bring me now 
                        are wankers...

           INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Introducing the wanker in question: SIMON MINTZ, an affable 
           British dude in his early 30s.  He’s wearing formal attire 
           for probably the first time in his life, and trying his best 
           not to grin like a complete dork as the ceremony commences.

           Simon rises as the orchestra begins to play.  Queen Elizabeth 
           enters the crowded ballroom accompanied by two Gurkha Orderly 
           Officers and the LORD CHAMBERLAIN, who stands to the right of 
           Her Majesty and addresses the assembled audience.  

                                 LORD CHAMBERLAIN
                        To receive the honor of knighthood, 
                        Dr. Simon Mintz, for advancements 
                        in the field of ecology.

           Simon nervously steps forward and nearly TRIPS over the 
           Investiture stool, as he clumsily drops to one knee before a 
           decidedly unimpressed Queen Elizabeth.

           Simon can’t help but FLINCH as Her Majesty calmly raises her 
           sword and WHACKS him on each shoulder.

                                 SIMON
                        Ow?

           Elizabeth rolls her eyes as she reluctantly places a MEDAL OF 
           KNIGHTHOOD around Simon’s neck.

                                 QUEEN ELIZABETH II
                            (flatly)
                        Arise, Sir Simon.

           As everyone APPLAUDS, Simon gets to his feet and holds out 
           his hand for the Queen to shake.  She just stares at him.
                                 SIMON
                        Hm?  Oh, crap, right.  They told me 
                        I’m not supposed to touch you.  I--  

                                 QUEEN ELIZABETH II
                        Sir Simon, what is it you do with 
                        these... newts?

                                 SIMON
                        Thank you for asking, ma’am.  I 
                        study the effect of climate change 
                        on their breeding sites and 
                        terrestrial habitats.  It’s really 
                        quite interesting to see how--

           Ignoring him, the Queen looks out into the audience to see an 
           EMPTY SEAT next to the one where Simon was just sitting.

                                 QUEEN ELIZABETH II
                        Where is your guest?

                                 SIMON
                        My what?  Ah, yes, well.  My 
                        parents passed on a few years back.  
                        Big fans of yours, incidentally.  
                        Like so many of the elderly. 

           More staring.

                                 SIMON (cont’d)
                        And I, uh, suppose you’d think six 
                        months would be enough notice to 
                        find a proper date, but I’ve been 
                        so busy with... email and what have 
                        you that I never--

                                 QUEEN ELIZABETH II
                        Please go away now.

                                 SIMON
                            (relieved)
                        Cheers.

           EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - AFTERNOON

           The ceremony completed, Simon stumbles out into the daylight, 
           proudly inspecting the medal still hanging around his neck.  

           As one of those old-fashioned carriages that only tourists 
           ride clops past, Simon holds up the medal for one of the 
           HORSES to see.  The animal snorts with indifference.     
           But Simon’s still smiling to himself as he approaches the 
           crappy little SCOOTER he parked directly in front of the 
           palace... when he suddenly notices an attractive young FEMALE 
           POLICE OFFICER who appears to be writing him a ticket. 

                                 SIMON
                        Oi!  Lovely Rita!

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                            (not even looking up)
                        I’m not a meter maid, I’m a 
                        constable with the Metropolitan 
                        Police.

                                 SIMON
                        Then why are you writing me a 
                        bloody ticket?

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        I’m not.  I’m taking down your 
                        license number so I can have your 
                        vehicle impounded.

                                 SIMON
                        What?!  Why?

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        You can’t just leave vehicles 
                        unattended in front of Buckingham 
                        Palace.  In case you haven’t 
                        noticed, there’s a War on Terror 
                        going on. 

                                 SIMON
                        I’m not a terrorist, I’m a 
                        Commander of the British Empire!

           The officer chuckles to herself, but Simon holds up his medal 
           in protest for the confused woman to inspect.

                                 SIMON (cont’d)
                        It’s true!  Look!

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        You rode a Vespa to your own 
                        knighting?

                                 SIMON
                        Yeah, well, no one gets into 
                        herpetology for the money.  

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        You’re a doctor of herpes?
                                 SIMON
                        What?  No, it’s the study of 
                        reptiles and...
                            (giving up)
                        Look, if you just let me off with a 
                        warning or whatever, I’d... I’d do 
                        anything to make it up to you.  

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Are you trying to bribe me?

                                 SIMON
                        Ab-absolutely not, I--

           But the bobby SMILES, her cold exterior melting away.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Relax, I’m just taking the piss.  
                        Sure, you could buy me a pint.  
                        Never been on a date with a real 
                        knight before.  If we got married, 
                        that’d make me a lady, yeah?

                                 SIMON
                            (uncomfortable)
                        Married...?

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        A joke, mate.

                                 SIMON
                        Ah.  Brilliant.  
                            (then)
                        Which part?

           She writes down her number on the back of Simon’s ticket.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        I’m off-duty by eight.  Ring me if 
                        Her Majesty ever gives you a night 
                        off.  Name’s Bobbi, by the way.

                                 SIMON
                        Ha!  A bobby named Bobbi?

           BOBBI just glares at him, clearly having heard this joke a 
           hundred thousand times in her career.

                                 SIMON (cont’d)
                        Right.  Well.  I’m Simon.
                            (with a dumb grin)
                        “Sir Simon.”

           As the sky darkens, THUNDER rolls in the distance.
           EXT. ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE - EVENING

           We’re looking at a TREE.

           And if it seems familiar, that’s because it’s the same 
           WEEPING WILLOW from our medieval opening, looking exactly as 
           it did when it first sprung fully formed from the earth.

           As LIGHTNING flashes, we see an overweight CONSTRUCTION 
           WORKER wielding a massive CHAINSAW.  He’s headed right for 
           the tree. 

           Standing in this man’s path is a lone male PROTESTER, a 
           college-age hippie holding a hand-painted sign that reads 
           “SAVE OUR FORREST.”  He’s screaming at the bored worker.

                                 PROTESTER
                        I won’t let you rape Mother Earth 
                        to put up another department store!  
                        You have no right to--

                                 CONSTRUCTION WORKER
                        You misspelled “forest.”

                                 PROTESTER
                        Sorry?

                                 CONSTRUCTION WORKER
                        On your sign.  It’s only spelt with 
                        one R, innit?

                                 PROTESTER
                        Oh.  Are you sure?

                                 CONSTRUCTION WORKER
                            (really thinking hard)
                        ...no.

           The two men, alone in this large field, stare at each other 
           for a long beat.  

           Finally, the construction worker YANKS his chainsaw to life.

                                 PROTESTER
                            (quietly)
                        Right.  Rape away.

           Defeated, the protester steps aside, as the construction 
           promptly CUTS into the weeping willow.  But as the blade 
           sinks deep into the wood, something strange happens.

           A BLINDING BURST OF LIGHT emanates from within the bark, 
           sending a shower of SPARKS flying everywhere.
           The construction worker takes a step back as the felled tree 
           COLLAPSES in a burst of brimstone.  The trunk of the fallen 
           tree is shrouded in smoke, and as the cloud dissipates, we 
           see a FIGURE standing here.  

           It’s MORGANA.  She’s naked, her naughty bits obscured by the 
           swirling mist.

                                 MORGANA
                        At last.
                            (looking at the two men)
                        Which of you is responsible for my 
                        emancipation?

           The protester sheepishly points to the construction worker.

                                 PROTESTER
                        Um, he broke your tree, ma’am.  I 
                        tried to stop him.

                                 MORGANA
                        Your honesty is commendable.

           Without warning, Morgana reaches forward and SNAPS the 
           protester’s neck.  His lifeless body crumbles to the ground.

                                 CONSTRUCTION WORKER
                            (horrified)
                        You... you killed him.

                                 MORGANA
                        Most astute, slave.  Now remove his 
                        vestments and give them to me.

           But instead of helping this woman, the construction worker 
           DROPS his chainsaw and wisely RUNS AWAY.  

           Morgana holds out her right hand... but rather than launching 
           a deadly blast, it just FIZZLES with a few sad little pops.

           As the construction worker continues to huff away at top 
           speed, Morgana nonchalantly picks up the chainsaw, and from 
           about a hundred yards away, HURLS it right into the 
           retreating construction worker’s heart.  

           We’re with a smiling Morgana as she watches him COLLAPSE in 
           the distance.

           Suddenly, Morgana hears a familiar SCREECHING, and looks up 
           to see a FALCON gazing down at her from a nearby tree.  

           Having apparently seen enough, the bird LAUNCHES into the sky 
           and flaps hard for the setting sun in the west.
           Morgana watches as one of its FEATHERS flutters to the 
           ground.  She picks it up, stares at it, and SNEERS.

                                 MORGANA (cont’d)
                        Merlin...

           EXT. HAUNTED CAVE - NIGHT

           Smash cut to this close-up of a WARLOCK, dressed like the 
           magicians of legend.

                                 WARLOCK
                        Hold your ground, knights!  

           We’re outside of a ominous cave in what we can now tell is 
           some kind of VIRTUAL WORLD, animated in the realistic style 
           of an online role-playing game.

           The virtual warlock is leading SEVERAL OTHER CHARACTERS, all 
           of whom are wearing elaborate suits of armor.

                                 WARLOCK (cont’d)
                        I fear a terrible darkness lurks 
                        within this cave!

                                 VIRTUAL KNIGHT #1
                        What tipped you off, cocklord? 

           The virtual knight jerks a thumb at a nearby wooden sign that 
           clearly reads “THE CAVE OF TERRIBLE DARKNESS.”

                                 WARLOCK
                        Which is all the more reason for us 
                        to agree on a comprehensive 
                        strategy before we enter.

                                 VIRTUAL KNIGHT #2
                        Here’s a strategy: let’s run in and 
                        stab guys with our swords.  

                                 WARLOCK
                        But if one of you were injured--

                                 VIRTUAL KNIGHT #3
                        Then you’d use your crappy +2 
                        restoration spell.  Now let’s go!

                                 VIRTUAL KNIGHT #1
                        Yeah, out of the way, Merkin!

           As the knights all race past him and into the cave with their 
           weapons drawn, the warlock FROWNS with quiet disappointment.
                                 WARLOCK
                        Um, actually...

           INT. APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

                                 MERLIN
                        ...it’s Merlin.

           Now in the real world, we reveal that the human being behind 
           this digital avatar is none other than MERLIN, who hasn’t 
           aged a day since we saw him last.  

           As a matter of fact, since he’s shaved his beard and gotten 
           himself some relatively contemporary clothes (old boxers and 
           an Avenged Sevenfold T-shirt), he actually looks even 
           younger.  

           Merlin’s sitting in front of his desktop computer, speaking 
           with a distinctly AMERICAN ACCENT into a little headset.  He 
           works his joystick as he watches the warlock he’s controlling 
           try in vain to save the knights from this suicide mission.

                                 MERLIN (cont’d)
                        Wait!  Don’t all go in at the same 
                        time, retards!  Gimme a second to 
                        work up a defense enchantment!

           But over the computer’s speakers, we can hear the cries of 
           Merlin’s troops being SLAUGHTERED: “Ahh, the eggs keep 
           respawning!  Jesus Christ, they ate Leeroy!  Merkin, you 
           gotta rez us!  MERKIN!”

                                 MERLIN (cont’d)
                            (sighing)
                        Don’t make ‘em like they used to...

           And as we ARM AROUND Merlin, we see a large picture window in 
           the background that looks out on the BROOKLYN BRIDGE.

           Yep, we’re in New York City.

           Merlin takes off his headset just as he hears a POUNDING at 
           his door.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Marvin?  Marvin, open up!

           Merlin gets up and reluctantly shuffles for his front door, 
           which SWINGS OPEN to reveal a 19-year-old FEMALE MODEL 
           wearing nothing but a man’s button-down shirt and a sleep 
           mask bedazzled with the word “SLUT” hiked up above her eyes.
                                 MODEL
                        Dude, what’s it gonna take to get 
                        you to turn down the effin’ video 
                        games?

                                 MERLIN
                        Oh, hey, Crystal.

                                 MODEL
                        It’s Cristal.  Look, my party went 
                        until four in the morning and I 
                        have to be at a night shoot in, 
                        like, six hours.

                                 MERLIN
                            (sarcastic)
                        Yeah, sorry about all the noise.  
                        Hey, how about I play the same 
                        Prodigy song 10,000 times in a row 
                        at top volume?

                                 MODEL
                        I love Prodigy.

                                 MERLIN
                            (flatly)
                        Yes.  I know.

                                 MODEL
                        What are you doing home now, 
                        anyway?  Don’t you have a cubicle 
                        to be in or something?

           Embarrassed, Merlin looks over to a dusty old MAGIC WAND  
           mounted on a wooden frame in a forgotten corner of his pad.

                                 MERLIN
                        I’m... kinda between gigs right 
                        now.

                                 MODEL
                        How the hell can you afford this 
                        place on unemployment?

                                 MERLIN
                        I’ve been here since... a while.  
                        Rent control’s a bitch, huh?

           Suddenly, the model notices something behind Merlin.

                                 MODEL
                        Yeah, so’s the fact that you’re 
                        totally gonna get evicted for 
                        having a pet in this building.
           Merlin looks around, bewildered.

                                 MERLIN
                        What are you talking about?

                                 MODEL
                        That, yo!

           Merlin turns and notices what Cristal just spotted.  Perched 
           on the ledge of his window is the same FALCON that was spying 
           on Morgana.  

           Merlin’s eyes go wide with shock.

                                 MERLIN
                        Princess...?

                                 MODEL
                        What did you--

           But before the young model can say another word, Merlin SLAMS 
           the door shut on her face.  He races to the window and flings 
           it open to let his long-lost pet inside.

                                 MERLIN
                        Princess?  Is that really you?

           The bird screeches in the affirmative.

                                 MERLIN (cont’d)
                        Jesus, I haven’t seen you since the 
                        Reformation.  Is everything...?

           And that’s when it hits him.

                                 MERLIN (cont’d)
                        No.  It’s her, isn’t it?

           Princess just flaps her mighty wings.

                                 MERLIN (cont’d)
                        Why is it that only the assholes 
                        don’t know how to stay dead?

           Princess screeches again, and a suddenly somber Merlin looks 
           up at a faded old Union Jack flag hanging on his wall.

                                 MERLIN (cont’d)
                        Come with you?  I... I can’t go 
                        back there, girl.  You know why.  
                        Besides, other than a few weak-ass 
                        card tricks, I’ve forgotten any 
                        magic worth a damn.
           Ignoring this, the bird flies over to a nearby drawer and 
           uses her beak to pull out a MEDAL identical to the one given 
           to Simon, though this one is badly rusted, an antique.

                                 MERLIN (cont’d)
                        It doesn’t work like that anymore.  
                        Knighthood isn’t earned these days, 
                        it’s just passed around 
                        indiscriminately.  Like genital 
                        warts.  

           Princess angrily flaps her wings.

                                 MERLIN (cont’d)
                        Fine, you want to round up some 
                        fresh lambs for the slaughter, go 
                        nuts.  Just keep me out of it.

           Clearly annoyed, Princess lets out one last screech.

                                 MERLIN (cont’d)
                        Wrong, Princess.  It’s the world 
                        that changed.  I tried to...

           But as he looks around, Merlin discovers that Princess has 
           DISAPPEARED, though he notices something she left behind:

                                 MERLIN (cont’d)
                            (to himself)
                        Aw, son of a... she shit on my 
                        couch.

           EXT. LONDON ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

           Back in England, we’re now tight on another knighthood medal, 
           this one glistening and relatively new.  It’s clutched by 
           thick fingers.  We hear the delightful sound of VOMITING.

           The person holding this medal is RICKY BUTLER, a chubby 
           British everyman in his 40s.  And by everyman, I mean a bit 
           of a drunk, as Ricky further illustrates by again puking his 
           guts out onto the pavement.  He inspects his own throw-up 
           with confusion.

                                 RICKY
                        Cor, when did I eat so many beans?

           Wiping his mouth with the back of his sleeve, Ricky stumbles 
           into a nearby pawn shop.
           INT. LONDON PAWN SHOP - CONTINUOUS

           As the bell attached to the door jingles, the lone SHOPKEEPER 
           inside looks at Ricky with disgust.

                                 SHOPKEEPER
                        We’re closed.

                                 RICKY
                        Hang on, mate.  Got the offer of a 
                        lifetime for you.  

           Ricky places his knighthood medal on the counter, and the 
           shopkeeper immediately pulls out a jeweler’s loupe.

                                 SHOPKEEPER
                        This real?

                                 RICKY
                        ‘Course it is.

                                 SHOPKEEPER
                        Where’d you steal it from?

                                 RICKY
                        I didn’t!  Look, I’m Ricky Butler. 
                            (a beat)
                        Sir Ricky?
                            (another beat)
                        The Olympic athlete?

                                 SHOPKEEPER
                        Which Olympics?  Special?

                                 RICKY
                        You serious?  Track and field.  I 
                        was the best bloody pole vaulter in 
                        the world!

           And now the shopkeeper doesn’t even bother stifling it, 
           crushing poor Ricky.

                                 RICKY (cont’d)
                        Laugh it up, but before I blew out 
                        my knee, I won three gold medals.

                                 SHOPKEEPER
                            (still skeptical)
                        Then why aren’t you trying to hock 
                        those?

           Ricky hangs his head a bit.
                                 RICKY
                        I... already did.

           Ouch.  Depressing.

                                 SHOPKEEPER
                        Go home, friend.  Sober up.

                                 RICKY
                        But I need the--

                                 SHOPKEEPER
                            (serious now)
                        Before I ring the police.

           Weighing his options, Ricky ultimately picks up his medal and 
           STORMS out of the store.

           EXT. PAWN SHOP - CONTINUOUS

           Outside, a pissed-off Ricky digs into his pockets and finds a 
           single five pound note.  He looks around, spots a pub still 
           open across the street, and is about to head for it, when...

           He see Princess, Merlin’s falcon, perched on a nearby trash 
           bin.  The bird is glaring at Ricky.

                                 RICKY
                        The hell you looking at?

           But the falcon’s eyes begin to GLOW ever so slightly, and--
           FWASH!--Ricky DISAPPEARS in a burst of brimstone.

           Princess watches Ricky’s five pound note flutter to the 
           ground, before the bird lifts off once more into the sky.

           INT. EXECUTIVE OFFICE - NIGHT

           Elsewhere in London, we’re close on another of one of those 
           medals of knighthood, this one mounted on the wall behind a 
           golden frame.

           We track along this wall to see several other awards, as well 
           as photographs of a devastatingly handsome businessman (who 
           happens to be black) shaking hands with politicians and 
           captains of industry: Tony Blair, Richard Branson, etc.  

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Frightfully sorry to have to bother 
                        you, Sir Edmund.  I’m afraid we 
                        have a bit of a situation.
           Finally, we land on the black businessman from the photos.  
           This is SIR EDMUND WORTHINGHAM.  Unlike the jovial man in the 
           pictures, Edmund is SCOWLING at us with simmering rage. 

                                 EDMUND
                        Who do I get to sack?

           Widen to reveal that we’re inside of an opulent penthouse 
           office, where Edmund is speaking to his attractive Asian 
           EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT from behind a massive oak desk.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Brittles in receiving.  He made a 
                        rather regrettable overage while 
                        ordering live lobsters.

                                 EDMUND
                        How regrettable?

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Twenty thousand extra, Sir Edmund.  

                                 EDMUND
                            (leaping out of his chair)
                        Good Christ, this is a supermarket 
                        chain not a goddamn marine 
                        preserve!

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Perhaps we could donate the 
                        leftovers to a local food bank?  

                                 EDMUND
                        A food bank?  Ms. Nakamori, do you 
                        have any idea how old I was when I 
                        ate lobster for the first time?

           The assistant just hangs her head.  She’s heard this shit a 
           million times.

                                 EDMUND (cont’d)
                        Twenty-five, and I’d just made my 
                        first million pounds after working 
                        my way up from nothing.  

           Edmund removes a Cuban cigar from his golden humidor.

                                 EDMUND (cont’d)
                        Delicacies should be earned, not 
                        doled out to the wastrels who can’t 
                        even afford to shop in my stores.
                            (lighting his cigar)
                        Have whatever we can’t sell donated 
                        to area dog shelters.
                                 ASSISTANT
                        Er, do dogs even eat lobster, Sir 
                        Edmund?

           Edmund opens the door to a magnificent balcony overlooking 
           London.

                                 EDMUND
                        They do tonight.

           Stepping outside to be alone, Edmund takes a puff off his 
           cigar and surveys the city.  He watches with interest as 
           Merlin’s falcon circles above him before LANDING on the 
           balcony railing.  Edmund grins at this beautiful creature.

                                 EDMUND (cont’d)
                        If you’re looking for rats, you 
                        came to the right town.

           But once again, the falcon’s eyes begin to GLOW and--FWASH!--
           Edmund instantly DISAPPEARS in a puff of brimstone.

           INT. SALOON - NIGHT

           And we smash cut to a different burst of smoke, but as this 
           cloud begins to dissipate, we see that we’re now inside of an 
           Old West Saloon, which is currently ON FIRE.

           We then find DAISY, a gorgeous young female gunslinger, who’s 
           bound by heavy rope to a wooden chair.  

                                 DAISY
                        You’re finished, Coop.

           Widen to reveal that Daisy’s being held hostage by COOPER, a 
           nefarious-looking outlaw wearing, of course, a black hat.

                                 COOPER
                        Well, ain’t that the proverbial pot 
                        and kettle.  And I’d say yours is 
                        about ready to boil.

                                 ANOTHER VOICE (O.S.)
                        Please, that girl couldn’t work a 
                        stove to save her life.

           Startled, Cooper SPINS to find a figure silhouetted by the 
           flames.  As he cuts through the smoke, we can see that this 
           figure is another cowboy, a distinguished older man.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                            (perfect American accent)
                        Howdy, Daisy.
           Holy shit, it’s MICHAEL CAINE.  

           Yes, THE Michael Caine, legend of stage and screen.  

           (And sure, while we could always fill out our Roundtable with 
           Sir Anthony Hopkins or Sir Ian McKellen or Sir Ben Kingsley 
           or any other venerable actor of their ilk... seriously, is 
           anyone cooler than Michael Caine?)

                                 DAISY
                        SHERIFF!

           Anyway, here’s Michael Caine, and he’s reaching for his SIX-
           SHOOTER.  He gives Daisy a reassuring wink before turning his 
           attention to Cooper:

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        What’s it gonna be, Cooper?  You 
                        can reach for the sky and leave in 
                        irons or slap leather and go out in 
                        a box. 

           Cooper starts reaching for HIS gun.

                                 COOPER
                        You passed your prime when they was 
                        signing the Constitution, old-
                        timer.  You’re as good as--

           BANG BANG BANG.  

           The second Cooper touches his own weapon, Michael Caine 
           DRAWS, COCKS and FIRES three slugs into the outlaw’s chest, 
           killing him instantly.

           As the saloon continues to burn, Michael pulls out a Bowie 
           knife, which he uses to SLICE Daisy free from her ropes.

                                 DAISY
                        Took your sweet time.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        Trust me, kid, nothing sweet about 
                        time.

           And as the conflagration rages on behind them, Daisy grabs 
           Michael Caine and KISSES HIM deeply, madly, passionately.

                                 DIRECTOR (O.S.)
                        Cut!  Beautiful!  Weapons up, 
                        please!

           Widen to reveal that we are, naturally, inside of a 
           SOUNDSTAGE inside London’s Shepperton Studios.
           Michael smiles at his fellow actors as a stunt coordinator 
           rushes over to take the sidearm from him.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                            (his usual semi-cockney)
                        Let’s hope editing will help with 
                        that, eh?  I can barely draw a bath 
                        these days much less a bloody 
                        pistol.  

           Various CREW MEMBERS rush about, helping the actor playing 
           Cooper to his feet, etc.

                                 ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
                        And that’s a wrap for Sir Michael 
                        Caine!

           Everyone applauds wildly, as “Daisy” pulls Michael aside.

                                 DAISY
                        Was that all right, Michael?

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        You were brilliant, pet.  First 
                        rate.  See a very long career for 
                        you.  

                                 DAISY
                        You think?  I don’t know.  I still 
                        have to do my monologue tomorrow.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        Two words, my dear: Don’t blink.  
                        Remember, your eyes are going to be 
                        eight feet tall up on that screen, 
                        and blinking just makes your 
                        character seem weak.  

           Daisy flirtatiously rubs Michael's arm.

                                 DAISY
                        “Don’t blink.”  God, that’s so 
                        genius.  Hey, do you maybe want to 
                        help me run lines for a bit?  
                            (a beat)
                        In my trailer?

           Michael smiles politely, but ultimately pulls himself away.  
           He starts walking backwards, retreating to his own trailer.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        I’d love to.  Really.  But, I 
                        should go.  Go call my wife.
                                 DAISY
                        Oh.  Sure.  

           She gives a disappointed little wave before turning to leave.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                            (quietly, to himself)
                        And then I have to take a very cold 
                        shower.
                            (watching Daisy saunter 
                             away)
                        And then kill myself.

           INT. MICHAEL CAINE’S TRAILER - CONTINUOUS

           Stepping into his spacious trailer, Michael starts to change 
           into his civilian duds when he notices something on his make-
           up table.

           It’s our falcon.  But instead of freaking out, Michael defies 
           expectations by just STARING at the bird.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        So.  This is some kind of juvenile 
                        prank, is it?  

           The falcon look back as we continue this blinkless staring 
           contest for another beat.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE (cont’d)
                        Who put you up to this?  Was is 
                        that shit Roger Moore?

           Obviously, the falcon says nothing.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE (cont’d)
                        Look, friend, this is all very 
                        funny, but I don’t work with 
                        animals, so let’s--   

           And just like last time, the falcon’s eyes begin to GLOW ever 
           so slightly, when--FWASH!--Sir Michael Caine DISAPPEARS.

           INT. SIMON’S FLAT - NIGHT

           Elsewhere that same evening, we rejoin the freshly dubbed Sir 
           Simon, as he walks into the low-tech lab inside his modest 
           flat, which is crowded with eerily glowing AQUARIUMS holding 
           various newts, salamanders and lizards. 

           Simon removes his knighthood medal and drapes it next to one 
           of his tanks.  Oh well, back to work.
           But as he makes a move for his microscope, Simon remembers 
           what’s in his pocket.  He pulls out the sheet of paper that 
           Bobbi wrote her cell number on.

           He stares at it for a beat, considers picking up the phone... 
           but then thinks better of it.  He CRUMPLES the piece of paper 
           and tosses it aside.  What a pussy.

           He walks to his small kitchen, opens the pantry... and finds 
           the falcon perched just inches from his face.  

                                 SIMON
                            (terrified)
                        JESUS AND MARY CHAIN!

           The bird barely ruffles her feathers, but Simon FREAKS OUT.

                                 SIMON (cont’d)
                        There’s a huge bird of bloody prey 
                        in my flat!  Help me!  Somebody 
                        help--

           But before he can say another word, the falcon’s eyes begin 
           to GLOW, when, you guessed it--FWASH!--Simon is the last of 
           our Roundtable to DISAPPEAR in a puff of brimstone.

           EXT. BROOKLYN ROOFTOP - DAY

           Smash cut to elsewhere, as Simon continues his cowardly 
           screaming...

                                 SIMON
                        --meeeee!

           ...but then looks around to see that he’s apparently been 
           MAGICALLY TRANSPORTED to the roof of a Brooklyn apartment.  
           It’s still daytime in the States because of the time 
           difference, so we can see the sun looming over the Manhattan 
           skyline in the distance.

           Widen to reveal that Simon is joined on this rooftop by an 
           equally disoriented Edmund, Ricky and Michael Caine.  The 
           four men stare at each other with disbelief.

                                 SIMON (cont’d)
                            (trying to act cool)
                        Right.  What’s this then?

                                 RICKY
                        Who the hell are you people?

                                 EDMUND
                        Who are you?
                                 RICKY
                        Asked you first.

                                 EDMUND
                        Who does it look like?  I’m Sir 
                        Edmund bloody Worthingham.  Of 
                        Worthingham Markets?

                                 RICKY
                        Don’t get all high and mighty with 
                        me.  I’m a sir, too.      

                                 SIMON
                        Ooh, me, too!  
                            (to Ricky)
                        Are we supposed to cross swords or 
                        something?

                                 RICKY
                        Afraid I’m hetero all the way, 
                        mate.

           Edmund squints at Michael Caine.

                                 EDMUND
                        Hold on.  Aren’t you...?

                                 RICKY
                        Wait, don’t tell me!  You’re the 
                        bloke from Jaws 3-D!

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        Sorry?

                                 SIMON
                        Actually, I think he was in the 
                        fourth Jaws, wasn’t he?

                                 RICKY
                        Right you are.  
                            (a beat)
                        Wait, which one was Jaws 3-D?

                                 SIMON
                        The one in 3-D.

                                 RICKY
                        Ah.  So what the hell was Jaws 4?

                                 EDMUND
                            (suddenly engaged)
                        Jaws Strikes Back, maybe?  
                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        I was in other pictures than bloody 
                        Jaws, you know!  Alfie?  The 
                        Italian Job?     

           The men just stare at him blankly.  

                                 MICHAEL CAINE (cont’d)
                            (sighing)
                        Batman?

                                 SIMON
                        Hold on, you’re Michael Keaton?

                                 RICKY
                            (an aside)
                        The years have not been kind.

                                 MERLIN (O.S.)
                        I thought I told you to leave me 
                        out of this!

           The men turn to see Merlin, still dressed in his “civilian” 
           attire and eating a Hot Pocket.  He has his falcon Princess 
           on his arm.

                                 MERLIN (cont’d)
                        And you’ve gotta be shitting me 
                        with this crew.  They’re giving 
                        away knighthoods like Halloween 
                        candy and these are the four best 
                        you could come up with?

                                 RICKY
                        Hey, that’s the bird what kidnapped 
                        me with its eyes!

                                 MERLIN
                        Her name is Princess.  
                            (pause for effect)
                        And mine... is Merlin.

           The knights just shrug.  Who?

                                 MERLIN (cont’d)
                        Immortal advisor to the Roundtable?  
                        Sworn mystical defender of Britain?

                                 RICKY
                        You expect us to believe you’re 
                        some kind of wizard? 
                                 MERLIN
                        And you expect me to believe you 
                        people are knights?  I figured 
                        Princess might grab a couple of 
                        senile World War II vets, maybe an 
                        especially brave crossing guard.  
                        Not a washed-up athlete...

                                 RICKY
                        Hey!

                                 MERLIN
                        ...a pampered millionaire...

                                 EDMUND
                        Billionaire, actually.

                                 MERLIN
                        ...the guy from the Muppet 
                        Christmas Carol...

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        Has no one seen The Man Who Would 
                        Be King?

                                 MERLIN
                        ...and a second-rate lab geek.

                                 SIMON
                            (cheery)
                        Hello!

                                 MERLIN
                            (to his bird)
                        If you were just looking for 
                        novelty acts, you could have at 
                        least dug up a decent soccer 
                        player.

                                 RICKY
                        “Soccer?”  It’s called football, 
                        you Yank bastard.

                                 EDMUND
                        Yes, I thought “Merlin” was a 
                        proper Englishman.

                                 MERLIN
                        I am.  Was. 

           A wistful Merlin looks off at the Manhattan skyline.
                                 MERLIN (cont’d)
                        See, when the British Empire 
                        started setting up shop on this 
                        side of the pond, I figured I’d 
                        jump on a ship and check her out 
                        for myself.  I mean, the colonials 
                        could barely bathe themselves, who 
                        knew they were gonna sign a 
                        friggin’ Declaration of 
                        Independence?  

           Princess whines.

                                 MERLIN (cont’d)
                        Anyway, the second this stopped 
                        being British soil, I was trapped 
                        in the States forever, all ‘cause 
                        of her stupid curse.

                                 SIMON
                        Back up.  Whose curse?

                                 MERLIN
                        Morgana.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        The kissing bandit?

                                 SIMON
                        Who?

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        Blonde girl.  Used to run out onto 
                        the field to kiss baseball players.  
                        Tremendous knockers.  

                                 MERLIN
                        I’m talking about Morgana le Fay.  
                        Wicked stepsister of King Arthur?  
                        Ruler of the Dark Fairy Goblins?

                                 RICKY
                            (confused)
                        And she plays baseball?

                                 MERLIN
                        Look, Morgana nearly destroyed our 
                        kingdom back in the day, and now 
                        she wants to finish the job.

           Merlin finishes the last of his Hot Pocket.
                                 MERLIN (cont’d)
                        Only a true knight can defeat her, 
                        so unfortunately for humanity, a 
                        new Roundtable is all that stands 
                        between us and, you know... 
                        complete annihilation.

                                 EDMUND
                        Ridiculous.  I’m having a bad 
                        dream.  

                                 MERLIN
                        We all are.  And unless somebody 
                        stops her...

           Merlin WAVES his left arm with a dramatic gesture.

                                 MERLIN (cont’d)
                        ...this is what we’ll wake up to.

           Nothing happens.  The knights look at Merlin with confusion.

                                 MERLIN (cont’d)
                        Oop.  Sorry.  Been a while.

           Now Merlin waves his RIGHT arm, and suddenly, the men are 
           standing in the middle of London, but this version of their 
           hometown is completely POSTAPOCALYPTIC.  

           Every building has been badly burned, familiar landmarks like 
           Big Ben have been knocked to the ground.  Even Buckingham 
           Palace is nothing but rubble.

                                 MERLIN (cont’d)
                        She’ll start with Jolly Olde 
                        England, move on to the new world 
                        after that.

           All four of the knights look completely horrified.  Having 
           proved his point, Merlin SNAPS his fingers, returning the men 
           to present-day Brooklyn.

                                 MERLIN (cont’d)
                        So anyway, we’re pretty much boned.

           But Princess screeches a correction.

                                 MERLIN (cont’d)
                        Yeah yeah, fine... technically, 
                        it’ll take time for Morgana to 
                        reach her full strength, so I guess 
                        there’s some minute chance she 
                        could still be defeated.
                                 SIMON
                        Hold on.  You want... us to save 
                        the world?

           Merlin surveys his would-be troops.  And as he looks into his 
           countrymen’s eyes, his confidence actually begins to build.

                                 MERLIN
                        Listen, I don’t know why Princess 
                        chose you four... but she’s got a 
                        pretty good nose for this kinda 
                        thing.  Maybe she came to you guys 
                        for a reason.  
                            (then, self-assured)
                        Came to us.  

           As the music swells, Merlin continues his pep talk.

                                 MERLIN (cont’d)
                        I’d be lying if I told you this 
                        wasn’t going to be insanely 
                        dangerous.  In all likelihood, 
                        you’re gonna die in a horrible, 
                        painful way, so if any of you want 
                        to back out, speak up now, before--

                                 EDMUND
                        I’m out.

                                 MERLIN
                        Wait, what?

                                 EDMUND
                        I want nothing more to do with this 
                        rubbish.  I’m out.

                                 MERLIN
                        Um, okay.  I suppose I can’t force 
                        you to join, but in two thousand 
                        years, every single knight who’s 
                        heard the call has--

                                 EDMUND
                        Let me out of this bloody 
                        nightmare.  Now.

                                 MERLIN
                            (sighing)
                        Sure.  But if you change your mind, 
                        all you need to do is say my name.

                                 EDMUND
                        I won’t.
           And with that, Edmund VANISHES.

           The three remaining knights look at each other, unsure what 
           to do now.  Eventually, Michael Caine turns to Merlin.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        Sorry, friend.  I’m with him.  The 
                        special effects were very 
                        impressive, but if you want to 
                        pitch me on a project, best to go 
                        through my representation.

                                 MERLIN
                        What?  This isn’t a movie!  It’s--

           But Michael Caine has already VANISHED.  Now it’s Ricky’s 
           turn to address the increasingly crestfallen Merlin.

                                 RICKY
                        If there really is some ancient 
                        evil drag queen coming to nuke 
                        London, you should call in 007.  
                        All you got here is a bunch of 
                        zeroes.    

           And with that, Ricky VANISHES.

           Simon shuffles his feet awkwardly.

                                 SIMON
                        Table for one, eh?

                                 MERLIN
                        Oh, just leave already.

                                 SIMON
                        And do what?

           Merlin looks off at the darkening horizon.

                                 MERLIN
                        With twenty-four hours to live?  
                        Don’t waste your time visiting New 
                        England.  Trust me, it’s nothing 
                        like the real thing.     

           And Simon disappears, leaving Merlin more alone than ever.

                                 MERLIN (cont’d)
                            (sadly, to himself)
                        Their chowder looks like whale 
                        jizz.
           INT. EDMUND’S PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT

           We’re close on Sir Edmund as his eyes SPRING OPEN.  He looks 
           around to find that he’s in his own bed inside his tastefully 
           decorated penthouse bedroom.

           Shaking off the strange “dream” he just had, he spots a 
           bottle of prescription sleeping pills next to his bed.  
           Edmund takes one look at the label, then promptly tosses the 
           whole bottle into the trash.

           He walks over to a small bar, pulls himself a ridiculously 
           expensive glass of Scotch, and nurses it at he looks out his 
           window at London far below.

           INT. RICKY’S SHITTY FLAT - NIGHT

           Ricky is fast asleep face-down in a puddle of his own drool, 
           as he awakens from what he hopes is just a drunken stupor.  
           He looks over at the other side of his bed, is a little 
           heartbroken to see that he’s once again alone.  He starts to 
           climb out, when--

                                 RICKY
                        FuhOW!

           --he steps on something in his cluttered apartment, looks 
           down to see that it’s a child’s Super Soaker-style WATER GUN.

           Ricky holds it in his hands for a beat before finally picking 
           up a nearby phone.  We can hear the groggy voice of a middle-
           aged WOMAN on the other line:

                                 WOMAN (FROM PHONE)
                        Do you have any idea what time it 
                        is?

                                 RICKY
                        Jess?  Jess, it’s me.  Look, I just 
                        wanted to make sure the boys 
                        were... you know.  Are they okay?

                                 WOMAN (FROM PHONE)
                        You can’t see them, Ricky.  You had 
                        your shot at joint custody and you 
                        pissed it away.

                                 RICKY
                        I know.  Jess, please, you should 
                        take the boys and... and get out of 
                        here.  Go to your folks’ place.
                                 WOMAN (FROM PHONE)
                        In Italy?  What the hell is this 
                        all about?

                                 RICKY
                        I had a dream.  More than a dream, 
                        really, it was like a... a vision.  
                        Michael Keaton was there and I--

                                 WOMAN (FROM PHONE)
                        Jesus, Ricky, get some help.  

           The line goes silent.  A frustrated Ricky THROWS his phone 
           against the wall... but rather than predictably breaking, it 
           BOUNCES off of the wall and hits Ricky in the face.

           What can he do but sigh?

           INT. CAINE MANOR - NIGHT

           Elsewhere in England, Michael Caine wakes up next to his 
           still-sleeping WIFE.  He stares up at the ceiling for a bit, 
           trying to digest what just happened.  

           He then tiptoes over to a nearby TROPHY CASE inside of his 
           large bedroom.  On its shelves are his Academy Awards for 
           Hannah and Her Sisters and Cider House Rules, his Golden 
           Globe for Educating Rita, etc.

           But at the very bottom of this display case, there’s a small 
           drawer that Michael quietly slides open.  Inside is a case 
           lined with black velvet, and he flips it open to reveal his 
           MEDAL OF KNIGHTHOOD.  

           Michael runs his thumb over the medallion, feeling GUILTY...

           INT. SIMON’S FLAT - NIGHT

           Last but not least, Simon awakens to find that he apparently 
           fell asleep at his computer, the imprint of his keyboard 
           still indented into his face.

           He yawns, stretches and then--POW--the memories of what 
           Merlin just showed him come flooding back.  

           With the wizard’s parting words likely replaying in his head, 
           Simon looks around for the crumpled TRAFFIC TICKET he tossed 
           aside earlier.

           He unfolds it and stares down at the number written on it.  
           Then he looks at his phone.  Decisions, decisions...
           EXT. ANOTHER APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Elsewhere, a door opens to reveal BOBBI, the female constable 
           we met earlier.  Out of her uniform, the sleepy woman is now 
           dressed in her pajamas and dorky eyeglasses.  

           She looks at us with disbelief, as we reveal that Simon is 
           standing on her stoop, having made the bizarre decision to 
           show up in person.

                                 SIMON
                        Hello, Bobbi.

                                 BOBBI
                        Simon?

                                 SIMON
                        You remember my name, great!  I 
                        wasn’t sure, ‘cause--  

                                 BOBBI
                        What the hell are you doing here?

                                 SIMON
                        I tried ringing you, but there was 
                        no answer.

                                 BOBBI
                        That’s because it’s two in the 
                        bloody morning.  How on earth did 
                        you find out where I lived, anyway?

                                 SIMON
                            (proudly)
                        Reverse directory.  Touch of my own 
                        police work.  I actually live up 
                        the hill, on Larrabee?  Could 
                        probably look right into your place 
                        with my ol’ binocs. I...

           Simon suddenly realizes how insane this was.

                                 SIMON (cont’d)
                        Right.  This was a bit creepy, 
                        wasn’t it?

                                 BOBBI
                        A bit and a half, yeah.

                                 SIMON
                        I’m so sorry, Bobbi.  I swear I 
                        didn’t come here for a quick shag.  
                        I mean, not that I don’t think 
                        you’re extraordinarily attractive-- 
           More glaring.

                                 SIMON (cont’d)
                        Yes, well, today has been just 
                        about the strangest day of my life, 
                        and I... I don’t really have anyone 
                        else to talk with, so I was kind of 
                        wondering if you would... if you 
                        wouldn’t mind terribly taking a 
                        walk with me.

           Bobbi looks at him for what feels like an eternity; finally:

                                 BOBBI
                        Let me grab my coat.

                                 SIMON
                            (beaming)
                        Brilliant.

                                 BOBBI
                        But I don’t have all night.  Got a 
                        long day ahead of me tomorrow.

           But Simon suddenly seems a little worried.

                                 SIMON
                        Let’s hope...

           EXT. PUB - LATE NIGHT

           We’re back with MORGANA, who’s now wearing the ill-fitting 
           clothes that she removed from the logging protester.  Her 
           eyes narrow as she watches something with intense interest.

           Four soccer (sorry, football) HOOLIGANS with shaved heads are 
           drunk off their asses, TRASHING the hell out of a car parked 
           on the side of the road.  The apparent leader of this group 
           is hitting the hood of the car with a lead pipe, while the 
           other three kick in its windows with their jackboots.  

                                 HOOLIGAN #1
                        Heh.

                                 HOOLIGAN #2
                        Yeah.  Heh!

                                 HOOLIGAN #3
                        Stupid car.

                                 HOOLIGAN #4
                        I wish this car had a face so I 
                        could kick its face in.
           Morgana approaches this gang.

                                 MORGANA
                        Good to see that ogres still roam 
                        the earth.

           The hooligans gradually stop pounding on the car and turn 
           their attention to this disarmingly beautiful woman.

                                 HOOLIGAN #1
                        What’d you say, whore?

                                 MORGANA
                        Oh yes, you four will do nicely.

                                 HOOLIGAN #2
                        Who wants to take her first?

                                 HOOLIGAN #3
                        I don’t care, long as I don’t gotta 
                        go last.

           Morgana ignores this; instead waves her hand with a subtle 
           “sod off” gesture.

                                 MORGANA
                        Come as you are.

           With that, the four hooligans begin to CHANGE, writhing in 
           pain as they rip through their football jerseys and transform 
           into hulking, mythical OGRES.  The lead hooligan's crowbar 
           even takes the shape of a massive CLUB studded with spikes.

                                 OGRE #1
                        Rrrrrr.

           The monstrous ogres all get down on bended knee before their 
           master as they await her orders.  

           Morgana then produces the FEATHER she retrieved from 
           Princess, holding it up for her new servants to behold.

                                 MORGANA
                        Merlin will have likely already 
                        dispatched his flying rodent to 
                        find a new band of merry minions.  
                        I want you four to use the bird’s 
                        stench to track down his 
                        recruits... and see what they’re 
                        made of. 

           Through rows of razor-sharp teeth, the ogres all SMILE.
           EXT. HYDE PARK - LATE NIGHT 

           Bobbi (no longer in her dorky glasses) and Simon are now 
           walking through London’s decidedly creepy Hyde Park, 
           populated by various SKETCHY CHARACTERS.  

           Simon looks nervous.

                                 SIMON
                        You really walk this way every 
                        night? You’re a braver soul than I.

                                 BOBBI
                        I do have a badge, Simon.

                                 SIMON
                        Yeah, well, until they start 
                        letting your lot have guns, I’d 
                        take the long way home.

                                 BOBBI
                        Duly noted, mother.

           Simon smiles, but only for a moment.

                                 SIMON
                        Can I ask you something?  When you 
                        decided to join the force, was it 
                        like... a calling?

                                 BOBBI
                        Yeah, a calling to quit my job at 
                        the chip shack so I could make more 
                        than twenty grand a year.

                                 SIMON
                        But didn’t you want to, I don’t 
                        know, help people?

                                 BOBBI
                        I suppose.  
                            (then; matter of fact)
                        I was working the day those 
                        bastards set off bombs in the Tube.  
                        Had to go down through the smoke 
                        and flames to pull folks to safety.

           Simon is significantly impressed.

                                 SIMON
                        Bloody hell.  But I guess that’s 
                        all just another day at the office 
                        for you?
                                 BOBBI
                        Oh, bollocks.  When they were 
                        interviewed, every guy I work with 
                        spat out that old cliche about 
                        “just doing my job.”  Screw that!  
                        I put my ass on the line for 
                        complete strangers.  They should 
                        throw me a giant bloody parade.

           And now Simon and Bobbi both smile as they exit the park...

                                 SIMON
                        Seriously, I don’t know how you do 
                        it.

                                 BOBBI
                        Come on, your job’s important, too.  
                        What about all that environmental 
                        stuff you were telling me about?  
                        You work could help the whole 
                        planet.

                                 SIMON
                        If it does, it’ll be a happy 
                        accident.  I didn’t set out to save 
                        the world.  I just like newts.

           Bobbi stops in her tracks, arches an eyebrow at him.

                                 SIMON (cont’d)
                        They’re kind of like salamanders!  
                        Only... friendlier.  They have this 
                        really lovely courtship behavior 
                        before they start mating and--

                                 BOBBI
                        Simon?

                                 SIMON
                        Yeah?

                                 BOBBI
                        Here we are then.

           Bobbi thumbs over at her house, which we can now see the duo 
           has finally made their way back to.  Simon’s embarrassed.

                                 SIMON
                        Right.  Sorry.  Um, thanks for 
                        tonight.  It was perfect, really.  
                        Just what I needed to hear.    

           But Bobbi actually looks a little hurt that this cute guy 
           isn’t being more assertive by maybe inviting himself in.
                                 BOBBI
                        Oh.  Okay.  Well, good night then?

                                 SIMON
                        Yeah.  Good night.

           Simon goes to kiss her on the cheek and Bobbi goes for lips--

           THUNK!  And he ends up kissing her smack on the EYE.

                                 BOBBI
                            (in pain)
                        My eye!

                                 SIMON
                        Oh, hell.  I’m so... I didn’t--

                                 BOBBI
                        No, no, perfectly all right.  
                            (blinking)
                        Think I lost a contact.

           Simon begins to search the ground madly.

                                 BOBBI (cont’d)
                        No worries.  Disposable.  I have a 
                        ton.  Good night?

                                 SIMON
                        Sure.  Good enough.

           They chuckle nervously, as Simon then watches Bobbi step 
           inside and close the door behind her.  

                                 SIMON (cont’d)
                            (under his breath)
                        Imbecile.

           As he rounds the corner and starts heading down another 
           street back home, Simon continues to beat himself up.

                                 SIMON (cont’d)
                        “I like newts?”  Seriously?  Well, 
                        what was I supposed to tell her?  
                        That I’ve been hallucinating magic 
                        birds?  I’m such a--

           Kroom.  KROOM.  Hearing the sound of heavy footsteps behind 
           him, Simon slowly turns around, only to be greeted by--

                                 OGRE #1
                        ROOOOOAAAAARRRR!
           --the LEAD OGRE, who holds his massive club above his head as 
           he roars right in Simon’s face.

           At first, Simon has no reaction at all.  He’s literally 
           FROZEN with terror.  Eventually, a single tear rolls down his 
           cheek.

                                 SIMON
                            (barely audible)
                        I’ve shat myself.

           At the last second, Simon DUCKS just as the ogre SWINGS his 
           heavy club right into a parked car, whose windows all SHATTER 
           on impact.

           INT. CAINE MANOR KITCHEN - LATE NIGHT 

           Michael Caine, now wearing a robe, is nursing a cup of tea in 
           his kitchen.  In the distance, he hears what sounds like a 
           car being totalled.  

           The hell...?

           EXT. CAINE MANOR GARDEN - LATE NIGHT 

           Stepping outside in his slippers, Michael cautiously enters 
           his quaint garden.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        Is someone there?

           Hearing a branch snap nearby, he picks up a GARDENING HOE.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE (cont’d)
                            (lying)
                        I’ve got a shotgun at the ready, 
                        friend, so you’re better off 
                        robbing the neighbors.

           Just then, OGRE #2 comes RIPPING through one of Caine’s big 
           topiary bushes.

           Without missing a beat, Michael WHACKS the big creature in 
           the face with his hoe, which sadly SPLINTERS to pieces on 
           impact.  

           The monster GROWLS with annoyance.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE (cont’d)
                        Well.  That’s unpleasant.
           INT. RICKY’S SHITTY FLAT - LATE NIGHT 

           We’re close on a terrified Ricky, looking straight out of 
           Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein.

                                 RICKY
                            (like a small girl)
                        AIEEEEEEEE!

           Widen to reveal that he, too, has been confronted by one of 
           Morgana’s henchmen.  OGRE #3 has RIPPED through Ricky’s front 
           door and is menacingly looming over him here.

           INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT 

           And now we revisit Sir Edmund, who’s changed into comfortable 
           attire.  He’s just nonchalantly holding his drink as he 
           listens to what sounds like a FREIGHT TRAIN barrelling 
           through the walls of his apartment building.  

           When OGRE #4 finally comes CRASHING through his bedroom wall, 
           Edmund just finishes his Scotch and SIGHS.

                                 EDMUND
                        Merlin.

           And as he says the wizard’s name, a GLOWING PORTAL instantly 
           materializes behind Sir Edmund.  As the ogre CHARGES at him, 
           Edmund reluctantly DIVES into this hole in space-time.

           EXT. CAINE MANOR GARDEN - CONTINUOUS

           Michael Caine is still facing off against his ogre, when the 
           same light bulb goes off over his head.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        Oh!  Right!  We’re supposed to say 
                        his bloody name!
                            (closing his eyes)
                        Merlin.

           INT. RICKY’S SHITTY FLAT - CONTINUOUS

           Ricky is hiding behind his couch as his ogre continues to 
           RANSACK his apartment.  The still-hungover man is struggling 
           to remember his benefactor’s name.

                                 RICKY
                        What’s-his-face!  You know!  Gay 
                        old magic man!  Dumbledore!   
           EXT. STREETS OF LONDON - CONTINUOUS

           Finally, we’re back with Simon, who’s RUNNING at full-speed 
           right at us to escape from the club-wielding ogre, who’s 
           causing massive property damage as it huffs and puffs down 
           the street in hot pursuit.

                                 SIMON
                        MEEEEERRRRLLLIIIIIINNNNNN!

           EXT. RENAISSANCE SETTING - AFTERNOON

           Elsewhere, Simon comes TUMBLING out the other side of a 
           glowing portal, and lands at the feet of the shaken Ricky, 
           Edmund and Michael Caine, who are already gathered here.

                                 SIMON
                        What the...?!  I almost got killed 
                        by sodding Shrek!

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        I’m beginning to think this might 
                        not be a movie, lad.

                                 EDMUND
                        Where the hell are we?

           Ricky looks around to see that they’re surrounded by HORSES 
           and what appear to be MEDIEVAL LORDS AND LADIES.

                                 RICKY
                        I don’t believe it.  That poof sent 
                        us back in time!

                                 MERLIN (O.S.)
                        Not quite.

           The four men turn to see MERLIN with Princess on his 
           shoulder.  

           He’s snacking on a funnel cake beneath a banner that reads 
           “NEW JERSEY WELCOMES REN-FAIRE IX!”

                                 EDMUND
                        We were nearly murdered by some 
                        kind of monsters, and you drag us 
                        to a bleeding dress-up party?

                                 MERLIN
                        You all came here of your own free 
                        will, so I’m guessing that means 
                        you’re ready to get serious? 
                                 EDMUND
                        Serious?  Look around.  These 
                        people are mongoloid virgins.

           Merlin takes in the various geeky PRETEND KNIGHTS 
           entertaining even geekier WOMEN and CHILDREN.

                                 MERLIN
                        Maybe, but they’re also the keepers 
                        of a dying code.  A code of virtue 
                        and honor... one you’re gonna need 
                        to adhere to if you stand any 
                        chance at kicking Morgana’s taint. 

                                 RICKY
                        What, you want us to fight her with 
                        good manners and crap costumes?

                                 SIMON
                        Well, if it’ll help us stop those 
                        monsters, I’m in.  
                            (then, strong)
                        Whatever it takes.

           Wow.  Simon actually looks self-assured, BOLD.  

           But then, Merlin wrinkles up his nose like he’s just smelled 
           something awful.

                                 MERLIN
                        Did somebody...?

                                 SIMON
                        I had a bit of a trouser accident.
                            (and)
                        I’m not gonna lie, it’s bad.

           EXT. MEDIEVAL WEAPONS STAND - AFTERNOON

           We’re close on a BEARDED DUDE, loudly selling his wares.

                                 BEARDED DUDE
                        Get yer broadswords, kids!  One for 
                        thirty bucks, two for fiddy!

           Widen to reveal Merlin and his troops approaching this 
           makeshift ARMORY in the center of the fair.  Simon wears 
           colorful JESTER SHORTS he’s thankfully just purchased.

                                 SIMON
                        We’re getting our weapons next to 
                        the chocolate-covered banana stand?
                                 RICKY
                        Actually, I could murder a 
                        chocolate-covered banana about now.

                                 SIMON
                        It’s just, I figured we’d get the 
                        big guns.  Like, Excalibur or 
                        something.

                                 MERLIN
                        Excalibur was only a sword, Simon.  
                        The man makes the blade, not vice 
                        versa.  

           Merlin then gestures at the row of assorted weapons.

                                 MERLIN (cont’d)
                        As we used to say in the Grail 
                        days, “Choose wisely.”

           Simon inspects the armaments, picks out a nice SWORD.

                                 SIMON
                        Stick with the classics, yeah?

           Michael surveys the spread, selects a badass BATTLE AXE.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        Hello hello hello, where’ve you 
                        been all my life?

           Now it’s Ricky's turn.  He stares at a BO STAFF for a nice 
           long beat.

                                 RICKY
                        And I’ll take... a flamethrower.

           Merlin frowns.

                                 MERLIN
                        You pole vault for a living, Ricky.  
                        Just use the staff.

                                 RICKY
                        If I have to fight more of those 
                        goddamn giants, I won’t be doing it 
                        with a bloody stick!

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                            (an aside)
                        They were decently sized, but I’d 
                        hardly call them giants.
                                 MERLIN
                        Modern armaments are useless 
                        against Morgana.  Besides, there’s 
                        a reason that people relied on 
                        weapons like these for centuries.

                                 RICKY
                        Yeah, ‘cause they were all waiting 
                        for something that could throw 
                        flames to be invented!

                                 EDMUND
                        Give me the bow and arrows.

                                 MERLIN
                        You sure about that, Edmund?

                                 RICKY
                        Yeah, hold on, Winston Zeddemore.  
                        Maybe I want the arrows.

                                 EDMUND
                        Winston who?

                                 SIMON
                        Black guy from Ghostbusters.

                                 RICKY
                        The useless one.  They just put him 
                        on the team to be politically 
                        correct.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        Actually, Ernie Hudson is a fine 
                        actor.  We did Miss Congeniality 
                        together back in--

                                 MERLIN
                        Quiet!  You guys hear that...?

           In the distance, we hear the sound of SCREAMING.

                                 MERLIN (cont’d)
                        Oh, no.  Who was last through the 
                        tesseract gateway?

           Everyone points at Simon.

                                 MERLIN (cont’d)
                        You didn’t close it behind you??

                                 SIMON
                        Hang on, I don’t even know what a 
                        testicle gateway is!!
           Suddenly, ALL FOUR OGRES come bursting onto the scene, having 
           apparently followed our boys through the aforementioned 
           gateway.  The monsters ROAR, and the RenFaire attendees all 
           wildly APPLAUD, thinking this is part of the show.  

                                 MERLIN
                        Not cool.  

                                 RICKY
                        You think?!  Make ‘em disappear 
                        already, ya half a Gandalf!

           One of the ogres charges right for Merlin, who struggles to 
           remember his old spells.

                                 MERLIN
                        How did that stupid freezing 
                        incantation go?  Libra... libra 
                        gela?  Libra jello?

           The ogre is almost on top of him now...

                                 MERLIN (cont’d)
                        Libra geli!

           Merlin then fires a blast of frigid energy, which FREEZES one 
           of these ogres in place.  The wizard smiles proudly as his 
           falcon flies over to rest on the frozen ogre’s head.

                                 MERLIN (cont’d)
                        BAM!  Did you see that??  I haven’t 
                        cast that spell in eons!  And I 
                        totally--

           But just then, the Lead Ogre runs into frame and BASHES 
           Merlin with his club, sending the wizard SAILING into a 
           TURKEY LEG STAND.  Hunks of meat go flying.

                                 SIMON
                        Merlin!

           As Simon and Michael Caine try to decide what to do with 
           their weapons, the three remaining ogres all turn their 
           attention to the unarmed Ricky.

                                 RICKY
                        No!  Please! Don’t hurt me!  Don’t--  

           But just as the lead ogre is about to club Ricky to death--
           ZWISH!--an arrow EMBEDS itself right in the monster’s eye!  
           It stumbles backwards a bit, and--ZWISH!--a SECOND ARROW 
           splits the first arrow right down the center, as this perfect 
           shot kills the lead ogre dead.
           Reverse to reveal EDMUND, who is confidently wielding the bow 
           and arrows like a professional goddamn archer.

           The other two ogres charge right at him, but--ZWISH! ZWISH! 
           ZWISH!--Sir Edmund easily dispatches them by emptying his 
           entire quiver into the monsters with blinding speed.

           Several role-playing WENCHES cheer with approval.

           As the monsters drop to the ground dead, a cowering Ricky 
           picks up a staff and slowly gets to his feet.  He looks at 
           Edmund with a mixture of gratitude and bewilderment.

                                 RICKY (cont’d)
                        How... how did you...?

                                 EDMUND
                        Oxford.  President of the Archery 
                        Club.

                                 RICKY
                        You saved my life!

                                 EDMUND
                            (deadpan)
                        Not my goal, I assure you.

                                 MERLIN (O.S.)
                        That was so badass!

           ON MERLIN, crawling out of the obliterated food stand, 
           chewing on a turkey leg.  

                                 MERLIN (cont’d)
                        You guys crushed Morgana’s 
                        henchmen!

                                 SIMON
                        So... that means we won?

                                 MERLIN
                        Oh, hell no.  This was just the 
                        opening salvo.  Morgana was 
                        probably just keeping you guys 
                        occupied to give her enough time to 
                        raise her army of the undead. 

                                 RICKY
                        You mean... zombies?

                                 SIMON
                        Not terribly keen on those.
           The guys look at Merlin, clearly worried.  He tosses the 
           turkey leg aside.

                                 MERLIN
                        I don’t remember all the details to 
                        be honest.  This was, like, forty-
                        three presidents and a few hundred 
                        monarchs ago.  But whatever, it 
                        doesn’t change the fact that she 
                        has to be stopped, so you four 
                        should get back to London ASAP.

           With a wave of the hand, Merlin opens another glowing portal.

                                 SIMON
                        We’re supposed to stop an army on 
                        our own?  Without you?

           Merlin reaches into his pocket for something.

                                 MERLIN
                        Don’t worry, I’ll be in touch every 
                        step of the way.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        How?  Some kind of telepathy?

           The wizard pulls out an ordinary-looking cell phone.

                                 MERLIN
                        No.  My magic cell phone.

                                 RICKY
                            (under his breath)
                        It’s called a mobile, you sellout.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        What’s so magic about it?

           Merlin tosses the phone to Michael Caine.

                                 MERLIN
                        Free roaming.  Pretty decent 
                        international rates.

           As the knights enter the portal, Edmund just shakes his head.

                                 EDMUND
                        We are well and truly buggered...
           EXT. LONDON SKYLINE - JUST BEFORE DAWN

           As the sun threatens to rise, a FOG rolls over England, 
           monstrous even by London standards. 

           EXT. ABNEY PARK CEMETERY - CONTINUOUS

           As the mist clears, we see Edmund FACE DOWN on the damp earth 
           in front of a crumbling old tombstone.  He’s fast asleep. 

                                 SIMON (O.S.)
                        You are indeed brave, sir knight, 
                        but the fight is mine!

                                 RICKY (O.S.)
                        Oh, had enough, eh?

           Edmund finally wakes from his slumber, opens his eyes, and 
           looks up to see Sir Simon (wearing new jeans) and Sir Ricky 
           in the middle of this foggy old cemetery, using their weapons 
           to reenact a scene from Monty Python and the Holy Grail.

                                 SIMON 
                        “Look, you stupid bastard, you've 
                        got no arms left!”

                                 RICKY
                        “It’s only a flesh wound!”

           Edmund rolls his eyes as Michael Caine helps him to his feet.

                                 EDMUND
                        How long have they been at it?

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        ‘Bout three hours.  Already made it 
                        through the whole film once, then 
                        they started over from the top. 

                                 EDMUND
                        And still no sign of Morgana?

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        Or her zombie hordes.  We haven’t 
                        seen so much as a maggot crawl out 
                        of these graves.  

           Simon and Ricky stop their games to join the conversation.

                                 RICKY
                        I’m telling you, she probably 
                        packed up after she heard about the 
                        beating we gave her other goons.
                                 EDMUND
                        “We?”

                                 SIMON
                        What is this woman’s problem 
                        anyway?  I mean, France has 
                        knights, don’t they?  Why can’t she 
                        go bother them?

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        She obviously wants something.

           A light bulb goes off over Ricky’s head.

                                 RICKY
                        Revenge!

                                 EDMUND
                        For what?

                                 RICKY
                        No, Jaws 4.  It was called Jaws the 
                        Revenge!

           Michael Caine sighs.

                                 SIMON
                        That’s right!  “This time, it’s 
                        personal.”

                                 EDMUND
                        Personal for whom?  

                                 SIMON
                        The shark, I think. 

                                 RICKY
                        Are you serious?  Because that’s 
                        stupid on a level I never imagined 
                        possible.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        Enough!

           Michael Caine suddenly raises his hefty battle axe.  Everyone 
           falls silent.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE (cont’d)
                        I don’t know if any of you right 
                        bastards have families, but 
                        sometimes, we have to do unpleasant 
                        things to take care of them. 

           That hits all of the knights, but Ricky in particular.
                                 MICHAEL CAINE (cont’d)
                        And I don’t care how awful the job 
                        may be, when your loved ones are in 
                        need... you close your eyes and do 
                        it for England.

           Everyone just hangs their heads a bit as those words sink in, 
           when--DEET DA DEET!--all four knights simultaneously FREAK 
           OUT as an unexpected noise cuts through the silence.

           Slowly, the electronic chirping becomes more recognizable as 
           a digital RINGTONE of The Police’s “Every Little Thing She 
           Does Is Magic.”  Breathing a sigh of relief, Michael reaches 
           into his jacket to retrieve Merlin’s magical CELL PHONE.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE (cont’d)
                        ‘Ello?

           INT. MERLIN’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Back in the States, Merlin has returned to his Brooklyn 
           apartment, where he’s watching television with concern.

                                 MERLIN
                        Mike, it’s Merlin.  Um, there’s 
                        been a little change of plans.  I 
                        need you guys to get back to the 
                        city.  Like, now.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE (FROM PHONE)
                        Why?

                                 MERLIN
                        Because Morgana’s army is already 
                        there.

           Angle on Merlin’s television, as we see BBC World News 
           showing footage of TERRIFIED LONDONERS screaming through the 
           streets at they FLEE some unseen horror.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE (FROM PHONE)
                        That’s impossible!  We’ve checked 
                        every cemetery in London!

                                 MERLIN
                        Yeah, well, turns out her army 
                        isn’t undead as much as it is... 
                        not alive.

           There’s silence on the other end of the line for a beat.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE (FROM PHONE)
                        ...what?
           EXT. MADAME TUSSAUDS’ WAX MUSEUM - MORNING

           We’re right outside of the world-famous Madame Tussauds’ Wax 
           Museum, as we finally reveal what all of those terrified 
           Londoners have been running from:

           ABRAHAM LINCOLN, GEORGE CLOONEY, MARILYN MONROE, and about a 
           dozen other WAX FIGURES have been magically brought to life.  
           Led by a Thriller-era MICHAEL JACKSON, they’re lurching 
           Frankenstein-style out of the museum and onto the street, 
           where they’re SMASHING anything that gets in their way. 

           Our four knights have just arrived on the scene with their 
           weapons at their sides.  They’re staring slack-jawed at the 
           supernatural horrors come to life before their eyes. 

                                 RICKY
                        Goodbye.

           With that, Ricky immediately drops his staff and RUNS AWAY.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        Where the hell are you going??

                                 RICKY (O.S.)
                            (already gone)
                        Home...!

                                 SIMON
                        Ricky!

                                 EDMUND
                        Leave him.  We can handle these 
                        things ourselves.
                            (raising his bow)
                        They’re just dummies.

           Michael Caine and Simon retort simultaneously:

                       MICHAEL CAINE
                                                         SIMON
           What does that make us?
                                             What does that make us?

                                 SIMON
                        Ooh, jinx.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        Great minds.

                                 EDMUND
                        GET DOWN!

           Simon and Michael DUCK, as Edmund FIRES an arrow into the one 
           good eye of a rapidly approaching WAX SAMMY DAVIS, JR.
                                 EDMUND (cont’d)
                        Spread out!  Kill as many as you 
                        can.

           Michael and Simon ready their battle axe and sword 
           respectively as they survey their choices.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        I’ll take Hitler.

                                 SIMON
                        Dammit, I was just going to call 
                        Hitler!

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        You can take Madonna.

                                 SIMON
                            (considering this)
                        Fair deal.

           As screaming civilians continue to stream past them, the 
           three knights charge into battle.

           Simon heads for WAX-FIGURE MADONNA, tarted up in her Vogue-
           era cone bra.  He somewhat reluctantly POKES her in the wax 
           tummy with the tip of his broadsword.

                                 SIMON (cont’d)
                            (skeeved out)
                        Eeee.

           But Simon’s eyes go wide as “Madonna” continues to shuffle 
           right for him, pressing on as Simon’s sword moves RIGHT 
           THROUGH her waxy midsection.

                                 SIMON (cont’d)
                        Um, bad?

           Nearby, Michael Caine is having problems of his own, as he 
           continues to battle the now-decapitated body of ADOLF HITLER, 
           which is running about like the proverbial headless chicken.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        Very bad!  How are we supposed to 
                        stop these things??

           Behind him, Edmund is flailing as WAX DAVID BECKHAM tries to 
           choke the life out of him with an inhumanly strong grip.

                                 EDMUND
                            (gasping for air)
                        Somebody... please... 
                                 ANOTHER VOICE (O.S.)
                        Sorry about that.

           Edmund looks over to see a triumphantly returned RICKY.

                                 RICKY
                        Live right up the street but I had 
                        to stop for petrol.

           Simon YANKS his sword out of Madonna’s midsection as he 
           notices that Ricky is carrying his son’s SUPER SOAKER.

                                 SIMON
                        What the hell is that?!

           Ricky calmly flicks a ZIPPO to life.

                                 RICKY
                        Guess.

           He then holds the lighter in front of the water gun and--
           FWOOOOOOOOOOM!!!--a spectacular RIVER OF FIRE shoots out of 
           the toy weapon.

           That’s right, Ricky’s manufactured a homemade FLAMETHROWER.

           Edmund screams as wax David Beckham is ENGULFED in flames... 
           but a smile slowly breaks over the businessman’s face as he 
           watches the figure MELT into a puddle of warm goo.

                                 RICKY (cont’d)
                        What do you say, Eddie?  We even?

                                 EDMUND
                        By almost no system of measurement.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE (O.S.)
                        Um, excuse me!

           Simon, Ricky and Edmund all turn to see Michael Caine, who’s 
           struggling to pry his battle axe away from... MICHAEL CAINE, 
           more specifically, a younger wax figure of him circa Get 
           Carter.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE (cont’d)
                        Little help over here!

           The other three knights are agape.

                                 RICKY
                        Which... which is the real one?

                                 SIMON
                        On the right?
                                 EDMUND
                        It’s the one on the left, 
                        obviously.
                            (a beat)
                        I think.

           A pissed-off Michael Caine continues to struggle.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        I look nothing like this thing, you 
                        absolute assholes!  

                                 RICKY
                        Bit of a sticky wicket, innit?

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        Also, I’m the one talking!

                                 RICKY
                        Might have to do them both.

                                 SIMON
                        Well, trust your instincts.

           FWOOOOOOOOOOM!!!  The wax Michael Caine goes up in flames, 
           and the real one frowns at his compatriots.  

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        About sodding time!

                                 SIMON
                        Did we get the right one...?

                                 ANOTHER VOICE (O.S.)
                        DROP THE WEAPONS!

           All four knights turn to see none other than BOBBI, in 
           uniform and wielding her police-issue nightstick.

                                 BOBBI
                        Simon?

                                 SIMON
                        Bobbi?

                                 BOBBI
                        What the hell is going on here?

                                 SIMON
                        Well, it’s quite a story actually.  
                        I don’t know if you’ve ever read 
                        The Sword in the Stone, but--
                                 BOBBI
                            (interrupting)
                        Is that Michael Caine?

                                 RICKY
                        Michael who?

           Michael steps forward, gives a charming little bow.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        At your service, luv.

           Bobbi blushes.  Simon frowns.

                                 BOBBI
                            (collecting herself)
                        Right, why are there wax pop stars 
                        running down Mansell Street?

                                 SIMON
                        We’ll finish them off, Bobbi.  You 
                        should stay here, help any hurt 
                        civilians.

                                 BOBBI
                        Who the hell are you to give me 
                        orders?

           Simon pulls her aside, a little embarrassed about being 
           dressed down in front of the boys.

                                 SIMON
                        Bobbi, please.  

                                 BOBBI
                        And why are you carrying a sword?  
                        What is this?

                                 SIMON
                        A mess I have to clean up.  I know 
                        you have no reason to trust me... 
                        but I hope you will.

           Bobbi just stares at him, but their moment is interrupted by 
           a ringtone of “Black Magic Woman,” as Michael Caine pulls out 
           his phone.

           INT. MERLIN’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           We rejoin a frantic Merlin, who’s got his falcon Princess 
           flapping her wings on his shoulder.
                                 MERLIN
                        Guys, you have to get over to the 
                        Tower of London!  

           Push in tight on Merlin.

                                 MERLIN (cont’d)
                        It’s Morgana.  I just remembered 
                        what she wants.

           INT. TOWER OF LONDON VAULT - MORNING

           Smash cut to this close-up of the QUEEN’S CROWN, as gloved 
           hands return it to its pedestal.

           We’re with the same two YEOMEN OF THE GUARD from Buckingham 
           Palace, now inside a hi-tech vault brimming with jewels.  The 
           men are in the middle of a heated discussion:

                                 YEOMEN #1
                        Hold on, what’s the difference 
                        between a Yeti and a Sasquatch?

                                 YEOMEN #2
                        Sasquatch is your basic bigfoot, 
                        any large, hairy bipedal primate 
                        indigenous to the remote forests of 
                        the Pacific Northwest.  Yeti is its 
                        Himalayan cousin, more of the 
                        Abominable Snowman variety. 

                                 YEOMEN #1
                        Hm, in that case, I suppose I’d 
                        rather make love to the 
                        Sasquatch... 

           Suddenly, the two men hear the distant sound of screaming, 
           followed by what sounds like GUNSHOTS.

           The pair of Yeomen quickly draw their MACHINE GUNS, and take 
           up a defensive position in front of the crown jewels, when--

           KRAKOOM!  The heavy vault door explodes inward.  As the smoke 
           clears, we see four figures standing here: it’s THE BEATLES 
           (or at least their wax doppelgängers), dressed in their 
           colorful faux-military attire from SGT. PEPPER’S.

           The Yeomen look at each other, shrug, then OPEN FIRE on just 
           RINGO.  But the bullets harmlessly pass through the dummy’s 
           body.  WAX JOHN LENNON then steps forward and calmly PUNCHES 
           Yeomen #1’s nose up into his brain, while WAX PAUL McCARTNEY 
           dispatches Yeomen #2 by brutally KICKING right through him.
           As the dead guards slump to the floor, the Wax Beatles 
           suddenly BOW as a fifth figure enters this vault.

           It’s MORGANA, who’s apparently found time to secure some sexy 
           evening attire for herself.  

                                 MORGANA
                        Charming.

           Morgana then waves her hand, and the four wax BEATLES all 
           SLAM TOGETHER, melting into each other’s bodies.  The four 
           waxy moptops soon combine into one new bug-like being, a six-
           foot-tall BEETLE CREATURE who sprouts large, insectoid wings.  
           Morgana kisses her new golem, and its compound eyes SPARKLE 
           as it comes to life.  

                                 MORGANA (cont’d)
                        On your way, beautiful.  You have a 
                        long flight ahead of you.  

           The Beetle Creature spreads its wings and FLIES out of the 
           vault, as Morgana turns her attention to the queen’s crown...

           EXT. TOWER OF LONDON COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

           Outside the Tower, our four knights finally arrive on the 
           scene, but clearly too late.

           The ground is littered with the bodies of BEEFEATERS who 
           apparently died in pitched battle against Morgana’s wax army.  
           The knights are horrified.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        Good Lord.

                                 SIMON
                        They’re... they’re all...

                                 EDMUND
                        What are we supposed to do now?

                                 RICKY
                        We find the slag that did this...
                            (raising his flamethrower)
                        ...and we give her what for.

           Just then, the sky begins to DARKEN.

                                 ANOTHER VOICE (O.S.)
                        Two entire centuries and nothing 
                        has changed.
           The knights all turn to see Morgana, who’s now WEARING the 
           Queen’s crown atop her head.  

                                 SIMON
                        Morgana.

                                 RICKY
                        She’s already got the crown.  
                        That’s... that’s trouble, right?

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        Merlin says it makes her more 
                        powerful.

                                 EDMUND
                        I say it makes her a bull's-eye.

           Edmund FIRES an arrow, it HITS Morgana high in her shoulder.

                                 MORGANA
                        NAHHH!

           Edmund fires again, but this time, Morgana SNATCHES the arrow 
           out of midair just before it connects.  She SNAPS this arrow 
           in two before painfully YANKING the first arrow out of her 
           flesh.  

           Morgana makes a show out of licking her own blood off of this 
           projectile.

                                 MORGANA (cont’d)
                        First blooding to you... Sir 
                        Edmund, isn’t it?  

           Edmund’s surprised this woman knows his name.

                                 MORGANA (cont’d)
                        Knighted for “charitable work,” and 
                        yet you never donated a single 
                        shilling more than what you were 
                        able to write off on your taxes.

           Sir Edmund tightens his grip on his bow.

                                 EDMUND
                        You have no idea who I am.

                                 MORGANA
                        Oh, I’ve seen your brand of gentry 
                        a thousand times.  The sad little 
                        urchin boy who stepped on as many 
                        of his fellow downtrodden as it 
                        took to reach the very “class” he 
                        used to curse.
           Edmund hangs his head a bit.  Apparently, this was a fair 
           evaluation...

                                 MORGANA (cont’d)
                        You fancy yourself a man of power, 
                        but you’re just as impotent as the 
                        pathetic eunuchs with which you’ve 
                        aligned yourself here.

           Ricky looks to Michael Caine.

                                 RICKY
                        Eunuchs?

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        Blokes without bollocks.

                                 RICKY
                        That’s what I thought.

           With that, Ricky FIRES his flamethrower... but Morgana HALTS 
           the flames in mid-air by simply extending a palm.  

                                 RICKY (cont’d)
                        Oh, come on!  That’s cheating!

           She then uses her mind to PUSH the fire back into Ricky’s 
           Super Soaker, causing the homemade weapon to EXPLODE.  The 
           ensuing BLAST knocks all four knights right onto their asses.  

                                 SIMON
                        Ricky!  Rick, are you all right?!

           Ricky slowly turns to reveal that he’s alive.  The bad news 
           is that the entire front of his shirt has been burned away, 
           exposing his meaty man-breasts.  One of his nipples is still 
           on fire here.

                                 RICKY
                            (dazed)
                        Do... do I still have my eyebrows?

           Morgana lords over them.

                                 MORGANA
                        You knights are all the same... 
                        indolent, glory-starved, absurd.  
                        You claim to be champions of the 
                        poor, the oppressed, the so-called 
                        “fairer sex,” and yet you only care 
                        about yourselves.  

           Edmund and the others start to get to their feet.
                                 EDMUND
                        And what the hell do you care 
                        about?

                                 MORGANA
                        Remaking this mundane world as it 
                        was before barbarians like you 
                        stole it from my kind.  When elves 
                        and trolls roamed this land, it was 
                        thrilling.  It was alive.  But in 
                        your selfish pursuit of dull 
                        tranquility, you monsters nearly 
                        wiped us off the face of the earth.
                            (then)
                        But sadly for you, “nearly” is not 
                        nearly good enough...    

           More storm clouds gather overhead as Morgana’s hands begin to 
           CRACKLE with mystical energy.

                                 MORGANA (cont’d)
                        Your time is over, Roundtable.  
                        Welcome back to the Dark Ages.  

           The knights can only cower as MASSIVE BOLTS OF LIGHTNING 
           suddenly shoot out of Morgana’s fingertips.

           EXT. ENGLAND - CONTINUOUS

           We’re high above all of England, a SATELLITE P.O.V., as we 
           see Morgana’s energy arc high into the heavens and spread out 
           across the entire country like an incandescent spider web.

           EXT. STREETS OF LONDON - CONTINUOUS

           Back on earth, a double-decker bus and several black cabs 
           SCREECH to a halt as every motor vehicle on the road suddenly 
           LOSES POWER.

           EXT. BIG BEN - CONTINUOUS

           Finally, this is an iconic shot of Big Ben.  The clock’s 
           hands freeze in place as we hear its motors GRIND to a halt.

           EXT. TOWER OF LONDON COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

           Back at the Tower of London, the knights angrily confront a 
           defiant Morgana.
                                 EDMUND
                        What have you done??

                                 SIMON
                        All the power’s gone out!  Looks 
                        like she hit us with some sort of 
                        E.M.P., that is, an electro-
                        magnetic--

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        Yes yes, we’ve all seen a movie 
                        before, Simon.

                                 RICKY
                        I think Edmund was being 
                        rhetorical.

                                 SIMON
                            (quietly)
                        Right, sorry.

                                 MORGANA
                        You have the rest of the day to 
                        enjoy sweet chaos.  And then, I 
                        shall welcome Doomsayer, the Final 
                        Herald, into this realm.

                                 EDMUND
                        Alternately, we end this now.

           All four knights CHARGE Morgana, but she LEVITATES ten feet 
           into the air.

                                 MORGANA
                        Midnight.  Trafalgar Square.  I 
                        value punctuality.

           With that, Morgana snaps her fingers and DISAPPEARS.  Her 
           crown clanks to the ground, and a torrential DOWNPOUR ensues.  

           As lightning flashes, the helpless knights stare up at the 
           suddenly opened heavens.

                                 SIMON
                        Well, that was pants.

                                 EDMUND
                        She’s really going to finish it.  
                        England is dead.
                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        I lived through the Blitz, lad.  If 
                        the Nazis couldn’t beat us, neither 
                        can some overdramatic dinner 
                        theater wench.  We can beat her.

                                 RICKY
                        Not until I find another weapon, we 
                        can’t.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        Fine, but no more flamethrowers.  
                        You heard Merlin.  Only medieval 
                        weapons can stop her.  You need a 
                        club or a... a mace or something.

                                 RICKY
                        Way ahead of you, M.C.

                                 EDMUND
                        If we’re all going to perish at 
                        midnight, I have some... unfinished 
                        business to attend to first.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        Then I’ll try to get in touch with 
                        Merlin.  See if he can tell us what 
                        to expect at Trafalgar tonight.

                                 SIMON
                        What about me?

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        You’re the brains of this outfit, 
                        aren’t you?  
                            (a beat)
                        Think up a way to beat her.

           INT. SIMON’S HOME - NIGHT

           It’s later that evening, and we’re close on a NEWT.

           The amphibian is regarding a CHALKBOARD illuminated by 
           several Bunsen burners.  On this large black slate, an 
           intently focused Simon is scribbling some complex diagrams.  
           But after a moment, he THROWS his chalk to the ground.

                                 SIMON
                        What the hell am I doing?!  I work 
                        with lizards!  I can’t beat a 
                        sorceress with hibernation 
                        factoids!  I--
           KERRASH!  Startled by this sudden noise, Simon DRAWS his 
           broadsword and wildly WAVES it at the shadows.

                                 SIMON (cont’d)
                        Is...is somebody there?  Show 
                        yourself!

           And that’s when a nightstick-wielding BOBBI steps out of the 
           darkness.

                                 BOBBI
                        Easy, Prince Valiant.  I come in 
                        peace.

                                 SIMON
                        Bob!  

                                 BOBBI
                        Sorry to scare you.  After this 
                        morning, I wasn’t sure what kind of 
                        trouble might have followed you 
                        home.

           She then surveys Simon’s chalkboard, which looks not unlike a 
           football play analysis with its various Xs and Os.

                                 BOBBI (cont’d)
                        What’s all this then?

                                 SIMON
                        Hm?  Oh, I, uh, was just plugging 
                        in a few figures to help me, you 
                        know... strategize.

           Bobbi seems lost.

                                 BOBBI
                        Madame Tussauds, the blackout... 
                        this is all just some game?

                                 SIMON
                        What?  No!  No.  You know how 
                        people say, “It’s not the end of 
                        the world.”  
                            (beat)
                        Well, this is pretty much the 
                        opposite of that.

           Bobbi is even more at sea.  Simon takes a moment, then:

                                 SIMON (cont’d)
                        Would you like some tea?
           INT. SIMON’S KITCHEN - A LITTLE LATER

           And now our couple is finishing their second cup, with Bobbi 
           clearly having just been downloaded a lot of fascinating 
           exposition by Simon.

                                 BOBBI
                        So you have no idea what this 
                        “Doomsayer” is?

                                 SIMON
                            (eating a cucumber 
                             sandwich)
                        No, but I’m guessing it’s either a 
                        great evil or a terrible band.

                                 BOBBI
                        This is madness.  You boys aren’t 
                        going anywhere without a tactical 
                        unit backing you up.

                                 SIMON
                        No!  Bobbi, please, if you’d seen 
                        what this woman did to those guards 
                        at the Tower...

           He takes her hand.

                                 SIMON (cont’d)
                        I can’t let any more innocent 
                        people get killed.  Knights are 
                        supposed to be the protectors of 
                        this realm.  It’s our fight.

           Bobbi looks down at his hand.  The tension builds...

                                 BOBBI
                        Well... if there’s a chance this is 
                        the end of the road for us all, be 
                        a bit silly for you and me not to 
                        go out with a bang.  
                            (a beat)
                        As it were.

           Simon blushes, tries to hide his shyness.

                                 SIMON
                        Ha!  You’re wonderful.  But no.  
                        No, it wouldn’t be right for me to
                            (immediately changing his 
                             mind)
                        Yeah okay let’s.
           INT. SIMON’S BEDROOM - ELEVEN MINUTES LATER

           We’re directly above Simon’s bed, as the two post-coital 
           lovers, covered by sheets, stare up at us with contentment.

                                 BOBBI
                        Hm.  

                                 SIMON
                        Right.

                                 BOBBI
                        Shame if that’s the last time we 
                        got to do that.

                                 SIMON
                        Well said.
                            (then; noticing the time)
                        I swear I’m normally a cuddler, 
                        usually to a fault, but my 
                        scooter’s out of commission, and 
                        it’s a long walk to--

                                 BOBBI
                        Go.  

                                 SIMON
                        Cheers.  Wait for me here?

           In the distance, we hear what sounds like a trash can being 
           THROWN through a plate-glass window.

                                 BOBBI
                        You wish.  Sounds like the 
                        inevitable looting has gotten 
                        underway.  I’m back on the clock.  

                                 SIMON
                        Do me one favor, will you?

                                 BOBBI
                        You, too.

                          SIMON
                                                         BOBBI
           Try not to die.
                                             Try not to die.

                                 SIMON
                        Ooh.

                                 BOBBI
                        Jinx.

           And off Simon’s nervous smile...
           INT. MERLIN’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           ...we’re back in the States with Princess, as the falcon 
           SCREECHES loudly.

           Widen to reveal that Merlin is yelling at his bird as an 
           American television report plays in the background. 

                                 MERLIN
                        What do you mean you can’t break 
                        through?  You have to keep trying, 
                        Princess!

                                 FROM TELEVISION
                        ...and with no communication going 
                        in or out of England, exactly what 
                        is going on inside the UK remains a 
                        complete mystery...

           Suddenly, a ring tone of Heart’s “Magic Man” plays, as Merlin 
           breathlessly picks up his cell phone.

                                 MERLIN
                        Hello?

                                 MICHAEL CAINE (FROM PHONE)
                        Hello yourself, old son.

                                 MERLIN
                            (relieved)
                        Michael!  I thought all the lines 
                        were dead!

                                 MICHAEL CAINE (FROM PHONE)
                        Says the genius behind the magic 
                        phone?

           Princess the falcon squawks as if to call Merlin a complete 
           and utter dipshit.  Merlin covers the phone to yell at her: 

                                 MERLIN
                        I forgot, all right?  I’m under a 
                        lot of stress!  Go take a dump on a 
                        statue!
                            (into the phone)
                        Sorry.  We at the end of the world 
                        yet or what?

           EXT. CAINE MANOR - EVENING

           And now we join Michael Caine, SHARPENING his axe beneath his 
           rain-slicked outdoor patio, as we INTERCUT between the two 
           sides of this conversation.
                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        Close enough.  Morgana got her 
                        hands on the crown jewels, killed 
                        all the power, and now we’re 
                        supposed to meet her at midnight to 
                        fight some bloke named Harold. 

                                 MERLIN
                        You mean, the Final Herald?  As in, 
                        the Doomsayer?

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        That’s the one.  What’s he all 
                        about then?

                                 MERLIN
                        I... I don’t know.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        Come on, mate, I know it’s been a 
                        few years, but you have to 
                        remember.

                                 MERLIN
                        I remember the name, it’s just... 
                        the last Roundtable stopped Morgana 
                        way before she could ever bring 
                        whatever that thing is here.
                            (beat)
                        I’m sorry.  I have no clue what you 
                        guys are up against next.

           Michael thinks this over.  

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        You know, first day I was shooting 
                        The Ipcress File, director set the 
                        entire bloody script on fire in 
                        front of us, told us we’d be better 
                        off improvising.  
                            (then)
                        If I could fake my way through that 
                        picture, I figure we’ll be able to 
                        pull this off.

                                 MERLIN
                        I appreciate the stiff upper lip, 
                        but I still feel like a douche.  I 
                        mean, I should be there with you 
                        guys, not running stupid 
                        simulations in my apartment.  I... 
                        I never should have left the 
                        British Isles.
                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        Now now, don’t beat yourself up.  I 
                        did my time in the States just like 
                        you.  England is a miserable, gray, 
                        cold-hearted place.  You can’t 
                        blame a guy for needing some time 
                        away.

                                 MERLIN
                        So why’d you go back?

           As the clouds part and the rain finally starts to die down, 
           Michael Caine looks out beyond his garden to see rolling 
           green hills swallow a blood red sphere in a heartbreakingly 
           beautiful sunset.  It’s England in all her glory.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                            (matter of fact)
                        For a proper pint.  The Guinness is 
                        for shit in America.  

           Merlin allows himself a little smirk.

                                 MERLIN
                        Break a leg tonight, Sir Michael. 

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        I will.

           Michael snaps the phone shut.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE (cont’d)
                            (muttering to himself)
                        And probably a hip while I’m at 
                        it...

           EXT. LONDON HOME - AFTERNOON

           We’re outside of someone’s front door as it swings open to 
           reveal an ADORABLE CHILD, a ten-year-old boy.

                                 ADORABLE CHILD
                        Daddy!

           Widen to reveal that Ricky--still wearing his singed and open 
           shirt--is standing outside in the rain.

                                 RICKY
                        Hello, champ.

           The boy’s YOUNGER BROTHER then runs up to hug his father.
                                 YOUNGER BROTHER
                        We saw you on the telly before the 
                        lights went out!

                                 ADORABLE CHILD
                        You set Margaret Thatcher on fire!

                                 YOUNGER BROTHER
                        It was brilliant!

                                 RICKY
                        Couldn’t have done it without your 
                        toy, handsome.

                                 ADORABLE CHILD
                        Can you make my water gun shoot 
                        fire?

                                 RICKY
                        Oh, it’s easier than a drunk 
                        hooker.  You just--

                                 ANOTHER VOICE (O.S.)
                        Ricky?

           The door opens wider to reveal a pleasant-looking WOMAN the 
           same age as Ricky... but Ricky feels a hundred years old when 
           he looks at her.  This is JESS, his ex-wife.  

                                 RICKY
                            (quietly)
                        Hello, Jess.

           Jess looks at him, then up at the supernaturally black sky.

                                 JESS
                        You... you were right all along.  
                        Something bad is happening, isn’t 
                        it?  How’d you know we should get 
                        out of town?

                                 RICKY
                        Never mind about that.  The 
                        motorways are jammed with dead cars 
                        and none of the trains are running.  
                        Best thing for you and the boys to 
                        do now is get down to the cellar 
                        and stay there.

                                 JESS
                        What about you?
                                 RICKY
                        I’ll be fine.  I just wanted to 
                        come here and say... and say I’m 
                        sorry for being such a complete 
                        arse.

           That word makes the two boys giggle a bit.

                                 RICKY (cont’d)
                        Look, these last couple of years, 
                        I’ve been a worthless freeloading 
                        bastard.  I wasn’t there for you, 
                        and nothing I can do now is ever 
                        gonna make up for that.  But for 
                        what little it’s worth, I love all 
                        three of you.  More than the world.

           Genuinely moved, Jess is on the verge of tears.

                                 JESS
                        Ricky.  I...  I...

                                 RICKY
                        Um, also, I was wondering if I 
                        could maybe borrow a wee something 
                        of yours?

           And off Jess’ FROWN...

           INT. EDMUND’S OFFICE BUILDING - EARLY EVENING

           ...we’re on Sir Edmund’s EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT, who is wearing 
           a similar expression.  She’s holding a candle close to her 
           face as she barks orders at her COLLEAGUES gathered in the 
           darkness.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        I don’t care about whatever rumors 
                        you’re hearing.  What do you think 
                        Sir Edmund’s going to do when he 
                        returns to find you people just 
                        milling about?

                                 ANOTHER VOICE (O.S.)
                        I think he’s going to send them 
                        home to look after their families.

           Everyone turns to see a torch-wielding Edmund enter the dark 
           offices.  He has his quiver slung over his back and his bow 
           at his side.
                                 EDMUND
                        But first, I need you each to check 
                        in on one of our markets.  Tell the 
                        managers that they’re to open the 
                        stores to anyone and everyone.  I 
                        don’t want a single soul left out 
                        on the streets tonight. 

           The assistant is stunned.

                                 EDMUND (cont’d)
                        Perishables are worthless without 
                        refrigeration, but all of our 
                        canned goods should be evenly 
                        distributed to those in need.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Distributed?  Sir, before you send 
                        our entire inventory out the door 
                        for free, are you sure you don’t 
                        want to look into less costly--

                                 EDMUND
                        Ms. Nakamori, never argue with a 
                        man wielding a bow and arrow.

           And for the first time in a long time, the assistant SMILES.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        You heard him.  Let’s get to work!

           EXT. SIMON’S STREET - NIGHT

           Speaking of which, Bobbi is once again on the beat.  The 
           afterglow of the evening's proceedings is starting to fade as 
           the seriousness of the situation again rears its ugly head.

           Down the street, Bobbi sees an OLD WOMAN struggling to get to 
           her feet, having apparently been knocked to the pavement.  
           There’s a nasty gash on her forehead.

                                 BOBBI
                        Hell.

           She runs to help the old woman up.

                                 BOBBI (cont’d)
                        Ma’am!  Are you all right?

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        Oh, bless your heart, dearie.  It’s 
                        nothing.
           Suddenly, the Old Woman reaches out and GRABS Bobbi by the 
           throat.  As Bobbi GASPS for air, the “Old Woman” SHAPESHIFTS 
           into her real form: Morgana.

                                 MORGANA
                        Nothing at all.

                                 BOBBI
                        ...who...?

                                 MORGANA
                        I apologize for this, girl, but 
                        your involvement is a necessary 
                        evil.  If there’s one thing a 
                        knight can’t resist...

           Morgana smiles as Bobbi finally PASSES OUT.

                                 MORGANA (cont’d)
                        ...it’s a damsel in distress.

           INT. MERLIN’S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

           On cue, we reenter the virtual world of Merlin’s VIDEO GAME, 
           where a simulated DAMSEL IN DISTRESS screams for help. 

                                 DAMSEL
                        SAVE ME!

           Merlin watches helplessly as four knights (each a medieval 
           approximation of our Roundtable members) try to rescue her, 
           only to be DECIMATED by a virtual version of Morgana.

                                 VIRTUAL KNIGHT #1
                        No way!  This chick ripped 5000 
                        damage points in a single move!

                                 VIRTUAL KNIGHT #2
                        Weak, I just logged on!  How can I 
                        be dead already?

           Pull out to reveal that we’re in the Brooklyn apartment, 
           where a groggy Merlin has clearly been at this for a while.

                                 MERLIN
                        That doesn’t bode well...

           Merlin takes off his headset as he once again hears a 
           POUNDING at his door.  He reluctantly gets up to answer it.

                                 MERLIN (cont’d)
                        God, Cristal, either invest in 
                        earplugs or--
           But as he opens the door, Merlin is greeted not by the female 
           model who lives downstairs, but by the winged BEETLE CREATURE 
           Morgana dispatched from the Tower of London.

           Merlin calmly gives this towering wax creature the once-
           over... and SNIFFS at it.

                                 MERLIN (cont’d)
                        Huh.
                            (a beat)
                        You smell like candles.

           The oversized insect responds by PUNCHING Merlin so hard that 
           he FLIES back across his studio, SMASHING into a bookcase.

           Merlin just shakes this off and gets to his feet.

                                 MERLIN (cont’d)
                        I’m guessing Morgana sent you?  If 
                        you were from the co-op board, I’d 
                        be dead already.

           The Beetle Creature then PROJECTILE VOMITS molten lava across 
           the room at Merlin, who DEFLECTS it at the last second by 
           conjuring a GLOWING FORCE FIELD.

                                 MERLIN (cont’d)
                        LIKTUS PROFECTOR!  Also?  So, so 
                        gross!

           As Morgana’s emissary moves in for the kill, PRINCESS swoops 
           off her perch and ATTACKS the giant bug, who promptly SWATS 
           the falcon to the ground.

                                 MERLIN (cont’d)
                        Did... did you just hit my bird?

           Merlin’s hands begin to crackle with mystical energy as he 
           FIRES a blast at his enemy.

                                 MERLIN (cont’d)
                        Experimo flarus!  That’s Latin for 
                        SUCK IT.

           But the Beetle spreads its wings and LIFTS OFF into the air 
           to avoid the blast.  It then dives down from the high ceiling 
           to TACKLE Merlin, pinning him against a wall.

                                 BEETLE CREATURE
                        Morgana ssssends a messsssage...

           As the creature begins to CHOKE the life out of him, Merlin 
           strains to reach for the nearby MAGIC WAND we saw mounted on 
           the wall when we first visited this apartment.
                                 BEETLE CREATURE (cont’d)
                        Today, all of Britain will 
                        celebrate your demisssssssse.  

                                 MERLIN
                            (choking)
                        Too bad... we ain’t... in Britain.

           Merlin finally GRABS the wand, but as he tugs down on it, the 
           wooden panel it’s mounted on SLIDES OPEN.  This isn’t a real 
           magic wand, but a lever that activates a hidden panel... one 
           concealing a Dirty Harry-style SMITH & WESSON MODEL 29 .44 
           MAGNUM, “the most powerful handgun in the world.” 

                                 MERLIN (cont’d)
                        This is how we roll in the 
                        U.S. of A.

           And as the heavy revolver slides into his hand, Merlin FIRES 
           RIGHT INTO THE MONSTER’S FACE.  

           BLAM!  Purple blood splatters everywhere as the Beetle 
           Creature TOPPLES backwards.

           As the smoke clears and a recovered Princess flaps onto his 
           shoulder, Merlin looks down at his firearm, decidedly 
           impressed.

                                 MERLIN (cont’d)
                        Well, screw the old-school stuff, 
                        huh?  Maybe I should have armed the 
                        boys with these things after all...

           But before he can pat himself on the back, the Beetle 
           Creature scares the hell out of us by LEAPING TO ITS FEET.  
           Clearly not dead yet, it POUNCES on Merlin, knocking our poor 
           wizard out of frame.

           EXT. TRAFALGAR SQUARE - LATE NIGHT 

           It’s a little before midnight back in England, and Trafalgar 
           Square is eerily silent, with everyone in the city having 
           gone into hiding behind closed doors.

           Everyone except Michael Caine, that is.  He strides 
           purposefully down the empty street, his trusty battle axe at 
           his side.

           Suddenly, he hears something.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        Who the hell goes there?
           Edmund steps out from behind an old-fashioned phone booth.

                                 EDMUND
                        Thought I might be the only one 
                        stupid enough to show up.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        I’m a sucker for a good fight.  

           The two men walk together.

                                 EDMUND
                        You do any time in the armed 
                        services, Sir Michael?

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        Queen’s Royal Regiment.  Saw some 
                        action in Korea.  Filthy business 
                        that was.  Vowed I’d never take up 
                        arms on someone else’s turf.  If 
                        the bastards wanted to scrap, 
                        they’d have to come to me.

                                 EDMUND
                        And here we are.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        And here we are.

                                 ANOTHER VOICE (O.S.)
                        Well, you’re a somber looking 
                        couple of sods, aren’t you?

           The two men turn to see RICKY, now wearing a fresh new shirt.

                                 RICKY
                        I, for one, am ready to get 
                        medieval on a proverbial ass or 
                        two.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        Ricky?  Where’s your weapon?

           Ricky pulls out a SMALL CANISTER from his pocket.

                                 RICKY
                        Never fear.

           Edmund inspects it with disappointment.

                                 EDMUND
                        Pepper spray?
                                 RICKY
                        No, it’s mace.  You said that 
                        counts, right?

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        I said a mace, you daft... 
                            (increasingly frustrated)
                        That stuff is worthless!

                                 RICKY
                        Have you ever been maced before?  
                        My ex got me in the eyes with this 
                        crap last year.  I was crying like 
                        a Spaniard.

                                 ANOTHER VOICE (O.S.)
                        Guys!

           All three knights turn to see Simon, breathlessly dragging 
           his heavy broadsword behind him.

                                 SIMON
                        Guys, wait up!

                                 EDMUND
                        Please tell me you have something 
                        worthwhile to contribute.

                                 SIMON
                        I do. Tonight, I was with Bobbi, 
                        and as she was leaving, I realized 
                        how we can win against Morgana.

                                 RICKY
                        The cop?  You were with her or with 
                        her?

                                 SIMON
                            (blushing)
                        With her?

                                 RICKY
                        Nice one.  Use the cuffs?

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        Shut up!  How do we beat Morgana.

                                 SIMON
                        Easy.  By not fighting her.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        What?
                                 SIMON
                        Look, if she wanted us dead, she 
                        could have killed us back at the 
                        Tower.  Morgana obviously needs us 
                        to accomplish whatever comes next, 
                        so the logical thing for us to do 
                        is deny her the satisfaction.

                                 EDMUND
                        You’re saying, what... we just 
                        retreat and go into hiding?

                                 RICKY
                            (suddenly excited)
                        I love this plan.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        And what about England?  We let 
                        Morgana stay in power, her goblins 
                        and fairies lording over us while 
                        we’re cut off from the rest of the 
                        world, living without electricity 
                        like some third-world country?

                                 SIMON
                            (starting to have second 
                             thoughts)
                        An agrarian lifestyle isn’t all 
                        bad, really.

                                 ANOTHER VOICE (O.S.)
                        Yes, run away and beat your swords 
                        into plowshares.

           The knights spin around to see Morgana standing in the middle 
           of this square.  

           She’s holding Bobbi hostage, standing behind this policewoman 
           with a DAGGER pressed to her neck.

                                 MORGANA
                        This battle has already been lost.

                                 SIMON
                        BOBBI!

                                 BOBBI
                        Get out of here, Simon!  I can 
                        handle this tart!

           Edmund raises his bow, but Simon calls him off.

                                 SIMON
                        Don’t!  You’ll hit her!
                                 RICKY
                        I thought you were just with her.  
                        What’s she doing here?

                                 BOBBI
                        Jesus, Simon, you told them?  
                        Already?  

           But Morgana KNICKS Bobbi with the dagger.

                                 BOBBI (cont’d)
                        Ahh!

                                 MORGANA
                        Unless you want to watch me bleed 
                        your consort like a fatted calf, 
                        you will kneel before me.

           Simon immediately drops his sword and falls to his knees.  On 
           cue, LIGHTNING flashes in the distance.

                                 SIMON
                        Don’t hurt her!

           But Morgana stares at the other thee knights.

                                 MORGANA
                        All of you.

           Ricky’s not quite sure what to do here.

                                 RICKY
                        Actually, I’ve got a bit of a bum 
                        knee, so--

           Morgana GLARES at him.

                                 RICKY (cont’d)
                        Right, down I go.

           Ricky WINCES as he kneels, and another bolt of lightning 
           cracks above them.

           And now only Michael Caine and Edmund are left standing.  
           Simon looks at Michael with pleading eyes...

                                 SIMON
                        Michael, please.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        I know, but what about your plan?  
                        Maybe us bowing before Morgana is 
                        what causes this Doomsayer chap to 
                        appear.
           Seemingly confirming this, Morgana CUTS Bobbi deeper.

                                 BOBBI
                        AHHHHHH!

           Michael sighs, drops his battle axe, and kneels as lightning 
           once again flashes.

           Now only Edmund is holding his ground.

                                 SIMON
                        Edmund...

                                 EDMUND
                        I don’t kneel before anyone except 
                        the Queen.  And that was under 
                        protest.

           But Simon is done playing nice.

                                 SIMON
                            (hard as nails)
                        Get down before I take your legs 
                        out from under you.

           Edmund says nothing for a beat, but finally kneels as the 
           last bolt of lightning flashes on cue.

                                 SIMON (cont’d)
                        We held up our end of the bargain, 
                        now let her go.

                                 MORGANA
                        Who said we were bargaining?

           With that, the earth begins to TREMBLE.

                                 RICKY
                        Saw that coming.

           Suddenly, the street OPENS UP, and Morgana and Bobbi are 
           THRUST into the air by the MASSIVE HILL that springs up 
           beneath their feet.

                                 RICKY (cont’d)
                        Not that part, truthfully.

           And then, the hill begins to LENGTHEN and UNFURL, as we see 
           that it’s not a hill... but a living creature, a scaly 
           monster more than 100 feet long with a head like an oversized 
           lizard.  

           That’s right, it’s a DRAGON.
           Still on their knees, the knights look up at this mythical 
           creature with an appropriate mix of shock and awe.  As 
           Morgana and her hostage take up position on the creature’s 
           back, SMOKE billows out of the dragon’s nostrils.

                                 RICKY (cont’d)
                        Uh...

                                 SIMON
                        EVERYONE, MOVE!

           Quickly grabbing their weapons, the knights SCATTER a split-
           second before the dragon EXHALES LIQUID FIRE all over the 
           spot where they were just kneeling.  Ricky ROLLS to a stop 
           and pats out his smoldering clothes.

                                 RICKY
                        Now that is a proper flamethrower.

           The dragon ROARS, as Simon looks up to see the captive Bobbi 
           high on the monster’s back with Morgana.

                                 EDMUND
                        Is this the part where we retreat?

                                 SIMON
                            (total badass)
                        Change of plans.

           Raising his sword, Simon charges forward and SLASHES his 
           weapon against one of the dragon’s legs.  But the monster’s 
           hide is too thick, and the attack only seems to make it 
           angry.  The dragon LUNGES at Simon.

                                 SIMON (cont’d)
                        Bother.

           Trying to distract the creature, Edmund LAUNCHES several 
           arrows at its head.  The steel-tipped projectiles only BOUNCE 
           off of it, but the annoyed dragon does turn away from its 
           attackers.

           Seeing an opening, Michael Caine rushes at the dragon’s long 
           tail and SLICES into it.  He manages to dislodge some sort of 
           shell-like COATING, but the dragon remains unhurt.

           CACKLING, Morgana then motions for her dragon to move.  It 
           obliges and STOMPS AWAY, knocking over street lamps and 
           traffic lights as it leaves Trafalgar Square with Morgana and 
           a screaming Bobbi still on its back.

                                 BOBBI
                            (gradually fading away)
                        SIIIIiiiiiimoooon...!
           The knights just stand there helplessly, absolutely 
           dumbfounded.  

           As the sounds of the creature’s heavy footsteps finally 
           subside, Ricky holds up his little canister of mace.

                                 RICKY
                        Come back and I’ll spray you!

                                 EDMUND
                        What the hell are we supposed to do 
                        now?  That thing is unstoppable.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        What is it?

                                 SIMON
                        It’s a dragon.
                            (then, dramatically)
                        It’s kind of like a salamander.

                                 RICKY
                        Yeah.  Except no.  Because 
                        salamanders aren’t a million bloody 
                        feet tall.

                                 EDMUND
                        Nor do they normally breathe fire.

           Ignoring them, Simon reaches down and picks up the piece of 
           shell-like coating Michael Caine knocked off the dragon.

                                 SIMON
                        Do you have any idea what this is?  

           Simon hands it over to Ricky, who shakes his head.

                                 SIMON (cont’d)
                        It’s a cocoon. 

                                 RICKY
                        Ah.

                                 SIMON
                        Made of mucus.

                                 RICKY
                        Eh.

           Ricky promptly DROPS it.
                                 SIMON
                        Listen, in order to prevent their 
                        skin from drying out on land, some 
                        amphibians encase themselves in 
                        a... a kind of protective shell.  
                        That’s why we couldn’t break 
                        through its hide.  But if we had 
                        enough water to rehydrate the 
                        thing, it would suddenly be 
                        vulnerable to our attacks.   

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        You’re saying we need to get it wet 
                        before we can kill it?

                                 RICKY
                            (an aside)
                        Knew I should have brought another 
                        squirt gun.

                                 EDMUND
                        The taps all went dry the second 
                        Morgana killed the power.  We can’t 
                        exactly hose it down, Simon.

           Suddenly, a HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE abandoned by its driver 
           clops into frame.  It’s the same one Simon saw outside of 
           Buckingham Palace.

                                 SIMON
                        If you can lead a horse to water...

           Simon walks over, starts unhooking the handsome BLACK STEED 
           from this carriage.  The other knights look confused.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        The hell are you doing?

                                 SIMON
                        The River Thames is just a stone’s 
                        throw from here.  If I can catch up 
                        to that beast, I should be able to 
                        steer him into the drink.

                                 RICKY
                        What about us?

                                 SIMON
                        Go home to your families.  I don’t 
                        want any more of you getting hurt.  
                        This... this is absurd.  We’re not 
                        even real knights.

           But Michael Caine stands strong.
                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        Maybe not.  But I sure as shit know 
                        how to act like one.

           The venerable actor extends his hand, palm down, in the 
           center of this foursome.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE (cont’d)
                        Long live the Roundtable.

           Ricky thinks about this, nods, puts his hand on top of 
           Michael’s.

                                 RICKY
                        He’s right.  This is our code.  All 
                        for one, one for all.

           Edmund rolls his eyes, but reluctantly places his hand on top 
           of Ricky and Michael’s.

                                 EDMUND
                        We’re not Musketeers, idiot.

           Grateful for his new comrades, Simon adds his hand to the 
           others’.

                                 SIMON
                        Right then.  God save the Queen...  

           He then dramatically MOUNTS his horse’s saddle.

                                 SIMON (cont’d)
                        ...and our worthless asses.

                                 EDMUND
                        Do you even know how to ride that 
                        thing?

                                 SIMON
                            (a little too confident)
                        Like a scooter with legs, mate.

           EXT. NORTHUMBERLAND AVENUE - MOMENTS LATER

           Smash cut to Simon’s horse GALLOPING AT FULL SPEED through 
           the urban destruction left in the dragon’s wake.  

           Simon hangs on for dear life as his horse LEAPS over the 
           scattered debris.

                                 SIMON
                            (screaming)
                        FFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU--
           EXT. STREETS OF LONDON - CONTINUOUS

           Before Simon can finish that thought, we rejoin the other 
           three knights, who are RACING down another street.

                                 RICKY
                            (winded)
                        A little... slower... maybe?

                                 EDMUND
                        Where exactly are we going?

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        I’m guessing you own a boat, yeah?

                                 EDMUND
                        Six.  Why?

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        Just get us onboard, Captain.  I’ll 
                        handle the rest...

           EXT. DRAGON’S BACK - CONTINUOUS

           As the dragon continues to slouch across London--CRUSHING 
           comically small European cars with each step and INCINERATING 
           British billboards with its fiery breath--Morgana calmly 
           rides on the beast’s back, sitting behind Bobbi with her 
           dagger still pressed to the police officer’s neck.

                                 BOBBI
                        He’s gonna kill you, you know.

                                 MORGANA
                        Your knight in shining armor?  Oh, 
                        I’m certain he’ll try, just as I’m 
                        certain he’ll fail.

                                 BOBBI
                        Yes, well, I’m certain that... your 
                        hair is stupid.

                                 MORGANA
                            (a little self-conscious)
                        What?

                                 BOBBI
                        You heard me.
                            (under her breath)
                        Bitch.

                                 ANOTHER VOICE (O.S.)
                        HEY!
           ANGLE BELOW, as Simon pulls his horse to a stop right in 
           front of the dragon.  He yells up at the creature.

                                 SIMON
                        Down here, you mutant bastard! 

           Morgana smiles back at Bobbi.  She pets her dragon.

                                 MORGANA
                        And now, my love, you may sup.

           With a forked tongue, the dragon LICKS ITS LIPS.

           Simon kicks his horse to life, steering the steed towards the 
           nearby shoreline.

                                 BOBBI
                        What the hell is he doing?

           Below, Simon begins to freak out.  This was a bad idea.

                                 SIMON
                        What the hell am I doing?!

           EXT. EDMUND’S SAILBOAT - NIGHT

           Elsewhere, Ricky, Michael Caine and Edmund are hopping aboard 
           one of Edmund’s yacht-like SAILBOATS.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        Edmund, you have the wheel.  Ricky, 
                        help me hoist the main sail.

                                 RICKY
                        I don’t even know what that means!  
                        Give me a harpoon or something!

                                 EDMUND
                        What for?

                                 RICKY
                        Maybe I can poke out one of 
                        Godzilla’s eyes.  I used to throw a 
                        little javelin.

                                 EDMUND
                        You’re barely fit to throw a party.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        Shut up and raise the anchor!  
                        We’ve only got one shot at this...
           EXT. EDGE OF THE RIVER THAMES - NIGHT

           With the dragon stomping through the city right behind him, 
           Simon RACES his steed right to the edge of the water.

                                 SIMON
                        Bloody whoa!

           The horse SKIDS to a stop and Simon quickly dismounts.  He 
           slaps his animal on the ass. 

                                 SIMON (cont’d)
                        Go on, mate.  I’ll take it from 
                        here.

           As the dragon lumbers right up to him, Simon meekly raises 
           his sword.

                                 SIMON (cont’d)
                        Look, we... we both know you don’t 
                        want to eat me.  If you’re anything 
                        like my little guys, your favorite 
                        dish is fish, yeah?  Maybe some 
                        lake trout or a nice cod or--

           Suddenly, the dragon lowers its massive head and ROARS right 
           in Simon’s face, drenching him with its fetid saliva.

                                 SIMON (cont’d)
                            (grossed out)
                        Nuggaaahh!  That is never washing 
                        out!  

           Just as the dragon is about to use its mighty jaws to SNAP 
           him in half, Simon clutches his sword tight and DIVES into 
           the freezing water.

           EXT. RIVER THAMES - CONTINUOUS

           Coming up for air in the brackish river, Simon looks 
           absolutely disgusted. 

                                 SIMON
                        Oh, for Christ’s... how can this 
                        smell worse than that thing’s 
                        breath?!

           It’s out of the frying pan, as Simon looks up to see the 
           dragon finally FOLLOW HIM into the water. 

           But as the dragon sinks up to its waist in the Thames, we see 
           its protective shell of hardened slime begin to DISSOLVE... 
           EXT. EDMUND’S SAILBOAT - NIGHT

           With Edmund at the wheel, the other knights’ sailboat KNIFES 
           through the water at a good clip.  From the lookout, Ricky 
           suddenly spots something:

                                 RICKY
                        Big ugly lizard thing, dead ahead!

           Edmund shakes his head in wonder as sees the dragon trudging 
           slowly through the water.

                                 EDMUND
                        I don’t believe it.  He actually 
                        did it...

           At the ship’s bow, Michael Caine grabs his battle axe and 
           carefully walks out to the wooden bowsprit projecting form 
           the front of the vessel.  

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        Don’t pop the champagne yet.  Keep 
                        us sailing at full-speed right for 
                        it.

           Michael begins CHOPPING into the bowsprit with his axe.

                                 EDMUND
                        What the hell are you doing to my 
                        boat?!

           The bowsprit SPLINTERS in half, leaving only a jagged hunk of 
           wood protruding from the boat.

           A look of horror washes over Edmund as he realizes what 
           Michael is up to.

                                 EDMUND (cont’d)
                        Hold on, you’re turning our ship 
                        into a weapon?

                                 RICKY
                        What makes you think we can kill a 
                        monster with a sailboat?

           Michael Caine looks back at us, a twinkle in his eye.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        A little picture called Jaws: The 
                        Revenge.

           For an uncomfortably long beat, Edmund and Ricky just STARE 
           at him.
                                 MICHAEL CAINE (cont’d)
                        Trust me, all we did was tap that 
                        shark and it pretty well exploded.

           Edmund and Ricky are aghast.

                                 EDMUND
                        You insane old bastard.

                                 RICKY
                        It was a crap movie, not a sodding 
                        documentary!

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        That “crap movie” bought my family 
                        a home... and now it’s going to 
                        save the world.

           EXT. RIVER THAMES - CONTINUOUS

           Simon is SWIMMING as fast as he can, spitting out the rancid 
           river with each stroke.

                                 SIMON
                        Pwah!  It tastes like hepatitis!

           Trudging through the water behind him, the relentless dragon 
           is almost on top of poor Simon.

           EXT. DRAGON’S BACK - CONTINUOUS

           Looking down at her slow-moving prey, Morgana simply SMILES.

                                 MORGANA
                        Chivalry is dead.

           But the hostage Bobbi notices something else in the water 
           moving right for them.  

                                 BOBBI
                        Not just yet, twat face.

           EXT. EDMUND’S SAILBOAT - CONTINUOUS

           As the sailboat closes in on the dragon, Michael Caine 
           bravely stares down the monster.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        Smile, you son of a bitch!
                                 RICKY
                        That was the ending of the first 
                        Jaws!  You can’t just recycle good 
                        lines from earlier, vastly superior 
                        films!

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        Tell that to Mr. Bruce Willis.  Or 
                        Governor Schwartzenegger.  Or--

                                 EDMUND
                        HANG ON!

           EXT. RIVER THAMES - CONTINUOUS

           We’re with an awestruck Simon in the river, treading water as 
           he watches his friends’ sailboat COLLIDE with the dragon, 
           PIERCING its now-unprotected belly with the ship’s jagged 
           wooden bowsprit!

           The dragon HOWLS in pain as a massive amount of GREEN BLOOD 
           seems to almost EXPLODE out of its punctured chest.

           EXT. DRAGON’S BACK - CONTINUOUS

           High above, Morgana manages to hang on as the mortally 
           wounded dragon REARS BACK, but the sorceress is forced to let 
           go of Bobbi, who screams as she PLUNGES towards the water.

           EXT. RIVER THAMES - CONTINUOUS

           Simon looks up in horror to see his girlfriend PLUMMETING 
           right towards him.  Still treading water with his legs, he 
           holds out his arms to CATCH her.

                                 SIMON
                        Don’t worry, Bobbi!  I’ve got you!  
                        I’ve--  

           Realizing a moment too late that this is a profoundly stupid 
           plan of action, Simon braces for impact as Bobbi LANDS right 
           on top of him.  

           SPLOOOOOSH!

           EXT. EDMUND’S SAILBOAT - CONTINUOUS

           Back on the yacht, the other three knights are celebrating 
           like crazy as they watch the dragon stumble backwards off of 
           their boat’s bowsprit and tremble in the THROES OF DEATH.
                                 EDMUND
                        I don’t believe it!  We slayed a 
                        bloody dragon!

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        Was there ever any doubt?

                                 RICKY
                        Oh, loads!  Loads of loads!

           But the celebration dies down as the men notice the monster 
           SWAYING back and forth.  As its eyes roll back into its head, 
           the dragon finally COLLAPSES... right onto the MILLENNIUM 
           WHEEL, the world’s tallest Ferris Wheel.

           London’s multi-million dollar tourist attraction TOPPLES 
           along with the dragon, SMASHING into a billion little pieces 
           under the creature’s immense weight.  The knights all WINCE.

                                 RICKY (cont’d)
                        They’re probably insured.  
                            (a beat)
                        Against dragons.

                                 EDMUND
                        Well, that’s on Sir Michael.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        Me?  What the hell happened to “us” 
                        slaying that thing?

                                 ANOTHER VOICE
                        Oi!  Wankers!

           The men all turn to see SIMON clinging to the side of the 
           yacht with BOBBI at his side!

                                 SIMON
                        Permission to come aboard and all 
                        that?

                                 EDMUND
                        Simon!  

                                 RICKY
                        And that girl he porked!

           Edmund, Ricky and Michael Caine all race over to help pull up 
           the soaking wet couple.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        You two all right?
                                 BOBBI
                        If by “all right,” you mean smell 
                        like the back of Simon’s balls, 
                        then yes.

                                 SIMON
                            (a little hurt)
                        You’re welcome?

           Everyone freezes as a ringtone version of The Who’s “Magic 
           Bus” suddenly breaks the silence.  Michael Caine reaches into 
           his pocket to answer his cell phone.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        Merlin?

                                 MERLIN (FROM PHONE)
                        Oh, dude!  I was sure I’d be 
                        leaving voicemail for your charred 
                        corpses.

           INT. MERLIN’S APARTMENT - DAY

           And we were just about to say the same thing about MERLIN.  

           He’s standing next to Morgana’s Beetle Creature, who’s now 
           TETHERED to one of Merlin’s chairs with wired controllers 
           from a hundred different old video game consoles.  The wizard 
           is pacing nervously as he talks on his cell.

                                 MERLIN
                        I interrogated Morgana’s one-man 
                        British Invasion about this 
                        Doomsayer thing.  Turns out it’s 
                        actually a--

                                 MICHAEL CAINE (FROM PHONE)
                        Dragon.  We know.

                                 MERLIN
                        Oh.  Okay, good, listen, whatever 
                        you do, do not kill it.

           There’s an uncomfortable silence.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE (FROM PHONE)
                        Say again?

                                 MERLIN
                        The dragon.  Morgana’s gonna say 
                        that she needs you guys to conjure 
                        it, but that’s a lie.  Really, she 
                        needs you to destroy it.
                                 MICHAEL CAINE (FROM PHONE)
                        Uh...

                                 MERLIN
                        Look, if a sorceress bathes in 
                        dragon’s blood, she’ll be made 
                        impervious to the entire 
                        Roundtable.  She’ll be completely 
                        unstoppable!   

           EXT. EDMUND’S SAILBOAT - NIGHT

           Everyone looks at Michael Caine, who listens to other end of 
           the line and FROWNS.

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        You don’t say...

                                 RICKY
                        What’s he so glum about?

           Suddenly, Edmund notices something in the water.

                                 EDMUND
                        That, I’m guessing.

           All four knights and Bobbi then look over the edge of the 
           boat to see the water BOILING and BUBBLING as it mixes with 
           the dragon’s green blood.  

           Without warning, Morgana comes BURSTING out of this broth.  
           She LAUNCHES into the night sky before finally LANDING in a 
           dramatic pose on the deck of Edmund’s ship, right in the 
           middle of our knights.

                                 MORGANA
                        I’m in your debt for completing my 
                        metamorphosis, Roundtable.  
                            (a beat)
                        So I promise to end you quickly.

           Not hesitating even a little, Michael Caine drops his cell 
           phone and HURLS his battle axe at Morgana, throwing it with 
           enough force to EMBED the weapon deep in her heart!

                                 RICKY
                            (enthused)
                        Right between the jubblies!  

           But Morgana just looks down at the battle axe, and then 
           calmly REMOVES it from her chest.  Beneath her torn clothes, 
           we watch as her skin instantly HEALS.  
           Morgana tosses the weapon overboard as the others watch with 
           awestruck fear.   

                                 MORGANA
                        Thanks to your efforts, no knight 
                        on the planet can ever again harm 
                        me.
                            (a beat)
                        I’m afraid I can’t return the 
                        favor.

           Morgana extends her hand and FIRES a bolt of crackling mystic 
           energy right at Michael Caine.  

           Shockingly, the energy RIPS THROUGH the actor’s body, tearing 
           a massive hole in his chest.  He collapses to the deck.  

                                 RICKY
                        MICHAEL CAINE!

           Ricky, Edmund and Bobbi are frozen in horror, but Simon 
           rushes to his fallen comrade's side.  He cradles Michael 
           Caine’s still-smoking body.

                                 SIMON
                        Just hang on, Sir Michael.  
                        You’re... you’re gonna be fine.

           Taking shallow breaths, Michael Caine looks up at Simon. 

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        It was a privilege... serving with 
                        you rascals.  

                                 SIMON
                            (through tears)
                        No.  No, please.  

                                 MICHAEL CAINE
                        No matter what happens... 
                            (a beat)
                        ...don’t... blink...

           And with that, Michael Caine dies.

           Simon looks into the late actor’s eyes.  They’re open but 
           lifeless.  Holy shit.  The moment hits every member of the 
           surviving Roundtable HARD.  

           Filled with sorrow and rage, Simon wipes away his tears.  
           Slowly, he RISES, his glistening broadsword at his side.  
           Absolutely UNBLINKING, Simon stares Morgana down.
                                 MORGANA
                        Your weapons are useless against 
                        me, boy.  All you can do is annoy. 

                                 SIMON
                        Aye.
                            (a beat)
                        It’s what I’m best at.

           With that, Simon lifts his sword and THROWS it as hard as he 
           can.  We watch in slow-motion as the blade SPINS towards 
           Morgana’s face... 

           ...and MISSES her by a country mile. 

                                 MORGANA
                            (smiling)
                        What is it that you don’t you 
                        understand?  In the unlikely 
                        scenario you could even hit me, you 
                        still couldn’t kill me.  No knight 
                        can. 

                                 ANOTHER VOICE (O.S.)
                        Yeah?

           Morgana spins around to see the woman she turned her back on.  
           It’s BOBBI, who’s wielding the broadsword that we now realize 
           her boyfriend tossed to her.

                                 BOBBI
                        Good thing I ain’t a knight.

           And before Morgana can open her mouth to respond, Bobbi 
           SWINGS the heavy sword, DECAPITATING the sorceress with one 
           smooth slice.

           The knights all shield their eyes as the headless Morgana 
           then EXPLODES in a blinding shower of mystical sparks.

           And as the energy disappears, the dark clouds evaporate and a 
           glorious EARLY MORNING SUN suddenly appears over Britain.

           Simon proudly beams at the sword-wielding Bobbi... until the 
           memory of his recently fallen friend comes rushing back.

           He races to the nearby corpse and picks up the cell phone 
           that Michael Caine dropped earlier.  Simon frantically dials.

                                 SIMON
                        Come on, pick up.  Pick up!

           Just then, we hear a digital ringtone of The Lovin’ 
           Spoonfuls’ “Do You Believe in Magic?” behind us.  
           Edmund and Ricky turn to see MERLIN, with Princess on his 
           shoulder, exiting a glowing portal.

           Stepping onto the deck of the boat, a flabbergasted Merlin 
           drinks in his surroundings: Big Ben, Parliament, etc.  

           He’s really back.

                                 MERLIN
                        God.  
                            (then)
                        I’m home.  

                                 EDMUND
                            (confused)
                        Merlin?  I thought...

                                 MERLIN
                        Me, too.  But the curse is broken.  
                        Which means you magnificent 
                        bastards actually destroyed her.  
                        For keeps.
                            (looking around)
                        So why does everybody look like 
                        their grandfather just died?

           Ricky somberly gestures at the back of the boat, and Merlin 
           turns to see Simon and Bobbi holding Michael Caine’s lifeless 
           body.

                                 MERLIN (cont’d)
                            (heartbroken)
                        Oh.  Oh, no.

           Simon looks up at the wizard with pleading eyes.

                                 SIMON
                        Can... can you save him?

           Push in tight on Merlin, a glimmer of hope in his eye.

                                 MERLIN
                        I can try.

           The music begins to swell, but then we abruptly HARD CUT TO:

           EXT. ABNEY PARK CEMETERY - DAY

           A TOMBSTONE that reads:                                      

                                    SIR MICHAEL CAINE
                         STAR OF STAGE & SCREEN/SAVIOUR OF EARTH
                                       1933 - 2008
           We’re back in the cemetery where our knights first gathered.  
           It’s been several weeks, and Bobbi and Simon are visiting the 
           grave of their late friend.  They’re holding hands.

                                 SIMON
                        Well, he tried.

                                 BOBBI
                        Not much of a wizard if you ask me.

                                 SIMON
                        He’s Merlin, Bobbi, not Jesus.

           Bobbi can’t argue that.

                                 BOBBI
                        And I suppose you can’t say Sir 
                        Michael didn’t live a hell of a 
                        life.   

           Simon reaches into his jacket for something.

                                 SIMON
                        Which reminds me, his family gave 
                        me this, but I think he would have 
                        wanted you to have it.

           It’s Michael Caine’s MEDAL OF KNIGHTHOOD.

                                 SIMON (cont’d)
                        I’d say you earned it, yeah?  And 
                        long before you ever beheaded that 
                        bee-yotch.
                            (embarrassed)
                        As it were.

           Bobbi is almost moved to tears.

                                 BOBBI
                        Simon, I... I don’t know what to--

           Suddenly, a FRISBEE hits Bobbi right in the face.

                                 BOBBI (cont’d)
                        OW!

                                 ANOTHER VOICE (O.S.)
                        Sorry!

           Bobbi and Simon look over to see Ricky, who’s apparently been 
           playing Frisbee with his two boys.
                                 RICKY
                        That was my little one.  Future 
                        discus star, he is.

                                 ADORABLE CHILD
                        Did you see that, dad?  Got her 
                        square in the face!

           Just then, Sir Edmund appears in the distance, walking arm in 
           arm with his female assistant.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Apologies for our tardiness, all.  
                        Sir Helps-a-lot made us stop to 
                        change an old woman’s flat tire.

                                 EDMUND
                            (humorless)
                        She’s lying, of course.

           The three knights all look to each other with contented 
           smiles, when suddenly... Merlin appears in a burst of 
           brimstone.  

           He’s dressed in an embarrassing suit that looks like it’s 
           made out of the British flag.

                                 MERLIN
                        Guys!  Red alert!

                                 RICKY
                            (re: Merlin’s outfit)
                        Elton John’s been robbed? 

                                 MERLIN
                        I have a lot of national pride, all 
                        right!
                            (calming himself)
                        Look, we got a problem.

                                 EDMUND
                        Don’t tell me Morgana’s back 
                        already.  It’s barely been three 
                        months!

                                 MERLIN
                        Not Morgana.  Her son.  
                            (a beat)
                        Well, my son, actually.

                                 BOBBI
                        Wait, which one is it?
                                 MERLIN
                        Um.  Technically?  Both.

                                 SIMON
                            (putting this together)
                        You slept with Morgana?

                                 MERLIN
                        Wine was much stronger back then, 
                        okay!  

           The others shake their heads judgmentally.

                                 MERLIN (cont’d)
                        Whatever, it’s not my brat I’m 
                        worried about, it’s what he’s let 
                        loose in the middle of the city: 
                        the Werewolves of London.

                                 EDMUND
                        What, like the song?

                                 MERLIN
                        No.  Like the werewolves.

                                 RICKY
                        But it’s not a full moon!

                                 SIMON
                            (looking up at the sun)
                        It’s not even a moon!

                                 MERLIN
                        Either way, only the Roundtable can 
                        stop them.

                                 SIMON
                        Us?  But, we’re kind of down a man, 
                        Merlin.

                                 BOBBI
                            (pointing to her medal)
                        Excuse me!

                                 SIMON
                        Well, in all fairness, that makes 
                        you more of a dame than a knight, 
                        but--

           Bobbi PUNCHES Simon in the arm.

                                 SIMON (cont’d)
                            (rubbing his arm)
                        Gonna be a bruise there.
                                 MERLIN
                        Bobbi’s welcome to join us, but 
                        I’ve already sent Princess for 
                        reinforcements.

           The assembled knights all look at the wizard expectantly.

                                 EDMUND
                        What kind of reinforcements?

           INT. MANSION BEDROOM - DAY

           We’re inside of a palatial bedroom, where a MYSTERY FIGURE is 
           fast asleep beneath the covers between TWO SLEEPING 
           SUPERMODELS.

           Princess flies in through an open window and lands on a clock 
           radio, which comes alive with The Rolling Stone’s “Start Me 
           Up.”

           As the vocals kick in, the mystery figure rouses to reveal 
           that he is, of course, SIR MICK JAGGER.

           Mick stares at the falcon on his clock radio for a long beat, 
           before he finally says:

                                 MICK JAGGER
                        Princess...?

           The bird squawks.  

           Wait, these two KNOW each other?

           Reaching behind his headboard, the shirtless Mick produces a 
           MEDIEVAL SHIELD.  

                                 MICK JAGGER (cont’d)
                        About bloody time.

           And just as Keith’s guitar solo punches the song into 
           overdrive, a WEREWOLF crashes through one of the bedroom 
           windows.  

           The two supermodels scream, but Sir Mick just SMILES his 
           endless grin, as we...   

                                                      ...SMASH TO CREDITS.
