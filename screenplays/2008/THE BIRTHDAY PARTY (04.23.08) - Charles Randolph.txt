                                   THE BIRTHDAY PARTY

                                  Based on the memoir 
                                   by Stanley Alpert

           A WOMAN’S VOICE reaches us...

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE
                        I wanna be honest. May I be honest? I mean 
                        horribly, horribly honest?

           INT. RESTAURANT - UPPER EAST SIDE - NIGHT

           STANLEY ALPERT (38) nods. He’s half-listening to a woman 
           in the empty bar area; her voice is a bit tipsy.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE
                        I’m having a hard time coming to terms with 
                        how focused men are on the physical. 

           Stan’s not a handsome man but an intense one. People like 
           to say he “sucks up the room”. It’s not a compliment.

           For starters, he’s a lousy listener.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (CONT’D)
                        You know how women always fear men don’t 
                        want us to be smart, successful -- they 
                        don’t wanna be “challenged”. Bullshit.

           He actually fidgets when he’s not the one speaking. 

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (CONT’D)
                        It’s so much scarier. They don’t care. All 
                        they want is a certain type of butt. What 
                        comes attached to it is pretty much gravy. 

           He chuckles. Late. We see two empty wine glasses.

           STANLEY’S DATE (40) is dolled-up. Ernest. Smart. Wounded.

                                 STANLEY’S DATE   
                        Sorry. 

                                 STANLEY
                        No, I understand. 

                                 STANLEY’S DATE
                        Do you? 

                                 STANLEY
                        Totally.

                                 STANLEY’S DATE
                        It’s just so frustrating, right. I don’t 
                        know you. You’re a blind date. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 STANLEY’S DATE (CONT'D)
                        I haven’t even formed an opinion of you. 
                        But you have. Five seconds after you saw 
                        me, you put me on some scale. Not My Type. 
                        One Night Stand. A Few Booty Calls. A Six-
                        Month Affair. Okay, you don’t know if we 
                        could fall in love, but you at least know 
                        if it’s a possibility. And the sad thing is 
                        you can’t tell me. If I ask directly, if I 
                        say, “Stanley, are you attracted to me 
                        enough that you could envision us dating?” 
                        ...you’d probably lie. Right? Am I right?

           Stan smiles and stretches.

                                 STANLEY
                        No, you’re right. Well, not in this case 
                        cause you’re very attractive. At least to 
                        me. But I get the frustration. I do. 

           She knows he’s lying -- she’ll never hear from him again. 

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        Men suck. Seriously. 

           Stan reaches for the check. 

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        I’ve got an early arbitration. Don’t let us 
                        get to you, Gail. We’re idiots. Really. 

                                 STANLEY’S DATE 
                                  (a forced smile)
                        Ummm.

           He takes a moment to review the bill. 

           As he pulls out his wallet, still running the numbers...

                                 STANLEY
                        Hey, do I have your best email?

           INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

           A complex junction of subway passages. Dark. Empty.  

           We hear FOOTSTEPS. Someone running.

           And a TITLE appears...

                                     January 21, 1998
           Stan flies out a narrow tunnel, down a few stairs, over a 
           transom, around a corner, down another set of stairs -- 
           where his feet do the shallow jig of a man running for... 

           A train waits on the platform.

                                 STANLEY
                        C’mon. C’mon. C’mon.

           The departure buzzer.

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        C’mon!

           At this late hour, the Conductor takes pity. 

           INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT

           Stan leaps in as the doors close. He’s paunchy and out of 
           shape, puts his hands on his knees to catch his breath. 

           The train rolls out of the station. 

           Stan wipes his glasses, turns to sit, and FREEZES. 

           This side of the car is occupied only by TWO SERIOUS GANG-
           BANGERS. Both men watch him, legs sprawled in the aisle. 

           Putting on a tough face, Stan starts their way... 

           And stops immediately, remembers something, turns to go 
           back and check the car’s subway map. He pretends to study 
           it. Makes a show of nodding. Goes to the other way.

           He moseys to where the only other occupants sit, a WHITE 
           COUPLE. He leans back against a door near them. A sign 
           over his shoulder reads: “Do Not Lean Against the Door”. 

           CLOSE on Stan, his face is passive but a vein on his neck 
           pulses slightly. He cuts his eyes to the Gang-Bangers. 

           Thankfully, they aren’t looking his way. 

           Stan sighs, opens his book, “The Bright and Shining Lie”.

           He hears a man CACKLE. 

           The couple is a NEBBISHY MAN and CURLY-HAIRED BEAUTY. He 
           seems to be flirting; she’s polite but uninterested. 

           Stan gets snippets of their conversation: ”Who knows with 
           the new volunteers”...”UJA”...”Mary? How’s she Jewish?”
           When the train slows, the Nebbishy Man stands. 

                                 NEBBISHY MAN
                        Good to see you. 

           She flutters fingers. He exits. The Gang-Bangers, too.

           As the train moves on, Stan and the Curly-Headed Beauty 
           exchange the tight smile of strangers suddenly alone in a 
           subway car. They ride a moment. Furtive glances. 

           Stan puts his book away and feigns boredom.

                                 STANLEY 
                        Excuse me. I thought I heard you mention 
                        the United Jewish Appeal. You’re not going 
                        to the Washington conference are you? 

                                 CURLY-HEADED WOMAN
                        Oh. Next month? Yes. I mean, probably. 

                                 STANLEY 
                        Me, too. Probably. Weird. Hi. Stanley. 

           He puts a hand on his chest. 

                                 CURLY-HEADED WOMAN
                        Lisa.

                                 STANLEY
                        Sorry, I was totally eavesdropping.

           She just nods. Polite. Cool. 

           An awkward beat.

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        I’m coming from a blind date. Yikes. You?
                        Big night out? You look great.

                                 LISA
                        The 92nd Street Y. I program the lectures.

                                 STANLEY
                        Wow. You work for the Y. Volunteer at the 
                        UJA. Suddenly, all I can hear is the roar 
                        of my mother salivating.

           More awkwardness. Stan’s pushing too hard.

                                 LISA 
                        What do you do, Stanley?

                                 LISA
                        That sounds honorable.

                                 STANLEY 
                        Yes! Honorable. You get me. 
                                  (then)
                        Actually, JFK’s in my jurisdiction. I spend 
                        way too much time prosecuting the crazies 
                        who try and smuggle wildlife past customs. 

                                 LISA
                        People smuggle wildlife?

                                 STANLEY
                        More than drugs. It’s more profitable.

                                 LISA
                        You’re kidding? 

           He takes the opportunity to sit, albeit not too close.

                                 STANLEY
                        Oh, yeah. People will fly with a poisonous 
                        snake taped to a leg. Drug birds and hide 
                        them in tennis ball cans. Import cars with 
                        the tanks full of exotic fish.

                                 LISA
                        How do they get the poor fish out?

                                 STANLEY 
                        Put the car on a lift and torch a hole in 
                        the tank. I feel sorry for the mechanic. The 
                        most commonly smuggled fish is piranha.
                                  (acting it out)
                        Ssshhhh! Ching! Woooossh! Aaaahh! 

           It’s a funny little pantomime. Lisa has a generous laugh. 

                                 LISA
                        Omigod! That’s so freaky.

                                 STANLEY
                        You’d be surprised how many people treat 
                        the rainforest like a Costco. 

           He shrugs ruefully. She’s charmed. And if she’s like most 
           people, this should last about fifteen minutes.
           INT. SUBWAY PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

           CLOSE on a boom-box blaring BUSTA RHYMES's “Dangerous”.

                                 BUSTA RHYMES
                           Too much of us is dangerous. We dangerous. 
                           So dangerous. My entire unit is dangerous.

           Who’s shouldering the box? A Skinny Hipster White Kid.

           Stan and Lisa come the other way, their chat interrupted 
           by the aggressive rap echoing off the tile. 

           Naturally, Stan has to say something...

                                 STANLEY
                        You’re dangerous! We get it, Radio Raheem!

           The Kid ignores him as they cross paths. 

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        Appropriate something we can all enjoy!

           The Kid flips him off without turning. Stan chuckles for 
           Lisa. Uncomfortable, she affects an empathetic grimace.

           EXT. UNION SQUARE - NIGHT

           Stan and Lisa come out of the subway portal...

                                 STANLEY
                        You’ve never even tried the Entenmann’s 
                        soft-baked chocolate-chips?

           They’re hit by a blast of crisp, cold air.

           Stan holds a bag of Entenmann’s Chocolate Chips, watches 
           Lisa take a bite of a very appetizing cookie.

                        Huh? Can you believe these are Jewish? Our 
                        food usually sucks.

           She ignores him, closes her eyes, chews in pure bliss.

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        Look at Israel. Smartest thing they ever 
                        did was steal the Arabs’ cuisine.

           She swallows. Moans happily.

                                 LISA
                        I don’t think you want put the word steal 
                        in a sentence starting with “Israel” and 
                        ending with “Arabs”.

           She raises her eyebrows and takes another bite.

                                 STANLEY
                        Oooh. You’re one of those people. 

                                 LISA
                        I love Israel.

                                 STANLEY
                        Yeah well, Israel’s easy to love. It’s 
                        liking it that’s hard. 
                                  (she moans again)
                        That’s it. I’m buying you your own box.

           She shakes her head.

                                 LISA
                                  (mouth full)
                        Just let me enjoy this one.
           EXT. TOWNHOUSE - TENTH STREET - NIGHT

           Stan stands with Lisa in front of her building.

                                 LISA
                        Well, thanks for the cookie. 

                                 STANLEY
                        Sure. 

           She touches his arm and steps up her stoop.

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        Hey, you wanna go for some tea?

                                 LISA
                        Tea?

                                 STANLEY
                        Yeah. Tea.

           She almost seems to consider it.

                                 LISA
                        It’s kinda late. Give me your card.

           He pulls out his wallet and steps closer. He hands her 
           his business CARD. She angles it to the porch light.

                                 LISA (CONT’D)
                        Is the best email address for you?

           Stanley stops short. The resonance to earlier slams him, 
           as it does us. He deflates. She’ll never call.

                                 STANLEY
                        Sure.

           EXT. TENTH STREET - NIGHT

           A grey sidewalk. Occasional pools of dim streetlight. 

           Footsteps. Stan emerges from darkness, peeved. He’s now 
           feeling the cold, pulls his trench coat tighter.

           As he disappears into another patch of darkness...

                                 A VOICE GRUNTS
                        ...Yo...
           Stan spins to look over his left shoulder as a HAND grabs 
           his right elbow. He trips. Stumbles.

           The cookies and book fall to the sidewalk.

           A STOCKY BLACK TEENAGER holds Stan by the arm. Close. He 
           wears sunglasses under a dirty orange knit cap. 

                                 STOCKY TEENAGER
                        Don’t talk.

           He waits for Stan to see the automatic submachine gun now 
           sticking out from his puffy down coat, a TEC-9. 

           Another black teenager appears, a KID WEARING A TIE.   

           The stocky boy pulls Stan into the gutter. 

                                 STOCKY TEENAGER (CONT’D)
                        Get in the fuckin’ car, Motherfucker.

           The Teenagers hustle Stan between parked cars and down to 
           where a brand new LEXUS idles ominously, double-parked in 
           a fog of its own steam, chrome catching the light. 

           The Kid Wearing a Tie runs ahead and opens the left rear 
           door. Terrified, Stan looks up and down the empty street:  
                  No one sees this? Should I run? Scream? Fight?

           The older kid seems to anticipate his thoughts...

                                 KID WEARING A TIE
                        Just get in the car.

           The Stocky Teenager pushes Stan into the sedan. Hard.

           INT. LEXUS - NIGHT

           Stan tumbles into the back seat, settles to see a serious 
           .45 semiautomatic, inches from his face. In the passenger 
           seat is a THIRD BLACK TEENAGER. Muscular. Menacing.

                                 THIRD TEENAGER
                        Don’t look at me, bitch!

           Stan lowers his eyes.

           The Kid with a Tie gets in the driver’s seat. The stocky 
           boy gets in the back, his gun aimed at Stan’s side.

           The doors LOCK. The car begins to roll.
           Tense silence. Everyone’s breathing hard from adrenaline 
           and the cold. Stan can’t stop swallowing.

           The Lexus turns down Fifth Avenue.

           For a moment, we see Stan through his car window -- small 
           and terrified as million-dollar buildings wash over him.

           The buff kid in the passenger seat hisses...

                                 THIRD TEENAGER (CONT’D)
                        Give me yo wallet.

           Stan does so without hesitancy. The boy goes through it. 

           Stan peeks up at him: he’s tall, wearing matching leather 
           jacket and leather Yankees cap. Earrings. 

                                 KID WEARING A TIE
                        Sen, you have his cash card.

                                 THIRD TEENAGER
                        Right here, Lux.

           SEN (16) hands a Chase bank card to LUCKY (18).

                                 LUCKY
                        What’s your name? Stanley?

                                 STANLEY
                        Yes. 

           Lucky’s accent is vaguely Southern; his speech, stilted, 
           like he’s trying hard to sound professional, albeit with 
           the kind of professionalism formed in retail.

                                 LUCKY 
                        All right, Stanley, let me explain to you 
                        what’s about to happen. I see you have an 
                        ATM card. Fine. What’s your PIN number?

           We watch Stan consider lying. Briefly.

                                 STANLEY
                        Seven. Four. Seven. Four.

           Lucky punches the number into green iridescent face of a 
           cellular phone, nestled in the car’s fancy cradle.

           Stan dares to watch the boy’s hands, oddly delicate.

                                 LUCKY
                        Do you know what kind of car this is?
           The question’s bizarre since a large Lexus logo is etched 
           into the seat back right in front of Stan.

                                 STANLEY
                        It’s a Lexus?

           He answers like a game show contest unsure of the rules.

                                 LUCKY
                        That’s right. Now, do you have PIN number 
                        to get cash off any of your credit cards? 

                                 STANLEY
                        No. I’m sorry, I’ve never gotten any. The 
                        interest is like 24.8 percent.

                                 LUCKY
                        Fine. Let me tell you what we’re going to 
                        do. We are going to drive you to a cash 
                        machine and you are going to help us remove 
                        your money. Do you understand?

           Lucky checks him in the rearview mirror. Stan nods.

                                 LUCKY (CONT’D)
                        You are also going to keep your mouth shut. 
                        My affiliates here will be very unhappy if 
                        you do anything stupid. 

                                 STANLEY
                                  (quickly; sincerely)
                        I’m not doing anything stupid. I want to 
                        fully cooperate here. It’s just money.

                                 LUCKY
                        Fine.

           There’s nothing left to say. Lucky sips from a HIP FLASK. 
           They turn up 6th Avenue and ride in strange silence.

           EXT. 6TH AVENUE - NIGHT

           The Lexus moves among midnight traffic. Familiar store 
           signs reflect off ominously tinted windows: Old Navy; 
           Bed, Bath & Beyond; Barnes & Noble, etc.

           EXT. 23RD STREET - NIGHT

           The Lexus makes an U-turn, double parks at a Chase Bank 
           with a brightly-lit, cash-machine vestibule.
           INT. LEXUS - NIGHT

           Sen checks the vestibule. Empty. In the backseat, REN has 
           his Tec 9 still on Stan, cranes to see out the back. 

                                 LUCKY
                        Stanley, what’s that ATM number?

                                 STANLEY
                        Seven. Four. Seven. Four.

           Lucky checks his phone to make sure it matches. Stan is 
           suddenly glad he didn’t lie. Okay, don’t lie to them.

                                 LUCKY 
                        What kind of funds do you have available?

                                 STANLEY
                        Maybe two thousand dollars.

                                 LUCKY
                        Do you have a savings account?

                                 STANLEY
                        Yes.

                                 LUCKY
                        How much is in there?

           Stan hesitates again. They can learn this with one call.

                                 STANLEY
                        About a hundred and ten thousand.

           Lucky and Sen exchange a happy smirk. 

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        I haven’t invested it cause my dad’s sick 
                        and I thought, I mean you never kn-- 

                                 LUCKY
                        What do you do for living, Stanley?

                                 STANLEY
                        Okay, well, you kinda picked the wrong guy. 
                                  (dramatic)
                        I’m an Assistant U.S. Attorney.

           Lucky’s reaction is unseen, but Stan’s expecting more of 
           an intimidated response than Sen’s mock impressed...
                                 SEN
                        Ooooh, he an attorney.

           A beat. Lucky sips at his flask, considering, then checks 
           the back of the bank card and dials a number.

                                 LUCKY
                        What’s your mother’s maiden name?

                                 STANLEY
                        Robins.

           Everyone waits for Lucky to get a bank operator. Instead, 
           he gets a voice-mail prompt to KEY IN the account number. 

           Then another prompt. And another prompt. Sen GRUNTS.

           Another prompt. Another. Sen’s ready to punch somebody. 

           Lucky holds up a finger as he gets a human.

                                 LUCKY (ON THE PHONE)
                        Stanley Alpert...Manhattan...It’s Robins... 
                        I’m just fine. How are you?...I’d like to 
                        transfer some money from my savings to my 
                        checking...About a hun--fifty thousand 
                        dollars...Yes...Yes...Sure...No...Correct 
                        ...Thank you...You have a good night, too.

           He disconnects. 

                                 LUCKY (CONT’D)
                        Stay in the car.

           Lucky gets out of the car. A passing truck HONKS. 

           Stan watches him enter the bank, then turn to secure the 
           door behind him, like’s he’s afraid of muggers. With the 
           boss gone, Sen grows restless; he turns to study Stan.

           Stan’s careful not to look at him.

                                 SEN
                        Give me yo watch.

           Stan hands it forward -- he’s anxious to be cooperative.

                                 SEN (CONT’D)
                        This gold?

                                 STANLEY
                        I dunno. My Dad gave it to me for finishing 
                        law school. I couldn’t really ask.
                                 SEN
                        How about the ring?

                                 STANLEY
                        Maybe. My Grandmother got it for me. She’s 
                        on a limited income so, I dunno, maybe not. 

           Stan glances up reflexively, to make sure the ambiguity 
           is not being read as resistance. Their eyes meet.

           The .45 jerks right out at him.

                                 SEN
                        Motherfucker! You got big eyes! I should 
                        kill you for fuckin’ big eyes!

           Stan focuses on the floor again. 

                                 STANLEY
                        I’m not looking! Okay?! I’m not looking!

                                 REN
                        Not in the Lexus, Sen.  
                                  (then)
                        Lucky said ‘bout the Lexus.

                                 SEN
                        Take off them fuckin’ glasses!

           Stan does so, hands shaking.

           Sen pulls the gun back. He appraises the watch, concludes 
           its worthless, tosses it back into Stan’s lap. 

           Stan’s putting it back on as Lucky gets in the car -- now 
           masking extreme annoyance.

                                 LUCKY
                        Stanley, do you have a thousand dollar 
                        limit? I could only get eight hundred.

                                 STANLEY
                        I think that’s everybody’s limit.

           Lucky and Sen exchange another look. They clearly assumed 
           card limits didn’t apply to the wealthy white guys.

           Sen mutters to Lucky...

                                 SEN
                        I garaun-fuckin’-tee you, Oprah Winfrey 
                        ain’t got no fuckin’ limit.
                                 STANLEY
                        No, actually, she probably does.

                                 SEN
                        Motherfucker.

           Sen turns to Stan, who keeps his eyes down and hands up.

                                 STANLEY
                        It’s a standard theft-protection device.

                                 SEN
                        Oprah ain’t got no fuckin’ limit.

                                 STANLEY
                        It’s not a race thing.

           Sen aims.

                                 SEN
                        Oprah ain’t got no fuckin’ limit!

                                 STANLEY
                        Okay. Yes. What you say. 

           A beat. Sen spits air and turns back around.

           Lucky’s thinking. He wants this man’s money. Bad.

                                 LUCKY 
                        Do you have a car, Stanley?

                                 STANLEY
                        No.

                                 LUCKY
                        You have a hundred thousand dollars in the 
                        bank but you don’t have a car?

                                 STANLEY
                        Parking around here is six hundred a month.

                                 LUCKY
                        Do you have a girlfriend?

                                 STANLEY
                        No.

                                 LUCKY
                        How old are you?

                                 STANLEY
                        Thirty-eight.
                                 LUCKY
                        Kids?

                                 STANLEY
                        No.

                                 LUCKY
                        Stanley, you’re thirty-eight years old, and 
                        you don’t have a car and you’re not married 
                        and no girlfriend and no kids?

           Stanley nods. He’s trying hard to seem insignificant.

                                 LUCKY (CONT’D)
                        What the hell have you been doing?!

           Sen laughs. Ren does a reptilian snicker. Shy. Damaged.

           Through his window, we watch Lucky study the bank’s neon 
           facade. The Chase logo obscures his face.

           Lucky breathes deep, and makes a bad decision.

                                 LUCKY (CONT’D)
                        All right, let me tell me you what we’re 
                        going to do. We’re going to take you to a 
                        place we have to crash at, and keep you 
                        there, just for tonight. Tomorrow, we’ll 
                        find a Chase drive-through someplace and 
                        withdraw fifty thousand from your account. 

           He glances back at Stanley again.

                                 LUCKY (CONT’D)
                        Do you understand?

           Stan can only nod, too shocked, too petrified to speak.

           EXT. WESTSIDE HIGHWAY - LOWER MANHATTAN - NIGHT

           The Lexus disappears under the World Trade Towers, half 
           its windows still burning bright at this late hour.

           INT. LEXUS - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

           Lucky. Sen. Ren. But no Stan.

                                 LUCKY
                        We need to buy some tape to tie him up.
                                 SEN
                        I know a place off the BQE.

           Sen looks warily over his shoulder. We see Stan’s body is 
           crunched into a fetal position on the backseat.

           Lucky sips at his flask, turns the stereo up for privacy. 

           Rap rattles the car, ghetto style, an ode to thug life by

           We see a trip entirely from Stan’s POV...

           Heavy breathing. 

           INT. THE ROOM - NIGHT

           CLOSE on Stan, blindfolded, winded, terrified. PULL back 
           to see he’s sitting on a mattress in a corner. 

           The three black teenagers hover over him.

                                 LUCKY 
                        Take your coat off.

           Stanley struggles to remove his overcoat.

           This holding room has little furniture, just three large 
           and dirty MATTRESSES, an old DRESSER by the door, clothes 
           strewn about, crumbled bags, a broken toy fire truck.

           The Room, originally a dining room, extends into a living 
           room, also empty but for trash and a STEREO on crates.

           The windows onto the street haven’t been cleaned in years 
           and the overhead LIGHT above Stan is harsh. 

           Welcome to Stanley Alpert’s new home.

                                 REN
                        You want I should duct tape him?

                                 LUCKY
                        Not yet.

           We see the boys clearly for the first time...

           Lucky’s light-skinned, thin, unremarkable, a guy you’d 
           rent a car from. Sen’s dressed very street. Gold teeth. 
           Ren’s poor. His dirty clothes are almost comically baggy. 
           Lucky gestures for his men to back away. Sen sits on the 
           mattress across the room; Ren, on one to Stan’s right.

           Lucky kneels, sips from his flask. Stan’s all ears.

                                 LUCKY (CONT’D)
                        Would you like to know something I have a 
                        good knack for doing? 

                                 STANLEY
                        Yes. Okay. Sure. 

                                 LUCKY
                        Business. And what is it that businessmen 
                        do, Stanley? They take care of business. If 
                        you yell, or try to run, if you lie, mess 
                        with us in any way, I will have you killed. 

           Stan waves his hands to cut short this line of thought.

                                 STANLEY
                        No, no, no, you’ll get no problems from me. 

                                 LUCKY
                        I won’t even be here when it happens. My 
                        affiliates do these things. I’ll be in my 
                        home, in my bed, with my fiancee. 

                                 STANLEY
                        I’m gonna fully cooperate. I swear to you.

           Lucky considers him. The blindfold makes Stan’s sincerity 
           impossible to gauge, but he is nodding slightly. Eager.

                                 LUCKY 
                        Fine.

           He stands. Stan’s got his hands balled up in the coat on 
           his lap, hiding them, hoping Lucky will forget the tape. 

           After a few seconds,...

                                 LUCKY (CONT’D)
                        I need to go see my girls working the clubs. 
                        If he moves off that mattress, shoot him.

           Stan’s so anxious to please he nods like this a truly fine  
           idea. Lucky exits. Stan can hear his footsteps recede down 
           the hallway until the FRONT DOOR opens and closes. 

           A strange silence. Stan’s not moving a muscle.

           A gun’s safety CLICKS. 
                                 STANLEY
                        Hello?

           No response. 

           Another CLICK. 

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        Guys?

           Sen and Ren are on their mattresses, guns in hand, ready.

           CLICK. CLICK.

           CLICK. CLICK.

           CLICK. CLICK.

           It’s a two-man orchestra of terror. 

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        Do not fucking shoot me! Okay?! That would 
                        not be cool! Just be careful. Okay? Okay?

                                 SEN
                        Shut up.

           Quiet.

           Then, another CLICK. Ren giggles. 

           This all the opening Stan needs...

                                 STANLEY 
                        If you guys would talk, I could help you. 

                                 REN
                        He said shut up.

           A beat. Stan fidgets. Shifts his weight. Sighs. Too loud.

           He just can’t help himself...

                                 STANLEY
                        Look, I’m gonna shut up. Okay? I am! But you 
                        guys should know banks have policies about 
                        releasing large sums of cash. They make you 
                        see the branch manager. Okay? You have to go 
                        inside, show your ID, fill in a lot of these 
                        forms. A branch manager has to see you!

           He raises his palms. That’s all I wanted to say. 
           No response. 

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        Look, otherwise, tellers could all fake--

           Sen RACKS the .45. 

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        Okay. Okay.

           A long beat.

           Then,...

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        See. I’m quiet. 

                                                                FADE TO:

           EXT. TENEMENT HOUSE - NIGHT

           The apartment’s dirty windows are brightly lit. The Lexus 
           rolls to a stop across a quiet avenue.

           INT. TENEMENT HOUSE LANDING - NIGHT

           Hip flask in back pocket, Lucky comes up the stairs. He’s 
           busy going through the CARDS from STAN’s WALLET. He finds 
           his AMEX, slides it into his shirt pocket.

           At the landing, he peers cautiously up to the floor above  
           and moves quickly down to the apartment door. As he takes 
           out his keys, he stops. Listens.

           Lucky can hear hushed voices just inside the door. 

           Irritated, he unlocks it to find... 

           INT. MAIN HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Sen and Ren are waiting for him, having a panicked chat a 
           good fifty feet from their assigned position.

                                 SEN
                        Yo, Lucky, it ain’t like down South, man.

           Lucky peers down toward The Room. Still. Normal.
                                 SEN (CONT’D)
                        The drive-thru plan ain’t gonna work! Ain’t 
                        no bank gonna hand out that kinda cheddar in 
                        the motherfuckin’ drive-thru! 

                                 REN
                        Fifty thousand won’t go in they tubes!

           Lucky’s “affiliates” have been spooked. Stanley’s clearly 
           been trying to scare them into letting him go.

                                 LUCKY
                        This isn’t drug money, Ren. The bank will 
                        provide us new bills. C notes. In packs.
                                  (managerial)
                        Bank money is thin. It has a crisp quality.

                                 REN
                        What if they outta crispy?

                                 SEN 
                        Man, what if Stanley starts yellin’ shit?!

                                 LUCKY
                        Don’t use his name. Not among ourselves.

           Puzzled by the command, Sen snarls bemused defiance.

                                 LUCKY (CONT’D)
                        Use his name and you humanize him. Makes it 
                        harder to do what we have to do. Didn’t you 
                        see “Silence of the Lambs”? 

           Sen throws his chin up. Whatever. 

                                 REN
                        Naw, he won’t watch it.

                                 SEN
                        I ain’t down with eatin’ people. 
                                  (defensive)
                        That shit’s fucked up! I ain’t puttin’ that 
                        fuckin’ trash in my motherfuckin’ head! 

           Lucky rubs his face. It’s going to be a long night. 

                                 LUCKY
                        Just stay in the room. Please.
           INT. THE ROOM - NIGHT

           Lucky enters to find Stan sitting just where he left him, 
           only now there’s an odd confidence to his posture.

                                 LUCKY
                        What have you been doing in here, Stanley?

                                 STANLEY
                        I’m just trying to help you guys. I swear.

           Sen and Ren enter again, wary, weary.

                                 LUCKY 
                        I’m changing the plan. We’re all going in 
                        your bank tomorrow morning. You’ll withdraw 
                        the money with us standing near-by. Once we 
                        get outside, we’ll let you go. Understood?

                                 STANLEY
                        Yes. But, and I’m not being uncooperative in  
                        any way, but, honestly, I’m not 100% on the 
                        new plan. People are racist. Okay? They just 
                        are! They see three African-Americans come 
                        into a bank with a white guy, they start to 
                        ask questions. Not me. Okay? Personally, I 
                        just assume the white guy’s the keyboardist.

           He grins and waits. Nothing. The boys are in no mood for 
           inter-racial jesting.

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        Look, all I’m saying is, let’s do this safe.  

                                 SEN
                        He chock fulla this bullshit...

           Lucky silences his henchman with a hand.

                                 LUCKY
                        Stanley, do you really want to cooperate?

                                 STANLEY
                        Yes. Absolutely. 

                                 SEN
                        Fuck that, Lux, he gonna talk! Nigga ain’t 
                        shut up since we nabbed him!

                                 LUCKY
                        No. He won’t say anything. Because if he 
                        does...we’re going to kill his Father.
           A stunned beat.

                                 LUCKY (CONT’D)
                        We’ll kill him and then we’ll kill his Dad. 
                        We’ll break every bone in his body. 

           CLOSE on Stan. Frozen. Silent. Breathing with his mouth 
           open. He hears Lucky cross the room. A chair scoots. 

           Lucky sets it right in front of Stan. Sits.

                                 LUCKY (CONT’D)
                        Here’s what I need. I need you to prove to 
                        me you’re a team player-type person. 
                                  (then)
                        Tell me your Father’s name and address.

           Stan reels. 

                                 STANLEY
                        Lucky, I can’t just--

                                 SEN
                        What yo Daddy’s name, Motherfucker?!

           A long beat. Stan’s doing the ugly math.

           Finally, quietly,...

                                 STANLEY
                        Benjamin. It’s Benjamin Alpert.

                                 LUCKY
                        Where does he live?

           Stan won’t say it. He keeps his head straight on Lucky, 
           as if staring right at him through the blindfold.

                                 LUCKY (CONT’D)
                        Where does he live?

                                 STANLEY
                        My Dad’s seventy-seven-years old. Okay?! He 
                        has Parkinson’s Disease. He’s sick and--

                                 SEN
                        Whoa! Whoa! Nobody here give a fuck?! 

           Lucky holds Stan’s WALLET, taps it quietly, menacingly.

                                 STANLEY
                        Brooklyn. Okay? He lives in Brooklyn.
                                 LUCKY
                        We need an address, Stanley.

           A horrible beat. Ren engages his weapon. 

           Stan has no choice...

                                 STANLEY 
                        Nine-Sixty-Two Ocean Parkway.

           Lucky opens the wallet, takes out a RATTY BUSINESS CARD.

                                      Benjamin Alpert
                                       Cantor (SAG)
                                     962 Ocean Parkway
                                          Apt. 4N
                                    Brooklyn, NY  11230

           This is why Stan has no choice. He knows the card is in 
           his wallet, but he can’t know if Lucky has seen it.

                                 LUCKY
                        I assume that’s an apartment building.

           Stan nods.

                                 LUCKY (CONT’D)
                        Well?

           CLOSE on Stanley, trapped, stalling, miserable.

                                 SEN
                        Yo, Bitch! Tell him the fuckin’ number!

                                 STANLEY
                                  (barely audible)
                        3N.

           Lucky runs his thumb over the spot on the card with the 
           apartment number. It’s 4N. Lucky doesn’t react, just sits 
           a moment, as if he sees in the card some part of himself. 

           Sen waves for his attention. That the right address?

           Lucky nods. Lies. 

                                 LUCKY 
                                  (standing)
                        That’s fine, Stanley.

           Stan mutters something inaudible. Something unpleasant.
                                 LUCKY (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be back in a little while. I need to 
                        make some calls.

           Lucky checks around the room and notes the dirty windows. 
           There’s an old READING LAMP on the floor. He turns it on, 
           then turns out the OVERHEAD LIGHTS. 

                                 LUCKY (CONT’D)
                        If he says another word...beat him.

           Lucky tosses the wallet on the dresser and exits, leaving 
           Stan to smolder with anger and guilt in near darkness.

           INT. LEXUS - NIGHT

           Lucky gets in the driver’s seat -- doesn’t start the car. 
           He rubs his face. Exhales. We realize he’s afraid.

           Across the sleepy avenue, he can see just the faint lamp 
           glow within the apartment. He’s not calling anyone.

           He takes a STARBUCK’S CUP out of the cup-holder and pours 
           the last half of a Latte into his hip flask. 

           He waits. Sips. Waits. Sips nervously.

           A TAXI pulls up across the deserted avenue. 

           Lucky watches THREE TEENAGE HOOKERS, Lucite heels, puffy 
           jackets, pile out and go in the tenement building.

           INT. THE ROOM - NIGHT

           In the dark, Stan checks his pulse. Sen and Ren wait on 
           their respective mattresses. An INTERCOM BUZZES. 

                                 SEN
                        Make sure it ain’t them niggaz upstairs.

           Ren hawks as he goes. 

           Sen turns on the OVERHEAD LIGHT. Stan starts slightly at 
           the warmth; his lips are tight and troubled. 

           INT. MAIN HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Ren opens the front door to three chatty girls of wildly 
           varying sizes. The tallest has big hair and a child’s 
           voice. This is MYSTIC. She’s the oldest (18). Maternal. 
                                 MYSTIC
                           Ooh, ooh, ooh. Cold out there, Sugar.

           Mystic’s followed by an icy Puerto Rican beauty, MERCEDES 
           (15); she lit a cigarette in the stairwell. 

                                 MERCEDES
                        Taxi was sixteen dollars forty cent.

           Mercedes is always thinking about money. 

           The last girl through the door is pudgy and dark-skinned.  
           HONEY (16) has a quick scowl and a vulnerable sulk.

                                 HONEY
                        Brooklyn taxi drivers is straight racist! 

                                 MYSTIC
                        They just afraid we gonna make ‘em drive up 
                        in some bad part a town.

                                 HONEY
                        Where the fuck you think we was?! 

           Ren gestures for the girls to listen but they’re too used 
           to ignoring him to notice.

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        They oughta pick us up, cause any place we 
                        goin’ round here is shit.

                                 MERCEDES 
                        They oughta pick us up cause we hot.

                                 REN
                        We got somethin’ serious goin’ on. 

           A beat. The girls peer suspiciously down toward The Room.

                                 HONEY
                        Good serious or bad serious?

           INT. THE ROOM - DAY

           Stan’s on edge. He can hear strangers trying to be quiet.

           In the doorway, the three girls eye a rumbled, blindfolded 
           and unhappy white man sitting on a mattress. 

                                 HONEY
                        Nu-uh, Nigga. No. No. 
           Honey stomps off. Sen waves for the others to come inside 
           The Room. They do so, Mercedes and Mystic gawking.

                                 SEN 
                        Lookin’ good, Mercedes. Whussup, Mystic?

                                 MYSTIC
                        Hey, Sen. How...how y’all doin’ tonight?

                                 SEN
                        Crippin’ and trippin’.

                                 REN
                        This here Steve. He ain’t allowed to talk.

                                 SEN
                        His name Stanley, Ren. 

           Stan sorta half waves, both petulant and distressed. 

                                 MERCEDES
                        You askin’ for it. Draggin’ some businessman 
                        back here like he was nuthin’.
                                  (still)
                        Taxi come to seventeen dollars. 

           Sen peels a TWENTY out of his wad. Makes her come get it.

                                 SEN
                        How things out at the track?

                                 MERCEDES
                        We did our job. Ain’t yo business, anyhow. 
                        We answer to Lucky, not you.

                                 SEN
                        Don’t forget, me and Ren is yo protection.
                        Where Honey go at? Yo! Honey?!

                                 REN
                        She in her bedroom. 

           Tiny, fierce FOOTSTEPS approach. Honey stays at the door.

                                 HONEY
                        Is ya’ll ordinary stupid?! I ain’t stayin’! 
                        I’ma go sit in MacDonald’s! Fuck y’all!

                                 REN
                        You ain’t goin’ nowhere.

                                 HONEY
                        Nigga, please, don’t tell me what to do!
           Stan’s got his head bowed -- the play of his eyebrows the 
           only thing to tell us he’s following every single word. 

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        This ‘posed to be my fuckin’ crib! 

           Sen gestures her closer for a tete-a-tete. He’s over near 
           Stan. She refuses. He waves again. C’mon. C’mon.

           She sighs big and goes to him. They stand close. Whisper. 

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        Why you doin’ this for, Sen?

                                 SEN

                        in, Baby. Gettin’ paid. Thug life. Shit. 

           There’s history between them.

           CLOSE on Stan. He can hear but is careful not to react.

                                 SEN (CONT’D)
                        Why you wanna disrespect my gangsta?

                                 HONEY
                        You gonna get us all served.  

                                 SEN
                        Don’t think negative, baby. When you think 
                        negative is when you get caught.
                                  (solicitous)
                        So, what? You not gonna stay here with me?

           She considers, looks around. There’s something about the 
           white man so close, pretending not to listen. 

           She lowers her voice still further... 

                                 HONEY
                        No. Not tonight. Maybe later.

           INT. LEXUS - NIGHT

           Lucky sees Honey come out of the their building and head 
           out into the cold night. What the hell’s going on now?

                                 LUCKY 
                        Shit.

           He checks his watch, caps his flask, and gets out. 
           INT. THE ROOM - NIGHT

           Stan’s jittery, senses they’re all staring at him. No one 
           dares speak. It’s makes him feel infuriatingly naked.  

           Lucky enters, having come in with surprising stealth.

                                 LUCKY
                        Everything all right? Where’s Honey?

           Stan starts a little at that voice’s sudden appearance.

                                 MYSTIC
                        Out. She said we all gettin’ accessorized.

           Sen shrugs. Lucky absorbs the scene and kneels in front 
           of Stan, who makes a show of turning away. When Lucky 
           starts to adjust the blindfold, Stan jerks his head back. 

           Stan hisses, sotto, at his breaking point,...

                                 STANLEY
                        Fuck you if you hurt my Dad. I’ll hunt you 
                        down like fucking cockroach! 

                                 LUCKY
                        Pull yourself together, Stanley. Every time 
                        a negro takes a couple bills off you people, 
                        you act like there’s been a genocide.
                                  (simply)
                        It’s America. There’s crime. Deal with it.

           He gives Stan’s leg an avuncular pat. Stands. 

                                 LUCKY (CONT’D)
                        Who’s hungry?

                                 MYSTIC
                        I’m hungry but I ain’t hungry hungry.
                                  (then)
                        Can we get the cracker somethin’? 

                                 LUCKY
                        Sure.

                                 SEN
                        Stanley, man, we gettin’ McDonald’s. 

           All eyes go to Stan. He makes them wait.

                                 STANLEY
                        I thought I wasn’t allowed to speak.
                                 SEN
                        Damn, Nigga, just say what you want!

                                 STANLEY
                        Nothing. 

                                 MYSTIC
                        How ‘bout somethin’ to drink? 

           Their insistence undercuts his righteous petulance.

                                 STANLEY
                        I wouldn’t be comfortable eating or 
                        drinking right now. Thank you.

           A collective shrug. 

           INT. MAIN HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Mercedes and Mystic follow Lucky toward the front door, 
           where he puts an arm around Mercedes.

                                 LUCKY
                        You go ahead. I’ve got a business meeting. 
                        I need to talk with Mystic before I go.

                                 MERCEDES
                        Fuck that! Drive me over! Talk in the Lexus!

           Mystic sashays off down a Side Hallway. 

                                 MYSTIC
                        Stop at the A-rabs for my News, Sugar. And 
                        get extra napkins. We outta toilette paper.

           Lucky holds up a TWENTY. Mercedes snatches it, peeved.

                                 LUCKY
                        It’s two blocks. 

           She exits out the front door. SLAM!  

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Lucky jiggles the broken lock, now agitated. Mystic sits 
           on the tub in her underwear, considers her arms. 

                                 MYSTIC
                        You think I’m gettin’ ashy?
                                  (no response)
                        It smell like hot dog water in here.
           Lucky gives up on the door. He undoes his belt and pants. 

                                 MYSTIC (CONT’D)
                        You wanna come on my face or tits?

                                 LUCKY
                        No! No. Jesus. Just do it normal.

           Scowling, he knocks away a pair of PANTIES drying on the 
           towel rack as Mystic goes to work on him below.

           INT. THE ROOM - NIGHT

           Eating sounds. 

           Stan has his hands tucked under his armpits, bounces his 
           heels in anxious rhythm. His body’s starting to revolt. 

           Sen and Ren’s devour food on their respective mattresses. 

           Mystic lies on her stomach in the middle of the room like 
           a 50’s teenager, reads the DAILY NEWS under the lamp.

           Mercedes has her meal spread out on a windowsill. Smokes. 

                                 MERCEDES
                        What his name again?

                                 REN
                        Steven.

           Stanley waits for Ren to be corrected.

           When nobody does...

                                 STANLEY
                        My name’s Stanley. Okay? Hurt me if you want 
                        but get my name right! Stanley. Or Stan. 

           He half-expects Sen to fly at him in a rage. 

           Instead...

                                 SEN
                        Steven was last night, Ren.

           Stan’s ears perk up. 

                                 STANLEY
                        Steven? What happened to Steven?
                                 SEN
                        That’s enough. Stan.

           Snickers.

           Mercedes leaves her roost to get a Snapple out of a brown 
           paper bag on the dresser, steps over to the prisoner.

                                 MERCEDES
                        Here. I got you a Snapple at the A-rabs. 

           STAN’S POV: hands with ghetto nails place a PEACH SNAPPLE 
           on the floor between his feet. He hesitates. Grabs it. 

           He gulps it down. Quick. Thirsty. They all watch him.

                                 STANLEY 
                                  (wiping his mouth)
                        Thank you.

           Mystic has found something in the paper... 

                                 MYSTIC
                        Some nigga jacked a Neon with a baby in the 
                        back. You know that a mistake -- no brother 
                        takin’ no baby, less’n a judge say so. 
                                  (laughs)
                        I’m serious! Watch Maury! Please, Niggaz.

           The food’s relaxing the kids.

                                 MYSTIC (CONT’D)
                        Y’all look for a boy baby in a red Neon. I 
                        hope he don’t die. That a double tragedy. 
                        Cause a his soulmate and all. There’s a 
                        girl baby God done picked out as that boy 
                        baby soulmate. Everybody got a soulmate. 
                        Waitin’ since the beginnin’ a time. This 
                        boy baby soulmate, she gonna go her whole 
                        life lookin’, even with her one true love 
                        dead. She’ll be all lonely and in a bad 
                        relationship and not know a damn thing why!

           Stan TITTERS nervously. Since he’s the only one to laugh, 
           everyone looks over. Mystic’s pleased to be entertaining. 

                                 REN
                        What if that boy baby gay? 

                                 MYSTIC
                        Gays got soulmates, Sugar.
                                 SEN
                        Fuck that ignorant shit.

                                 MYSTIC
                        What do you think, Stanley?

           Stan opens his mouth.

                                 REN
                        We ain’t supposed to talk to him.

                                 MERCEDES
                        He in the fuckin’ room! 

                                 SEN
                        Everybody just shut the fuck up! 

           Stan closes his mouth. The room goes quiet again. 

           Mystic holds up a PHOTO of Arafat.

                                 MYSTIC
                        Looky, Ren. This man a Muslim. Like you. 

                                 REN
                        I ain’t decided if I a Muslim yet.

                                 MYSTIC
                        Well, you best get on it.

           Stan smirks -- he’s starting to like this girl.

                                 SEN
                        Aight. Let’s do it.

           Without comment, Mystic stands and turns off the OVERHEAD 
           LIGHT. Mercedes comes from the window to Sen’s mattress.

           CLOSE on Stan. They’re gonna kill me? Now? Why? A smirk?

           He stiffens. His breathing goes shallow. 

           A small CLICK. Deep inhale. Exhale. Stan sniffs the air. 

           Stan deflates. Sen’s smoking a JOINT. He hands it up to 
           Mercedes. She brings it over to Mystic. Ren’s last. 

                                 SEN (CONT’D)
                        How ‘bout some weed, Stanley?

                                 REN
                        Yeah, how ‘bout some smoke, Stanley.
           The boys chuckle. 

                                 STANLEY
                        No, thanks. I’m good. 

           Stan chuckles, too. This couldn’t get any weirder. 

                                 SEN
                        Shit is smooth. Damn. Damn! Mercedes, why 
                        don’t you bring that biscuit over here?

                                 MYSTIC
                        We need condoms, Sugar.

           Stan FREEZES. What?

                                 MERCEDES
                        Ain’t nobody gettin’ no blow job or nuthin’ 
                        without a fuckin’ condom. 

                                 MYSTIC
                        Honey maybe got some.

           Stan’s mortified as HEELS clack off down the hallway. 

           Just as he’s formed a polite protest... 

                                 SEN
                        Hey, Ren, where Ramos at?

                                 REN
                        Ain’t been home all night.

                                 SEN
                        Man, that jumpy nigga need Prozac. He 
                        steady trippin’. Like a Jack Russell. 

           Ren snickers. Heels return. 

                                 MYSTIC
                        She gonna know these two missin’, Y’all.
                                  (then)
                        Get them baggies off, Ren.

           Ren grabbles to pull his pants down while sitting. As Sen 
           does the same, Mercedes spits in her hand. 

           PUSH in on Stan. Embarrassed. Dry swallowing.

           Across The Room, he starts to hear gurgling and clucking; 
           then, next to him, rhythmic swishing. 
                                 REN (O.S.)
                        That good? 

                                 MYSTIC (O.S.)
                        You fine, Sugar. Get you some.

           The swishing intensifies. Stan opens his mouth to speak  
           for a third time, but now has NO idea what to say. 

           We leave him -- a man blindfolded, sitting on a mattress 
           in a suit, surrounded by a chorus of sex.

                                                                FADE TO:

           EXT. TENEMENT HOUSE - HOUSE

           The apartment’s windows are mostly dark. Distant gunfire. 

                                 SEN’S VOICE
                        You prayed yet, Stanley?

           INT. THE ROOM - NIGHT

           Stan’s startled by the question; he was feeling his chest 
           to check his heartbeat. He’s becoming hypochondriacal.

                                 STANLEY
                        Oh. No.

                                 SEN
                        You believe in God?

                                 STANLEY
                        Yes.

                                 SEN
                        You Jewish?

           Stan hesitates. The Room’s air is sluggish. Post-coital. 

                                 STANLEY
                        Yes, I’m Jewish.

                                 MYSTIC
                        Do Jews believe in God?

                                 STANLEY
                        Yes. They do.

           Stan’s voice is tentative, this sort of conversation does 
           not generally end well. Then, surprisingly,...
                                 SEN
                        That’s cool. I like Jews. Jews and Blacks 
                        the same. You shoulda told us you a Jew. We 
                        wouldn’ta grabbed yo white ass.

                                 REN
                        Hey, what you ‘posed to be doin’ tomorrow? 

                                 STANLEY
                        A lot of meetings. People in my office will 
                        be looking for me. You guys probably should 
                        think about that. Then at night, my friends 
                        are all expecting me at a concert. For...
                                  (realizing)
                        Terrific. Perfect...Tomorrow’s my birthday. 

                                 SEN 
                        No, it ain’t!

           Stan nods, gloomy. Yeah, it is.

                                 SEN (CONT’D)
                        Shit! We grabbed a nigga on his birthday!

           This fact elicits sleepy mirth. 

                                 SEN (CONT’D)
                        Happy Birthday, Stanley.

                                 STANLEY
                        Yeah. Thanks.

           They take turns wishing him sleepy Happy Birthdays. Stan’s 
           forced to thank each individually. It takes awhile. 

                                 SEN 
                        Yo, we gotta get you a gift, man! Right, 
                        Ren? How ‘bout a birthday blow job? 

                                 STANLEY
                        Thanks, but...I’d rather not. 

                                 REN
                        You don’t like black girls? 

                                 STANLEY
                        I’m just not feeling very horny right now. 
                        Maybe it was the Snapple. Thanks. 

                                 SEN
                        You gotta get somethin’. 
                                 REN
                        Yeah. Somethin’.

                                 STANLEY
                        Then take this blindfold off. Okay? Just put 
                        a lamp on my face -- I won’t be able to see 
                        behind it. I can’t stay like this. My heart 
                        keeps racing. I have a weak heart. I mean, 
                        okay, it’s not been formally diagnosed, but 
                        they made me wear the monitor. Once. Look, I 
                        just don’t wanna have a heart attack. Okay?

           Ren scoffs like Stan’s crazy.

           Sen gets up, comes over, stands over Stan. He gets on one 
           knee and stares right at him, menacingly close. 

           Stan can feel his breath. 

                                 MERCEDES
                        You a dumbass, Sen.

           Sen grabs the reading lamp, scrapes it closer, turns the 
           shade up, directly on Stan like an interrogation light. 

                                 SEN
                        Happy Birthday.

           Sen backs into the dark again.

                                 SEN (CONT’D)
                        Aight. Take it off.

           Stan gingerly removes the blindfold. Blinks. Adjusts. 

           He’s very careful NOT to look up.

                                 STANLEY
                        Thank you.

                                 SEN
                        How many fingers I holdin’ up?

                                 STANLEY
                        No, Sen, if it’s all the same, I’d rather 
                        not even try. Let’s not risk it. Okay? 

           Sen racks his 45.

                                 SEN
                        I said, “How many?”

           Stan just shakes his head.
                                 SEN (CONT’D)
                        Motherfucker, how many?!

           Stan looks briefly into the dark. 

                                 STANLEY
                        I can’t tell.

                                 SEN
                        How many?

                                 STANLEY
                        I can’t make out fingers.

           Sen’s voice is suddenly full of inexplicable rage...

                                 SEN
                        What’d we tell you ‘bout lyin’, Bitch?! How 
                        many motherfuckin’ fingers am I holdin’ up 
                        on my motherfuckin’ hand?!
                                  (no response)
                        I’ma count five! One.

                                 STANLEY
                        My pupils haven’t adjusted--

                                 SEN
                        Two!

                                 STANLEY
                        C’mon, Sen. Please. This-- 

                                 SEN
                        Three!

                                 STANLEY
                        Look, I promise, I can’t--

                                 SEN
                        Four!

           Sen’s gun catches a glint of light as it’s aimed at Stan.

           Stan screams into the dark...

                                 STANLEY
                        I can’t fucking see you!

           Utter silence. CLICK.

                                 SEN
                        I know that.
           Ren snickers. Everyone chuckles. Tension deflates. Sen 
           sits back on his mattress against the wall.

           Then, from the darkness across the room,...

                                 SEN (CONT’D)
                        Ain’t nuthin’ wrong with yo heart.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           CLOSE on name on a credit card: Stanley Alpert. 

           An impression roller loudly WIPES the screen.

           INT. SUPERSTORE - NIGHT

           The massive place is open all night. In the electronics 
           section, Lucky buys a computer with Stan’s card.

           The SALESMAN (38), white, pot-bellied, dingy button-down, 
           takes the card out of the machine to examine it. 

           Lucky doesn’t seem at all nervous, he’s busy looking at 
           the cell phones under the glass counter. 

                                 SALESMAN (O.S.)
                        You country-ass quadroon fuck. 

           The Salesman’s clearly a friend. Of sorts. Lucky looks up 
           to see him holding the credit card with his finger on the 
           business name, right under Stan’s. 

                                 SALESMAN (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck does that say?

           The card’s issued to the... 

                                 SALESMAN (CONT’D)
                        Department of Justice? Tell me that’s some 
                        nigger record label. Please. Tell me that. 

           Lucky doesn’t have to answer.

                                 SALESMAN (CONT’D)
                        You jacked a fuckin’ Federale?!

           The importance of Stan’s employer now descends on Lucky. 

           Finally, he nods.

                                 SALESMAN (CONT’D)
                        There tape of you using this?
           There is. The ATM machine.

                                 LUCKY
                        Shit!

           The Salesman grunts. Staring at Lucky hard, he yanks out 
           his own shirttail, starts wiping his prints off the card.

           Then, forcing himself to find patience,...

                                 SALESMAN
                        You listening, asshole?

                                 LUCKY
                        Yeah.

                                 SALESMAN
                        The FBI has to get involved with crimes 
                        committed against federal employees. I’m 
                        not gonna ask -- and I sure as shit don’t 
                        wanna know -- if you touched this man. 

           The Salesman holds the card up by a shirttail. 

           Lucky takes it back.

                                 SALESMAN (CONT’D)
                        You don’t fucking know me.

           INT. THE ROOM - NIGHT

           Late. Quiet. 

           In the LAMP’s glare, Stan wakes. Remembers his situation. 

           STAN’S POV: Vague forms in the dark around him seem to be 
           asleep. Mercedes is curled on Sen’s mattress. Mystic lies 
           on a make-shift bed of rags. Ren’s lump on his mattress. 

           Stan’s alone. He glances furtively toward the door. Open. 
           A light out in the Main Hallway leaks into The Room.

           CLOSE on Stan. He’s pondering a dangerous idea. 

           Gingerly, he lifts himself and scoots down the mattress, 
           closer to the exit. Again. And again. And again.

           He reaches the corner of his safety island, considers the 
           short distance. Prepares himself. Stops breathing. 

                  Now. Stand. Go.
           Stan doesn’t have the courage. The ugly fact descends on 
           him like sad news. Every muscle in his body goes slack. 

           Then, somewhere deep in the apartment, a DOOR SLAMS. 

           Someone’s moving around out in the halls. Stan starts to 
           quickly slide back toward his spotlight. 

           Just as he gets into position,...

                                 SEN
                                  (groggy)
                        Ramos come home yet?

           Silence. No one seems to know.

           FOOTSTEPS approach.

                                 SEN (CONT’D)
                        Ren!

           Ren grunts, locks, loads.

           The DOOR OPENS. We recognize Honey’s form as she comes in 
           searching for something, rifles through dresser drawers.

                                 MYSTIC
                        You not find a place to stay, Sugar?

                                 SEN
                        Where yo panties at, Girl?

           Stan can barely make out that the bottom half of a short, 
           heavy girl indeed appears naked.

                                 HONEY
                        That’s what I’ma fuckin’ find out! 
                                  (Ren snickers)
                        Y’all can suck my dick.

           She leaves. Their DOOR SLAMS shut. Everyone’s awake now. 

           The interruption has made Sen antsy...

                                 SEN
                        Yo, Ren? Maybe we should go over to Stan’s 
                        ‘partment and get his check book.

                                 MYSTIC
                        They got doormen in Ma’hattan, Sugar.

           Stan stares off at nothing, doesn’t seem to have heard.
           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Honey finds her panties among the trash on the floor.

                                 HONEY
                        ...goddamn...

           She turns and stops COLD. Floating in the toilette are 
           two condoms, recently used, probably hers.

           INT. THE ROOM - NIGHT

           Stan’s perfectly still, lost in despondent thoughts. I’m 
                  a fool and a coward. I’ll be in this room forever. 

           So, he starts a bit when the DOOR BANGS OPEN. 

           Honey holds up her panties.

                                 HONEY
                        Who threw my clean panties on the bathroom 
                        floor?! I wanna know?! Who threw my goddamn 
                        panties on the goddamn floor?! This here’s 
                        my house! You hear?! Mine! 

           No one responds, which deflates her only slightly.

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        I’ma find out. And I’ma fuckin’ chuck you!

           She goes. The DOOR SLAMS.

           Calm descends.

                                 SEN 
                        Guess you don’t hafta worry ‘bout none of 
                        this shit, huh, Stan?

                                 STANLEY
                        Sorry. What?

                        some Fifth Avenue nigga in a trench coat.

                                 STANLEY
                        I live in the East Village. 
                                 SEN

                                 STANLEY 
                        Okay. 

                                 SEN
                        Rich cracker like you ain’t got no worries. 
                        Not like us. Cops fuck with a nigga if’n he 
                        walk down the street. Motherfuckin’ Five-0 
                        always bustin’ heads! And for what? You the 
                        attorney. Why they steady stressin’ us?

           In the glare of the light, Stan can feel enquiring eyes. 

           A switch inside Stan flips...

                                 STANLEY
                        I dunno. Except maybe for the weed. And the 
                        illegal weapons possession. Maybe the armed 
                        robbery? The whole...kidnapping thing. Bank 
                        fraud. Extortion. It’s profiling, I guess.

           Ooohs. Aaahs.

                                 MERCEDES
                        Snap!

           In the dark, we see Sen can’t help a sheepish grin -- he 
           loves being cast the criminal entrepreneur.

                                 SEN
                        Fuck you. I do this shit to survive. You 
                        got shit handed to you. Opportunities. 

                                 STANLEY
                        I made opportunities.

           He has their attention. In the dark beyond him, they seem 
           to wait for the white man’s secrets to success.

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        I had serious problems growing up, too. 

                                 SEN
                        Yeah? What?

           Stan hesitates. 

                                 STANLEY
                        My parents divorced. When I was twelve. 

           Silence.
           Then a WAVE of derisive laughter.

                                 SEN
                        Ooooh! This cracker come up hard!

                                 MERCEDES
                        Dumbass.

                                 MYSTIC
                        Sugar, I don’t even know my Daddy’s name!

                                 REN
                        Po-lice took my Momma when I was ten. I 
                        come up with the ladies in my buildin’, 
                        hidin’ me from Child Services and shit.

                                 MERCEDES
                        Please, Nigger! My moms a crack whore! She 
                        always draggin’ in some greasy-dick fien’. 
                        And he be in her room slappin’ her like she 
                        stole somethin’. You know what I be doin? I 
                        be in my bed, thinkin’, “Good!” Thinkin’, 
                        “Don’t feel so hot, do it, Momma?!” That 
                        before I get old enough bang on the damn 
                        wall and yell, “Kick her ass, Motherfucker! 
                        Go on! Bust her lip and I’ma suck you off!”

           Sen and Ren lose it. This girl’s hard! Sen likes her last 
           line so much that he repeats it. Twice. 

                                 MYSTIC
                        That just sad, D. 

                                 STANLEY
                        Okay. Okay. Fine. The cracker’s an idiot.
                                  (fishing)
                        What’s your story, Sen? 

                                 SEN
                        Fuck that. I don’t talk ‘bout my peoples. 
                        Never have. Never will.

           There’s shame in his voice. And finality. 

           The calm returns. 

                                 SEN (CONT’D)
                        Hey, Stanley? 

                                 STANLEY
                        Yeah?
                                 SEN
                        What would I get for you if we was caught?

           Stan stalls; this is the last subject he wants discussed.

                                 MYSTIC
                        Y’all abducted him, that be ten to twenty 
                        right there!

                                 SEN
                        Yo, straight up, what they give me? 

                                 STANLEY
                                  (carefully; honestly)
                        It depends on how you end this. I mean, you 
                        know, what happens from here on. 

                                 SEN
                        Aight. 

                                 STANLEY
                        If you do the right thing, I can talk to 
                        them. Should the need ever arise.

                                 MERCEDES
                        Tell ‘em I got you a Snapple. I got you the 
                        Snapple and I don’t want no damn prison.

                                 SEN
                        Prison don’t scare me. Three hots and a cot 
                        -- I don’t give two rats fuckin’. 

           In the lamp light, Stan smiles empathy. A delicate beat.

                                 REN
                        Yo, Stanley? 

                                 STANLEY
                        Yeah, Ren?

                                 REN
                        When we let you go, you goin’ to the cops?

           CLOSE on Stan. The question of course is deadly. The kids 
           all watch him consider it. He takes his sweet time.

           Finally, casually,...

                                 STANLEY
                        No. 
                                  (then)
                        You guys seem pretty cool.
           The DOOR OPENS again. 

                                 SEN 
                        Fuck, Honey--

                                 LUCKY 
                        What the hell is goin’ on?!

           Lucky stands in the doorway.

           Sen jumps up, nervous, covering.

                                 SEN
                        Yo, Lux. Hey, man. How’s it goin’?

           Lucky simply turns, goes down the hall. Sen follows. We 
           HOLD on Stan, head down, eyes askance, watching.

           INT. SIDE HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Lucky paces. He waits with Sen around the corner from the 
           Main Hallway (the Side Hallway leads to a KITCHEN). 

           A TV is playing off in one of the bedrooms. 

           Ren hurries around the corner, hands Lucky Stan’s WALLET.

                                 REN
                        His card say “Assistant Federal Attorney”. 

                                 SEN
                        See? He just the assistant.

                                 LUCKY
                        The FBI will come after us. 

                                 SEN
                        He ain’t seen our faces.

                                 LUCKY
                        They have video of me from the ATM!

                                 SEN
                        So? They don’t know you, Lux. You ain’t got 
                        no record. Not even back in Virginia.

           Lucky’s patrician control is quickly fraying.

                                 LUCKY
                        This isn’t snatching chains at the mall! 
                        This isn’t NYPD! This is the FBI! They’ll 
                        put my picture on the news, Sen! Shit!
                                 SEN
                        Aight. Aight. How you wanna carry this?

                                 LUCKY
                        Can you do whatever I need you to do?

                                 SEN
                        Let the dog outta the cage, he gonna bite.

                                 LUCKY
                        Fine.

           Lucky can’t look at them. 

                                 LUCKY (CONT’D)
                        It’s nobody’s fault. This guy just got 
                        caught in a...tragedy-type situation.

           Sen and Ren get VERY uncomfortable.

                                 LUCKY (CONT’D)
                        We’ll dump him in the park. I’ll go to the 
                        police. Report I was jacked last night by 
                        two black males. They made me drive into 
                        Manhattan, forced me to withdraw money from 
                        an ATM machine. I assumed they didn’t want 
                        to be videotaped using the card. When I 
                        asked what happened to the owner...they 
                        told me to mind my own fucking business.  

                                 SEN 
                        What’d them two black males look like?

                                 LUCKY
                        Like the gentlemen upstairs.

           Ren and Sen like this part of the plan. Knock fists.

                                 LUCKY (CONT’D)
                        When the FBI investigates, sees the tape, I 
                        just stick to my story. “They killed that 
                        man? Oh my God, that could’ve been me!”

                                 MERCEDES (O.S.)
                        You better deal real with his DNA.

           Mercedes lurks at the corner, eavesdropping.

                                 LUCKY
                        Mercedes...Go watch Stanley, please.

                                 REN
                        Yo, Lucky, don’t use his name.
                                 SEN
                        Niggerachi, do me a favor and shut up!

           Sen pushes Mercedes away. 

           She goes, hands up in ironic compliance. Having a witness 
           douses the plan with a little cold water.

                                 SEN (CONT’D)
                        I dunno, Lux.

                                 LUCKY
                        What?

                                 SEN
                        I’m down for mine. You slippin’ in my hood, 
                        you gonna get done dirty. 
                                  (however)
                        We brung this man up in here.

           Lucky’s face says he doesn’t know why this should matter.

                                 SEN (CONT’D)
                        Stan’s tight, Lux. We been hangin’ with him 
                        all night. He sayin’ some diesel shit.

           Sen looks to Ren for support. 

           Instead, he gets...

                                 REN
                        I’ll do it if Sen won’t.

           Lucky and Sen stare in disbelief a moment. Finally, Sen 
           takes his .45 out with an aggravated pfiff. 

                                 SEN
                        I ain’t shootin’ this motherfucker cold.  

           INT. HONEY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Honey lays on her mattress and watches an ACTION MOVIE on 
           a tiny TV/VCR combo. It’s a bootleg, filmed off someone’s 
           TV -- we can hear a DRYER clunking on the sound-track.

           Mystic comes in, curls up in bed beside her, looking off.

                                 MYSTIC
                        Sen and them gonna kill that white man.

           Honey takes this without reaction.
                                 MYSTIC (CONT’D)
                        In the bathroom. 
                                  (then)
                        We all gotta help wipe up.

           Honey just watches the movie.

           And we hear a bunch of men suddenly yell...

                                 SCREAMING MEN
                           Wu Tang Clan ain’t nothin’ to fuck with!

           INT. THE ROOM - NIGHT

           The WU TANG CLAN plays on the stereo. Loud. Very loud.

                                 WU TANG CLAN
                           Wu Tang Clan ain’t nothin’ to fuck with!

           Stan’s blindfolded again, wincing at the music. He can’t 
           see that Lucky, Ren and Mercedes stand over him. Over at 
           a window, Sen does a line of COCAINE to pump himself up. 

           Finally, Sen takes out his gun and nods to Ren. Let’s go!

                                 REN
                        Stanley, you need the bathroom?! 
                                  (he doesn’t)
                        You had a Snapple!

           Stan shakes his head again.

           The kids exchange unsure looks. Now what?

                                 WU TANG CLAN 
                           Wu Tang Clan ain’t nothin’ to fuck with!

           Lucky leans down to the prisoner.

                                 LUCKY
                        Go to the toilet! I gotta leave! They can’t 
                        let you use it when I’m not here!

           Stan nods, accommodating. Yeah. Okay. Whatever. 

           Lucky helps him up.

                                 LUCKY (CONT’D)
                        The boys will cover you! 

           Mercedes takes his hand. Ren pokes the Tec 9 in his back. 
           Feeling it, Stan walks with his hands raised.
                                 WU TANG CLAN 
                                  (Rza’s Verse)
                           Tossin’ and flossin’, my style is awesome! I 
                           cause more family feuds than Richard Dawson!

           The murderous entourage leaves The Room.

                                 WU TANG CLAN (CONT’D)
                           And the survey said...You dead!

           INT. MAIN HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Mercedes leads. Stan takes blind man steps.

                                 WU TANG CLAN
                           Fatal flying guillotine chops off your 
                           fuckin’ head!

           Lucky glances over at Sen, who’s trying to move with the 
           song, trying to force his adrenaline to take over. 

           INT. HONEY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Mystic’s facing the wall. Through a crack in her door, 
           Honey can see the gang pass by out in the hall.

           INT. SIDE HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Mercedes leads Stan around the corner...Ren’s gun at his 
           back...Sen behind them, ready breathing.

           Lucky stops at the front door, looks back to the MUSIC, 
           looks to the ceiling, does a truncated WHISTLE.

           Sen’s heard it, comes back to give Lucky his ear.

                                 LUCKY
                        The music isn’t enough! Don’t shoot until 
                        he flushes! Use the flush! 

           Sen nods without meeting his eyes. Lucky hangs back, then 
           with a glance to Honey’s room slips out the front door.

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Mercedes leads Stan through -- he bumps into the table.

                                 REN
                        Watch yo’self.
           A door off the kitchen opens onto the infamous...

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Mercedes helps Stan step over a rise for the tile.

                                 MERCEDES
                        We gonna stand in the door. Go straight. 

           Stan uses his right foot to probe the junky floor. 

                                 MERCEDES (CONT’D)
                        You there. 

           Stan feels down for the toilette bowl. Finds it. Unzips.

           Sen quickly moves into position. Mercedes watches his gun 
           rise beside her, puts her fingers in her ears.

           Sen aims. Steadies his pistol hand. Ren watches.

           SEN’S POV: The .45 barrel moves from Stan’s head to the 
           toilette tank chain, dangling in front of him.

           But there’s a problem...

           Stan can’t pee. We see him holding it. Nothing.

                                 STANLEY
                        Sorry, guys. I’m a little stressed, okay.
                                  (then)
                        Give me a minute.

           They wait. Distant music. 

           Nothing.

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        It’s like Paruresis. That disease where you 
                        can’t pee around other people. 

                                 REN
                        Go on and piss.

                                 STANLEY
                        I’m trying! Just back off. Let me relax. 

           Nothing. 

           Stan rambles to calm himself...
                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        I knew a guy in high school, Dave Goldfarb, 
                        he had this. Bad. He couldn’t even pee in 
                        the building. His parents got him a van so 
                        he could go out and do it in a jug. Weird 
                        thing is he had no problem taking a dump 
                        right in front of you. His family had like 
                        some nutty open bathroom policy. He’d wipe 
                        and everything. Gross. The sounds.

           Sen gives Ren a brutal look. Do somethin’, Motherfucker! 

                                 REN
                        You gotta hurry, Stanley.

                                 STANLEY 
                        You’re only making it worse.

           They wait. Sen’s gritting his teeth, steeling his will.

           Nothing.

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know how they found out, but Senior 
                        Prank Week, somebody shoe-polished his van: 
                        “If this van’s a leakin’, don’t come a 
                        peekin’!” His folks made him change schools. 

           Sen’s had enough. Lowers his weapon. Leaves.

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Sen sits at the table, peeved, tosses the gun down.

                                 MERCEDES (O.S.)
                        Fuck, Cracker!

                                 STANLEY (O.S.)
                        I’m doing my best here! Okay?

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Everyone waits. They have no other choice. 

           Then, unbelievably,...

                                 STANLEY 
                        I heard he got better. His Mom told my Mom 
                        he’d joined a support group. They’d all go 
                        out to the mall and drink coffee -- then go 
                        together in the men’s room and try to pee. 
           INT. TENEMENT HOUSE LANDING - NIGHT

           Lucky waits for the shot. Checks his watch. Worries.

           INT. HONEY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Honey and Mystic also listen, ignoring the movie. 

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Sen’s coming down. Sweats.

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Stan, still holding his penis, still rambling,...

                                 STANLEY 
                        I saw them once. Maybe. Dave was at a table 
                        in the food court with four other guys. No 
                        one was really talking. He looked kinda sad. 

           A trickle.

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        Here we go.

           The trickle becomes a STREAM.

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        Yes!
                                  (then)
                        Wow. Okay. That was scary.

           In the doorway, Ren hisses for Sen to come back. Hurry!

           Sen appears again, takes up his position. 

           Mercedes stands beside him, fascinated, like a little kid 
           watching a big brother set off fireworks. 

           Sen aims, creeps closer. 

           All we hear is piss and the muffled...

                                 WU TANG CLAN
                           Wu Tang Clan ain’t nothin’ to fuck with!

           The barrel’s inches from Stan’s temple. Mercedes winces. 
           The urine stream dies. Stan turns cocks his head as if he 
           senses something. It’s not entirely clear he’ll flush, he 
           turns away, remembers...reaches for the flusher.

                                 MERCEDES
                        It’s a chain.

           Stan feels along the wall, finds it.

           He yanks the old wooden handle down.

           The FLUSH is deafening.

           Sen can’t pull the trigger.

           He simply spins and pushes roughly past Mercedes and Ren.

           INT. MAIN HALLWAY - NIGHT

                                 WU TANG CLAN
                           Wu Tang Clan ain’t nothin’ to fuck with!

           Lucky is just peeking in the apartment as Sen comes down 
           the Side Hallway and heads for The Room.

           INT. HONEY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Honey watches Sen, then Lucky, hurry past her door. She 
           mutters something inaudible. Fools.

           INT. THE ROOM - NIGHT

           Sen storms in and slams the MUSIC OFF. Soaking. Nauseous. 

           Lucky’s a few steps behind.

                                 LUCKY
                        What happened?! 

           Sen points the gun at Lucky to shut him up, his eyes wild 
           with coke and confusion. He lowers the weapon.  

                                 SEN
                        You do it.

           He holds the .45 out for Lucky by the barrel. 

           A nervy beat. Ren enters.
                                 SEN (CONT’D)
                        Take it! Go on! You do it!

           Lucky doesn’t. He can’t kill either. Not here. Not now.

           Ren calmly takes the gun out of Sen’s hand. Quietly, he 
           puts his Tec 9 on the dresser, takes a ratty pillow off 
           Sen’s mattress and exits. 

           Lucky and Sen exchange a incredulous look.

           INT. MAIN HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Ren raises the pistol at a hipster angle. The effect is 
           adolescent, uncool, scary. This kid will shoot.

           Around the corner, Mercedes and Stan shuffle closer.

                                 MERCEDES (O.S.)
                        We goin’ right. Not yet. Not yet.

           He’ll have kill the white man right here in the hall. Ren 
           wraps the pillow over the .45 as a dampener. 

                                 MERCEDES (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Aight.

           Stan’s out-stretched arms appear around the corner...

           THWACK!

           A NUNCHUCK whacks Ren’s skull. He flies against the wall.

           Honey’s sucker-slammed him.

                                 HONEY 
                        Who you think you are?! Huh?! Who?!

           She holds a old pair of beaten and taped “chucks”.

           Ren can’t answer, checks his forehead for blood, cuts his 
           eyes back to where...Mercedes holds Stan at the corner.

           THWACK! 

           Honey hits him again, awkwardly, clipping his skull this 
           time but nailing the collar bone. 

                                 REN
                        Owww! Fuck. Bitch!

           Stan waits in for the commotion, perplexed.
                                 HONEY
                        This is my goddamn house!

           She raises her makeshift whip to chuck Ren again -- he 
           holds his hands up, the .45 angled impotently.

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        This is my house! This is my house!

                                 LUCKY (O.S.)
                        Cut it out!

           Lucky and Sen watch from down inside The Room. 

           Honey spins to them, near tears,...

                                 HONEY
                        You here on my say so! I let you stay in my 
                        place! Mine! This the only place I got!

           No one knows what to say. Silence. 

           The downstairs BUZZER sounds. Three quick bursts.

           A beat. Looks.

                                 LUCKY
                        It’s Ramos.

           Honey goes back into her bedroom and SLAMS the door. Ren 
           turns to Lucky, who gestures for him just bring Stan back 
           into The Room. Embarrassed, he drags Stan by the collar. 

                                 STANLEY
                        Careful. I have the weak heart thing.

           INT. THE ROOM - NIGHT

           Ren and Mercedes bring Stan in and set him down. Lucky 
           nods for Ren to go deal with the arriving Ramos.

           Sen and Lucky’s eyes meet. Sen looks away, ashamed.

           Lucky considers their prisoner. Rubs his face. Concedes.

                                 LUCKY
                        Stanley, I’ve got some good news for you. 
                        I’m going to come back in a few hours, at 
                        nine AM, and we’ll drive you back to your 
                        neighborhood and drop you off.
                                 STANLEY
                        Thank you. That’s smart, Lucky. I mean it. 

           Lucky gives Sen a withering glance.

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        You’re making a sound business decision.

           INT. SIDE HALLWAY - NIGHT

           The front door opens and jittery LUIS RAMOS (22) enters.

           Ramos is a wiry Haitian with a wisp of a mustache and old 
           black-framed glasses and work sores on his hands. 

           Ren waves for him in the kitchen. Ramos grows suspicious.

                                 LUIS RAMOS
                        Yo, son, I ain’t carryin’ no cheese, man.

           Ramos steps closer, peers into his bedroom.

                                 REN
                        C’mere, Ramos. Nobody tryin’ to rob you. 

                                 LUIS RAMOS
                        Then why you actin’ faggy?!

           Lucky comes up behind -- he’s in no mood for Luis Ramos.

                                 LUCKY
                        Calm down, Luis.

                                 LUIS RAMOS
                        Yo, yo, what the fuck goin’ down, Homes?!

                                 LUCKY
                        You shouldn’t be here today.

                                 LUIS RAMOS
                        Why?

           Lucky doesn’t want to tell him. Ramos is a quick panic.

                                 RAMOS
                        Tell me! Tell me, yo, tell me, son! I’m the 
                        landlord, yo. Fuckin’ tell me!
           INT. THE ROOM - NIGHT

           Mercedes smokes. Sen nurses his pride. They both turn to 
           watch Luis Ramos peek in with elaborate stealth.

           Stan’s back on the mattress, still blindfolded. He’s more 
           relaxed now, knowing he’s soon to be released.

           INT. MAIN HALLWAY

           Ramos tip-toes back to Lucky and Ren by the front door.

                                 LUIS RAMOS
                        Yo, yo, yo! Is Y’all niggas crazy?! Y’all 
                        wildin’, now! All that hooka shit, sellin’ 
                        girls and shit, now you kidnap a cracker?!

                                 LUCKY
                        He’s giving us fifty thousand dollars.

                                 LUIS RAMOS
                        Oh, fuck!

           This stops his protest cold.

                                 LUIS RAMOS (CONT’D)
                        Yo, you gotta to bust me down, Lucky.
                                  (then)
                        Bust me down, yo. Five hundred. Do what 
                        y’all gotta do, just don’t put my name on 
                        it. Bust me down, yo. For real.

           Lucky turns back The Room. Thinks. Wonders. 

                                 LUCKY
                        Fine. But I may need your help.

           Ramos nods. Lucky leaves the apartment.

           INT. LEXUS - NIGHT

           Lucky gets the car. He’s still holding Stan’s WALLET. He 
           throws it on the dashboard, harder than is necessary. 

           He rubs his face. Shit! Shit! 

           Then, with one final glance at the apartment windows, he 
           starts the Lexus and pulls away.

                                                                FADE TO:
           INT. THE ROOM - DAY

           Early light beams through dirty windows. Stan’s still on 
           his mattress. Listening. Seagulls. A BUS passes. 

           He collects himself -- uses the end of his blind fold to 
           wipe his forehead; runs a hand over his hair; sniffs his 
           underarms, pulls his jacket lapels forward. Straightens.

           Stanley Alpert is ready to go home.

           A TITLE tells us it’s now...

                                     January 22, 1998

           EXT. LINDEN AVENUE - DAY

           Morning bustle. Wearing another dark shirt and tie, Lucky 
           comes out of his house sipping at a coffee mug. He’s with 
           his fiancee, SANDRA (19). They’ve clearly not slept much. 

           They kiss good-bye -- cranky, perfunctorily -- and go in 
           different directions. Sandra shoulders a book bag.

           Just your average young man, Lucky shuffles to his Lexus, 
           and STOPS COLD...The passenger window has been smashed. 

           He’s been robbed. He spins in shock, furry, indignation. 

                                 LUCKY 
                        Fucking negros!

           He means it -- there’s not a trace of irony in his voice. 

                                 OFFENDED BUREAUCRAT (O.S.)
                                  (pre-lap)
                        Did you just call me Robert Moses?!

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - BROOKLYN FEDERAL BUILDING - DAY

           DAN MORETSKY (36) stands at the back of the room full of 
           heated Community Activists and Government Suits. 

                                 WOOLLY ACTIVIST
                        No one’s calling you Robert Moses!

                                 PRAGMATIC WOMAN
                        It’s a bike path, people!

           Anxious, Dan checks his watch and leaves.
           INT. ASSISTANT’S BULLPEN - DAY

           Dan peeks in Stan’s office. Empty. Someone sent flowers. 
           A Happy Birthday balloon bouquet dances under a vent. 

           STAN’S ASSISTANT comes up, bundled up from a donut run.

                                 STAN’S ASSISTANT
                        He hasn’t checked in.

                                 DAN
                        The Gowanus arbitration’s going south.

           She grimaces. Dan picks up her desk phone.

                                 STAN’S ASSISTANT
                        I’ve tried like nine times. 

           He puts the phone down again.

                                 DAN
                        Where’s Scott Daniels this morning?

           INT. COURTROOM - BROOKLYN FEDERAL COURT BUILDING - DAY

           The judge waits. The jury waits. 

           At the prosecutor’s table, SCOTT DANIELS (42) has turned 
           to confer with a colleague leaning in from the gallery.

           Dan and Scott’s whisperings appear full of gravitas...

                                 SCOTT
                        He had a blind date last night. And it’s 
                        his Birthday. Do the math.

           Dan nods. That’s probably it. Of course.

                                 DAN 
                        How does he do it? 

                                 SCOTT
                        Attrition. He wears them down. That, and 
                        the environmental angle. 

                                 DAN 
                        You’re right. Women love the environmental 
                        angle, don’t they? 

                                 SCOTT 
                        Dude, you have no idea.
           INT. THE ROOM - DAY

           The girl’s are gone. Ren snores. Sen’s only half awake. 

           Stan’s impatient voice breaks the morning stillness...

                                 STANLEY (O.S.)
                        What time is it now?

           Sen clears his throat, raspy from the long night.

                                 SEN 
                        Lucky a little late is all.

           Stan bobs his blindfolded head, trying to keep hope alive.

           He fidgets. A PLANE passes out in the morning sky.

                                 SEN (CONT’D)
                        Sun’s up. You best ride back in the trunk. 

                                 STANLEY
                        Oh? Okay. 

           A strained beat.

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        Sen?

                                 SEN
                           Umm.

                                 STANLEY
                        The trunk thing kinda makes me nervous. 
                                  (then)
                        I might not be able to breathe back there. 
                        Lexus’s probably have a pretty tight cargo 
                        seal. They have a lot of monsoons in Japan. 
                        It’s very wet there. Humid. It’s tropical.

                                 SEN
                        Don’t worry about it, Stanley.

           Stan tries to let it go. He can’t. 

                                 STANLEY
                        What if the exhaust system has a leak? I’ll 
                        be on top of all that carbon monoxide. 

                                 SEN
                        Yeah, don’t worry.
           Stan bites his lip. It’s fine, Stan. It’s probably fine. 

           Still...

                                 STANLEY
                        I dunno, Sen. This trunk thing...

                                 SEN
                        Stan! Shut the fuck up! Damn!

           They hear car tires SQUEAK outside.

           EXT. 1430 EASTERN PARKWAY - DAWN

           The Lexus is parked in front. Again, we see the passenger-
           side front window has been violently smashed.

           INT. THE ROOM - DAWN

           Stan smiles huge as he hears the FRONT DOOR open.

                                 LUCKY (O.S.)
                        Luis! Get up! Luis!

           Hurried FOOTSTEPS.

           Lucky enters in a loosely controlled panic.

                                 LUCKY (CONT’D)
                        Alright, there’s been a change of plans.
                                  (calling back)
                        Luis!

                                 STANLEY
                        What?! No! No, change of plans. No! No way.

                                 LUCKY
                        Just a couple of hours, Stanley. I need to 
                        replace a window in the Lexus. One of our 
                        affiliates, Luis, is gonna watch you.

                                 STANLEY
                        Okay, Lucky, you made me a promise... 

                                 LUCKY
                        I need to take Sen and Ren someplace.

                                 STANLEY
                        What? Where?
                                 REN
                        We got school, Lux.

           Luis enters. Sleepy. 

                                 SEN
                        What the fuck happened?

                                 STANLEY
                        Wait! What school?! 

           Lucky takes Sen’s .45 and shoves it in Luis’s hands.

                                 LUCKY
                        My fiancee left Stan’s wallet on my dash--

                                 STANLEY
                        What school?! High School?!

                                                            SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. TENEMENT HOUSE - DAY

           The avenue outside is surprisingly busy during the day. 

           Rap MUSIC. Hard. Angry. Something from early ICE CUBE.

           INT. THE ROOM - DAY

           CLOSE on blindfolded Stan. Stewing. Furious.

           When Stan’s mad, everyone around him knows it... 

                                 STANLEY   
                        Okay, can we listen to a station that plays 
                        something besides rap? Hello? Please.

           No response. Stan MOANS. The stereo blares unchanged.

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        Has this artist been shot?! I only listen to 
                        rappers who’ve been shot! It has to say so 
                        on the CD. “This artist has been shot.” Not 
                        female rappers though. Them, I judge on the 
                        ability to treat their backsides like jello.

           No response. 

           Stan doesn’t realize he’s alone in The Room. 
                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        God, this music’s repetitive! Do these guys 
                        have any emotional register other than angry 
                        and horny? And their rhyme schemes? “Git” 
                        does not rhyme with “Gat”. Okay? What’s the 
                        hell’s a gat anyway?! There’s always a gat. 
                        Gat! Gat. Sounds like a Dr. Suess character.

           Honey’s bed head appears in the doorway. 

                                 HONEY
                        Who you talkin’ at? 
                                  (calling)
                        Luis?! What the fuck?!

                                 STANLEY
                        Great abduction management, Guys!

           FOOTSTEPS mosey down the Main Hallway. 

           Ramos enters, sniffling. She gives him a dirty look. 

                                 HONEY
                        Yo cracker lookin’ peaked.

                                 LUIS RAMOS
                        That’s how they look.

           Stan does seem pale; his hair, matted; his shirt, soiled.

           The FRONT DOOR opens and closes. 

                                 STANLEY
                        Who’s that? Is that Lucky? Lucky?!

                                 MYSTIC (O.S.)
                        Just us, Sugar. 

           Stan deflates. Mystic and Mercedes enter with food. They 
           are not day people. Luis rifles their bag hungrily.

                                 LUIS RAMOS 
                        Yo, yo, yo, yo. I said chicken sandwich.

                                 MERCEDES
                        Burrito a sandwich.

                                 HONEY
                        No it ain’t.

                                 STANLEY
                        Listen...
                                 MYSTIC
                        It like a sandwich, Sugar. Bread. Insides.

                                 HONEY
                        Burrito ain’t a goddamn sandwich. You ever 
                        have a baloney burrito?

                                 MERCEDES
                        Yeah.

                                 STANLEY
                        Listen...

                                 LUIS RAMOS
                        I ain’t even a part of this nigga shit!

                                 HONEY
                        Ramos right. This man ain’t our business.

                                 MYSTIC
                        We helpin’ out in our community.

                                 STANLEY
                        Listen!

           Stan finally their attention.

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        Listen. Right now, all of you are guilty of 
                        felony kidnapping. Federal. They can send 
                        you to any penitentiary in the system. Not 
                        upstate. Somewhere you won’t know anybody. 
                        Someplace run by angry skinheads. Wyoming.
                                  (angry)
                        Or you can let me go! Immediately! Now!

           Stan’s started to sweat. He habitually checks his pulse.

           A beat. Looks.

                                 HONEY
                        Fuck it. I’m callin’ Lucky.

           She drops her burrito, goes to the door.

                                 MYSTIC
                        He comin’ back directly, Sugar.

                                 HONEY
                        Yeah, cause I’m callin’! What the number?
                        Nine-one-seven...six-nine--
           The others WAVE their hands frantically. Honey FREEZES. 
           She’s said half of Lucky’s number in front of Stan.

           Stares. Did he hear? 

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        Yeah. Y’all. I be right back.

           She exits with scared look of girl who just screwed up. 

           CLOSE on Stanley. Yanking at his collar. Raging. Unwell.

           INT. SEARS - DAY

           A brand new PLAYSTATION BOX is set down on the counter.

           Ren tosses Stan’s AMEX beside it. An Older Sales Woman 
           picks up the credit card to examine it. 

                                 SEN (O.S.)
                        Yo, Stanley Alpert?! What up, G?!

           Sen passes by, pretending to have encountered his friend, 
           Stan Alpert, out shopping. They clinch fists.

                                 SEN (CONT’D)
                        New Playstation, huh? Tight. 

                                 REN
                        It for my kids.

           Sen’s face tells us Ren’s gone impromptu.

                                 SEN
                        Yeah? Aight. Yo kids, huh? Aight. 

           EXT. SEARS PARKING LOT - KING’S PLAZA - DAY

           The Lexus idles in an isolated corner of the wintery lot; 
           its broken window has been taped up with PLASTIC.

           INT. LEXUS - DAY

           Lucky looks about furtively. He sees Sen march toward the 
           car. Ren’s twenty feet behind, carrying a SEARS BAG.

           Sen gets in the front, irked; Ren in the back, sheepish.  

                                 REN
                        You got a new Platystation, Lux. 
                                 LUCKY
                        Fine. Thank you.

           Lucky drives. Distracted. Hiding something from the boys.

           INT. THE ROOM - DAY

           Honey returns. Pushes the door open slowly. 

           Mystic, Mercedes and Luis stand around Stan. Sweat runs 
           down his face and neck; his shirt is wet; his breathing 
           has gone quick and shallow. 

                                 MYSTIC
                        Stan don’t feel none too good.

           Stan rolls over his side, gets up on all fours.

                                 LUIS RAMOS
                        Yo, yo, yo, what the fuck you doin’?

                                 STANLEY
                        It’s my heart. It’s racing. My chest hurts. 
                        It’s radiating! Okay? It’s radiating down my 
                        left arm! I’m pretty sure it’s radiating. 

                                 LUIS RAMOS
                        Oh, shit! Yo, he gonna mess us up, yo! What 
                        the matter with yo fuckin’ heart, man?
                                  (then)
                        Don’t be fuckin’ with us! 

           Luis waves the .45 as if he would shoo away the illness.

                                 LUIS RAMOS (CONT’D)
                        Yo, Homes, you know what’s good for you, 
                        don’t be makin’ shit up, yo!

           Stan’s having a hard time catching his breath.

                                 MERCEDES
                        He can’t breathe. You best dial 9-1-1. 

                                 LUIS RAMOS
                        You do it!

                                 MERCEDES
                        Nobody put me in charge, Nigger!

           A tense beat. Everyone watches the white man wheeze.
                                 LUIS RAMOS
                        Lucky gonna call me a rat, yo! You gonna  
                        get me shot, or killed or somethin’! 
                                  (then)
                        How we know he ain’t fakin’?! 
                                  (then)
                        Stop that! Yo?! I said, stop that!

                                 MYSTIC
                        He dyin’, y’all.

           Ramos aims the gun at Stan with both hands.

                                 LUIS RAMOS
                        I ain’t watchin’ this!

                                 MERCEDES
                        You gonna shoot him for dyin’?!

                                 LUIS RAMOS
                        I ain’t fuckin’ watchin’ this!

           Stan tries to speak, manages only two words...

                                 STANLEY
                        ...I’m...okay...

                                 HONEY
                        He lyin’ now.

                                 LUIS RAMOS
                        Fuck!

           Stan’s still on all fours, drooling. In a death panic, he 
           reaches up, yanks down his blindfold. 

                                 LUIS RAMOS (CONT’D)
                        Put that back on! Put that back! Yo, tell 
                        him to put that back!

           Stan faces the mattress, pale, gasping. 

           It’s painful to watch.

                                 LUIS RAMOS (CONT’D)
                        Stop that! Yo! Stop it! 

           Stan can’t speak. The .45 shakes wildly in Luis’s hand.

                                 MYSTIC
                        He dyin’.
                                 LUIS RAMOS
                        Fuck!
                                  (then)
                        Fuck!

           Stan starts gagging. 

           Luis is ready to shoot just to make the situation go away  
           -- he starts to mutter hysterically... 

                                 LUIS RAMOS (CONT’D)
                        Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! 

           Finally...

                                 HONEY
                        Shoot him! 

           Honey has screamed so loudly that Mercedes, Mystic, and 
           Luis are all cut short. She’s trembling. Near tears.

           The sudden weirdness of it breaks the spell over Luis. He 
           lowers the gun. Stan’s wheezing slowly dissipates. 

           He holds up a “wait” finger.

                                 STANLEY
                        ...had this...before...

           His PANIC ATTACK subsides.

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        ...didn’t eat...

           They watch his breathing stabilize.

           Everyone relaxes.

           The BUZZER sounds out in the hall. Mystic goes to get it. 
           Mercedes looks baleful at Honey, who still quivers.

           Honey won’t meet Mercedes’s eyes.

                                 MYSTIC (O.S.)
                        Sen and Ren comin’ up, Y’all!

           When Honey finally looks over,...

                                 MERCEDES
                        Yeah, you try and save yo chunky ass.
           EXT. RIVERDALE TOWERS - BROOKLYN - DAY

           A massive project. Dilapidated. Scary.

           A DEALER KID (14) lurks in a frozen dirt playground as a 
           black Lexus pulls up in an adjacent parking lot.

           INT. LEXUS - DAY

           The Dealer Kid sits in the back and gives Lucky attitude.

                                 DEALER KID
                        I don’t sell guns. You wanna get strapped, 
                        go down South like every other nigga. 

                                 LUCKY
                        I’m looking for something special. A burner 
                        used in some serious shit. 

           He takes the PLAYSTATION BOX off the floorboard and hands 
           it back. The Dealer Kid’s eyes get big in a hurry.

                                 LUCKY (CONT’D)
                        I’m looking for an enterprising-type young 
                        person who’s maybe dumped such weapons.

           The Kid’s checking out the console’s box. The corner has 
           a star burst that reads: “NEW! DUALSHOCK CONTROLLER!”

                                 DEALER KID
                        This one got the dual shock con-trol?

           Lucky turns, thinks he’s kidding, realizes he can’t read.

                                 LUCKY
                        Yeah. 

           EXT. BROOKLYN RAIL YARDS - DUSK

           We fly over the massive yards. Trains. Tracks. Icy weeds.

           In a far corner of the yard, nestled against an overpass 
           for the Shore Parkway, there’s a baseball diamond.

           EXT. BASEBALL DIAMOND - DUSK

           The diamond is muddy and grey; the outfield, patched with 
           filthy snow. Out in center field, a young black man treks 
           in a tie, sipping a STARBUCK’S, holding an ice scraper.
           At a rusty “no trespassing” sign, Lucky kneels and digs.

           He digs. And digs. Beach wind wets him.

           He hits plastic. Glancing around, he yanks an old trash 
           bag out of the earth. Inside are three guns. Wrapped. 

           He unwraps a Glock 31, its polymer body strangely new.

           Then he sees the T-shirt it was wrapped in has a serious 
           blood stain. Lucky’s breath catches. 

           His coat and tie flap timidly in the wind. 

           EXT. THE BOTTOMLINE CLUB - NIGHT

           Waiting silently with Scott and Dan are Stan’s Friends: 
           tough DARCY (40), elegant and married ALYSOUN (32), and 
           Scott’s brother, MATT (29), with his date, DAFNE (30). 

           They hug themselves in the cold. Breath mist rises from 
           each like an thought bubble of roiling worry.

                                 DARCY
                        It’s freezing out here.

           Darcy’s a lawyer with bad attitude and a great body. 

                                 ALYSOUN
                        And we’re sure he knows the venue.

                                 DAN
                        He’s got the tickets, Alysoun.

                                 MATT
                        Isn’t his Dad really sick?

                                 DAN
                        Parkinson’s. He’d call one of us.

                                 DARCY
                        We talked on the phone last night around 
                        six-forty-five. He seemed distracted. Like 
                        there was somebody else in his apartment.

           Scott and Dan exchange a covert glance. 

                                 ALYSOUN
                        Maybe he met a girl. They could’ve run off 
                        somewhere. I dunno, Cancun. Brussels. 

           Darcy breathes deep, and makes a hard decision.
                                 DARCY
                        Actually, Stan’s started seeing someone.

                                 ALYSOUN
                        He has?

                                 MATT
                        Who?

                                 DARCY
                        Me.

           Dan’s goofy grin goes lopsided, a circus smile, like he’s 
           afraid he’s about to see something unpleasant. 

                                 DARCY (CONT’D)
                        It’s not like you send out announcements.

                                 ALYSOUN
                        Oh. Sure. Of course.
                                  (covering)
                        To be honest, Michael and I have had zero 
                        quality time with Stan lately. 

                                 DARCY
                        It’s only been three weeks.

                                 DAN
                        That’s great for you guys, Darcy.

           Clearly, no one thinks it’s great. A beat. Darcy looks up 
           the street, petulant. Where the hell is Stan?

                                 DARCY
                        God, it’s fucking freezing.

                                 SCOTT
                        Let’s wait in Dojo’s.

           He points an chain DINER across the street. 

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        We’ll get a booth by the window.

           INT. THE ROOM - NIGHT

           Stan faces the corner with the blindfold down around his 
           neck, lamp at his back. He’s careful not turn around.

           The long delay has unleashed Stan’s mouthy bravado...
                                 STANLEY
                        Lucky said “a couple of hours”! That’s a 
                        quote! A “couple of hours”!

                                 SEN
                        Man got busy is all.

           Sen, Ren, Mystic, Mercedes and Ramos are scattered around 
           in the dark behind him. Pot smoke wisps hang in the air. 

                                 STANLEY
                        It’s dark! I may be facing the wall but I 
                        can certainly tell when it’s dark!

                                 SEN
                        Lucky be here soon enough.

           Honey lurks by the door, feeling apart from the group. 

                                 STANLEY
                        Is that a promise? Do I have your word, Sen? 
                        Cause it’d be really terrific to have a high 
                        school kid’s solemn oath.

                                 SEN
                        Damn, white man, why you gotta be a dick?

           Stan doesn’t answer -- he is being a dick.

           Then, to the room in general,...

                                 SEN (CONT’D)
                        What got Stan all salty?

                                 MERCEDES
                        He had a heart attack. But he alright now.

           Mercedes and Honey keep glaring at each other.

                                 MYSTIC
                        Don’t you wanna stay with us, Sugar?

                                 REN
                        Yeah, Stan, you should join our gang.

                                 SEN
                        Tell us which of yo friends to rob.

           The boys snicker.

                                 MERCEDES 
                        He gonna need some decent clothes.
                                 SEN
                        We get you iced out. Tims. Blowy shirt.

           The image of Gangsta Stan tickles everyone.

                                 SEN (CONT’D)
                        Ain’t nobody gonna fuck with you. 

                                 STANLEY
                        What, just for dressing like a thug?

                                 SEN
                        Fuck, yeah. Black man got two choices. He 
                        can be a nigger. Or he can be invisible.

                                 MYSTIC
                        If you wanna be black, you gotta be ghetto, 
                        Sugar. All them others is oreos.

                                 SEN
                        Damn straight. Niggas keepin’ it real.

           Ren grunts his contempt for a rainbow of middle-classes.

           A SIREN passes outside. No one speaks until it fades.

                                 STANLEY
                        You know what, guys, you shouldn’t use that 
                        word. Seriously. I get offended for you. 

                                 SEN
                        What word?

                                 STANLEY   
                        You know what word, the N-word.

                                 SEN 
                        “Nigger”? You mean, nigger? What, you never 
                        say nigger?

                                 STANLEY
                        No. 

           Everyone PFIFFS and MOANS in cynical disbelief.

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        Hey. Hey. I always say “African American”.

                                 SEN
                        Say it. Say “nigger”. Call me a nigger.

                                 STANLEY
                        No.
                                 SEN
                        I ain’t fuckin’ askin’!

           He appears to mean it. 

           Finally,...

                                 STANLEY
                        Okay. Nigger. You’re a nigger.

                                 SEN 
                        Motherfucker! 

           Sen racks his gun. The girls giggle. 

           Silence returns.

                                 SEN (CONT’D)
                        See? What’s happenin’ now? Nothin’. Thirty-
                        nine flavors of motherfuckin’ nothin’. That 
                        African-American shit stupid.

           Ren snickers.

                                 SEN (CONT’D)
                        I hate crackers frontin’ with that. Like 
                        they down cause they say African-American. 
                        Get away with all kinds of bullshit, long 
                        as you stick “African-American” in there.
                                  (a few white voices)
                        “You should dress less...African-American.” 
                        “At work, we don’t speak African-American.” 
                        “African-American babies is so cute?”

           They’re not bad imitations. 

                                 SEN (CONT’D)
                        Park Slope Crackers. I say, slap ‘em naked.

                                 MERCEDES
                        The women, the worse. Sayin’ ‘excuse me’ 
                        when they ain’t even close. Thin-lipped 
                        bitch passin’ ten feet away, “Excuse me. 
                        Sorry.” Fuck you. I ain’t got the bug!

                                 REN
                        And snow skiin’. That’s fucked up.

           Everyone just looks at Ren, obscured in the dark.

                                 SEN
                        What the hell you talkin’ ‘bout?!
                                 REN
                        Snow is nasty. Who knows what done shit in 
                        there! I ain’t slidin’ round in no snow!

           Laughs.

                                 SEN
                        Damn, Ren.

                                 MYSTIC
                        Do white women do anal? 

           The room EXPLODES. 

           Sen laughs so hard he bangs his gun onto the floor. 

                                 MYSTIC (CONT’D)
                        I’m serious. Y’all! I’m serious! I am!

           Even Stan has to chuckle.

                                 MYSTIC (CONT’D)
                        Listen. I don’t do anal, right? Not with no 
                        stranger. That somethin’ special. Somethin’ 
                        you give a man. Like on yo weddin’ night. 

                                 MERCEDES
                        Oh, it special. Ninety-Nine Dollar Special.

           The boys love it. Ren does an old school “whoop, whoop”.

                                 MYSTIC
                        You niggas just rude. You got no idea how 
                        to act round company. 
                                  (then)
                        You make yo girls do anal, Stanley?

           Everyone calms down. 

           Stan realizes they expect an answer.

                                 STANLEY
                        Okay. Well. Yes. I’ve tried...giving it.

                                 SEN
                        Damn straight!

                                 MYSTIC
                        Whose idea was it?

                                 STANLEY
                        Mine. I guess. 
                                 MYSTIC
                        Why? What I’m askin’ is, what make a man 
                        need to put his junk up in there?

                                 SEN
                        It tight...

                                 MYSTIC 
                        Shush, Sen.

                                 STANLEY
                        I dunno, Mystic. I suppose you wanna see if 
                        she lets you. If you can take things to the 
                        next level. You’re right. You think it means 
                        you’re special. You think it shows...trust. 
                                  (then)
                        Maybe that’s harder to find than love. 

                                 MYSTIC
                        Thank you, Stanley. Thank you very much. 

           Mystic’s form collapses with satisfied grunt. Triumphant. 

           There’s a oddly warm silence. 

                                 SEN
                        Hang on, Stan. You be home in couple hours. 
                        You got my word on that.

           Then, calmly, comforted,...

                                 STANLEY
                        Okay, Sen. Okay. 
                                  (then)
                        Yeah, I can do that.

           INT. DOJO’S RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Late. Almost empty. Scott, Darcy and Dan are on one side 
           of a window booth; Matt and Aysoun, on the other. 

           Dafne’s just returning from a pay phone out in the Foyer. 

           She slides in beside Matt. 

                                 DAFNE
                        Okay. I tried every hospital in Manhattan. 
                        No Stanley Alpert. No John Doe’s. 

                                 DARCY
                        Are you sure they really checked?
                                 MATT
                        She’s a medical doctor, Darcy.

                                 DARCY
                        You said she was an allergist. 

           Matt gives Darcy a tough look. 

                                 DARCY (CONT’D)
                        I’m just saying, if our goal here is to get 
                        some harried ER nurse to scour her records, 
                        maybe, you know, maybe allergies aren’t the 
                        most intimidating specialty. 

           Matt drops it. Everyone’s irritable. Scott looks out the 
           window. The sidewalk in front of BottomLine is barren.

           A miserable beat. 

           Dan decides to lighten the mood...

                                 DAN
                        Stan’s probably fine, you guys. Manhattan’s 
                        different now. We’ve got Giuliani.

           The mayor’s name seems to make no one feel better.

                                 SCOTT
                        I say we find a way to break into Stan’s 
                        apartment. Let’s talk to his Super. 
                                  (a plan)
                        Worst comes to worst, somebody climbs up 
                        the fire escape, and breaks a window.

           INT. HALLWAY IN STAN’S BUILDING - NIGHT

           Scott and Dan talk with the Super, his name is MR. PENALTA 
           (44), in his doorway. Spanish TV plays behind him. 

                                 MR. PENALTA 
                        Twenty years, I have this building. No 
                        problem. Two weeks ago, Three-Zero-Nine is 
                        hang herself. Nice girl. Actress. Dirty 
                        movies, okay. Not my business. Now, my 
                        friend, you say Eight-One-Seven is no come 
                        to work. Maybe Mr. Stan is also... 

           He makes a hanging gesture and a guttural sound. 
                                 MR. PENALTA (CONT’D)
                        Maybe. I am only thinking because is many 
                        times catching. First one. Then another. 
                        More. Other Supers, we know of this. Wait.

           He quickly disappears, leaving the door cracked.

           The guys wait a few seconds before Scott calls...

                                 SCOTT
                        Should we go up without you?!

           Mr. Penalta appears again, now holding his flashlight.

                                 MR. PENALTA
                        I go. And if I go, you go. 

           INT. HALLWAY ON STAN’S FLOOR - NIGHT

           Darcy paces in front of Stan’s door. Alysoun and Dafne 
           sit on the carpet, backs to the wall. 

                                 ALYSOUN
                        How long have you and Matt been dating?

                                 DAFNE
                        Tonight.

           They share a tired giggle. Darcy checks the peep hole. 

           EXT. COURTYARD - STAN’S BUILDING - NIGHT

           Matt peers up the fire escape to see three dark figures 
           climbing high above. Spidery forms. A beam of light.

           INT. KITCHEN - STAN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Narrow light refracts in the window.

           Out on the landing, we see Mr. Penalta being held by Dan 
           and Scott, who brace themselves dramatically, goofy white 
           guys trying too hard at any physical task.

           The Super says something muffled. They let him go.

           Mr. Penalta SHATTERS the glass with his light, clears the 
           shards from the frame. Scott steps through first.
           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The track lights come on to illuminate a messy bachelor’s 
           living room. Gaudy sofa. Huge TV. Glowing electronics.

                                 DAN
                        I’ll check the bedroom.

           He goes through its door carefully, the cop creep. While 
           Mr. Penalta decides to stay put in the kitchen. 

           Scott searches Stan’s desk, lifting papers with a pencil.

           The girls POUND on the front door. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Hold on! Let us secure the premises!

                                 DAN (O.S.)
                        Scott!

           Scott drops the pencil, hurries back to the...

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Scott finds Dan standing inside the Bathroom.

                                 SCOTT
                        What?!

           Dan gestures toward the front door, waves him closer.

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Scott enters. Dan points to a nearly empty waste basket. 
           Stuck to its plastic liner is a used CONDOM.

                                 SCOTT
                        So?!

                                 DAN
                        What if it wasn’t Darcy?!

           Scott scoffs. Ancient, male, cloaking instincts click in.

                                 SCOTT
                        Take it out and flush it.

                                 DAN
                        No! Yuck. Man. No.
           The girls BANG on the door. Scott goes. Dan considers the 
           possibly damning condom. Wincing, he reaches down...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - STAN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Stan’s Friends gather around his whirling PHONE MACHINE. 

           BEEP. 

                                 TWO SINGING OLDER WOMEN 
                           Happy Birthday to youuu! 
                           Happy Birthday to youuu! 
                           Happy Birthday, dear Staaann! 
                           Happy Birthday to youuu!
                                  (one voice adds)
                           And many moooore!

           The Friends stay silent. The message is sort of sad.

                                 ARLENE ALPERT’S VOICE
                           It’s Mom and Grandma. Call us, Honey.

           BEEP.

                                 DAN’S VOICE
                           Dude, I just did the jump rope class. You 
                           won’t believe the hot chicks! God, I love 
                           working out-- 

           Dan hits forward. Smiles. Darcy manages to say nothing. 

           BEEP.

                                 BENJAMIN ALPERT
                           Son? Stanley? Hello? It’s your Father. I 
                           wanted to wish you--

           Dan hits forward.

           BEEP.

                                 A BLACK FEMALE VOICE
                           Hello. This is Michelle. I found your 
                           credit cards this mornin’ in the street. 

           Alysoun gasps. The faces around the machine lean closer, 
           each a mix of fear and disbelief.

                                 MICHELLE
                           About seven in the mornin’. It was near my 
                           work in Bedford-Stuyvesant. 
                                 DARCY
                        Omigod.

                                 MICHELLE
                           By the car wash. My number is 718-631-8437. 

           Scott writes the number down. No one dares speak. 

           BEEP. 

                                 AN OFFICIOUS VOICE
                           Mr. Alpert, this Chase Bank. There’s been 
                           unusual activity on your cash machine card. 

                                 ALYSOUN
                        Oh, no. 

           They’re all in full panic now.

                                 AN OFFICIOUS VOICE
                           We’d like to find out if this has been 
                           authorized. Please call Chase immediately.  
                           At 1-800-734-8000. Thank you.

           The last message. It leaves the room in a ravenous quiet. 
           Dafne keeps a hand over her mouth.

           Finally...

                                 SCOTT
                        No one touch anything. 

           INT. THE ROOM - NIGHT

           Late. Everyone waits. Facing the wall, Stan is exhausted 
           from hunger, the day’s roller-coaster of emotions. 

           Stan’s fight is almost gone. 

                                 LUCKY (O.S.)
                        Why isn’t he blindfolded?

           The kids all turn as Lucky enters, quietly yet again. 

                                 SEN
                        We got him facin’ the wall’s all.

           Lucky neither approves or disapproves. He steps over and 
           studies the back of his prisoner -- we see Stanley think 
           better of speaking. He’s too desperate.
                                 LUCKY
                        You ready go home, Stanley?

                                 STANLEY
                        Yes.

                                 LUCKY 
                        Let me tell you what’s going to happen. I’ll 
                        drive the girls over to the track. Then I 
                        have some business to attend. I’d like to 
                        get a bit more money from your account. I’ll 
                        be back after midnight. We’ll take you home.

           Another delay. Stan’s on the verge of frustrated tears.

           Lucky kneels -- his tone’s solicitous. 

                                 LUCKY (CONT’D)
                        No hard feelings, huh? I’ve just tried to 
                        ensure your safety with your own fear. 

           Facing the wall, Stan says nothing.

                                 LUCKY (CONT’D)
                        Stanley, let me ask you something.

           A meek nod.

                                 LUCKY (CONT’D)
                        If you had the chance to put me away for 
                        life, would you do it? 

           Stanley considers.

           Then...

                                 STANLEY
                        You know where I live. You know where my 
                        Father lives. I don’t know who you are. I 
                        don’t know where we are. I don’t care. 
                                  (a beat)
                        Please. I just want this whole thing over.  

           Lucky contemplates the flat sincerity of Stan’s answer.

           Then, he LAUGHS.

           Everyone looks. It’s a strained laugh.

                                 LUCKY 
                        That’s right. Make the negro think he’s got 
                        a chance. Open that door wide, then boom!
           He SLAPS his hands together in Stan’s ear. Stan flinches.

           As Lucky stands and turns away from him... 

                                 STANLEY
                        Grow up.

                                 LUCKY
                        Pardon?

                                 STANLEY
                        I said “grow up”.

                                 LUCKY
                        Yeah, I heard you.

                                 STANLEY
                        Shoot me or let me go. Either way, stop 
                        pretending you’re the victim here.
                                  (then)
                        Stop whining.

           There’s no anger in his voice. 

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        The door’s open, Lucky. Okay? Not always. 
                        Not everywhere. But after thirty years of 
                        people like me, it’s pretty much fucking 
                        open. If you’d stop worrying about being a 
                        negro, maybe you could just walk through 
                        it. And if you don’t, don’t blame the rest 
                        of us. White man’s keeping you down. White 
                        man put crack in the hood. The white man’s 
                        given you AIDS. Please. Grow the fuck up. 

           Stunned silence. Lucky steps back over to him, looks down 
           on the back of Stan’s head with confused menace.

           Stanley’s not done.

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        The door’s open. Deal with it. You’re just 
                        too proud to walk through. Or afraid.
                                  (unflinching)
                        It’s either that or you’re just plain lazy. 

           Lucky grabs Ren’s Tec 9. He yanks Stan backwards by the 
           scarf and crams the muzzle into his mouth. 

           Stan RETCHES. Mystic SCREAMS. 

           Stan forces himself to keep his eyes shut.
                                 LUCKY
                        Stand.

           Grabbing Stan by the tie, gun still in his mouth, Lucky 
           drags him to the Hallway. Sen and Ren rush to follow.

                                 LUCKY (CONT’D)
                        Stay here! 

           INT. MAIN HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Lucky forces Stan down the hall. We think he’s taking him 
           to the bathroom, and to his execution. 

           Instead, he pushes Stan hard against the front door. 

                                 LUCKY 
                        There. There’s your door.

           He pulls Stan back, opens it wide, gets behind him.

                                 LUCKY (CONT’D)
                        Open your fucking eyes.

           STAN’S POV on the building’s landing framed by the open 
           front door, dark and dangerous freedom.

           Lucky presses the gun to Stan’s back. 

                                 LUCKY (CONT’D)
                        Door’s open. Go. Bounce. Go on.
                                  (nothing)
                        Walk through! Walk through! 

           Stanley doesn’t move, can’t move. A decisive beat.

                                 LUCKY (CONT’D)
                        Yeah. It ain’t that easy.

           Lucky slams the door shut. He turns to see Stan has his 
           eyes closed again; as always, refusing to see him.

           He gets right in the white man’s face. 

           They stand there. Close. Worlds apart.

           And then Lucky mutters,...

                                 LUCKY (CONT’D)
                        Negro.
           INT. BASEMENT IN THE SUBURBS - NIGHT

           FBI SPECIAL AGENT RICHARD MEADE (54) is a schlubby Barney 
           Rubble, more Jersey beat cop than federal bureaucrat.

           He’s doing his laundry, spraying the underarms of all his 
           dress shirts with pre-wash. Mist gets in his face.

           The phone RINGS upstairs. Meade considers ignoring it.

           INT. KITCHEN - MEADE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The RINGING phone’s on a wall. We hear FOOTSTEPS come up 
           the stairs. As Meade appears, the phone stops. He sighs.

           He goes back down the stairs. We hear him...CREAK, CREAK.

           A BEEPER on the counter vibrates. The creaks stop.

           EXT. PALISADES PARKWAY - NIGHT

           Close on the door of ratty, brown van: Caribe Grocery.

           We move up to see the driver: Special Agent Meade speeds 
           through the night, blows into his hands to keep warm. 

           The van rattles purposefully down the empty highway. 

           Up ahead, lights from the George Washington bridge glow 
           orange and ominous off low winter clouds. 

           INT. LOBBY OF STAN’S BUILDING - NIGHT

           A suburban dad scribbles in a notebook. 

           DETECTIVE SAMUEL FELDEN (35) is wearing a garish Giants 
           jacket, the kind wives universally relegate to weekends. 
           Though it takes us a while to notice -- and no one ever 
           mentions it -- Felden also wears a yarmulke.

           The West Village detective is flanked by two FBI AGENTS.

                                 FBI AGENT ONE
                        Here he comes.

           Special Agent Meade enters, cold, rubbing his arms. 

                                 MEADE
                        Heat’s out in the brown van.
           Detective Felden extends his hand.

                                 FELDEN
                        Special Agent Meade, I’m Detective Felden. 
                        Sixth Precinct. Everybody’s upstairs.

           INT. ELEVATOR IN STAN’S BUILDING - NIGHT

           Special Agent Mead listens to Detective Felden read from 
           his notes. The two FBI Agents ride up behind them.

                                 FELDEN
                        He’s single. No depression. No substances. 
                        Seems pretty reliable. Prefers “Stan”.

                                 MEADE
                        You work a lot of kidnappings, Detective.

                                 FELDEN
                        Nope.

                                 MEADE 
                        Well, there are two types of federal-officer 
                        kidnappings: the good kind and the bad kind.

                                 FELDEN
                        What’s the good kind?

                                 MEADE
                        Good kind is when we find the body.

           The Detective blows air out through pursed lips.

                                 FELDEN
                        One of his friend’s says he’s been working 
                        a big industrial pollution case. It’s civil 
                        but the plaintiff may have mob connections. 

                                 MEADE
                           Meh.

                                 FELDEN
                        Sir?

                                 MEADE
                        How many people you got upstairs?

                                 FELDEN
                        Including my detective squad? Eight. Ten.

                                 MEADE
                        How many we got?
                                 FBI SUIT TWO
                        Seven. Mehan and Wyatt are in transit.

           EXT. THIRD STREET SIDEWALK - NIGHT

           AGENT MEHAN (34) has a black eye and paces in the street. 
           She’s agitated, breathing furiously, hands on her hips so 
           that we see she has a serious revolver. 

           AGENT WYATT (28) barrels out of the bar in front of her. 
           Wyatt’s a preppy black man. A baby face.

                                 AGENT WYATT
                        Third avenue. Not third street.

                                 AGENT MEHAN
                        Crap!

           INT. ELEVATOR IN STAN’S BUILDING - NIGHT

           Special Agent Meade and Detective Felden as before.

                                 MEADE
                        So, basically, we got twenty, twenty-five 
                        law enforcement officers. All biting at the 
                        bit to run down somebody. Tonight. That’s a 
                        lot of heat for an environmental case. 
                                  (kindly)
                        This isn’t a mob job, Detective. People who 
                        dump bodies in the East River aren’t too 
                        worried about violating the Clean Water Act.

           INT. STAN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           A zoo. With Stan’s Friends, FBI, uniformed NYPD and the 
           Sixth Detective Squad, it’s a good two-dozen people. 

           The phone RINGS and is answered unseen throughout.

           Stan’s Friends have been joined by two additions: Alysoun 
           holds hands with her husband, MICHAEL, wearing a tux; and 
           a bubbly woman in club clothes, JANICE JANOFSKY (24).

           Special Agent Meade’s entourage enters. He climbs up on a 
           chair among the Friends; his tone is calm, paternal.

                                 MEADE 
                        Hello, everyone. My name is Special Agent 
                        Rich Meade. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MEADE  (CONT'D)
                        I’m in charge of finding Stan, and I’d like 
                        to do that before the sun comes up.

                                 SCOTT
                        Were you briefed on his mob case?

                                 MEADE
                        I was. Thank you. Alright. First things 
                        first. Does Stan have a girlfriend?

                                 JANICE JANOFSKY
                        Not exactly.

           Puzzled looks. Why is Janice Janofsky answering this?

                                 JANICE JANOFSKY (CONT’D)
                        I was his intern last semester. We still 
                        spend a lot of time together. As friends.
                                  (sheepish)
                        Mostly. So far.

                                 DARCY
                        Fuck me.

           All eyes go to Darcy. The air turns incredibly awkward.

                                 MEADE
                        You’ve been seeing Stan as well, Ma’am?

                                 DARCY
                                  (peeved)
                        Yes. Since New Year’s Eve. 

           Janice and Darcy’s eyes meet. Janice shrugs politely. 
           Darcy’s in no mood for gracious commiseration.

                                 MEADE
                        Alright. Anybody have any idea what Stan 
                        did last night?

           All heads shake no. Dan gives Scott a questioning look. 
           Scott nods, ruefully. Dan steps forward.

                                 DAN
                        To be honest...I think he had a blind date. 

           Darcy audibly moans. Two Uniformed Officers snicker.

                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                                  (to Darcy)
                        The daughter of one of his mom’s friends. 
                                  (to Janice)
                        He was just going to be polite.
           The fact he’s addressing both women elicits from Darcy a 
           furious grunt. Janice holds out her palms to signal it is 
           absolutely none of her business.

                                 MEADE
                        Alright. That’s fine. We’ll sort it out. 
                        But here’s what I need from friends and 
                        family right now: leave. This is a crime 
                        scene. Detective Felden over there will 
                        take your statements out in the hall.

           Meade steps down, quietly pulls Dan aside, whispers,... 

                                 MEADE (CONT’D)
                        Can I get you to stick around, Buddy?

                                 DAN
                        Sure.

           Dan turns and calls loudly to the exiting others...

                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        Guys! The FBI needs me to hang back!

           Special Agent Meade shakes his head. That was discrete.

           Everybody stops. Jealous glances that Dan gets to stay. 
           Darcy starts to protest, then just throws up her hands. 
           Scott gives Dan a dramatic good-luck thumbs up.

           The Friends leave as Agents Mehan and Wyatt now squeeze 
           though the door, arriving late and embarrassed. 

           Special Agent Meade chin points to Mehan’s black eye.

                                 MEADE 
                        What happened to you?

           She hesitates. Wyatt struggles to suppress the chortles. 
           Mehan’s one of those female officers who manages to seem 
           both tomboyish and mousy. She’s also a blusher.

           Finally,...

                                 AGENT MEHAN
                        It sorta happened during sex, Sir. 

           Their boss considers her. 

                                 MEADE
                        Alright. 
           INT. THE ROOM - NIGHT

           Stan’s blindfolded for the last time. Waiting. Given his 
           outburst, he now has no idea what will happen to him.  

           He can hear Sen breathing across the room. Ren sits over 
           there, too, hawking intermittently. 

                                 SEN
                        ‘Bout that time, Ren.

           Both boys stand. Stan can hear them getting their coats 
           on, preparing their weapons. Someone cracks a knuckle. 

                                 SEN (CONT’D)
                        Okay, mah man, put yo coat on.

           There’s warmth in Sen’s voice. Stan puts his coat on. 

           Sen kneels in front of him.

                                 SEN (CONT’D)
                        Keep yo fuckin’ eyes closed.

           He removes the scarf. Stan’s careful to do as he’s told. 
           Sen slips a NIGHT MASK over Stan’s eyes, then takes Ren’s 
           SUNGLASSES, fits them over the mask to hide it.

           We move CLOSER on Stan. Disheveled. Unsure. Afraid.

           CLOSER. We see The Room reflected in the sunglasses. This 
           the last we will see of it.

           CLOSER. 

           The screen goes BLACK. Dirty black. Light still flutters 
           and flares at the edges of the screen

           Out in the Main Hallway, the front door opens and closes.

           FOOTSTEPS approach. 

                                 LUCKY (O.S.)
                        Let’s go.

           I/E TRAVELING MONTAGE - STAN’S POV - NIGHT

           BLACK. Unlike our arrival in The Room, our exit is masked 
           in nearly complete darkness. No music. Ambient sound. 

                  Our emotions can be measured by our labored breathing.
           Three sets of footsteps take us down the MAIN HALLWAY and 
           echo as we descend the TENEMENT STAIRS. The pace quickens 
           over the LOBBY marble floor, out the intercom VESTIBULE.

           The sounds of the CITY slam us. Cars. Buses. Planes. Off 
           in the distance, a car alarm. Two women shout.

           BLACK. 

           Shoes on the sidewalk. Car doors open. We slide into the 
           back seat. Someone gets in to our right, another, left.

           Doors slam. The satisfying thud of Japanese engineering.

                                 LUCKY (O.S.)
                        We good?

           Lucky’s in the driver’s seat. The responses go unheard.

                  We’re winded from fear and lack of food and sleep.

           BLACK.

           The engine starts. The car pulls away. The plastic cover 
           for the passenger side window RATTLES angrily.

           Bumps. Potholes. 

           The tires’ whir changes when the car turns.

                  Our breathing regulates.

           We ride awhile with the windy rattle. Turns. Bumps. 

           BLACK. 

           Suddenly, the car slows down, tires chew gravel.

                  Our breathing intensifies.

           The Lexus is stopping. 

           Lucky lets the engine idle and gets out of the car.

                  We clear our throat, confused, afraid to speak.

           Shoes scrape pavement. The trunk opens. Items scrape as 
           they’re moved around. The trunk slams shut.

                  We’re on the verge of hyperventilation.

           Then, we hear...RIIIP! RIP! RIP! RIIIIIIIIIP!
           Industrial grade DUCT TAPE is stripped from its roll.

                  And we grunt in abject terror.

                                                                FADE IN:

           Opaque plastic, gently undulating. Strange lights. Human 
           hands. Lucky. He’s re-taping the broken window plastic.

           INT. LEXUS - NIGHT

           Stan sits nervous in the back seat between Sen and Ren. 
           When he’s finished re-taping, Lucky climbs back inside. 

           They pull away.

           The Lexus moves almost silently through traffic. 

           Sen can see Lucky’s eyes in the mirror. He’s nervous, he 
           keeps blinking, wiping his forehead.

           Sen gives Ren a look. Something’s wrong.

                                 SEN
                                  (fishing)
                        We givin’ him a twenty for a cab?

           Stan cocks his head. They’re not taking me to Manhattan.

           Lucky studies Sen a moment in his mirror.

                                 LUCKY
                        Who’s going to give him twenty dollars?

                                 REN
                        We got a twenty left from the split.

                                 LUCKY
                        I haven’t made the last withdrawal yet.

                                 SEN
                           Tch.

           Sen reaches into his own pocket, pulls out his wad, rips 
           out a twenty and stuffs it into Stanley’s hand.

           Done with that, he looks defiantly back at Lucky.

                                 LUCKY
                        Fine.
           EXT. PROSPECT PARK - NIGHT

           A vacant park road. The Lexus stops under a street lamp. 
           Lucky and Sen get out. Sen pulls Stan out after him.

                                 SEN
                        Wait a sec.

           Lucky comes around from the driver’s side. Sen gives him 
           a hard look, which he ignores. He turns Stan’s body.

                                 LUCKY
                        Don’t say a word. Put your hands over your 
                        head. Start walking. Straight. Don’t stop.

           Stan starts walking. We STAY on him. 

           Someone follows.

                                 SEN (O.S.)
                        Lux?

                                 LUCKY (O.S.)
                        I’ll be right back.

           Stan can hear footsteps consistently two or three meters 
           behind him. They walk awhile. A long while. 

           Until,...

                                 LUCKY (CONT’D)
                        That’s far enough.

           Stan waits. Silence. Wind.

           Lucky’s not going back to the car.

                                 STANLEY
                        I can go in the trunk. Okay? The trunk, we 
                        can just do the trunk thing! 

           Stan’s starting to panic.

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        Lucky, I can handle the trunk! I can!

                                 LUCKY
                        Get on your knees, Stanley.

           There’s an awful flatness to the instruction.
                                 STANLEY
                        Why are you doing this?! I haven’t done 
                        anything! I haven’t! I respect you! 

                                 LUCKY
                        Get down.

           Stan hears him step over the gravel, feels the end of the 
           Glock as Lucky forces him to the earth.

                                 STANLEY
                        Why are you doing this?! 

           A horrible beat.

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        Okay, Lucky, please, please! Please! I’m 
                        begging you! Do not shoot me like this. 
                        Please. Not in the dark. Let me see! Do not 
                        fucking shoot me in the dark! Lucky?! 

           No response.

           Lucky has his gun aimed at Stan’s skull. Tears appear in 
           his eyes. The gun shakes wildly.

           The thin, young black man looks back toward the Lexus but 
           it’s much too dark to see Sen or Ren. 

           Lucky’s expression is that of a terrified child. 

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        I was just walking down the street, okay?! 
                        I didn’t do anything to you! 
                                  (hysterical)
                        I didn’t do anything!

           Stanley’s crying. 

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        Fuck you! You don’t know me! You don’t know 
                        my heart! What I feel about! You don’t know 
                        the things I do! You don’t know!

           No response.

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        I’ll rat on you?! Yes! Of course, I’ll rat 
                        on you! What do you fucking think?! You can 
                        pick somebody off the street?! You don’t do 
                        that! My life’s not a game?! You want the 
                        truth?! Yeah?! Nothing you could say or do 
                        would keep me from turning on you! Nothing! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        I hate you! I fucking hate you! 
                                  (no response)
                        I hate you! I hate you!

           He’s screaming now -- his voice bouncing thru the woods.

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        I’ve earned that...I earned that right...

           No response.

           Stan weeps a few desperate seconds.

           Then, collecting himself,...

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        You want me to...You do...You need me to 
                        hate you...It’s all you’ve got.
                                  (simply)
                        It’s all you’re ever gonna have. 

           No response.

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        Fuck you.

           Stan rips away the night mask and sunglasses. His sylvan 
           surroundings surprise him -- the last place he expected 
           to be is in a park, as if already in some afterlife. 

           He turns to see...

           Lucky’s gone. 

           The smoky haze of midnight air hangs over a lonely road 
           that curves off without cars and without people.

           He shrieks in disbelief. Stands. Spins. Searches. 

           He’s dizzy but alone in the clear, cold night.

           Stanley Alpert SHOUTS. A man in a suit and overcoat, just 
           after midnight, shouts in the middle of a park.

           He tries to recognize his surroundings, pats his pockets, 
           finds his glasses and puts them on.

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        Prospect Park. Yes! Okay. Okay. 
                                  (realizing)
                        Just don’t get mugged. 

           He takes a split second to choose a direction and wobbles 
           off into a meadow, high-stepping over tall grass.
           EXT. PROSPECT PARK WEST BLVD. - NIGHT

           An elegant row of massive townhouses face Prospect Park.

           Paunchy Stan darts out of the woods and across the broad 
           avenue. Dress shoe heels echo off lonely asphalt.

           EXT. 7TH AVENUE - NIGHT

           Stan stumbles onto the Slope’s sleepy commercial strip.

           INT. PIZZA PLACE - NIGHT

           A YOUNG PIZZA GUY scrapes down the oven. Stan bursts his 
           way through orange chairs and up to the counter.

           He’s barely capable of speech.

                                 STANLEY
                        Excuse...Excuse me...Can I use your phone?!

           The Pizza Guy stares with no expression.

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        I was kidnapped....They just released me... 
                        I’m fine, I’m okay...I need a phone!

           The Pizza Guy allows himself a skeptical head tilt.

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        I don’t have money...I have money, I have a 
                        twenty, but the kidnappers touched it...The 
                        FBI will need it...for the prints...

                                 PIZZA GUY
                        You can’t get prints off paper.

                                 STANLEY
                        Money isn’t paper, it’s fabric -- Look! I’m 
                        a federal prosecutor! I need help!

           The Pizza Guy makes weary show of handing him the phone.

                                 PIZZA GUY
                        Make it quick. We’re closing.

           Stan takes the flour covered remote and dials furiously. 
           The guys just stands there. Stan gets a busy signal.
                                 STANLEY
                        Fuck!

           The Pizza Guy waits. Stan dials again.

                                 MR. ALPERT (ON THE PHONE)
                        Hello?

                                 STANLEY 
                        Dad?! It’s Stanley! I was kidnapped, but 
                        I’m okay! I’m fine! 

                                 MR. ALPERT (ON THE PHONE)
                        What? Where are you?!

                                 STANLEY
                        A pizza place in Park Slope! They just let 
                        me go! They held me for twenty-five hours!

                                 MR. ALPERT (ON THE PHONE)
                        I’ll be damned. Are you all right? 

                                 STANLEY
                        I’m fine! Has anyone bothered you?!

                                 MR. ALPERT (ON THE PHONE)
                        No. What are you talking about?

                                 STANLEY
                        I’ll tell you later. Just stay inside.

                                 MR. ALPERT (ON THE PHONE)
                        Call your apartment.

                                 STANLEY
                        What?

                                 MR. ALPERT (ON THE PHONE)
                        Call your apartment. The FBI and everybody, 
                        they’re all in your apartment. 

                                 STANLEY
                        Okay. Okay. I’m sending some agents to you. 

                                 MR. ALPERT (ON THE PHONE)
                        I’m glad your safe, Son. I don’t know what 
                        I would have done. God forbid. I don’t.

                                 STANLEY
                        Me too, Dad. I’ll call you later. Bye.

           Stan hangs up. Dials.
           To justify another call...

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        The FBI is at my apartment.

                                 PIZZA GUY
                        I gotta close.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - STANLEY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Dan’s on the sofa with his face in his hands. Police and 
           FBI Agents cluster importantly as the phone RINGS.

           Special Agent Meade picks it up.

                                 MEADE
                        Yeah?...Special Agent Rich Meade of the 
                        FBI. Who’s this?...

           He raises two fingers to silence the room. 

                                 MEADE (CONT’D)
                        Stan?

           Dan jumps up off the sofa.

                                 DAN
                        Stan? Is it Stan?!

           Meade waves him off.

                                 MEADE
                        Whoa. Whoa. Hold on there, Stan, I need you 
                        to tell me your home address.

           He’s checking the caller’s ID. Everyone waits.

           Meade nods. Chatter. A whistle. Postures visibly relax.

           Dan runs for the front door.

                                 MEADE (CONT’D)
                        Do you need medical attention?

           Out in the hallway, we can hear an eruption of CHEERS.

           EXT. PIZZA PLACE - PARK SLOPE - NIGHT

           The Pizza Guy yanks the gate down. Stan’s standing beside 
           him, nervously checking the deserted avenue.  
           Stan desperately wants him to hang around.

                                 STANLEY
                        They were leaving right away. It can’t be 
                        more than another ten minutes. 

                                 PIZZA GUY
                        I gave you a Snapple.

           Stan does indeed hold a SNAPPLE. The Pizza Man walks off 
           without apology, leaving him very much alone. 

           Stan waits. Wind. Cold. The streets seem ominous. 

           He jumps back as something flies at him...blowing trash.

           Enough. Stan sees a STOREFRONT lit up on a far corner of 
           the next block and walks quickly toward it.

           EXT. CAR SERVICE DEPOT - NIGHT

           TEN IMMIGRANT DRIVERS gather around a dispatcher’s desk, 
           waiting for a livery call. Stan enters.

                                 STANLEY
                        Excuse me, do you mind if I wait in here? 
                        I’m getting picked up in a minute. Look, I 
                        was robbed. Can I just sit here? Please.

                                 RUSSIAN DISPATCHER
                        Sure, sure, you ken ssiht.

           Stan sits on a bench by the window. A multi-culti mix of 
           eyes watch him, sympathetic if not entirely trusting.

           INT. FBI SEDAN - NIGHT

           Agent Wyatt drives; Agent Mehan, beside him. They follow 
           another FBI sedan, both with flashing BUBBLE LIGHTS.

           Dan’s in the backseat, frustrated at the lead car’s pace.

                                 DAN
                        Don’t they have a siren?

           EXT. CAR SERVICE DEPOT - NIGHT

           Stan’s come outside to check down the street. Nothing.
                                 STANLEY
                        C’mon. C’mon.

           In the picture window behind him, Ten Immigrants crane 
           their necks to look where he’s looking.

           The turns to them, shrugs. They shrug back.

           Engines gun behind him. Two FBI Sedans come up the other 
           direction, red lights flashing. They don’t slow down.

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        Hey! Hey!

           INT. FBI SEDAN - NIGHT

           Dan peers ahead, looking for the Pizza Place. 

           He doesn’t see Stan jump into the street behind them and 
           give chase, like some crazed accountant strobed by light.

           EXT. 7TH AVENUE - NIGHT

           The FBI sedans stop in front of the dark Pizza Place. 

           Special Agent Meade and Detective Felden get out of the 
           first vehicle; Wyatt, Mehan and Dan, out of the second. 

           Dan turns as he hears distant...

                                 STANLEY
                        Dan! Hey! Dan!

                                 DAN
                        There he is, guys!

           Stan’s running up the middle of the avenue.

           Dan sprints toward him.

           Seeing them all turn his way, Stan slows to a jog, then a 
           walk, hands on his back, breathing deep.  

           His eyes well with tears of release and relief. 

           It’s finally over.

           Dan slows on approach. It was beginning to feel too much 
           like lovers-running-to-each-other-in-the-field.
                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        Oh, my God! Buddy! You’re alive! 

                                 STANLEY
                        Yeah.

           Dan embraces him, big and guyish.

                                 DAN 
                        I love you, Buddy. I love you. 
                                  (then)
                        I love you.

           He just holds on until...

                                 STANLEY
                        Better let go, Dan. 

           Dan releases him.

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        I dunno...my coat...maybe there’s prints.

                                 DAN
                        Don’t worry, you can’t get fingerprints off 
                        fabric. They can’t, it’s like money. 

           Dan beams. Stan can’t catch his breath. He gives in now 
           to exhaustion, twenty-four hours of adrenaline.

           Agent Mehan walks up.

                                 AGENT MEHAN
                        Are you okay, Mr. Alpert?

           Stan nods. Smiles.

                                 STANLEY
                        The guys in...that car place...I wanna 
                        thank them...for letting me wait.

                                 DAN
                        I’ll go do it.

           He jogs off. Stan’s left alone with Mehan. She just looks 
           at the him, emotional and bedraggled.

                                 STANLEY
                        Wow. Wow. 

                                 AGENT MEHAN
                        You’re safe now.
                                 STANLEY
                        Thank you.

           He’s just too shaken to get his wind back.

                                 AGENT MEHAN
                        Cup your hands. Breathe into them.

           He does this awhile, calms, looks at her over the tops of 
           his fingers, gets enough air to ask a muffled,...

                                 STANLEY 
                        What happened to your eye?

                                 AGENT MEHAN
                        Just breathe. 

           EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - NIGHT

           The FBI sedan drives back into the City.

           We see Stan through his window’s reflection, pylons fly 
           past and disappear like bars falling away.

           INT. 6TH PRECINCT STATION HOUSE - NIGHT

           APPLAUSE. Whoops. Whistles.

           STAN’S FRIENDS cheer him from a LOBBY on the other side 
           of the shift sergeant's desk. He and Dan have just been 
           brought through the rear of the Station House.

           Stan takes a few bows. Waves. 

                                 STANLEY
                                  (huge smile; sotto)
                        Darcy didn’t meet Janice, did she?

                                 DAN
                        Oh, yeah.

                                 STANLEY
                        Is Suzanne out there, too?

                                 DAN
                        Who the hell’s Suzanne?

           Meade gestures for the boys to follow. That’s enough. 

                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        Wait? Suzanne? Yoga Suzanne?
           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - 6TH PRECINCT - NIGHT

           A round table. Stan sits with Detective Felden and Agent 
           Wyatt and Agent Mehan as they interview him.  

           Special Agent Meade leans against a wall behind him.

                                 STANLEY
                        It was the Brooklyn Bridge. I recognized 
                        the sound of the tires on the grating.  

                                                               JUMP CUT:

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        The building must be mostly transients. The 
                        postal carrier doesn’t even sort the mail. 
                        Dumps it in a pile in the foyer. The lobby 
                        floor has white cross-pattern tile. With an 
                        elaborate border of red and black diamonds.

           The cops exchange a look. This guy’s incredible.

                        I could hear car alarms. Gulls. Commercial 
                        jets. It’ll be on the approach to Kennedy. 
                        Near the ocean. On a fairly major avenue -- 
                        a bus goes by every three-and-half minutes.

           More looks. He even calculated the bus schedule?!

                        But Honey isn’t sure of his number. So, she 
                        sorta half asks: “9-1-7..6-9...?” 

           Delighted cops scribble furiously.

           Stan’s on fire, talking ninety-miles-an-hour,...

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        There was a band sticker on the front door. 
                        Blue Tan Club maybe? They do this chant. 
                        “Blue Tan Club ain’t your fucking friends! 
                        Blue Tan Club ain’t your fucking friends!”

           He also butchers the melody. The black guy, Wyatt, looks 
           up to see Felden eyeing him expectantly.
                                 AGENT WYATT 
                        Don’t look at me. I’m from Vermont.

                                 AGENT MEHAN
                        You mean Wu Tang Clan? 

                                 STAN
                        Yes! 

                                 AGENT MEHAN
                        “Wu Tang Ain’t Nuthin’ to Fuck With.” Cool. 

           They all give her a look.

                                 STANLEY
                        Yes.

           The atmosphere has turned sour; they’re openly skeptical. 
           Special Agent Meade steps into view.

                                 SPECIAL AGENT MEADE
                        Mr Alpert, do you appreciate how unusual 
                        all this sounds?

           Stan nods. Yeah, pretty weird ride, huh? 
           Special Agent Meade just looks at him. Calm. Inscrutable.

           INT. DETECTIVE’S BULLPEN - NIGHT

                                 WORLD-WEARY DETECTIVE
                        That story’s a steaming pile a shit.

           Six steel desks face forward with phones on them. The FBI 
           Agents stand behind Detective Felden. He’s just finishing 
           briefing his cynical SQUAD, holds his notebook.

                                 TOUGH DETECTIVE 
                        Man’s seeing two women. Goes out on blind 
                        date with a third one. Then, coming home, 
                        he picks up another one on the subway? Buys 
                        her a cookie?! Then gets himself abducted 
                        by the only kidnappers in the history of 
                        New York City offering fuckin’ blow jobs?! 

                                 HANDSOME DETECTIVE
                        Nobody picks up a girl on the subway. 

                                 FEMALE DETECTIVE
                        Nobody asks you out for “tea”, either. 

           There’s a slight note of disappointment in her voice. 

           Detective Felden turns to Special Agent Meade.

                                 FELDEN
                        How does the FBI want to treat this?

                                 MEADE
                        Like a steaming pile of shit. 
                                  (then)
                        That just may be true.

                                                                FADE TO:

           INT. STAN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           A BANNER has been hung and altered to read...

                             “Congratulations Retiree! Escapee!”

           Beneath it, we find an IMPROMPTU PARTY. 

                                     January 23, 1998

           Stan is with a yuppie group listening to an attractive 
           woman in her forties. This is SUZANNE.
                                 SUZANNE
                        I’m so over yoga guys. If another man calls 
                        me his “anima” I’ll vomit.

                                 DARCY
                        At least it’s Latin! I always get soulmate. 
                        “You’re my soulmate”. “Yeah, right. You’ve 
                        know me for two weeks and won’t let me use 
                        your toothbrush!” 
                                  (laughs)
                        I’m not mating my soul this season, thanks.

           CLOSE on Stan. Withdrawn. The resonance to Mystic earlier 
           is depressing. His world’s starting to seem small.

           Stan discretely turns away, wanders over to a window.

           STAN’S POV: The ordered lights of lower Manhattan give 
           way to the dark continent that is Brooklyn. Aglow between 
           them is the Brooklyn Bridge, inviting emotional passage.

           Stan surveys the sight. Remembering. Disquieted. 

                                 DAN (O.S.)
                        Did you sleep?

           Dan joins him.

                                 STANLEY
                        Yeah. A little. I’m not a nap guy.

                                 DAN
                        You okay, Buddy?

                                 STANLEY
                        Yeah. I just...those kids. I dunno. I said 
                        things. When it got ugly. Racial things. 
                                  (then)
                        Things I didn’t know I feel.

                                 DAN
                        Were they all, you know, African-Americans?

                                 STANLEY
                        Mostly. 

           Dan raises his eyebrows.

                                 DAN 
                        But you couldn’t see them?

                                 STANLEY 
                        Well, yeah. No. I mean, they sounded black. 
                                 DAN
                        Are we allowed to say people “sound black”?

                                 STANLEY
                        Jeez-Louise, Dan, a little help maybe.

                                 DAN
                        Sorry. 

           Janice Janofsky approaches to introduce a Black Friend. 

           Stan and Dan smile big and fake...

                                 STANLEY
                        Hey, Guys!

                                 DAN
                        Whaaassssssuup!

           Stan gives Dan a look. What are you doing? Back in the 
           group around Suzanne, Darcy eyes them closely.

           INT. STAN’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Darcy leads Stan into his bedroom. Kisses him. It’s full 
           of forced intimacy, forced reunion. They stand close.

           They speak quietly under the PARTY NOISES.

                                 DARCY
                        How are you holding up?

                                 STANLEY
                        Good. Yeah. Well. 

                                 DARCY
                        Are you sure? Do you need to see someone? 
                        Maybe you should call my therapist. 

                                 STANLEY
                        I’m fine. Really.

           She cups his face in her hands. 

                                 DARCY 
                        I wanna tell you I’m glad you’re alive. And 
                        that I really, really, really want to bite 
                        you right now. Not in a sexy way. Not that 
                        I would. I wouldn’t. You hurt me, Stan. I’m 
                        not entirely sure how I let that happen.
                                 STANLEY
                        Darcy...I...You’re right. I’m sorry. I am.

           She takes his hand, kisses it, holds it to her lips.

                                 DARCY
                        I need to ask you something. Be honest. I 
                        can’t really be more mad. 
                                  (then)
                        Was our relationship ever going anywhere?

           Stan looks her right in the eye. 

                                 STANLEY 
                        No. 

           Darcy nods bravely. Then, she opens her mouth and ever-so- 
           gently puts her teeth on a knuckle. The softest of bites. 

           She drops his hand and leaves the room.

                                                                FADE TO:

           INT. LEXUS - NIGHT

           Rain.

           Lucky and Sen roll through the night. The beats of BIGGIE 
           jiggle a high school tassel hanging from the mirror.

                                     January 24, 1998

           Lucky notices a classic cop sedan -- we know it belongs 
           to the FBI -- parked on his street. Occupied.

                                 LUCKY
                        I’m driving around the block.

           He passes the sedan. It pulls out behind him. Sen watches 
           the car in the mirror on his side.

           EXT. UTICA AVENUE - NIGHT

           Rain. 

           The Lexus turns creepy slow onto the busy avenue. The FBI 
           sedan and a brown van follow. Slow. Slow. 
           INT. LEXUS - NIGHT

           Lucky and Sen as before. Another turn. Lenox Avenue. 

           The sedan’s BUBBLE LIGHTS now go off. A SIREN.

                                 SEN
                        Fuck, Lux! Fuck!

                                 LUCKY 
                        I’m pulling over.

           He does so. Kills the engine. Leaves the wipers running.

           They wait.

                                 SEN
                        Fuckin’ Stanley.

                                 LUCKY
                        Calm down. It’s only been a couple of days. 

                                                        A FEW QUICK CUTS:

           INT. A&P GROCERY STORE - DAY

           QUICK DOLLY in as Agent Mehan hands a BUSY MANAGER Stan’s 
           PHOTO. He doesn’t hesitate. 

                                 A & P MANAGER
                        Yeah, I remember him. He bought a bag of 
                        Entenmann’s so Lisa could try one.

           PAN from a stunned Mehan to the World-Weary Detective. 

                                 WORLD-WEARY DETECTIVE
                        Lisa?

                                 A & P MANAGER 
                        Marantz. She lives around the corner.

           INT. LISA’S FOYER - DAY

           MOVE in on Lisa. She’s answered the door for Agent Mehan 
           and the World-Weary Detective.

                                 LISA
                        He did. He asked me out for tea.

           Mehan smiles.
           INT. DETECTIVE’S BULLPEN - 6TH PRECINCT - DAY

           SLAP. A PHOTO of Mercedes goes up on the corkboard.

                                 MEADE
                        Diannes Santamaria. AKA Dee. AKA Mercedes. 

           Special Agent Meade addresses a dozen Agents and Cops.

                                 MEADE (CONT’D)
                        Between Beta, Bads, Pims and Field Force, 
                        we got seven photos. And an address.

           INT. EMPTY LOT - BROOKLYN - DAY

           PULL OUT from an abandoned lot to find Agent Wyatt stands 
           looking at it with the Tough Detective.

                                 AGENT WYATT
                        If she gives this as her address, she knows 
                        it’s an empty lot. 
                                  (scans their surroundings)
                        She lives close.

           INT. INDOOR POOL - DAY

           OVERHEAD on Stan. Floating in bluish-green luminescence. 

           Though free, though safe, he’s not a happy man.

           EXT. CHARLES STREET - DUSK

           FOLLOW Detective Felden out of the Precinct, checking his 
           watch. Late. The Female Detective comes out after him.

                                 FEMALE DETECTIVE
                        Detective Felden!

           He stops. Yeah? She hurries up apologetically.

                                 FEMALE DETECTIVE (CONT’D)
                        We just got a hit on the citywide inquiry 
                        for robberies with the same MO. Six seven 
                        had one on January nineteen. Two black 
                        males. Black Lexus. Victim’s name: Steven. 
                                  (this is the big news)
                        They took his cellphone.
           INT. FELDEN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           A Shabbat Dinner is going on down the hall. PAN to find 
           Detective Felden, covertly on the phone. He holds a FAX 
           from the “Technical and Reconnaissance Unit”.

                                 FELDEN
                        A 9-1-7-6-9 number showed up on the dump of 
                        Steven’s cell records. Same number called 
                        Chase Bank at 23:03 Wednesday. It belongs to 
                        a Terrance Micelli. M-I-C-E-L--

                                 FELDEN’S WIFE (O.S.)
                                  (suspicious)
                        Sweetie?!

           INT. BROWN VAN - NIGHT

           BAM! Special Agent Meade pounds the dashboard for heat. 

                                 MEADE
                        Micelli’s address also matches one of the 
                        Lexus owners off the DMV list. 

           Two Cops and Two Agents are suited up in the back. 

           INT. SARGENT’S DESK - 6TH PRECINCT - NIGHT

           WHIP from the harried NIGHT SARGENT to a NATIVE AMERICAN 
           YUPPIE, hands on his hips, serious weapon showing.

                                 SHORT GUY
                        Warrior. United States Postal Police. Who 
                        here needs an address for a Luis Ramos?

           EXT. EASTERN PARKWAY - DAWN

           CRANE down to Agent Wyatt’s car. He idles. Window down. 
           The Tough Detective approaches from a building.

                                 TOUGH DETECTIVE
                        White cross tiles but a yellow border.

                                 AGENT WYATT
                        Damn.

           They’ve been at this all night. 

           The Tough Detective nods down the street behind them. 
                                 TOUGH DETECTIVE 
                        What’s your story with these two here?

           Agent Wyatt checks his mirror to see two girls coming up 
           the sidewalk with McDonald’s bags. Honey. Mercedes.

           FLY in on them, startled, as they hear,...

                                 AGENT WYATT (O.S.)
                        Hello, Ladies. 

           INT. LINDEN AVENUE - DAY

           CLOSE on BROKEN AUTO GLASS. TILT up to a brown van parked 
           directly on the spot. “Caribe Grocery” on it’s side. 

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - 6TH PRECINCT - DAY

           CLOSE on Honey. Sobbing. Agent Wyatt hands her a KLEENEX.

                                 HONEY
                        I couldn’t call no po-lice! That my 
                        boyfriend! That’s my peoples! 

                                                                BACK TO:

           INT. LEXUS - NIGHT

           Lucky and Sen as before. Silent.  Nervous. 

           A loud speaker squeals and squawks...

                                 MEADE’S VOICE
                        Get out of the vehicle! 

           The Lexus is suddenly flooded by SPOTLIGHTS.

           EXT. LENOX AVENUE - NIGHT

           Lucky and Sen get slowly out of the car, hands in the air 
           and squinting in the glare of the spots.

           A perimeter of Cops creep closer, weapons drawn.

                                 MEADE’S VOICE
                        Lay down on the ground!

           Both stand their ground. Unmoving. Rain hits their faces.
           Cops start yelling. “Now!” “Get Down!” “On the ground!”

           Sen looks over to Lucky, who stares into the light with 
           vacant eyes, the tired look of resignation. 

           INT. OLD CADILLAC - DAY

           An ANGRY WHITE MAN (49) drives fast and reckless. Lucky’s 
           frightened fiancee, Sandra, chews at her cell beside him.

                                 SANDRA
                        Lenox! Darryl said on Lenox! 

           They fishtail around the corner and toward...

           A SERIOUS POLICE SCENE. It’s drawn a CROWD: the two FBI 
           sedans, three squad cars, a uniform van, the brown van.

           Lucky and Sen are cuffed and stood facing a fence.

                                 ANGRY WHITE MAN
                        Stay in the fucking car!

           EXT. LENOX AVENUE - NIGHT

           The Cadillac slides to an aggressive stop. Even with the 
           crowd commotion, Cops react at the intrusion. 

           The Angry White Man gets out yelling...

                                 ANGRY WHITE MAN
                        Fuck you! It’s his Lexus! It’s not stolen! 

           Cops hold him back. 

           Agent Mehan supervises as Sen is led through the crowd to 
           the uniform van. The Angry White Man grabs her jacket.

                                 ANGRY WHITE MAN (CONT’D)
                        That’s his car! His Grandmother bought it?! 

                                 AGENT MEHAN
                        Please step away from the scene, Sir.

           She waves for Cops to get ready to bring Lucky through.

                                 ANGRY WHITE MAN
                        Listen, you fucking Dike! Nothing better 
                        happen to that car! You fucking hear me?! 
                        You fucking racist cunt! You hear me?! 
           Lucky recognizes the voice yelling at Mehan. Turns.

                                 LUCKY
                        Dad! Stop! Dad! It’s not the car! Okay?! 

           Lucky gets his Father to stop yelling. The Cops take him 
           off the fence. He passes his Father on way to the van. 

                                 LUCKY (CONT’D)
                        I did something. I need some help. Okay? 
                        But I’ll pay you back! I promise!

           Lucky’s voice cracks as the police drag him away...

                                 LUCKY (CONT’D)
                        I’ll pay you back! I promise I’ll pay you! 

                                 SANDRA (O.S)
                        Terrance! Terrance!

           Sandra’s gotten out of the car. Hearing her voice, Lucky 
           turns his face to the pavement. Ashamed. Near tears.

           And we HOLD on his Dad’s confused expression, the look of 
           a man realizing the extent of the damage he’s wrought.  

           EXT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - DAY

           Wearing an Greenbay Packers jersey and cheese wedge hat, 
           Dan jumps out his car and starts RUNNING.

           The hat flies off. He tries to stop himself. Slides in a 
           bit of gravel. Falls. Scrapes an elbow. Limps.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SCOTT’S APARTMENT - DAY

           A Battery Park view of the Hudson River and New Jersey. A 
           SUPERBOWL PREGRAME SHOW plays on television. 

           Scott and Stanley watch. They hear the FRONT DOOR open.

           A woman SHRIEKS out the kitchen.

                                 SCOTT’S GIRLFRIEND
                        Christ! Dan! 

                                 DAN (O.S.)
                        Sorry...

           Dan enters carrying his cheese wedge. Bleeding. Exited.
                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        They got them!

                                 STANLEY
                        What...?

                                 DAN
                        Your guys! They got them! Felden called my 
                        place! Looking for you!

                                 STANLEY
                        What? Who’d they get?

                                 DAN 
                        All of them! He needs you at the precinct! 
                        They’re putting the males in line-ups!
                                  (they don’t get it)
                        Now!

                                 SCOTT
                        The game’s about to start...

           Dan gives him a look. A beat. Is this real? Scott grabs 
           his coat. Suddenly, Stan’s very nervous.

           INT. LINE-UP ROOM - 6TH PRECINCT - NIGHT

           Tiny. Four by six. Drab. Wood panelling. Old shag carpet. 

           Detective Felden leads Stan into the room. A BORED MAN is 
           in the corner, a Paid Witness. Stan faces darkened glass. 

                                 DETECTIVE FELDEN
                        Just tell me if you see the people that did 
                        this to you, but only if you’re certain.

           Felden flips off the OVERHEAD LIGHT. A dingy tiny CURTAIN 
           is pulled back manually from the other side. Sticks. 

           Stan breathes deep...

           SIX BLACK MEN sit in a similarly generic room through the 
           glass. No height lines. No special lighting. Just young 
           men sitting as if attending a tiny AA Meeting. 

                                 STANLEY
                        I didn’t think they’d be sitting.

                                 DETECTIVE FELDEN
                        We’ll get them to stand.
                                 STANLEY
                        No, it’s okay.

           Stanley notices Lucky’s delicate hands -- and he knows 
           it’s him. Lucky seems somehow younger than we remember, 
           and skinnier; his salesman’s suit, cheaper.

           Lucky stares straight ahead, defiant but terrified.

                                 DETECTIVE FELDEN
                        Do you recognize anyone?

           Stanley says nothing.

                                 DETECTIVE FELDEN (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Alpert?

           CLOSE on Stanley. Stalling. Wrestling.

           He can see Lucky through his own reflection.

                                 DETECTIVE FELDEN (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Alpert?

           Interminable seconds drag. 

           Finally, softly, almost to himself,...

                                 STANLEY
                        He can’t see me.

                                                                FADE TO:

           INT. COURTROOM - MANHATTAN CRIMINAL COURT - DAY

           Judge EDWIN TORRES has a strong Hispanic accent, and even 
           stronger sense of moral outrage. He’s listening calmly as 
           Luis Ramos CURSES him out in Spanish.

                                     October 19, 1998

           Stan enters in the back. A Court Officer points him thru 
           a metal detector. He takes a seat.

           As Three Other Court Officers hold Ramos back, his female 
           PUBLIC DEFENDER finally says to the bench...

                                 PUBLIC DEFENDER
                        I don’t think Mr. Ramos understands the 
                        rule of accessorial liability.

                                                               JUMP CUT:
           Ren stands before the court. 

                                 JUDGE TORRES 
                        Do you admit to the charge of Kidnapping 
                        with Intent to Terrorize?

                                 REN
                        Yeah. No. Maybe. What you mean terrorize?

           Ren’s Lawyer whispers in his ear.

                                 REN (CONT’D)
                        Yeah. We did that. Guilty.

                                                               JUMP CUT:

           Sen stands before the court.

                                 JUDGE TORRES
                        So, you had a plea agreement of ten years-
                        to-life. Then Mr. Davis here tells his cell 
                        mate he’s going to get a friend to smuggle 
                        a steak knife into court, kill his court-
                        appointed attorney, take a hostage, escape. 

           Sen’s Lawyer sits as far from his client as possible.

                                 JUDGE TORRES (CONT’D)
                        He then discusses this very brilliant plan 
                        on a Rikers Island telephone. 
                                  (Sen picks his palm)
                        So, now...puff. No more plea offer?

                                 THE DA
                        That is correct, your Honor.

                                                               JUMP CUT:

           Lucky stands before the court. The Judge shuffles papers.

                                 JUDGE TORRES 
                        The court has some character letters...Let’s 
                        see, one from your supervisor at Sears...and 
                        two from teachers at the College of Staten 
                        Island. You’re a double major...business and 
                        criminal justice...? 

           Lucky looks down. Nods. The irony doesn’t escape Torres. 

           CLOSE on Stan: Lucky’s real life is shockingly mundane.
                                 JUDGE TORRES (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Micelli, do you have anything to say 
                        before sentencing?

                                 LUCKY
                        I only wish to say...I wish I had met the 
                        victim under different circumstances. I 
                        think he would have been impressed by me. 
                        That is something I would like to hope.

           This is the last thing Stan expected to hear.

                                 JUDGE TORRES
                        All right. It is the judgement of the Court 
                        that the defendant be hereby committed to 
                        the custody of the Department of 
                        Correctional Services to be imprisoned for a 
                        term no less than twenty years...

                        ...a term of no less than seventeen years...

                                                               JUMP CUT:

           And Luis Ramos.

                                 JUDGE TORRES (CONT’D)
                        ...no less than fifteen years. You do, of 
                        course, have the right to an appeal.

           GAVEL. Commotion.

           Ramos is led away squirming. 

           He sees Stan...

                                 LUIS RAMOS 
                        Yo, man, can you believe this shit?!

           GAVEL. Murmurs.

           Ren also turns to find Stan. He smiles surprised, happy 
           to see him, raising his hand to wave. 

           Then, as if remembering, Ren shyly drops the gesture.

                                                               JUMP CUT:

           GAVEL. Crying.

           Sen hugs two gentleman over the balustrade. Elegant men. 

           Stan realizes Sen’s Father and Grandfather are middle-
           class professionals; it’s why he won’t speak of them.

           Sen’s eyes drift onto Stan. A cold stare. 

           Sen spits air. Vengeful. Hurt.

           The Bailiff jostles him for the Courtroom’s side door.

                                                               JUMP CUT:

           GAVEL. Quiet.

           Stan’s standing by the time Lucky sees him. Embarrassed, 
           the prisoner looks away. Both just men watch the Bailiff 
           put the cuffs around Lucky’s wrists. 

           Finally, their eyes meet, hold.

           It’s the first time they’ve seen each other face-to-face. 

           Their gazes hold, even as the Bailiff leads Lucky away.

           Then, just at the door, Lucky seems to nod. That’s all. A 
           simple nod. Recognition. Familiarity. 

           Stan smiles the saddest of smiles...but it comes too late 
           and Lucky’s already disappeared through the doorway. 

                                                                FADE TO:

           INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

           Late. Hot. Stan waits alone for his subway still trying 
           to get through “A Bright Shining Lie”.

                                       May 17, 1999
           INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT

           Stan comes in to find the car empty save a MASSIVE GANG-
           BANGER listening to large headphones worn open around his 
           neck like mini-speakers, an auditory “fuck off”.

           Stan stops. Thinks. Decides.

           He goes and sits right across from the Gang-Banger, whose 
           attitude is far from welcoming. He glowers. 

           The train leaves the station and picks up speed. 

           A rap beat BLARES. It’s TUPAC SHAKUR’s confused, tortured 
           anthem of hope and hopelessness, “Changes”.

                                 TUPAC
                           I see no changes. Wake up in the morning and 
                           ask myself: “Is life worth living, or should 
                           I blast myself?” I'm tired of bein' poor. 

           Stan gives up trying to read.

                           Even worse, I'm black. My stomach hurts. 
                           So, I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch.

           Stan listens.

                                 TUPAC (CONT’D)
                           We gotta start makin' changes. Learn to see 
                           me as a brother, not two distant strangers. 
                           And that's how it's supposed to be. How can 
                           the Devil take a brother if he close to me?

           Then, surprisingly, almost imperceptibly, Stan starts 
           moving his head to the music. 

                                 TUPAC (CONT’D)
                           I'd love to go back when we played as kids 
                           but things changed -- that’s the way it is.

           The chorus kicks in...

                                 TUPAC (CONT’D)
                           That’s just the way it is. 
                           Things will never be the same.
                           That’s just he way it is.

           Stan’s mouthing the words. Faintly.

           The Gang-Banger notices. Their eyes meet. 
           But Stanley Alpert keeps grooving...

                                 TUPAC (CONT’D)
                           All I see is racist faces. Misplaced hate 
                           makes disgrace to races. And I wonder what 
                           it takes, to make this one a better place. 

           They ride on through the night. A black man. A white man. 
           Facing each other. Not speaking. Listening. Seeing.

           Somewhere in the second verse, about the time we hear,...

                                 TUPAC (CONT’D)
                           And though it seems heaven sent, we ain't 
                           ready to see a black President.

           ...the screen FADES to BLACK.

           CREDITS.

           End.
