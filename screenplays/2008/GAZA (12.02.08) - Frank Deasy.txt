           EXT GAZA/ CITY CENTRE - DAY 

           GAZA CITY

           - the crackle of machine gun fire - 

           - teeming STREET BOYS, swarming over rubble, cheering, 
           eyes shining in the sun, glazed with adrenaline as 

           HAMAS FIGHTERS

           In BLUE GREY CAMOUFLAGES and BLACK BALACLAVAS, fire at 

           FATAH FIGHTERS

           In BLACK COMBATS and BLACK BALACLAVAS 

           AK 47’S BLAZING the two MILITIAS shadow each other 
           along a narrow, twisting street of breeze block 
           apartments and shops.

           Electricity cables hang from building to building, 
           FIGHTERS appear on BALCONIES and among roof top 
           SATELLITE DISHES. 

           Dust and smoke swirl as M16 MACHINE GUNS rip into 
           breeze block walls.

           At an angle to the fighting is SAYED, a good looking 
           Palestinian news cameraman wearing a T-shirt and jeans. 
           He is filming, braced against a car covered in taped TV 
           signs, it’s passenger door open -

                                 SAYED
                        Joanna come on! Get out of here! 

           Sitting in the passenger seat, is JOANNA, a British 
           television news CORRESPONDENT, sexy, smart, twenty 
           three years old, wearing a loose headscarf. 

                                 JOANNA
                        Fatima’s waiting for us, at the hair 
                        salon. 

           JOANNA is urgently keying a number scrawled in blue ink 
           on her hand into her mobile. On the car CD, loud, is 
           KRS ONE - HOT.

                                 KRS ONE
                        ‘All you do is talk, that ain’t hot!’

           A burst of automatic fire and shattering glass -

           - SAYED looks up - 

           - several floors above an OFFICE BLOCK WINDOW explodes 
           outwards.
           HAMAS FIGHTERS appear in the window tearing down 
           curtains - 

           JOANNA lowers herself out of their sight, lying across 
           the front seats. She gets voice mail. She hesitates -

           STREET BOYS swarm around the TV CAR, among them a 
           strikingly beautiful ten year old boy KALID. 

                                 SAYED 
                        Fuck off. Joanna!

           JOANNA decides against leaving a message.

           A BLACK SUBURU JEEP

           brakes in a burst of dirt 

           MAJED KHAZI

           is in the passenger seat, muscular, in his late 
           thirties, wearing a black T-shirt and wrap around 
           shades. 

                                 KRS ONE 
                        ‘Respect on the block, that’s hot!’

           Four FATAH FIGHTERS  ride ‘ shotgun’, armed with 
           gleaming Chinese AK 47’s with telescopic sights -

           SAYED is scared. KALID and the other kids back away

           MAJED removes his shades. His eyes are warm and 
           beautiful. His POV: JOANNA’s long legs and tight jeans. 

           JOANNA is furiously texting, her face hot and intense. 

                                 MAJED
                        You’ve been to the hair salon? You’ve 
                        had your hair done? No? 

           JOANNA’s face tightens with fear. MAJED is smiling, his 
           teeth perfect white.

                                 MAJED (CONT’D)
                                (Arabic, to Sayed)
                        (She’s very beautiful) 

           JOANNA sits up, surreptitiously rubbing her skin to 
           erase the telephone number from her hand. 

                                 MAJED (CONT’D)
                        You’re not Muslim, why do you wear a 
                        veil?
                                (teasing)
                        Are you a Hamas? One of the beards?
                                 JOANNA
                        I’m a journalist.

           MAJED glances at HAMAS FIGHTERS firing at a pocket of 
           FATAH FIGHTERS trapped in an office entrance.

                                 MAJED
                        Write about Hamas, see how they 
                        behave. Hamas are terrorists, nothing 
                        more 

                                 JOANNA 
                        Hamas won the elections -

                                 MAJED
                                (gestures,look at you)
                        You have a degree? You’ve been to 
                        university?
                                (Joanna nods)
                        Why come to a shit hole like Gaza?

           A new burst of automatic fire alerts  SAYED, he turns ; 
           the moving front line between the FIGHTERS has shifted - 
           SAYED and MAJED are suddenly in the FIRING LINE - 

           A FATAH FIGHTER  is lining up a ROCKET PROPELLED 
           GRENADE LAUNCHER. 

           MAJED’S SECURITY panic, waving frantically

                                 MAJED (CONT’D)
                                (calmly sardonic)
                        My own team send me to Paradise. 

           THE SUBURU violently reverses. SAYED throws himself 
           onto the ground. 

                                 SAYED
                        Joanna!

           A ROCKET PROPELLED GRENADE SCREAMS towards the TV CAR - 

                                 JOANNA
                        Oh -

           THE GRENADE shoots over the TV CAR. It hits an 
           APARTMENT BLOCK. A HUGE EXPLOSION. The BUILDING erupts 
           into dust -

           A WEIRD SILENCE

           JOANNA is enveloped in a fine coating of dust. 
           Somewhere a mobile ringing - a distant sound of 
           screaming. 

           SAYED is struggling to sort out his camera. PEOPLE 
           emerge from the smoke like spectres, covered in dust
           AT THE OFFICE WINDOW the HAMAS FIGHTERS part abruptly -  
           a FATAH FIGHTER is standing between them - 

           JOANNA realises it’s her mobile ringing - 

                                 JOANNA (CONT’D)
                        Fatima? Fatima is that you? 

           JOANNA’s sky suddenly darkens - the FATAH FIGHTER is 
           FALLING - he smashes onto her wind screen - in the 
           crystalised glass his face is a mash of blood and bone -

                                 JOANNA (CONT’D)
                        Fuck! Fuck it! Fuck!

           SAYED leaps into the car and whips it into gear -

                                 SAYED
                        See those guns? Majed’s men? Chinese 
                        Ak’s with telescopic sights? Where’s 
                        Majed getting them?  

                                 JOANNA 
                                (still stunned)
                        I should have got an interview.

                                 SAYED
                        You did. Majed interviewed you.  

           SAYED wrenches the gears again. THE CAR reverses, makes 
           a brutal turn, and the FATAH FIGHTERS body slides off 
           the bonnet.

           STREET KIDS surround the body, cheering, doing a 
           victory dance. KALID looks insane with excitement.

                                 JOANNA
                        How did he know about the 
                        hairdressers, how the fuck did he 
                        know? 

           SAYED drives away past cheering kids and a HAMAS 
           FIGHTER who releases a celebratory burst of GUNFIRE 
           which carries over -

           A BURST OF STARLINGS

           In a leaden, London sky. 

           EXT LONDON - DAYBREAK 

           A skin of ice glitters on a grey pond in a park in 
           central London. 

           RUTH HASS is a Londoner in her late fifties, a 
           consultant radiologist. 
           She is throwing bread pieces, from tinfoil in her 
           leather gloved hand, to a solitary SWAN.

           RUTH watches the SWAN gracefully navigate the remaining 
           water in its shrinking, frozen world. 

           RUTH’s gaze is alert, curious, she bristles with a 
           sharp incisive intelligence. There is a guarded 
           expression, an understated English quality to RUTH’s 
           beautiful face. 

           CUT TO:

           RUTH, walking through the park, an elegantly dressed 
           purposeful figure.

           INT LONDON HOSPITAL/ MRI UNIT/ SCANNING ROOM  - DAY 

           A silver, crucified JESUS dangles from praying hands. 

           ROSE, an Irish woman in her forties, watches her 
           fourteen year old daughter PEARL disappear into the 
           streamlined tube of an MRI scanner.  

           PEARL, wearing headphones, is completely bald, her eyes 
           circled with dark lines left by CHEMOTHERAPY. 

           ROSE turns and looks to a curved window surrounding the 
           IMAGING BAY.  RUTH, in a white coat, is moving about 
           behind the reflecting glass. 

           INT IMAGING BAY - DAY 

           RUTH, wearing highly polished bifocals, is absorbed by 
           MRI SCANS stored on a COMPUTER SCREEN. 

           ON SCREEN are pulsing coloured images in swirling 
           shapes of vivid YELLOW and BLUE. 

                                 RUTH
                        If the tumour is still under five 
                        millimetres we can operate. If it’s 
                        any wider in diameter there’s no 
                        point. She’d never make it.

           INT SCANNING ROOM - DAY

           An MRI NURSE appears, signalling to ROSE to come out - 
           it’s torture for her to leave her daughter here. 

           RUTH calmly removes her bifocals and steps up to the 
           bay window, she leans forward over a microphone. Her 
           attention is focused on the conical shaped MRI.
                                 RUTH
                        Okay Pearl? Comfortable? 

           PEARL’s hand, VENFLOW attached, rises and gives a 
           ‘thumbs up’. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        We’ll start with normal scans, then 
                        introduce the dye. 

           INT GAZA - DAY 

           JOANNA, bumping along in the TV CAR.

                                 JOANNA
                        I’m worried about Fatima. 

           SAYED is racing through narrow streets deserted other 
           than the occasional frightened CIVILIAN. 

                                 SAYED
                        What did Fatima give you? Documents, 
                        photographs? 

                                 JOANNA
                                (she’s not telling)
                        I know what I’m doing. 

           SAYED rounds a corner - he BRAKES HARD

           JOANNA AND SAYED’s POV: the street is filled with 
           trucks discharging dozens of ARMED FATAH FIGHTERS, 
           entirely in black, the trucks, combats and weapons all 
           glistening new. 

           SAYED’S HAND reaches for the camera  JOANNA’S HAND 
           stops his. Some of the FATAH FIGHTERS are showing 
           interest, walking towards them, guns taking aim. 

           SAYED reverses calmly. 

                                 JOANNA
                        Where have they come from?

                                 SAYED
                        Egypt. Israel’s let them through. 

           SAYED turns and picks up speed - they’ve got away - he 
           punches the CD PLAYER, ALGERIAN HIP HOP bursts into 
           life and with it an adrenaline high, fear and shock 
           turning into a massive rush - 

                                 SAYED (CONT’D)
                        Wooa! 

           JOANNA watches SAYED drive with a feline concentration - 
           low in his seat, relaxed and controlled - 
                                 JOANNA 
                        God I love you so much. 

           SAYED turns to JOANNA with a smile of pure pleasure - 
           with his fine, nut brown features, jet black hair and 
           strong warm eyes he is immensely attractive - 

           JOANNA, everything about her, her skin, her eyes, hair, 
           mouth - is glowing, radiant with life. 

                                 SAYED
                        London?

                                 JOANNA
                                (a wry grin)
                        London.

                                 SAYED
                                (triumphant)
                        London! 

           JOANNA a wild deep laugh, she leans over and as they 
           hurtle through streets ravaged by war and poverty - 

           THEY KISS

           EXT GAZA CITY - DAY 

           A building explodes. 

           WOMEN run out onto the street, screaming, on their 
           shoulders wet multi coloured towels - they wear dark 
           ankle length dresses but their hair hangs uncovered, 
           wet and tangled - 

           Some WOMEN have their hair wrapped in strips of tinfoil 
           for highlighting - others wear pink rubber caps through 
           which strands of hair have been pulled - 

           JOANNA AND SAYED pull up. They spring out of the TV CAR 
           SAYED automatically carrying his camera - 

                                 JOANNA
                        Where’s Fatima? 

           JOANNA searching in a storm of DUST. 

                                 JOANNA (CONT’D)
                        Fatima? Fatima it’s Joanna? 

           WOMEN emerge out of the smoke bleeding and shocked. 

                                 JOANNA (CONT’D)
                        She musn’t be here. She said she was 
                        here? 
                                 SAYED
                        These colours are fantastic. 

                                 JOANNA 
                        I should do a piece here. 

           JOANNA follows SAYED, backing away from the blast sight 
           to get some perspective and a safe distance - 

           GUN FIRE and all the surreal drama of WAR continues 
           around JOANNA as she does a ‘ stand upper’ to camera. 

                                 JOANNA (CONT’D)
                        Gaza is descending into chaos. 
                        Palestinians describe this narrow 
                        strip of land home to a million and a 
                        half people, as a huge prison. Gaza is 
                        isolated from the world, it’s borders 
                        entirely controlled by Israel. No 
                        Palestinian is allowed to leave, only 
                        journalists are allowed enter. Last 
                        year the Islamist group Hamas won 
                        democratic election. The secular Fatah 
                        faction, beset by allegations of 
                        corruption but backed by the west has 
                        refused to cede power. Today Hamas and 
                        Fatah and are battling for control of 
                        the Gaza strip. There are reports of 
                        Israel allowing five hundred Fatah 
                        fighters cross into the Gaza strip - 

           JOANNA jumps, an odd uncoordinated leap, then crumbles 
           like a wet newspaper. 

           SAYED’S CAMERA POV: JOANNA falling to the ground - 

           SAYED looks out from behind the viewfinder - a 
           suspended DREAM LIKE MOMENT  - he can’t compute what’s 
           just happened. 

           SAYED, horrified by JOANNA’S STOMACH, peering out from 
           under body armour. A dark red river unfurls over the 
           arc of skin, it rolls down to her jeans, turning the 
           blue denim black.  

           SAYED cries out in disbelief and the world returns with 
           all its PANIC and GUN FIRE. SAYED runs to JOANNA, 
           dropping beside her, holding her to him

           JOANNA is still breathing, struggling but breathing. On 
           his knees, in the chaos and confusion, the smoke and 
           gunfire, his hands smeared with her blood, SAYED 
           screams in Arabic for an ambulance.

                                 SAYED
                        Hang on Joanna, hold on!

           RUTH’s gaze so still and intent she could be peering 
           beyond the screen and into PEARL’s soul.

           white prayer shawl over his suit, reading the TORAH. 

           CUT TO : several rows further back - ROBERT, 
           uncomfortable, guilty, sitting with PAUL.

                                 ROBERT
                        This woman, Fatima, the prostitute, 
                        she was executed - a single bullet to 
                        the head just before Joanna. The hair 
                        salon they were to meet in was blown 
                        up. That’s hardly a coincidence? 

                                 PAUL
                        We could be liable in this. Health and 
                        safety still applies, even in a war 
                        zone. 

                                 ROBERT
                        I don’t give a fuck about - 

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah? You want to finish that sentence 
                        on Newsnight? Thank you Jeremy I’m 
                        glad you asked me that? 
                                (beat)
                        I can’t believe you accepted her own 
                        risk assessments.

                                 ROBERT
                        Joanna was the one on the ground.

                                 PAUL
                        That’s bullshit and you know it is. 
                        People get used to an environment, 
                        accept it as normal - they lose all 
                        perspective. 
                                (Robert staring ahead)
                        That’s what risk assessments are 
                        about! 

           ROBERT is staring up several rows  to where he can see 
           RUTH’s shoulder and hair. 

                                 ROBERT 
                        We’re opening up Joanna’s computer in 
                        London, she backed up everything in 
                        London, her whole laptop. She was 
                        trying to get something out of Gaza, 
                        documents, photographs, she was 
                        frightened. 
           PAUL also looks up to RUTH. 

                                 PAUL 
                        You know the father was a lawyer? Shit 
                        hot? 

                                 ROBERT
                                (turns to Paul)
                        She hates us. Telly people. She thinks 
                        we’re superficial little shits.

           PAUL shrugs - ‘ so, what’s new?’ 

           CUT TO : RUTH, her face ashen, shakes her head as a 
           STEWARD offers her water, her gaze passes over the 
           ORTHODOX JEWISH MAN as she returns to her own void. 

           EXT ISRAEL/ BEN GURION AIRPORT - NIGHT 

           A British Airways plane lands at BEN GURION airport.

           EXT ISRAEL/ BEN GURION AIRPORT/ CHECKPOINT - NIGHT 

           A ISRAELI GOVERNMENT LIMOUSINE, with a STAR OF DAVID 
           PENNANT is waved past by an ETHIOPIAN FEMALE SOLDIER in 
           light green COMBATS. 

           EXT JERUSALEM/ JERICHO ROAD - DAY 

           The LIMOUSINE sweeps along the JERICHO ROAD towards 
           JERUSALEM as day breaks over the CITY.

           INT CAR -

           RUTH in the back seat. In front, ARIEL, an Israeli 
           Ministry of Defence Official, about fifty with a 
           military physique, finishes a call in HEBREW. 

                                 ARIEL
                        Justice Minister sends his sympathies.
                        He will do everything he can help.

                                 RUTH
                        Thank you. 

                                 ARIEL
                        Gaza is a terrible place. My daughter 
                        is doing her military service at the 
                        border. 

           RUTH nods, exhausted, she gazes out at near empty 
           streets. At traffic lights an ORTHODOX JEWISH FAMILY 
           waits to cross, the FATHER and SONS locked and in black 
           hats and long black coats, the WIFE and DAUGHTERS in 
           loose jumpers, peasant skirts and headscarves. 
                                 ARIEL (CONT’D)
                        I grew up in Swiss Cottage.

           RUTH glances at ARIEL mildly surprised. ARIEL is 
           observing RUTH in the rear view mirror.

                                 ARIEL (CONT’D)
                        You never learned Hebrew?

                                 RUTH
                        A little. As a child. I’ve forgotten 
                        it all now. 

                                 ARIEL
                        My father escaped from Germany early. 
                        My mother was Russian. We came home 
                        twenty years ago.  

                                 RUTH
                        Home?

                                 ARIEL
                        To Israel. 

           RUTH nods, slightly irritated. 

                                 ARIEL (CONT’D)
                        Did they know Joanna was Jewish, the 
                        Arabs? 

                                 RUTH
                        I doubt it. She didn’t, we never 
                        practised. 

           RUTH’s eyes meet ARIEL’s in the rear view mirror. He 
           looks away. They pass the MOUNT OF OLIVES, on it’s 
           slopes the JEWISH CEMETERY with its honey coloured 
           gravestones.

                                 ARIEL 
                        Someone from the British Consul is 
                        meeting us at the hotel. They’re 
                        liaising with the television people.
                        I’ve arranged a funeral car, once 
                        Joanna’s remains are out of Gaza.

                                 RUTH
                        That’s very kind of you.

                                 ARIEL
                        Please, to lose a child...it’s,

           ARIEL glances at RUTH in the mirror. She is defiant in 
           her grief, her aloneness. 
           EXT EAST JERUSALEM/ AMERICAN COLONY  - DAY

           The ISRAELI GOVERNMENT CAR surges off the motorway and 
           into the driveway of the AMERICAN COLONY HOTEL.

           EXT/INT AMERICAN COLONY COURTYARD - DAY 

           The AMERICAN COLONY Jerusalem stone courtyard. SPARROWS 
           flit among flowers, olive trees and a small fountain. 
           At scattered tables DIPLOMATS and JOURNALISTS breakfast 
           with the well groomed MIDDLE EAST ELITE.

           At one table ROBERT sits with a British Consul 
           official, MAURICE, in his thirties, ‘little boy in long 
           trousers’ vibe. ROBERT has a black and white PHOTOGRAPH 
           laid out on the table - MAJED KHAZI.

                                 MAURICE
                        It’s not looking good for the good 
                        guys. 

                                 ROBERT
                                (dislikes him)
                        The ‘good ‘ guys?

                                 MAURICE
                        Well ‘good’ is relative, Fatah are 
                        secular, more Western friendly, Hamas 
                        are Islamic fundamentalists - 

                                 ROBERT
                        They’re not the Taliban?

                                 MAURICE
                        No they’re not the Taliban. Not yet. 
                        But they’re committed to the 
                        destruction of Israel. Oh, is this Mrs 
                        Hass?

           RUTH is approaching the table, calm, guarded. 

                                 ROBERT 
                                (standing)
                        Ruth this is Maurice Doran from the 
                        British Consul. 

                                 MAURICE
                        Mrs Hass, I’m terribly sorry -
                                (shaking hands)
                        I often met Joanna at the Consul. 
                        Lovely, lovely girl. 

           A WAITER appears holding two pots - tea or coffee?

                                 RUTH
                        Coffee please. 
           Silence. The coffee pours. RUTH sits, reserved, cool. 
           MAURICE, awkward, a little taken aback at her manner. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        The Israeli Government have arranged a 
                        funeral car, at the crossing point. 

                                 MAURICE
                        Excellent. Mrs Hass, um, you describe 
                        yourself as the ‘next of kin?’ 

                                 ROBERT
                        Obviously -

           RUTH - wrong footed - 

                                 MAURICE 
                        Well, so did Joanna, initially, but -
                                (some records)
                        - the last time she renewed her visa 
                        she changed her next of kin to a 
                        ‘Sayed Hamad’?

                                 RUTH 
                        Who?

                                 ROBERT
                        No, no, there’s some mistake, Sayed is 
                        a Palestinian cameraman, he worked 
                        with Joanna.

           RUTH regards MAURICE with a glacial stare. 

                                 RUTH
                        I’ve no idea what you’re talking 
                        about? 

                                 MAURICE
                        Um, yes, well, the thing is I’m afraid 
                        Joanna and Mister Hamad got married, 
                        the wedding was in Gaza, two months 
                        ago, under Sharia, that’s Muslim law -  

                                 RUTH
                        That’s impossible. 

           RUTH looks from ROBERT to MAURICE - suddenly at sea, 
           panic rising up inside her - 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        They had a, he was, her cameraman, 
                                ( to Robert)
                        for a while? 

                                 ROBERT
                        I’ve no idea. 
                                 RUTH
                        I’ve seen a J.peg Joanna sent 

                                 ROBERT
                        Sayed is her cameraman.

                                 MAURICE
                        Joanna applied for a British passport 
                        for Mister Hamad, I have the paperwork-

                                 RUTH
                        Oh well, that’s it. Joanna would 
                        always side with the underdog.
                                (Maurice, non plussed)
                        Joanna was very young - 

           RUTH flinches, she struggles to maintain her composure, 
           grief and anxiety raging inside - 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        She could well do something like that 
                        to help him come to England.  

                                 MAURICE
                        You mean a fake marriage?

           RUTH nods, uncertainly. ROBERT doesn’t buy it.

                                 MAURICE (CONT’D)
                        Well, um, the things is, Mister Hamad 
                        wants the funeral to take place in 
                        Gaza. He doesn’t want the body moved. 
                        Gaza is his preferred resting place. 

                                 RUTH
                        Preferred?
                                (loud)
                        His preferred! Who, who is the person? 

           One or two HEADS turn. 

                                 MAURICE
                        Mister Hamad is her husband. There’s 
                        no dubiety. I’m very sorry Mrs Hass. 

                                 ROBERT
                        That’s just not going to happen.
                                (to Ruth)
                        Forgive me but Joanna’s Jewish! You 
                        can’t have her funeral-

           A shift is taking place within RUTH deep in the pit of 
           her stomach a rage is uncoiling.

                                 MAURICE 
                        - I understand - 
                                 ROBERT 
                          - her family are all in Britain! 

                                 MAURICE
                        No - 

                                 RUTH
                        What do you mean no? 

           ANGER boiling up in RUTH.

                                 MAURICE 
                        Joanna didn’t mention any of this?

                                 RUTH
                        She would have done. Of course she 
                        would have done, had it meant 
                        anything!

           MAURICE, stumped. Stalemate. 

                                 ROBERT
                                (move things on)
                        I’ll speak to Sayed, he can come to 
                        London for the funeral, or won’t the 
                        Israeli’s allow him? Is that the 
                        problem ? Is that what he’s worried 
                        about? 

                                 MAURICE
                        I put that to Mister Hamad -

                                 RUTH
                        You spoke to him?

                                 MAURICE
                        Last night. I managed to persuade him 
                        to hold off the burial off until 
                        today.

                                 RUTH 
                        Today!? 

                                 MAURICE
                        The family are Muslim. Burial should 
                        really take place by sunset.

           RUTH - the effrontery! 

                                 ROBERT
                        What did Sayed say ? 

                                 MAURICE
                        He wants Joanna to be buried in 
                        Palestine. Legally, I’m afraid it’s 
                        decision, he says it’s what Joanna 
                        would have - 
           RUTH stands up so abruptly she startles ROBERT and 
           MAURICE. ARIEL looks over from a station where he is 
           having coffee with an OLDER WAITER. 

                                      RUTH
                        I’ve come here to take Joanna home, to 
                        be buried with my husband -
                                (a crack in her voice)
                        - with her family.

                                 MAURICE
                        Mrs Hass I’m very sorry - 

                                 RUTH 
                        I’m not leaving Joanna there! She’s 
                        not some trophy Jew!

           The word echoes around the startled courtyard. 

           ARIEL watches RUTH walk out. RUTH sees him and makes a 
           snap decision. She crosses to ARIEL. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        How far is it to Gaza, how long? 

           ARIEL looks to ROBERT and MAURICE on their way over.

                                 ARIEL
                        An hour, to the border. 

                                 RUTH 
                        Can you take me?

                                 ARIEL
                        I can’t take you inside. 

                                 RUTH
                        To the border then?

                                 ARIEL
                        Do you plan to go into Gaza? 

           ROBERT and an appalled MAURICE appear behind RUTH.

                                 ROBERT
                        They’ll never let her in surely?

                                 ARIEL
                        The Palestinians will let any one in. 

                                 ROBERT
                        Ruth it’s civil war in there -  

           MAURICE looks wildly from RUTH to ROBERT -
                                 MAURICE 
                        The Foreign Office advice is under no 
                        circumstances should British Citizens 
                        enter Gaza! 

           RUTH’s eyes remain on ARIEL.

                                 ARIEL
                        He’s right.

                                 RUTH
                        If it was your daughter? The one on 
                        duty there? If it was her body? Would 
                        you leave her? 

           ARIEL considers, RUTH’s eyes on him.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        What’s her name? What’s your daughters 
                        name? 

                                 MAURICE 
                        They keep firing rockets on Israel!

                                 ARIEL
                        I’ll talk to my superiors. 

                                 RUTH
                        Thank you. 

           EXT AMERICAN COLONY HOTEL/ CABANA/ POOL  - DAY

           ROBERT and PAUL by the pool. 

                                 PAUL
                        So she went native! Big time! Jesus, 
                        she could have converted, Allah Ackbar 
                        all that shit! 

           ROBERT’s mind is pursuing something else. 

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                                (sharp)
                        Did you know about her and Sayed? 

                                 ROBERT
                        I don’t ask employees who they’re 
                        sleeping with. 

                                 PAUL
                        But there must have been gossip. 

                                 ROBERT
                        There’s always gossip, Joanna Hass was 
                        a consummate correspondent, I never 
                        had the slightest problem - 
                                 PAUL
                        For all you know she could have a big 
                        Bin Laden dildo. 

           ROBERT goes to hit PAUL who blocks his arm - 

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, I’m sorry. 

           ROBERT watches in amazement as PAUL drops onto a 
           lounger, near to tears. 

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Fuck, fuck fuck! I’m sorry. 

           PAUL is obviously stressed out of his mind. 

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        I shagged Joanna. 

                                 ROBERT
                                (okay)
                        When? 

                                 PAUL
                        Soon after her dad died. Not pretty. 
                        She was pissed, all fucked up about 
                        the father. The mother’s a cold fish. 

                                 ROBERT
                        I should go with her. 

                                 PAUL
                        Into Gaza? No way, no way Robert. You 
                        don’t know what pile of shit is 
                        waiting for us in there. 

           PAUL is back on his feet, pleading with ROBERT - 

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        We can’t, I can’t let you. Where 
                        Joanna’s buried, who buries her, it’s 
                        a family matter. She doesn’t want us 
                        involved - you said yourself ...?

           ROBERT - conceding.

           INT GAZA/ NEWS AGENCY STUDIO - DAY 

           SAYED wearing an EMINEM  T-shirt, sitting on a burst 
           swivel sucking on a thick joint and wearing padded 
           earphones through which plays PUBLIC ENEMY, extremely 
           loud. 
           He is in the NEWS AGENCY TV STUDIO - an abandoned HOTEL 
           ROOM with a handful of ancient MONITORS, a wooden 
           table, plastic chairs and a mounted camera. The music 
           thuds through SAYED, music to get numb with. 

           Anti glare covers the windows curtain and framed verses 
           of the KORAN are stuck to the walls.

           SAYED uses a remote to replay a video tape -

           ON A SCREEN : JOANNA, during her fatal ‘piece to 
           camera’ - she jerks upwards - then drops to the ground - 

           The tape stops, replays, - JOANNA jerks upwards - then 
           drops to the ground - 

           SAYED smoking, replaying the tape over and over, 
           forcing himself to watch, the music more and more 
           brutal.

           ON THE SCREEN ‘JOANNA jerks upwards - then drops to the 
           ground’ over and over - more and more abstracted. 

           SAYED, is eyes dulling with the music and spliff. 

           A window above him 

           EXPLODES. A bullet ricochets around the room.  

           SAYED Throws himself to the floor, head phones falling 
           off. BULLETS shatter the window and serrate a wall. 
           Deafening GUNFIRE, very close by. Just as suddenly it 
           stops. 

           HIS HEADPHONES

           Lie nearby - music emerging as a tinny whine

           SAYED

           Peers tentatively out - 

           HIS POV

           An empty street, a car, it’s door lying open - 

           SAYED

           Leans further out -

           HIS POV

           A FATAH FIGHTER - lying in a pool of blood. 

           SAYED eyes darting about, uncertain - what is going on? 
           Behind him the office door bursts open - 
           HAMAS FIGHTERS pile in shouting commands, AK 47’s 
           scoping the room. SAYED is terrified. An AK 47 rams 
           into his throat a MASKED HAMAS FIGHTER stands over him.

           The gun is pushed aside by a man, RAJA in blue grey 
           combats, without a mask. RAJA is a Hamas leader in his 
           mid thirties, fine boned, ascetic looking, with a 
           cropped beard. He helps SAYED up. 

                                 RAJA
                        ( Fatah, you seen any Fatah?) 

                                 SAYED
                        (No. No one.)

           HAMAS FIGHTERS are taking over the office.

                                 RAJA
                                (the camera)
                        (Have you been filming?)

                                 SAYED
                        (No editing, I’m editing)

                                 RAJA
                                (crosses to the window)
                        ( We need this office.)

           RAJA picks up a roach lying on a sound desk. 

                                 RAJA (CONT’D)
                        (Your wife was the journalist who was 
                        killed? )
                                (Sayed nods)
                        (This won’t help. God will help you. 
                        And we will find your wife’s killers.)

           EXT GAZA/ ABANDONED HOTEL/ TV STUDIO - DAY 

           SAYED emerges cautiously from the bullet scarred hotel 
           housing the NEWS AGENCY STUDIO. 

           FATAH BODIES lie splayed out, frozen in death.

           A FATAH FIGHTER hangs from a BURNT OUT CAR. Two more 
           like in a pool of sticky blood.

           SAYED’s MOBILE rings. He answers. 

                                 SAYED
                        We just lost the office. Hamas took it 
                        over. 

           SAYED is moving gingerly among the bodies, towards his 
           car, trailing his camera - apparently casually but 
           switched on - 
           CAMERA POV : DEAD BODIES, at an odd angle but moving 
           among them, on their level - 

                                 ROBERT 
                        Sayed, I need to talk to you...about 
                        Joanna, and Joanna’s mum. 

           SAYED freezes, suddenly intensely vulnerable. 

                                 SAYED
                        I’m sorry Robert. Joanna told me not 
                        to tell anyone. 

           INT AMERICAN COLONY / BEDROOM - DAY 

                                 RUTH
                        Fucker. 

           RUTH, coiled tight, gazing out over EAST JERUSALEM. 
           She’s kneading a coffee cup so hard it marks her hand.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Mister Hamad. 
                        Little fucker.

           RUTH very deliberately puts down the coffee cup and 
           turns very deliberately to a sheepish ROBERT sitting in 
           a cane chair. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        No one is dictating to me where I will 
                        bury my only child. 

           INT AMERICAN COLONY / BEDROOM - DAY 

           RUTH is standing in a slip, ironing an ash grey suit in 
           a very resolute manner. Her eyes flick back and forth 
           to a TV NEWS BROADCAST -

                                 NEWSREADER
                        Hamas appear to be gaining ground over 
                        their Fatah rivals, seizing key 
                        strongholds in the city.

           RUTH flicks to another channel - JOANNA’s face smiling 
           out at her. 

                                 NEWS VOICE OVER
                        Mother of Joanna Hass the British 
                        journalist shot dead in Gaza 
                        yesterday.

           RUTH steels herself to continue watching - the report 
           cuts to an interview with PAUL, standing outside the 
           AMERICAN COLONY.
                                 PAUL
                        Mrs Hass has asked the media respect 
                        her privacy at this painful time. 

           RUTH’s movements of the IRON get more deliberate, 
           firmer, she suddenly smashes the iron down onto the 
           board. She picks up the board and with a ferocious 
           force throws it across the room. 

           CUT TO: RUTH sitting hunched in a corner of the room, 
           her face is wet with tears but ignores them - she is 
           drawing in deeper and deeper breaths, clawing back her 
           composure. 

           EXT JERUSALEM/ AMERICAN COLONY HOTEL - DAY

           RUTH emerges from the AMERICAN COLONY wearing the ash 
           grey suit and dark sunglasses - she looks elegant and 
           composed, carrying herself with a Jackie O dignity. 

           ARIEL holds open the rear door to the ISRAELI 
           GOVERNMENT car. 

           EXT ROAD TO GAZA/ EREZ CROSSING POINT - DAY 

           The ISRAELI GOVERNMENT CAR, a POLICE CAR following. 

           ARIEL is sitting in the back seat beside RUTH.

                                 ARIEL
                        Joanna never mentioned anything, a 
                        romance, falling in love? 
                                (Ruth shakes her head)
                        Could she have converted?

                                 RUTH
                        I’ve no idea. 

                                 ARIEL
                        Its nothing, say a few words, there’s 
                        one god, Mohammed is his prophet - 
                        you’re a Muslim. 

                                 RUTH
                                (a big step)
                        We hadn’t spoken for some time. 

           ARIEL hears the effort that took, he sits a beat in 
           this unexpected intimacy. 

                                 ARIEL
                        I understand. 

                                 RUTH
                        My husband died two years ago. 
                        Simon and Joanna were very close. 
           A troubled multitude hangs on those words. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Could you, the air conditioning, would 
                        you mind? 

                                 ARIEL 
                        Of course. 

           ARIEL orders the DRIVER in HEBREW. He sits back with a 
           quick appraising look at RUTH. 

                                 ARIEL (CONT’D)
                                (his mobile)
                        You’ve got my cell phone, if anything 
                        happens, if you feel you’re in danger, 
                        call me. Who knows if we can do 
                        anything but maybe. We do send in 
                        troops, air strikes. 

           RUTH looks at ARIEL, apprehensive but grateful.

                                 ARIEL (CONT’D)
                        If you just want to talk, call me. 

           ARIEL holds RUTH’s gaze.

           EXT MOTORWAY/ GAS STATION/ COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           A GAS STATION with an open air COFFEE SHOP attached. 

           RUTH, perspiring in the burning sun, sits with a coffee 
           and a bottle of water. ARIEL sits facing her. 

                                 ARIEL
                        You must see a lot of cancer?

           RUTH nods. ARIEL considers a beat. 

           RUTH is distracted by three JEWISH BOYS, in their early 
           twenties, leaving a nearby table. They each carry a 
           MACHINE GUN. 

           ARIEL is tempted, more than tempted, there is something 
           pressing he wants to ask RUTH, he is about to -

                                 RUTH
                        We should go. I’m afraid they’ll go 
                        ahead.  

                                 ARIEL
                                (remembering himself)
                        Of course. 
           EXT MOTORWAY/ GAS STATION - DAY 

           RUTH and ARIEL are walking towards the ISRAELI 
           GOVERNMENT CAR. The JEWISH BOYS, guns slung over their 
           shoulders, are fooling around. 

                                 RUTH
                        Those boys?

                                 ARIEL
                        Settlers, They go far into the Arab 
                        territories and take over land, build 
                        settlements. 

           A SIREN suddenly sounds, loud and disturbing. A high 
           pitched scream fills the sky. RUTH and ARIEL duck 
           behind some cars. RUTH sees a flare trailing white 
           smoke against the blue sky. 

                                 ARIEL (CONT’D)
                        A rocket! 

           A loud explosion and the ROCKET hits the ground, not 
           far away. Within seconds the SIREN is joined by FIRE 
           BRIGADE and AMBULANCE sirens. 

                                 ARIEL (CONT’D)
                        It alright. 
                                (continuing to the car)
                        The Palestinians keep firing these 
                        rockets, they could kill anyone. 
                        Women, old people. We seal the 
                        borders, we don’t let them in or out, 
                        we control the flow of goods - they 
                        won’t stop.

           RUTH glances at ARIEL. The JEWISH BOYS are passing, in 
           a jeep now, MACHINE GUNS trained out the windows. 

                                 ARIEL (CONT’D)
                        Israel is a beautiful villa in the 
                        jungle. 

           INT/ EXT ISRAELI GOVERNMENT CAR/ MOTORWAY - DAY 

           The ISRAELI GOVERNMENT CAR slows, it’s rear window 
           lowers and RUTH gazes out at a group of ISRAELI 
           SOLDIERS and POLICE examining racks and a hole in the 
           concrete, surrounded by AMBULANCES and FIRE ENGINES. 

                                 ARIEL
                        The Arabs like violence. 
                                (beat)
                        Are you sure you want to go in? 

                                 RUTH
                        I’m sure. 
           EXT GAZA BORDER/ EREZ CROSSING POINT  - DAY 

           A building like a European provincial airport - several 
           floors of stone and glass - sealed off by barbed wire 
           and metal fencing. This is EREZ CROSSING POINT.

           To one side are the CONCRETE WALLS, camouflage webbing 
           and OBSERVATION TOWERS of a MILITARY BASE. The other 
           side a wire fence disappearing into the distance. 

           INT EREZ CROSSING POINT  - DAY 

           ARIEL and RUTH, carrying a bottle of water, strides, 
           towards SECURITY GATES. A beautiful SOLDIER, ISABEL, 
           nineteen, steps forward, bracing a sub machine gun. 
           RUTH stops. 

                                 ARIEL
                        It’s okay. 
                                (smiles at Ruth)
                        My daughter, Isabel. 

           RUTH casts a surprised, faltering look at ISABEL who 
           nods shyly. RUTH turns to ARIEL.

                                 RUTH
                        She’s so beautiful. 

           ARIEL nods. A delicate moment. RUTH manages a generous 
           smile. 

           EXT EREZ CROSSING POINT/ GAZA SIDE - DAY 

           RUTH emerges out of the TERMINAL. It hits her instantly 
           - she has entered an abandoned world made of shattered 
           concrete and sand, a desiccated landscape devoid of 
           vegetation, overlooked by grey WATCH TOWERS hug with 
           green and dun webbing. 

           CUT TO : RUTH, walking, clutching her water. 

           CUT TO : RUTH, tiring in the mid day sun. She picks out 
           apocalyptic detail in this‘ no mans land’, an empty 
           bottle, a child’s shoe, a shattered television monitor. 

           NEARBY, behind some camouflage webbing squat several 
           grey blue battered looking ISRAELI MERKAVA TANKS. 

           RUTH feels increasingly exposed, she speeds up. A GUN 
           TURRET suddenly swivels. RUTH starts. The GUN TURRET, 
           follows her - featureless, anonymous, brutal. 

           INT TANK 
           DANIEL, a tank gunner, twenty years old, tracks RUTH’s 
           vulnerable figure on his SCREEN

           CUT TO : RUTH, hurrying, angry with herself for wearing 
           this suit, these shoes. She stumbles forward, desperate 
           to get out of the TANK’s sights, 

           To one side there she can see a GREEN FIELD and a BLACK 
           MARE bridled to a plough.

           RUTH hears music, louder as she gets closer, HIP HOP, 
           it’s coming from a dirt track road. She  stops, looks 
           about, a burnt out car, a demolished farmhouse. 

           RUTH looks back to the TERMINAL - a world far away. She 
           takes a few more steps - RUTH freezes - the TV CAR. 

           RUTH approaches the battered looking car, it’s windows 
           closed, PUBLIC ENEMY pounding inside. A figure lies 
           asleep in the drivers seat - SAYED? RUTH is uncertain, 
           examines the rest of the car interior - lots of TV 
           stuff, camera, a RED CARDIGAN.

           RUTH steps back from the car,aware she has to approach 
           this carefully. A sound nearby startles her - 

           THE BLACK STALLION, beautiful, strong and vigorous - 
           only feet away, a horse far too beautiful for its lowly 
           task, dragging a plough guided by an elderly 
           PALESTINIAN FARMER, head swathed in a black keffiyeh.  

           RUTH knocks on the car window, nothing. She raps hard. 
           Still nothing. RUTH opens the door. SAYED scrambles to 
           his senses, half falling out of the car. 

           CUT TO : RUTH and SAYED facing each other - 

                                 SAYED
                        Shalom.

                                 RUTH
                                (surprised)
                        Shalom. 

           RUTH and SAYED shake hands uncertainly. They study each 
           other while making only the most fleeting eye contact. 

           INT/ EXT ROAD TO GAZA/ TV CAR -DAY 

           RUTH, teeth gritted, bumping along to the sound of 
           PUBLIC ENEMY - she glances at SAYED, his ease at the 
           wheel seems insolent 

                                 RUTH
                        My head is pounding - 
                                (loud)
                        I have a splitting headache - 
           RUTH reaches down to switch off the CD player. SAYED’s 
           hand darts across - ahead of her

                                 SAYED
                                (turning down the volume)
                        Doctor Nazeem will see you at the 
                        hospital. He’s the one who tried to 

                                (trails off)

           RUTH looks at SAYED - everything about him irritates 
           her - his clothes, his demeanour, his music - 

                                 SAYED (CONT’D)
                        My sisters will prepare Joanna for 
                        burial. 

                                 RUTH
                        No. No, no.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know how much Robert has told 
                        you, I’m taking Joanna home London.

                                 SAYED
                                (shakes his head)
                        Gaza is her home. 

           RUTH considers her response. SAYED is driving into 

           EXT JABALIYA REFUGEE CAMP - DAY 

           - a maze of higgledy piggledy breeze block buildings 
           awash with raw sewage.

           RUTH decides to hold fire, she pulls down the passenger 
           SUN VISOR something falls out into her lap -  a PRESS 
           CARD.  JOANNA in the red cardigan, smiling

           RUTH caught unawares, a flash of intense pain, she 
           grips the PRESS CARD TIGHT. Holding the card 
           strengthens her resolve. 

                                 RUTH
                        It may feel to you like Joanna’s been 
                        here a long time but I can assure you 
                        Gaza was never her home.

           SAYED leans over and pumps the music right up. 

           THE TV CAR Races on through JABALIYA passing wooden 
           lamp posts hung with GREEN HAMAS FLAGS.

           NAZEEM places a fresh mint tea a table in his OFFICE. 

                                 NAZEEM (CONT’D)
                        You may find this too sweet but..

                                 RUTH
                        Bloomsbury that’s right. 

           RUTH, on a couch, draped with a Bedouin blanket. 

                                 NAZEEM
                        Tavistock Park. 

           NAZEEM is calm, easy, his eyes bright and agile.  

                                 NAZEEM (CONT’D)
                                (smiling)
                        The British Museum. Virginia Woolf. 
                        That was my London I did a lot of my 
                        surgical training there.   

           RUTH smiles politely.  NAZEEM gives her an appraising 
           look; she’s here for business. 

                                 NAZEEM (CONT’D)
                        Joanna was hit in the abdomen by a 
                        single high velocity bullet, probably 
                        an M 16 machine gun. 
                                (Ruth registers this 
                                calmly )
                        These bullets can penetrate walls 
                        never mind flak jackets. Joanna 
                        suffered a devastating blood loss. By 
                        the time she got she was arresting. I 
                        haven’t done a post mortum and you may 
                        wish to but from our experience you’ll 
                        find her spleen, liver devastated, her 
                        portal vein.

                                 RUTH
                        Yes.
                                (she can imagine)

                                 NAZEEM 
                        We did everything we could but, I 
                        pronounced Joanna dead at 2.10 
                        yesterday afternoon.  

           NAZEEM and RUTH are silent a beat.

                                 NAZEEM (CONT’D)
                        Joanna did a feature here, on the 
                        hospital here, a very good one. She 
                        told me you were a doctor. 
           NAZEEM sees a yearning flares up in RUTH, to hear more 
           to seize at his memories. Well used to death and it’s 
           territories he responds -

                                 NAZEEM (CONT’D)
                        She was very proud of you. 

           RUTH, grief grips her by the throat, she looks down. 
           NAZEEM calmly waits

                                 RUTH
                        I’d like to see her now if I may? 

                                 NAZEEM
                        Of course. Please. 

           INT GAZA/ HOSPITAL - DAY 

           RUTH and NAZEEM walk down a corridor which bears the 
           scars of shrapnel and bullets. Something is nagging 
           NAZEEM. 

                                 RUTH
                        Did you scan Joanna? 

                                 NAZEEM
                        Of course, a major gun shot wound, 
                        organ damage, I should have scanned 
                        her immediately. 

                                 RUTH
                        But you didn’t?

           NAZEEM pauses at a METAL DOORWAY, he looks RUTH 
           straight in the eye.

                                 NAZEEM
                        I haven’t had a working scan for nine 
                        months, even for cancer patients. 

           NAZEEM is surrounded by PATIENTS and RELATIVES 
           questioning him - he gently eases them away.

                                 NAZEEM (CONT’D)
                                (wryly)
                        It seems when we elected Hamas we made 
                        the wrong choice so we must suffer. 
                        Israel has shut down our borders, 
                        virtually nothing gets through, they 
                        control our electricity, our oil, 
                        phones, medical supplies, even our 
                        mail.

           NAZEEM pulls open the door for RUTH. 
                                 NAZEEM (CONT’D)
                        The European Union decided we should 
                        not have scans, or x-rays or 
                        antibiotics.   

           EXT GAZA CITY - DAY 

           RUTH steps out into a CROWDED STREET - immediately 
           attracting stares from PASSERS-BY.  

                                 NAZEEM 
                        This way - 

           RUTH follows NAZEEM through a jumble of breeze block 
           buildings, covered in graffiti.

                                 NAZEEM (CONT’D)
                        I have enough anaesthetic left to last 
                        maybe a week, ten days. 

           NAZEEM stops outside a breeze block building painted 
           with long faded logos of CARNATIONS.

           NAZEEM steps aside to allow RUTH ahead - he appears 
           suddenly embarrassed. 

           INT CARNATION WAREHOUSE - DAY

           RUTH enters and stops, stunned, staring in disbelief -

           HER POV: BODIES, many of them CHILDREN, laid out in 
           lines on SORTING TABLES, some wrapped for burial in 
           white gauze, others still dressed the way they were 
           when they died. 

           RUTH is standing in what was once a FLOWER COOLING 
           PLANT and is now a temporary MORGUE. At the heads of 
           tables GRIEF STRICKEN FAMILIES are gathered. 

                                 NAZEEM 
                        The hospital morgue is over flowing, 
                        we have so many casualties from 
                        Israeli raids and bomb attacks. And 
                        now we are even killing each other. 

           At one table WOMEN  are washing a CORPSE. A steely 
           resolve surfaces in RUTH - 

                                 RUTH
                        Joanna? 

                                 NAZEEM
                        This way. 
                                (leading her)
                        I didn’t know how long you would be, 
                        so - 
           NAZEEM parts some GAUZE CURTAINS revealing a quiet area 
           and  at it’s centre  - a CATERING FRIDGE emblazoned 
           with a faded logo of an ICE CREAM CONE. RUTH stares -

                                 RUTH
                        Tell me this isn’t? 

                                 NAZEEM 
                        This is what we’ve been reduced to. 
                        I’m very sorry. 

           RUTH, transfixed by the CATERING FRIDGE. 

                                 NAZEEM (CONT’D)
                        I’ll give you a few minutes.

           RUTH can barely credit this is real. She approaches the 
           fridge. She takes hold of a handle grip on the lid. 

           RUTH steels herself, she lifts the lid. A cry leaps to 
           her throat but she holds it back - her POV : 

           JOANNA wearing the clothes she died in, crumpled into 
           the narrow fridge, her skin blue grey, her eyes 
           lifeless, her casket of ice stained with blood.  

           RUTH cries out, beating her fist against the FREEZER 
           edge

           NAZEEM averts his gaze. It falls to a table nearby -  
           the body of a BOY about seven lies unclaimed even in 
           death.  

           NAZEEM takes in the BOY’s distorted limbs - he takes 
           the BOY’s hand in his. 

           With heavy eyes NAZEEM gazes around the former flower 
           plant - rows of BODIES and grieving MOURNERS. 

                                 RUTH
                                (without turning)
                        How can I take Joanna to the border?

                                 NAZEEM 
                        I, I  understood burial was taking 
                        place here?

           RUTH, silent, staring at JOANNA like some ravaged Snow 
           White, frozen in a lifeless lustre. RUTH traces her 
           frozen fingers. She pauses on a gold wedding ring - 
           registering its presence but betraying no emotion.

                                 RUTH 
                        No. I’m bringing Joanna back to 
                        London.
                                 NAZEEM
                                (troubled)
                        Please, there is something I must 
                        attend to. 

           NAZEEM hurries out. 

           RUTH, alone with JOANNA. A strange, clinical detachment 
           creeps over her.   She parts JOANNA’s blouse. She 
           studies the bloated entry wound. Her fingers 
           methodically work their way around, under her abdomen 
           feeling for the exit wound. 

           RUTH gasps, detachment deserting her. 

           INT TEMPORARY MORGUE.

           RUTH sitting on a plastic chair, at one end of the 
           fridge, her hands under her thighs - she looks oddly 
           disassociated; like some sort of attendant. 

           NAZEEM returns. 

                                 RUTH
                        I’ll need a funeral car to take Joanna 
                        to the border. 

                                 NAZEEM
                                (gently)
                        I’m afraid the border is closed. 

                                 RUTH
                        The bor, the crossing point?

                                 NAZEEM
                        It’s closed. 
                                (Ruth is dumbstruck)
                        Until tomorrow. I just called them.  
                        ‘ Security reasons’ 

                                 RUTH 
                        But that’s ridiculous, I have someone 
                        to call, someone in the Israeli..

                                 NAZEEM
                        Go ahead but this happens all the 
                        time. Maybe they’ll listen to you but 
                        I’ve had patients die at the border, 
                        patients who needed treatment in 
                        Israel or Egypt. 

           His disinterested authority seems indisputable.

           INT GAZA/HOSPITAL/ NAZEEM’S OFFICE - DAY 

           RUTH enters NAZEEM’s office, pointedly ignoring SAYED 
           who sits in a corridor talking to some HAMAS FIGHTERS.
                                 RUTH
                        If Sayed imagines for one moment, one 
                        moment!

                                 NAZEEM 
                        Mrs Hass it’s too dangerous for you to 
                        stay in a hotel, there are criminal 
                        gangs,  kidnappings. Sayed’s family 
                        will look after you - 

                                 RUTH
                        Like they looked after Joanna?

                                 NAZEEM
                                (disapproving)
                        Please, in Gaza Sayed’s family are 
                        your family. 

                                 RUTH
                        Well that’s lovely but do you think 
                        you could - 

                                 NAZEEM 
                        I would invite you, of course, but  
                        this is my home. 

                                 RUTH
                        I don’t understand?

                                 NAZEEM
                        Here. This office. 

           RUTH takes in anew the couch and patterned cloth, the 
           traditional carpet - a locker with some suits hanging.  
           She’s mystified. 

                                 NAZEEM (CONT’D)
                        A year ago the Israeli’s blew up my 
                        house. They killed my family, my 
                        mother, my wife, two of our children. 

                                 RUTH
                        My god. I’m very sorry. 

                                 NAZEEM
                                (a fatalistic shrug)
                        It’s how we live here. A five hundred 
                        pound bomb. 

                                 RUTH
                        But why?
                                 NAZEEM
                        A punishment. My son was a suicide 
                        bomber. 

           RUTH stares - a mixture of astonishment and compassion. 
           NAZEEM fixes her with his sombre, sensitive gaze -  

                                 NAZEEM (CONT’D)
                        I’m a doctor of course I don’t agree 
                        with suicide bombing, I’ve always been 
                        opposed but, to the world Palestinians 
                        are not real people, we’re pictures in 
                        a bad news story. Our pain is of so 
                        little value...
                                (Ruth trying to compute)
                        If you want to ask, yes, I am proud of 
                        my son. 

           NAZEEM, still, calm, civilised. RUTH the same - a vast 
           incomprehension between them. 

           EXT/ INT SAYED’S CAR/ GAZA CITY  - DAY 

           SAYED cutting in and out of busy traffic. RUTH, 
           introverted, thoughtful,  cut off the from the 
           PALESTINIAN HIP HOP playing on SAYED’s car stereo. 

                                 RUTH 
                                (conciliatory)
                        Sayed, in the world Joanna comes from 
                        young people have lots of 
                        relationships before settling down 
                        with someone.

           SAYED, uneasy at this. RUTH sees his vulnerability. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        People sleep together, even live 
                        together, it doesn’t mean a lot. It’s 
                        a way of exploring the world, finding 
                        out who you are.

                                 SAYED
                        It’s true what Joanna said about you.
                                (turns to her)
                        You didn’t know her at all. 

           RUTH - hurt, but buries it. 

           EXT/ INT SAYED’S CAR/ KIOSK CAFE - DAY 

           SAYED pulls up at a KIOSK/CAFE on a busy square in 
           central GAZA. He hops out without a word, then pauses

                                 SAYED
                        You better come. 
           RUTH looks from SAYED around the SQUARE - a semblance 
           of normality - shops, traders, MEN and WOMAN in Islamic 
           dress, moving about. She moves to accompany SAYED. 

           INT KIOSK CAFE - DAY 

           SAYED approaches the COUNTER and after an exchange in 
           Arabic chooses a STICKY BUN. 

                                 SAYED
                                (to Ruth)
                        Water?

                                 RUTH
                        Please.

           SAYED gets two bottles of WATER and pays. 

           RUTH notices on a COLOUR TV in the CAFE - ROBERT - 
           being interviewed. She turns to SAYED just as he slips 
           a folded DOLLAR note to the KIOSK CLERK and the CLARK 
           slide a cling wrapped packet into his hand. 

           RUTH registers the transaction but turns back to the TV 
           - she steps a little closer - only MEN sit in the cafe, 
           smoking water pipes and playing cards or Shes Besh. 

           ON SCREEN : ROBERT, standing at the EREZ crossing 
           point, talking to camera - RUTH cannot hear what he is 
           saying - SAYED hands her WATER as the picture cuts to 

           LIBRARY FOOTAGE OF JOANNA :  a‘ SOFT NEWS’ piece with 
           some CHILDREN splashing in the water on GAZA BEACH - 
           JOANNA is teasing some small children and smiling as 
           she talks to camera -  

                                 SAYED
                        Last summer. 

           RUTH and SAYED, caught unawares, their faces transfixed 
           amid the hubbub of the cafe - can she really be gone?

           ON SCREEN - the sparkling water, the sunlight, JOANNA’s 
           face - radiant - she crouches and lifts a BEAUTIFUL 
           THREE YEAR OLD GIRL onto her knee - their faces 
           touching, smiling out.

           RUTH gazing at SAYED pain in him so visible, intense. 
           She is ‘seeing’ SAYED for the first time, so young, 
           vulnerable, searches for something more conciliatory.

                        I maybe have a solution. 

           EXT GAZA/ RURAL ROAD/ TV CAR  - TWILIGHT 

           THE TV CAR driving along a quiet rural road. 

           SAYED is rolling a joint in his lap as he drives, a wad 
           of grass in the cling film. 

                                 SAYED 
                        I remembered one of my father’s 
                        cousins, he’s the gardener here. 

           RUTH, increasingly paranoid as the car bumps along. 

           EXT GAZA/ BRITISH CEMETERY - TWILIGHT

           RUTH, the red cardigan over her shoulders against the 
           cold, steps through an arched stone porch and stops

           HER POV : a long gravel path bordered by tall cypress 
           trees - between them visible the seried ranks of 
           perfectly maintained WAR GRAVES. 

                                 SAYED
                        The British cemetery. 

           RUTH surprised, steps forward.

           RUTH walking slowly along a row of graves, studying the 
           headstones - First World War dead, soldiers from -

           THE ROYAL FUSILIERS.

           THE SCOTS GUARDS. 

           A UN PEACE KEEPER, after 1948 -   

           RUTH, brought up short by several First World War 
           graves - marked with the STAR OF DAVID - 

           THE LONDON REGIMENT -

           A ELDERLY GARDENER has appeared along side RUTH. 
                                 GARDENER
                        Jewish soldiers, Zionists, who fought 
                        along side Britain in the First World 
                        War in return for Britain supporting a 
                        Jewish State. 

           RUTH takes in the trees, the perfectly trimmed borders, 
           a sense of ordered calm, she could be in an English 
           churchyard.

                                 GARDENER (CONT’D)
                        Jewish soldiers buried here, from 
                        London, their graves are not 
                        desecrated. 

                                 SAYED
                        We can get permission to bury Ruth 
                        here. 

           CUT TO : RUTH, standing reading a brass plate on a 
           MEMORY BENCH - for a MEDICAL OFFICER from Cambridge - 
           died here after 1948. 

                                 GARDENER 
                                (quoting)
                        “if I should die, think only this of 
                        me, that there is some corner of a 
                        foreign field that is forever 
                        England.’

           SAYED is confident RUTH will respond to this but she 
           looks to the GARDENER with a wan smile.

                                 RUTH 
                        Joanna would hate this. 
                                (Sayed - taken aback)
                        The whole military, Sayed you don’t 
                        understand, young people in England 
                        today they don’t.. 
                                (Sayed, frustrated, 
                                embarrassed)
                        All this, it’s not Joanna.  

                                 SAYED
                        She said you’d like it here, she 
                        wanted you to visit. You’re always ‘ 
                        too busy.’

                                 RUTH
                        Do you know the expression holiday 
                        romance? 

                                 SAYED
                        No. No that’s not - 
                                 RUTH
                        Why did Joanna told you not to tell 
                        anyone about the wedding? Why? All 
                        this, it’s not reality for Joanna, it 
                        was an adventure, she -

                                 SAYED
                        You don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about, you haven’t spoken to her in 
                        months. 

                                 RUTH
                        Joanna’s my daughter -

                        You’re not the only one who’s lost a 
                        child. 

                                 RUTH
                                (walking away)
                        I’ve heard all about the big bad 
                        Israeli’s. 

                                 SAYED
                        That’s not what I meant. 

           RUTH keeps walking - suddenly STOPS. She turns 
           fearfully back to SAYED.

                                 SAYED 
                        She wanted to tell you herself. She’d 
                        booked a flight to London - 

                                 RUTH
                                ( looks Sayed up and down)
                        What was she thinking of? 

           SAYED stares, stunned. RUTH’s mobile rings. She looks 
           at the caller ID - ARIEL. She switches it off. RUTH 
           walks off, viciously wiping her eyes. 

           INT EREZ CROSSING POINT - NIGHT. 

           ISABEL is finished her shift, walking across a deserted 
           entrance hall, she glances up at a lit office area, her 
           father ARIEL is at visible at the window. 

           ISABEL waves to ARIEL. He waves back. 
           INT SECURITY CENTRE/ EREZ CROSSING POINT - NIGHT. 

           ARIEL, turns from the window, a mobile in his hand. He 
           looks from the mobile to a large ‘ letter box’ format 
           computer screen on which is visible a street plan - 
           like a big high tech. Sat Nav.  

           A red dot is moving swiftly through the streets. 

           ARIEL studies the progress of the red dot. 

           INT/EXT SAYED’S CAR/ GAZA CITY/ REFUGEE CAMP - NIGHT

           THE TV CAR racing through night streets - 

           RUTH silent, lost in contemplation.  

           SAYED drawing on a joint, driving to the dreamy tones 
           of ancient Arabic singing, headlights pick out a pack 
           of BLACK DOGS roaming a rubbish tip, they pin point 
           SHADOWY FIGURES hugging graffiti daubed walls. 

           RUTH gazes out at FAMILIES gathered around open fires 
           in bombed out buildings or living in tents pitched on 
           mounds of rubble. 

           RUTH is suddenly flung forward as SAYED brakes hard - 
           ahead is a ROAD BLOCK manned by ARMED FATAH FIGHTERS. A 
           MAN  is being pulled from his car - a FATAH FIGHTER 
           batters him to the ground with his AK 47. 

           RUTH looks to SAYED - who is scared but calm. A FATAH 
           FIGHTER is waving them ahead. 

                                 SAYED
                        Don’t say anything. If you have to say 
                        you’re with the UN, just arrived. 

           SAYED nudges the car forward. FATAH FIGHTERS are 
           emerging from some sort of compound, JEEPS are 
           scattered about, their lights illuminating the scene. 

           A FATAH FIGHTER is standing over the MAN beaten to the 
           ground. SAYED is rolling down his window to speak to 
           the FATAH FIGHTER waving him on. In the light of a JEEP 
           he sees MAJED KHAZI.  

                                 SAYED (CONT’D)
                        Shit. 

                                 RUTH
                        What is it?

                                 SAYED
                        Majed Khazi. He’s the one people say 
                        ordered Joanna’s death. 
           RUTH stares across, transfixed by MAJED KHAZI, his 
           attractive features, warm smile as he gives ORDERS. 

           SAYED is talking to the FATAH FIGHTER. They both look 
           as screaming of the FIGHTER nearby reaches a climax - 
           his AK 47 is rammed into the MAN’s face -  RUTH looks 
           just as the FATAH FIGHTER fires - the MAN’s explodes, 
           his body jolts and stills. RUTH, rigid with shock.

           SAYED resumes talking. RUTH can see his hands are 
           shaking violently. In her own hands JOANNA looks up at 
           her from the ID CARD. 

           RUTH’s eyes catch MAJED KHAZI’s, staring at her, 
           curious. RUTH is terrified. MAJED KHAZI is starting 
           towards her. The FATAH FIGHTER waves them through SAYED 
           pulls away and in seconds floors it. 

           MAJED KHAZI’s calm gaze follows the car.

                        Did you see him? Did you see Majed 
                        Khazi coming over? Just in time, just 
                        in time!

           RUTH is sick with fear and exhaustion. 

                                 SAYED (CONT’D)
                        I’ve seen the house where Majed Khazi 
                        was born, not a house really, a hut, 
                        made of asbestos. Now the block is his 
                        palace, he has mansions, here and in 
                        Egypt, a house in Paris. He’s the 
                        biggest Fatah gangster in Gaza. 

           EXT  SAYED’S FAMILY BUILDING  - NIGHT 

           The TV car headlights pick out an apartment building, 
           in front of which stands a MOURNING TENT. SAYED pulls 
           up. RUTH looks out at the MOURNING TENT. A fire burns. 
           WOMEN move about, talking and heating food. 

                                 SAYED
                                (a mournful gaze)
                        If it was Majed Khazi I’ll have to 
                        kill him.

                                 RUTH
                        What? 

                                 SAYED
                        Otherwise my sisters, my mother, 
                        they’ll never be safe.

                        defenceless. 

                                 RUTH 
                        But, what about police, courts?

                                 SAYED
                        Last year Majed was the police, he may 
                        be again. There’s have no choice. 
                        Majed Khazi will be thinking I’ll have 
                        Sayed for breakfast before he has me 
                        for lunch. 
                                (Ruth - reeling )
                        My mother and sisters are here. Come.

           RUTH and SAYED get out of the car. Somewhat apart from 
           the tent, MEN are gathered standing or sitting around 
           WATER PIPES. RUTH’s had enough. 

                                 RUTH
                        Can I just go somewhere to sleep?  

           INT SAYED AND JOANNA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           RUTH steps through the door way to SAYED and JOANNA’s 
           apartment. Exhausted, she barely takes in an 
           impression. SAYED switches on a lamp, suddenly Joanna 
           is everywhere - her clothes, her books, her pictures, 
           her work station -

                                 SAYED
                        You can sleep here. 

           RUTH stunned by the untidy vibrancy of a life - 
           suspended.

           SAYED is gazing forlornly about the room. 

                                 RUTH
                                (ventures)
                        I know you feel about Joanna, and a 
                        baby but -
                                (start again)
                        what age are you Sayed?

           SAYED responds with a slow scathing look. RUTH gives 
           up. SAYED walks to the door.  

                                 SAYED 
                        My sisters will make you something to 
                        eat. 

                                 RUTH
                        I’m not hungry. 

           SAYED shrugs ‘ suit yourself.’ 
           RUTH drops onto the bed, she sits there a long 
           motionless beat, as if she’s afraid she will 
           disintegrate any second. 

           CUT TO LATER: RUTH staring, with incomprehension, at 
           the closed door on which is a life size poster of TUPAC 
           - all gleaming muscles, guns and tattoos. 

           On wall shelves to one side is CAMERA EQUIPMENT and a 
           beautiful wooden VINTAGE CAMERA. A collection of 
           several years old magazines - issues of GQ, VOGUE, HIP 
           HOP MUSIC and ARAB FASHION magazines.

           CUT TO : RUTH, investigating a different set of shelves 
           - books by NAOIMI KLEIN, EDWARD SAID, MICHAEL MOORE, 
           ORIANA FALLACI, ANNA POLITKOVSKAYA.

           RUTH, ashen faced with stress and exhaustion, is taking 
           in the apartment - a mixture of TRADITIONAL PALESTINIAN 
           fabrics and cushions, furniture of contemporary design 
           and an Israeli retro sixties look. 

           There are several photographs by SAYED - classic images 
           of the INTIFADA and of PALESTINIAN CHILDREN, but also 
           puzzlingly for RUTH, random images cut from EUROPEAN 
           and ARAB FASHION MAGAZINES. 

           RUTH sees a bottle of WATER on a work station and 
           reaches for it - she is brought up short brought up by 
           a framed COLOUR PHOTOGRAPH - RUTH and her husband, 
           SIMON, with a younger JOANNA in the garden of their 
           NORTH LONDON home.

           RUTH lifts the photograph. She stares, disbelieving - 
           at what was her world.

           RUTH moves back towards the bed, her elbow disturbs a 
           robe hanging on the back of a chair. She picks up the 
           robe. RUTH realises it an ankle length Islamic dress 
           and resting on the chair is a Hijab.

                                (outraged)
                        No, no. Fuck! 

           RUTH sweeps the Hijab onto the floor. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        The twenty first century! 

           RUTH casts about, she sees a BLACK TUNIC, another HIJAB 
           RUTH seizes a camera bag. She empties out some gear and 
           puts the framed photograph into the bag -

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        What were you - 
           RUTH rips open a DESK DRAWER - more pictures - family 
           snaps from London - into the bag - photos of JOANNA 
           with Sayed’s sisters, her hair covered - RUTH throws 
           them away -

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Medieval! 

           ANOTHER DRAWER - JOANNA’s passport - other documents - 
           into the bag. RUTH grabs clothes, blouses, T. Shirts, 
           underwear, stuffing them into the sports bag. Her rage 
           becomes cold, hard, she packs Joanna’s things 

           A BEDSIDE DRAWER Jewellery- straight into the bag - a 
           photo of JOANNA and SIMON - into the bag - a LOWER 
           BEDSIDE DRAWER some clothes - RUTH grabs them - She 
           suddenly stops - 

           In her hands are two BABY GROWS and a KNITTED NEW 
           BORN’S JACKET - RUTH swaying with anger - what to do 
           with them? 

           EXT/ INT MOURNING TENT/SAYED’S FAMILY BUILDING - NIGHT 

           Sayed’s sister, HANAN , in her late twenties, his 
           MOTHER in her early fifties, SISTERS and AUNTS, sit 
           around a table cloth  covered with dishes of salad, 
           humous, vegetables, rice. They are startled as - 

           An agitated RUTH appears in the tent entrance, carrying 
           the CAMERA BAG.

                                 RUTH
                        I’m sorry but I want to go. Right now. 
                        Sayed? May I speak to Sayed! 

                                 HANAN 
                                (standing)
                        I’m Hannan, Sayed’s sister. 

                                 RUTH
                        I need him to take me, take me back to 
                        the hospital. 

                                 HANAN 
                        It’s too dangerous, there are and 
                        criminals and Israeli’s under cover -

           SAYED’S MOTHER is on her feet and taking RUTH’s hand, 
           addressing her kindly in Arabic. RUTH is momentarily 
           caught by a large framed version of the photograph of 
           JOANNA in the elegant ‘ dress’ Hijab.  It is stood 
           beside burning candles.  

                                 HANAN  (CONT’D)
                        My mother says you must eat, eat with 
                        us, you’re our guest - 
                                 RUTH
                        No. I should be with Joanna, it’s 
                        nearly morning anyway. 

           SAYED’s MOTHER is murmuring soothing sounds. 

                                 SAYED
                                (appearing)
                        It’s still too dangerous -

                                 RUTH
                        Can’t you just take me?

           SAYED’s MOTHER takes hold of the CAMERA BAG.  RUTH 
           pulls it back - the KNITTED NEW BORN JACKET comes free 
           in SAYED’s MOTHER’s hand, everyone stops. All eyes on 
           the KNITTED JACKET. 

                                 SAYED 
                        What are you doing - 

           RUTH looks mortified. 

                                 HANAN 
                        For the baby?

           RUTH feels exposed, like a thief. The FAMILY are 
           struggling not to regard her as such. 

                                 SAYED 
                                (disgusted)
                        Take her then. Go on take her. 
                        You’ve got what you came for. 
                                (Ruth is startled)
                        Take Joanna, take her body. In the 
                        morning we’ll go to the hospital - 

           HANAN, appalled, challenges SAYED angrily in Arabic - 
           he responds in kind - 

                                 SAYED (CONT’D)
                                (back to Ruth)
                        Her body doesn’t matter, Joanna’s 
                        heart will always be in Palestine. 

           RUTH gives a careful neutral nod. 

           SAYED’S MOTHER enters into the fray, forcefully 
           haranguing SAYED. RUTH watches shrewdly, the entire 
           family is involved now but SAYED is obviously holding 
           his ground. HANAN turns to RUTH - 

                                 HANAN 
                        My mother can’t bury her grandchild? 

           RUTH looks away. SAYED and his MOTHER’s confrontation 
           reaches a climax with him gesturing and obviously 
           saying ‘ That’s it!‘
           RUTH is aware of MEN appearing from the shadows, drawn 
           by the row. 

                                 RUTH
                                (quietly)
                        There is a paper you’re required to 
                        sign. 

                                 SAYED
                        I’ll sign anything you want me to. 

           RUTH - a tight lipped victory. SAYED walks away. HANAN  
           and SAYED’s MOTHER look troubled, hard done by. RUTH an 
           uncertain beat, then - 

                                 RUTH
                        Thank you. 

           RUTH turns to follow SAYED.

                                 HANAN 
                        No. 

           SAYED’S MOTHER indicates the food laid out. 

                                 HANAN (CONT’D)
                        Please, you’re our guest. 

           RUTH wrong footed. The WOMEN’s eyes upon her. 

                                 RUTH
                        You’re very kind. 

           LATER:

           RUTH sits with the WOMEN, eating with their hands. 
           HANAN brings her a fork. RUTH smiles her gratitude. 

           An awkward silence filled with eating. HANAN and the 
           other WOMEN feeling aggrieved. RUTH thinking through 
           what’s just happened. A little GIRL giggles at RUTH 
           using a fork. She winks at the GIRL. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        You’re welcome to come to England, to 
                        the funeral, I can help - 

                                 HANAN 
                        The Israeli’s won’t allow any 
                        Palestinians travel out of Gaza. Only 
                        foreign journalists. Joanna tried and 
                        tried to get Sayed out so he could 
                        take up his scholarship. 

                                 RUTH
                        Scholarship? 
                                 HANAN 
                        The Royal College of Art in London.  
                        Fine art photography. 

                                 RUTH
                                (surprised)
                        How would you manage without him? 

                                 HANAN  
                        Joanna said there are grants, he could 
                        do some work in England. 

           SAYED’s MOTHER speaks to HANAN. 

                                 HANAN  (CONT’D)
                        My mother says it must be hard for you 
                        without a husband, without a family 
                        behind you? 

           RUTH smiles, polite, but wary of where this is leading. 

                                 HANAN (CONT’D)
                        Joanna missed you. She was looking 
                        forward to seeing you. 
                                (Ruth flinches)
                        Two days ago in Tel Aviv she had an 
                        ultra sound, everything was fine. 

           RUTH, staring ahead, hunched tight into herself, as if 
           in physical pain - 

                                 HANAN  (CONT’D)
                        My mother wants to know what sort of 
                        funeral? 

                                 RUTH 
                        Just people who.. 
                                (stops herself)
                        Family, friends. 
                                (covering her awkwardness)
                        We’re not religious. My husband’s 
                        funeral was a civil ceremony.

           The GIRL tickles her hand, and directs RUTH, grateful 
           for the distraction, to a - TELEVISION wired up to a 
           car battery - 

                                 HANAN 
                                (smiling)
                        The wedding. 

           ON SCREEN - women dancing, among them JOANNA in a 
           traditional PALESTINIAN DRESS and a Hijab decorated 
           with silver and gold tassels - 
           CUT TO: RUTH staring at the television screen - ‘who is 
           this person?’ JOANNA is radiant - her skin white but 
           her Semitic features indistinguishable from HANAN and 
           the other GIRLS. Her dancing is exuberant, sensual. She 
           is entirely at ease.

                                 HANAN  (CONT’D (CONT’D)
                        Joanna was my sister. 

                                 RUTH
                        Where is Sayed?

                                 HANAN 
                        The men have their party in another 
                        hall. 

           RUTH filled with wonder at the person her daughter had 
           become. HANAN  and SAYED’s MOTHER watch, smiling - 
           JOANNA dancing, beautiful - 

                                 HANAN  (CONT’D)
                        Joanna was so proud of you. 

                                 RUTH
                                (automatically)
                        I don’t think so.

                                 HANAN 
                        Of course. Every day you’re saving 
                        people’s lives - 

                                 RUTH
                        - hardly -

                                 HANAN 
                        - a doctor.

           RUTH shrugs it off. HANAN looks back to the TELEVISION.

                                 HANAN  (CONT’D)
                        It’s gods will. 

                                 RUTH
                        None of this is god’s will.
                                (standing)

           HANAN giggles. RUTH looks at her, surprised - 

                                 HANAN
                        You’re like Joanna. She could never 
                        understand how I can have a degree in 
                        Philosophy from Hamburg university and 
                        still believe in God. 
                                (smiling)
                        God will deliver us. 

                                 RUTH 
                        There is no god. 
           RUTH walks away. 

           EXT SAYED’S FAMILY BUILDING - NIGHT 

           RUTH finds a space to stand alone, away from the tent. 
           She stares into the night - GUN FIRE in the distance. 
           RUTH dials on her mobile. 

           INT ARIEL’S HOUSE/ BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           ARIEL is woken by the flashing of his mobile. He sits 
           up, legs over the side of the bed. His WIFE asleep. 

                                 ARIEL
                        Ruth? 

                                 RUTH’S VOICE
                        Tomorrow, tomorrow morning

                                 ARIEL
                                (smiling)
                        Tomorrow? Good for you. 

           The mobile clicks off - ARIEL sits in his boxer shorts 
           a beat, reflecting. He turns to his WIFE - an oxygen 
           tube runs from her nose to a tank beside them bed. 

           ARIEL gazes with great tenderness at his WIFE, listens 
           to the rustle of her breathing in the tube. He leans 
           over and gently pulls a sheet up over her shoulder.

           EXT SAYED’S FAMILY BUILDING APARTMENT - NIGHT 

           SAYED stands in a stairwell, smoking an ordinary 
           cigarette, staring out at flashes from gun fire around 
           the city. 

           RUTH appears out of the darkness. She has to pass SAYED  
           to get up to the apartment. 

                                 RUTH 
                        Your family’s angry with you?

                                 SAYED
                        What’s new? My cousin says I was lost 
                        once I started listening to Western 
                        Music. 
                                (Ruth smiles)
                        I keep telling him hip hop is the 
                        music of resistance. Joanna would say‘ 
                        How can you care about hip hop or 
                        fashion when all this is happening?’ 
                                (Sayed shrugs)
                        I don’t want to shoot people. That’s 
                        what politics means here now. 
           RUTH, her expression determinedly neutral. 

                                 RUTH 
                        Good night Sayed. 

           RUTH walks towards the stairwell. 

                                 SAYED
                        Wait.

           RUTH pauses, surprised - she follows SAYED’s gaze 
           towards the street - 

           RUTH’S POV: THREE BLACK JEEPS brake in front of the 
           MOURNING TENT. RAJA Emerges from the lead jeep, 
           surrounded by ARMED HAMAS FIGHTERS spreading out. RUTH 
           looks to SAYED

                                 RUTH
                        What is it? What’s happening?

                                 SAYED 
                        Fucking beards. Hamas. 

           SAYED calls out to the HAMAS FIGHTERS in Arabic RAJA 
           Looks up and start towards him. 

                                 SAYED (CONT’D)
                                (under his breath)
                        Look at them, just like the Israelis. 

           CUT TO: RUTH watching, unnerved as ARMED HAMAS FIGHTERS  
           powerfully built, crowd the stairwell, agitated, 
           shouting commands in ARABIC and SAYED talks to RAJA.

           RUTH - an RPG at her eyeline. RAJA is looking at RUTH.

                                 RAJA 
                        I am investigating your daughters 
                        death. I am happy to give you some 
                        guards  - 
                                (indicating his men)
                        When you are here, for your safety?

           RUTH, uncertain, looks to SAYED. His body language says 
           - ‘up to you’ but his eyes.... 

                                 RUTH
                        No thank you, I’m fine.

           A slight softening in SAYED.

           A burst of mobile phone and RAJA starts away with his 
           personal bodyguards, ordering a MUSCLE BOUND COMMANDER 
           to take the MEN upstairs. 
           INT SAYED AND JOANNA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

           A LITTLE LATER: RUTH, watching HAMAS FIGHTERS search 
           the room - looking at papers, photographs. SAYED is 
           suffering this. A HAMAS FIGHTER unplugs JOANNA’s 
           laptop. He speaks to SAYED and leaves with it. 

           Even with their masks it’s gradually apparent that the 
           HAMAS FIGHTERS are no more than BOYS, shy and awkward 
           in RUTH’s presence.  One powerfully built fighter, 
           MUSCLE MAN is studying SAYED. 

           RUTH is taken aback at seeing SAYED, ashen faced, a 
           tremor in his lips. MUSCLE MAN is staring hard at 
           SAYED. One of his MEN speaks to him.

           RUTH senses a movement at her hand - SAYED’s FINGERS 
           are slipping something into hers. RUTH freaks. 

           HAMAS FIGHTERS continue searching. RUTH struggles to 
           quelling her panic, she resists taking the slim hard 
           object from SAYED. He pushes it back to her, more 
           forcefully.

           MUSCLE MAN says something to SAYED, with his AK 47 he 
           gestures towards the bathroom. SAYED is petrified now. 
           RUTH opens her hand and takes the object.  

           SAYED goes into the bathroom. MUSCLE MAN follows. RUTH 
           clasps the object clasped tight in her hand. Through 
           the  BATHROOM DOOR sees SAYED unbuckling his belt. 
           MUSCLE MAN catches RUTH’s eye in the BATHROOM MIRROR 
           and with the back of his foot kicks the door shut.

           RUTH sits up onto the bed. She faces down the HAMAS 
           FIGHTERS, shy and uncertain in the company of a Western 
           Woman. 

           The BATHROOM DOOR opens and MUSCLE MAN emerges briskly. 
           He barks orders to the HAMAS FIGHTERS, and nods to RUTH 
           as they pile swiftly out. 

           CUT TO: RUTH, alone, on the bed. She can hear muffled 
           crying from the bathroom. 

           INT BATHROOM - SAYED, hurriedly washing tears from his 
           eyes, stressed out, upset, embarrassed. He becomes 
           aware of RUTH in the doorway, watching him. SAYED, 
           humiliated, angry with himself for having been afraid. 

                                 SAYED 
                        Can’t read or write? Big fuck off gun 
                        and you rule the world. 

                                 SAYED (CONT’D)
                        That’s what it’s like here. You were 
                        right. 
                                     (MORE)
                                     SAYED (CONT’D)
                        You take his men as guards and you 
                        make yourself a target. They think 
                        like people in prison, they see plots- 

           SAYED draws a jagged pattern in the air.

                                 SAYED (CONT’D)
                        conspiracies, paranoia all the time, 
                        we’re living in one big prison.

                                 RUTH
                        What are they looking for? 

                                 SAYED
                        Fatima gave Joanna something, a 
                        document or photographs, she was 
                        worried about getting it out of Gaza. 
                        They think it’s the reason she was 
                        killed. 

                                 RUTH
                        This?

           RUTH holds up the object  SAYED pressed into her hands, 
           a wallet held together with an elastic band. 

                                 SAYED
                        No. I don’t know what Fatima gave her. 

                                 RUTH 
                        Joanna must have told you surely? 

                                 SAYED
                                (shakes his head)
                        She was always protecting her 
                        journalistic integrity. 
                                (flashes her a look )
                        You know what Joanna was like, you 
                        only knew what she wanted you to know. 

           RUTH - can’t argue with that. 

           INT APARTMENT - NIGHT

           LATER: 

           THE WALLET, it’s elastic band being undone. RUTH is 
           sitting at JOANNA’s work desk. The wallet is packed 
           with photographs. First up is - 

           A COLOUR PHOTOGRAPH of Ruth and Simon, wearing a prayer 
           shawl, in the early eighties, proud parents holding 
           baby Joanna in a LONDON SYNAGOGUE.

           Next up - 
           A BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPH of Ruth as a child, with 
           her PARENTS, at a London Zoo in the fifties. 

           RUTH stares, stunned.

           Next up A BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPH of a BEDOIN family 
           in the thirties - MEN and WOMEN wearing elaborate 
           traditional dress and jewellery. 

                                 SAYED 
                        My great grandfather and grandmother. 

                                 RUTH
                                (earlier picture)
                        My parents. 
                                (Sayed nods)
                        I never knew Joanna had any of these?

           ANOTHER BLACK AND WHITE of Sayed’s family outside a 
           stone built house. 

                                 SAYED 
                        This was our home, near Haifa. 

           A BLACK AND WHITE of a young WOMAN in Piccadilly Circus 
           in the forties. 

                                 RUTH
                                (gasps)
                        My mother. She met my father in 
                        London, his  parents escaped from 
                        Germany, then Holland. 

                                 SAYED 
                        In a boat?

                                 RUTH
                        That’s right. 

                                 SAYED
                        He survived on Lemon biscuits?

           RUTH nods, gripped by the unfolding narrative. 

           A BLACK AND WHITE of a BOY standing in front of a tent, 
           bare foot, bleak eyed - 

                                 SAYED (CONT’D)
                        My father, in a refugee camp in 
                        Jordan, after 1948. 

           COLOUR  - a serious man in his FORTIES in an Arab cafe. 

                                 SAYED (CONT’D)
                        My father again, in Tunis, he was in 
                        exile with Arafat.

           COLOUR - Ruth’s graduation picture. 
                                 SAYED (CONT’D)
                        My father also trained as a doctor. In 
                        Beirut. 

           RUTH looks up surprised at SAYED. He leans down and 
           begins arranging the photographs. RUTH watches SAYED’S 
           HANDS l ay out the photographs fast as a croupier in 
           what is clearly a familiar arrangement - 

           A PARALLEL NARRATIVE emerges - SAYED pairs his fathers 
           photographs with Ruth’s parents. 

                                 SAYED (CONT’D)
                        Your family fled from Germany. When 
                        Israel was formed a million 
                        Palestinian’s were driven from their 
                        villages We Palestinians became the 
                        refugee nation. The one’s with no 
                        home. 

           RUTH keeps her gaze fixed and steely on the 
           photographs.

                                 SAYED (CONT’D)
                        My mother still has the key to our 
                        house in Haifa. Israeli’s live in it 
                        now.

           RUTH is aware of SAYED producing the KNITTED BABY 
           JACKET and replacing it in the bedside drawer. It is 
           the most gentle of reproofs but for all that cuts deep.

           RUTH is aware of SAYED walking away and the door 
           closing. 

           RUTH sags with relief. She’s held out. 

           EXT GAZA/ BALCONY/ SAYED AND JOANNA’S APARTMENT - DAY 

           The mournful sound of MINARET’s call to prayer drifts 
           out over a roof top mosaic, interspersed with the 
           sounds of gunfire and distant explosions. 

           RUTH, wearing a silk slip, sitting on the balcony, 
           alone, drinking tea, staring out.

           RUTH glances up at a PHOTOGRAPH hanging on the wall - a 
           picture of JOANNA, sitting in the same chair, drinking 
           tea from the same pot. Unsettled, RUTH stands up - 

           INT SAYED AND JOANNA’S APARTMENT - DAY

           RUTH, bag packed, dressed to leave. 

           RUTH approaches JOANNA’s work station. 
           RUTH considers the pictures. Then firmly picks out her 
           own family shots, breaking the linked family trees 
           until only Sayed’s remain.

           EXT GAZA STREET - DAY

           RUTH and HANAN  walking down the street - to the 
           curious gaze of barefoot CHILDREN. 

           EXT HOSPITAL YARD - DAY 

           With a HEAVY CLUNK the CATERING FREEZER drops onto the 
           back of a battered pick up truck. 

           RUTH nods thanks to FOUR WORKMEN who clamber down. 

           NAZEEM, overseeing things, hands them a few dollars, 
           indicating that they came from RUTH. 

           The FOUR WORKMEN gesticulate their gratitude. 

           NAZEEM turns to RUTH and extends his hand --

                                 NAZEEM
                        Say hello to Bloomsbury for me. 

                                 RUTH
                        Thank you for everything.

           NAZEEM smiles. 

           RUTH lingers a beat - but there’s nothing more to say.  

           EXT/INT PICK UP TRUCK/ ROAD TO JABALIYA - DAY 

           The pick up truck spreads a cloud of dust as it 
           approaches JABALIYA REFUGEE CAMP.

           A CIVILIAN DRIVER and beside him RUTH on her mobile. 
           She’s not getting through. She turns to the DRIVER.

                                 RUTH
                        How long, how long to the border?

                                 DRIVER 
                        Half. 

                                 RUTH
                        Half an hour?
                                (he nods)
                        Do they know we’re coming? 

           The DRIVER shrugs. RUTH returns to the mobile. 
           EXT JABALIYA REFUGEE CAMP - DAY 

           THE PICK UP TRUCK bouncing through narrow pot holed 
           streets wet with sewage. They pass a DONKEY drawing a 
           cart stacked tins of cooking oil. There is a sudden‘ 
           ack, ack’ of  GUN FIRE. RUTH can see commotion ahead - 

           CROWDS filling the narrow streets.

           RUTH alarmed. 

           CHILDREN AND ADULTS are running, screaming frightened. 
           There are INJURED PEOPLE being carried or dragged. The 
           GUN FIRE is nearer, more intense.

           EXT JABALIYA STREET

           The PICK UP brakes - throwing RUTH forward into the 
           wind screen - she hardly seems to notice - she is 
           transfixed by an - 

           ISRAELI MERKAVA TANK

           Coming towards them. Lumbering, elephantine, pressing 
           forward

           RUTH watching as

           crushed by the TANK’s relentless tan and grey bulk -

           On a covered balcony a MASKED FIGHTER firing back at 
           the tank. 

           A CHILD

           screaming on the balcony next door, the 

           CHILD’S MOTHER

           dressed in black, runs out, she reaches the CHILD and 
           lifts it up. Holding it to her as she turns back -

           seems to tremble and rise up - MOTHER and CHILD jerk 
           forward - the balcony wall

           The TANK COMMANDER’s hand claps DANIEL’s shoulder.

           DANIEL - his eyes insane with adrenaline.

           EXT JABALIYA STREET

           RUTH, the pick up truck door is open, tantalisingly 
           close. All around her PEOPLE moan and cry, they pray, 
           calling out in Arabic - 

           RUTH crawls forward. She reaches the pick up door. She 
           pulls herself inside. The DRIVER is dead. The extent of 
           the violence begins to hit RUTH she’s shaking, 
           desperately trying to regain control. 

           A MOVEMENT catches RUTH’s eye. Behind the pick up, 
           obscured from the tanks, is

           KALID

           Strikingly beautiful, a rock in his hand -

           registers RUTH but his arm is already rising in an arc 
           as he 

           STEPS OUT

           RUTH jumps from the pick up, instinctively she runs to 
           KALID’S BODY. RUTH whips off her cardigan and forms a 
           pack for an exit wound to his kidney. A WOMAN hands her 
           a head scarf. RUTH kneels across KALID tying the pack 
           into place with the headscarf.

                        I’m not aware of any.

                        This is a security operation. Israel 
                        has the right to defend itself -

           at a loss.

                        Mrs Hass entered Gaza at her own risk.

           RUTH running alongside a stretcher carrying KALID. She 
           is massaging a manual oxygen bottle for KALID. 

           RUTH and PARAMEDICS race along the same chaotic 
           corridor we saw Joanna taken to theatre. 
           INT GAZA/ AL SHIFA HOSPITAL/ THEATRE AREA - DAY 

           MADNESS in the THEATRE AREA.

           NAZEEM is operating a blunt triage system for the flow 
           of fresh CASUALTIES. He passes over a severely INJURED 
           FATAH FIGHTER. His COMRADES realise what is happening  
           and turn on NAZEEM arguing vehemently for their man to 
           be treated. NAZEEM ignores them. 

           RUTH arrives with KALID on a trolley. One FATAH COMRADE 
           suddenly produces a hand GUN. He orders NAZEEM to take 
           the INJURED FIGHTER into theatre. 

           RUTH is terrified for NAZEEM. He refuses to budge. The 
           FATAH COMRADE is screaming with impotent rage. He rams 
           the GUN into NAZEEM’s stomach. 

           RUTH watches, hypnotized, as NAZEEM calmly shakes his 
           head. THE FATAH COMRADE - shaking with frustration. 

           RUTH suddenly snaps out of it, she pushes KALID’S 
           TROLLEY between them and into theatre. 

                                 FATAH COMRADE
                        ( Stop!) 

           The FATAH COMRADE swivels. He aims at RUTH’s face.  She 
           stares down the barrel of the gun, she could reach out 
           and touch it. In this heightened reality RUTH is 
           weirdly calm. Her eyes move from the gun to the FATAH 
           COMRADE’s face. He is struggling against tears. 

           Behind RUTH a MALE NURSES un hooks some theatre 
           equipment. NAZEEM watches transfixed. Another MALE 
           NURSE starts cutting off KALID’S clothes. 

           THE FATAH COMRADE is suddenly broken. He can’t fight 
           the whole world. He turns and walks away. NAZEEM looks 
           to RUTH.

                                 NAZEEM
                        Thank you. 

           A look RESPECT passes between them.

           NAZEEM and RUTH, now wearing THEATRE BLUES, operating 
           on KALID’s abdomen. They work in sync, anticipating 
           each other in a wordless professional tango. 

           The THEATRE plunges into near darkness. 

                                 NAZEEM
                        Shit.
                                 RUTH
                        What -

                                 NAZEEM
                        The Israeli’s. They do this. They cut 
                        off the electricity. 

                                 RUTH
                        What about generators?

                                 NAZEEM
                        We’ll have them in a while. 

           A NURSE switches on a FLASH LIGHT. She shines it on 
           KALID. He is struggling. NAZEEM looks to a colleague. 
           An exchange in Arabic.

                                 NAZEEM (CONT’D)
                                (to RUTH)
                        We can’t afford to give him any more 
                        anaesthetic. 

           KALID begins moaning. RUTH, faintly illuminated by the 
           flashlight, leans down. She strokes KALID’s head, 
           brushes his sweat soaked hair. KALID twists in pain. 
           RUTH gazes at him.

           - his young body, so perfect and so violated -  

           RUTH’s fingers grip KALID’s, he continues to struggle. 
           The shield in RUTH falls away, she leans down, placing 
           her cheek against his. 

                                 RUTH
                        Sssh, sssh, it’s alright.

           NAZEEM watches them, CAPTIVATED by this unlikely 
           Madonna and child. 

           A rumbling sound and weak flickering light returns. 

           RUTH jerks up abruptly, as if she’s been caught out and 
           NAZEEM looks away. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Suture?

                                 NAZEEM
                        Yes.

           from it’s incursion, lumbers into final position.

           The HATCH flips open and the Tank Commander ELIAT,  
           emerges with a loud ‘ whoop’, followed by DANIEL.
           ELIAT and DANIEL‘ high five’ as ISABEL approaches.

           ‘fight’ each other in a series of wrestling holds as

                        earned it.

           DANIEL nods along but he would much rather be with 
           ELIAT, nearby, joking about with the rest of the CREW.

           A secluded line of open topped JEEPS. From the sounds

           unlocking the buckle of her belt. ISABEL takes his 
           wrist, slowing his hand. 

           DANIEL’s response is to swiftly unbuckle his own

                        Oh forget it then. 

           DANIEL gets out of the car. 

                                 ISABEL
                        Daniel. 
                                (he pauses)
                        Come back. Come here. 

           ISABEL holds a hand out to DANIEL.

           CUT TO LATER: 

           ISABEL, over DANIEL’s shoulder as he fucks her. She is 
           disturbed and confused - not wanting this impersonal 
           fuck but wanting to give him some comfort.

           LATER STILL : 

           DANIEL, spent. ISABEL, what just happened? DANIEL is 
           still psyched, his breathing fast and anxious. She puts 
           a calming hand on his stomach. 

                                 Isabel (CONT’D)
                        What is it?

                                 Daniel
                        I love you. I just love you so much. 

           ISABEL, trying to get her head around that. 

           INT GAZA/ AL SHIFA HOSPITAL - DAYBREAK 

           A kind of stupor peace; THEATRE is finally empty. A 
           NURSE is slumped in the doorway, sleeping. An ELDERLY 
           CLEANER in black tunic dress and Hijab washes down the 
           floor.  The CALL TO PRAYER floats inside and the 
           ELDERLY CLEANER stops work.

           INT GAZA/ AL SHIFA HOSPITAL/ NAZEEM’s office - DAYBREAK 

           NAZEEM kneels facing MECCA, praying. 
           A dazed RUTH sits at his desk, drinking coffee. She 
           watches NAZEEM pray. Her gaze is gentle, reflective, 
           aware she is sharing something essentially private. 

           NAZEEM finishes. He lights a cigarette. 

                                 NAZEEM
                        No one would guess you hadn’t operated 
                        in years. 

                                 RUTH
                        I thought you’re not meant to smoke?

                                 NAZEEM
                        I may be a Muslim, but I’m also a man. 

           RUTH grins - her gaze lingers on him a beat. 

                                 NAZEEM (CONT’D)
                                (energised)
                        Let me show you something. 

           EXT GAZA BEACH - DAY

           A wide expanse of sea. 

           RUTH and NAZEEM is walking across sand dunes towards 
           the Gaza Bay. RUTH drinking in the clear air and early 
           morning sun, enjoying the wind blowing her hair.

                                 NAZEEM 
                                (exhilarated)
                        The beach is my escape, my freedom. 
                        Without the sea I think I would 
                        implode. Have you noticed there are no 
                        trees in Gaza? 

                                 RUTH
                                (laughs)
                        Umm, can’t think why I haven’t - 

                                 NAZEEM
                        When I was a child there were trees 
                        everywhere, ancient trees stretching 
                        back before the time of the Prophet, 
                        peace be upon him, back to the time of 
                        Christ. The Israeli’s had them cut 
                        down for ‘security reasons.’ They 
                        stole our Olive trees, the trees of 
                        peace. Joanna and Sayed were so 
                        excited about marrying, creating 
                        something new in Gaza, creating hope. 

           NAZEEM catches a sardonic look from RUTH. 
                                 NAZEEM (CONT’D)
                        What? 
                                (pressing)
                        It’s true.

                                 RUTH
                        Life isn’t romantic, you of all people 
                        must know that.

                                 NAZEEM
                        You believe in love.
                                (Ruth scoffs)
                        I can see you do.

                                 RUTH 
                        I’m not eighteen. 

           NAZEEM watches her tenderly as RUTH gazes resolutely 
           out to sea.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Let’s check on Kalid.

           INT GAZA/ AL SHIFA HOSPITAL / WARD - DAY 

           KALID in bed, grinning, bright with excitement, wearing 
           a GREEN HAMAS HEADBAND. Injured HAMAS FIGHTERS lie in 
           the other beds. Armed HAMAS FIGHTERS wearing GREEN 
           HEADBANDS stand around KALID’s bed. His charm and good 
           looks have made him already their MASCOT. 

                                 NAZEEM
                        See? The young are strong. 

           RUTH is smiling at KALID, aware she is a major 
           curiosity among these young men. NAZEEM and KALID have 
           an exchange in Arabic - the HAMAS FIGHTERS laugh but 
           NAZEEM responds sharply.

           KALID grins proudly up at RUTH. 

                                 RUTH
                        What did Kalid say?

           NAZEEM shakes his head. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                                (light)
                        Tell me, go on. 

                                 NAZEEM
                        He says he will get better fast, so he 
                        can kill Jews. 

           RUTH - as if she’s been struck. NAZEEM stares at the 
           floor. KALID is puzzled by the changed vibe. 
                                 RUTH
                        Tell him.

                                 NAZEEM
                        Ruth -

                                 RUTH
                        Tell him I’m a Jew. 

           NAZEEM hesitates, then speaks to KALID who giggles 
           delightedly. He says something to NAZEEM.   

                                 NAZEEM
                                (translating)
                        He says you’re a good person, you 
                        couldn’t be a Jew. 

           RUTH, gripped by a fury. She looks about her, repelled 
           by these MEN with their black T-shirts and massive 
           biceps their ROCKET LAUNCHERS and MACHINE GUNS like 
           peacock feathers. She manages a tight lipped smile to 
           KALID and walks deliberately away. 

                                 NAZEEM (CONT’D)
                                (following)
                        Ruth? Ruth you have to understand.

                                 RUTH
                                (rounding on him)
                        Understand? Fuck understand!? Israel 
                        is a piece of land smaller than Wales! 
                        One safe place in the world! Six 
                        million Jews? Annihilated? 
                                (hurt pride)
                        Olive trees and peace and you teach 
                        him nothing but hate.

                                 NAZEEM
                        That’s not true. 

                                 RUTH
                        Do you teach him why the Jews came 
                        back to Israel? 

                                 NAZEEM 
                        The only Jews Kalid has ever seen are 
                        the soldiers blowing up his house, the 
                        soldiers who shot him. You were there! 
                        He’s never spoken to a Jew except at 
                        the end of a gun. Can you understand 
                        that? In his own country? But you 
                        expect him to care about the 
                        Holocaust? About a sanctuary for the 
                        Jews?

                                 RUTH
                        We are not the Nazis! 
           NAZEEM goes to respond but stops himself. TENSION flies 
           between them. Angry and frustrated with each other they 
           both struggle to find a civil tone. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        I need to go.

                                 NAZEEM 
                        The border is still closed. No one 
                        gets in or out, no supplies, nothing. 

           RUTH could scream at this but NAZEEM hasn’t finished. 

                                 NAZEEM (CONT’D)
                        Joanna’s fridge is hooked up again but 
                        if this blackout continues we’ll have 
                        to cut supply to the morgue, we need 
                        the generators for patients. By 
                        tomorrow morning at the latest. 

                                 RUTH 
                                (cold)
                        I understand. 

           INT GAZA/ UNDERGROUND BUNKER - DAY 

           SAYED is handling the firing mechanism on an AK 47. He 
           is being observed with amusement by a super obese chain 
           smoking GUN DEALER

                                 GUN DEALER
                        ( Where have you been living?)

           The GUN DEALER slides off his stool and waddles over, 
           he adjusts SAYED’s grip and stance on the AK 47. He 
           steps back and nods his approval. He reaches under his 
           massive belly and grips himself -

                        ( Makes your cock hard ay? ) 

           SAYED hands over a pile of DOLLAR BILLS. 

           INT GAZA/ CARNATION PLANT/ TEMPORARY MORGUE - DAY

           RUTH feeling the side of the fridge - it’s wet. At her 
           feet is a pool of water. She looks to the wiring - 
           ancient, taped into a plug hanging lose in its socket. 

           RUTH could explode with the pressure mounting in her. 
           Her mobile rings. She answers. 

                                 ROBERT’S VOICE
                        Ruth! 

           INT LONDON / HEATHROW AIRPORT - DAY 
           ROBERT is coming out of a busy COSTA COFFEE in HEATHROW 
           AIRPORT. 

                                 ROBERT
                        I’ve told Sayed you’re still in Gaza. 
                        No one is getting in or out, we can’t 
                        send anyone into you. 

           CUT TO: ROBERT queuing up in WH SMITHS, surrounded by 
           FAMILIES, TEENAGERS, MEN and WOMEN in suits - an 
           ordinary British morning.  

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        Ruth, I’m pushing for a British Police 
                        Investigation. It’s a lot to ask but 
                        there are no foreign correspondents 
                        left in Gaza, would you do an 
                        interview ? Sayed could film - 

           INT CARNATION PLANT/ TEMPORARY MORGUE - DAY

           RUTH, trying to leave but her path blocked by heaving 
           angry HAMAS SUPPORTERS taking a BODY out to bury. 

                                 ROBERT’S VOICE
                        You’re Joanna’s mother, a British 
                        Citizen trapped in Gaza, trying to 
                        uncover the truth about -

                                 RUTH
                        I’m not part of this madness.

           RUTH snaps off her mobile - the HAMAS supporters are 
           bitterly angry MEN  - but wait - a woman is pushing her 
           way through towards RUTH. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Hanan?

                                 HANAN
                        I heard what happened. Come it’s not 
                        safe for you here. 
                                (holding out a Hijab)
                        There are gangs everywhere, roadblocks 
                        no one knows who is in charge. We need 
                        to get home. 

           RUTH yields and puts on the Hijab.

           EXT GAZA CITY - DAY 

           HANAN and RUTH making their way through fear filled 
           streets, PEOPLE hurry from door way to door way as gun 
           fire crackles about them.
           HANAN and RUTH come upon CROWD of PEOPLE - WOMEN and 
           MEN wailing, crying, HAMAS GUNMEN firing AK 47’s into 
           the air.  HANAN keeps RUTH close. At the centre of the 
           crowd is a burnt out tangle of metal - what was a jeep 
           and the burnt husks of it’s PASSENGERS. 

           A CAR brakes suddenly beside RUTH and HANAN - SAYED, 
           waving them in. They clamber gratefully inside. 

           INT/ EXT SAYED’S CAR/ GAZA STREET - DAY 

           SAYED pulls away, indicating the burnt out car. 

                                 SAYED
                        Israeli are firing rockets, killing 
                        the Hamas leaders. Fatah look like 
                        they’re finished here

           CUT TO MOMENTS LATER: SAYED turns off one road onto an 
           AVENUE - he immediately begins to slow down - 

           The AVENUE is long and deserted - ominously so - smoke 
           drifts from burnt out buildings - a DEAD BODY lies 
           splayed in the middle of the street. 

           RUTH takes in the scene apprehensively, but she’s in 
           their hands. SAYED - wary - the street is silent - it 
           looks like a shooting range. HANAN and SAYED begin to 
           argue in ARABIC - she quickly gets the upper hand. 

                                 HANAN
                                (to Ruth)
                        This is the fastest route home. 

                                 SAYED
                        But this area is still controlled by 
                        Fatah. By Majed Kazi. His men are 
                        heading for the tunnels, to escape-

           HANAN says something else to SAYED. He lets the car 
           roll forward and as he does so he lifts up, from 
           between the two front seats, the AK 47. 

                                 RUTH
                                (stiffens)
                        Sayed?

           SAYED shoves the gun out his window, holding it erect 
           with one hand, driving with the other. 

           RUTH - increasingly alarmed. 

           EXT AVENUE

           SAYED’s car, gingerly progressing down the AVENUE, the 
           AK 47 aloft like a defiant fist. 
           INT CAR

           SAYED reaches a JUNCTION - he inches forward, bent over 
           the wheel, his face wet with sweat, scoping the 
           streets.

           RUTH is even more alarmed when she takes in HANAN - 
           ashen under her dark skin, starting to shake with fear.  
           HANAN grips RUTH’s hand and begins to pray out loud. 

           SAYED stops, wipes sweat from his eyes - he looks in 
           the side mirror - half way down the AVENUE - 

           SAYED noses forward into the JUNCTION - he looks left - 
           A squad of FATAH FIGHTERS milling about  - SAYED blinks 
           - keeps going. He looks back - 

                                 SAYED
                        Look! 

           The FATAH FIGHTERS are discarding their uniforms, 
           undressing in the street, pulling on civilian clothes - 

                                 SAYED (CONT’D)
                        They’re giving up, running away!

           EXT AVENUE

           SAYED’s car crawls across the junction - ignored by the 
           FATAH FIGHTERS.  SAYED picks up speed - 

           A BURST OF GUNFIRE - 

           SAYED floors it - careering down the street followed by 
           gun fire strafing the concrete. 

           RUTH digs herself down onto the floor - pulling, 
           screaming, down beside her.  

           Coming up at the foot of the AVENUE is barricade of 
           corrugated iron sheets - 

           SAYED smashes straight through the barricade - 
           scattering a HERD OF GOATS corralled behind them. He 
           swerves off leaving the GOATS scattering and bleating.

           INT SAYED’S FAMILY BUILDING/ STAIRWELL - TWILIGHT

           SAYED, carrying the AK 47 is hurrying RUTH and up the 
           stairwell to his APARTMENT. 

                                 RUTH 
                        What were you and Joanna thinking of?
           INT SAYED AND JOANNA’S APARTMENT- TWILIGHT

                                 RUTH 
                        Bringing a child into this insanity?

                                 SAYED
                        Joanna was committed -

                                 RUTH
                        Committed, committed to what? Blood 
                        lust, blood letting?

                                 SAYED
                        Maybe if you’d asked her she would 
                        have told you. 

                                 RUTH
                        You haven’t the slightest idea of what 
                        you’re talking about - 
                                (waves away his response)
                        You’re a good looking boy Sayed but my 
                        god you must have something, you must 
                        have something special. 

           SAYED backs off any further confrontation with her. 

           CUT TO: 

           HOURS LATER: SAYED is subdued, cradling the AK 47 - 
           it’s size making him seem more rather than less 
           vulnerable. RUTH watches him, her expression neutral.

                                 SAYED 
                        I told her go straight from Tel Aviv, 
                        to London but no, she wanted to come 
                        back, just a few days. I should have 
                        made her, once she was out, you would 
                        have, you would have made her go?

                                 RUTH
                        Who knows? Maybe I’d be same in your 
                        situation? Maybe I’d fuck anyone to 
                        get out of here? Even a Jew. 

           SAYED - stunned with hurt, near disbelief. 

           RUTH has stunned herself, she knows she’s gone too far, 
           ruptured a part of her own humanity. 

                                 SAYED 
                        Get out. Get out of here.

                        You’re not taking Joanna anywhere, you 
                        don’t deserve her. 

           RUTH buckles inside. 

           EXT GAZA CITY - NIGHT

           RUTH hurrying along a darkened street, she’s shaken and 
           badly scared. 

           A GROUP OF MEN are approaching. RUTH tries desperately 
           to cover her hair with her hands. She turns into some 
           shadows. She presses herself right into a wall. 

           The MEN pass, but in their wake comes a pack of DOGS. 
           Barking, growling. The Dogs surround her. Terrified, 
           RUTH runs, the DOGS chase her. 

           CUT TO: RUTH running through ever more narrow, more 
           confusing  streets. She stops, which way now?  The DOGS 
           are still barking somewhere behind her. RUTH runs on, 
           no idea where she is going. 

           CUT TO: RUTH feeling her way in the MOONLIGHT, as she 
           climbs up over a mound of rubble - a demolished house. 
           There is sudden GUN FIRE nearby, the sounds of feet 
           running. RUTH stumbles in fear, she falls down a rubble 
           embankment to the ground. 

           RUTH lies in the MOONLIGHT, helpless and alone, she 
           burrows into some rubble, seeking to disappear. 

           CUT TO: DARKNESS, other than a faint, ruby glow. 

           RUTH is walking, she passes an ARMCHAIR, a smashed 
           TELEVISION, other bits and pieces of furniture, she is 
           approaching the RUBY EMBERS Of a fire.

           RUTH stands faint illumination provided by the fire. 
           Hair askew, clothes stained and torn, her face 
           bloodied. A FAMILY Lies sleeping nearby and an ELDERLY 
           WOMAN sitting up. 

                                 RUTH
                        Hospital? 
                                (no response)
                        Please, can you, the hospital? 
           RUTH searches the ELDERLY WOMAN’s rheumy eyes. RUTH has 
           a pierce of cloth in her hand, she passes it in front 
           of the ELDERLY WOMAN’s eyes. Nothing. She’s blind. 

           RUTH backs away into the dark. 

           EXT GAZA BEACH - DAYBREAK 

           MIST Comes in off the sea at Gaza at daybreak.  

           MIST swirls about RUTH, the piece of cloth acts as a 
           headscarf, her face is dirty and her clothes are torn. 

           As RUTH walks the mist reveals a brutal landscape of 
           conflict  and violence - rusting rolls of barbed wire, 
           broken concrete, security blocks daubed with graffiti.

           A noise frightens RUTH - something nearby, moving she 
           cannot make out anything or even accurately locate the 
           sound - she turns round and round, disorientated, 
           filling with terror -

           Suddenly a dark ominous presence is upon her, looming 
           out of the darkness - the ARAB STALLION. RUTH laughs 
           with relief, the horse’s long face and mournful brown 
           eyes gazing at her. RUTH feels giddy, near hysterical, 
           she strokes his long gleaming neck like an old friend.

           The BLACK STALLION lumbers off. RUTH carries on, 
           lighter, more hopeful.

           EXT GAZA/ BEACH FRONT - DAY

           In a clearing of aluminium light RUTH sees the HIGH 
           RISES of the beach front. She starts towards them.

           EXT GAZA/ BEACH FRONT/ STREET - DAY

           RUTH, staring -in the burnished metal of a HOT DOG 
           stand is her own shimmering reflection - she can barely 
           recognise herself - hair covered, her face bruised, her 
           stockings torn.  RUTH looks down at her hands - as if 
           they belong to someone else. 

           INT AL SHIFA HOSPITAL - DAYBREAK 

           A HAND holding a COFFEE nudges RUTH awake. She is lying 
           on row of plastic seats. 

           KALID, bare chested, his abdomen swathed in bandages is 
           holding the coffee. Behind him NAZEEM. RUTH smiles 
           wearily at KALID and takes the cup.  

           Nearby, the ELDERLY CLEANER is working. 
                                 RUTH
                        I had no where else to go.

                                 NAZEEM
                        When my sister goes to her in laws in 
                        the south I stay in her apartment. 

                                 RUTH
                        Look, yesterday - 

                                 NAZEEM 
                        You need to rest.

           NAZEEM speaks quickly to the ELDERLY CLEANER and 
           produces a bunch of keys - 

           INT corridor/ NAZEEM’s SISTERS APARTMENT - DAY 

           The ELDERLY CLEANER unlocks a plain black door on a 
           clean, marble floored landing. The door swings door 
           open and she gestures RUTH to go in. 

           INT NAZEEM’s SISTERS APARTMENT - DAY 

           RUTH closes the door, keys in her hand, she hears the 
           lock ‘click’ - blessed relief. 

           RUTH lets herself fall to the floor.  Respite. 

           INT NAZEEM’s SISTERS APARTMENT/ BEDROOM - TWILIGHT

           Almost all the light gone from the room RUTH lying on a 
           wide double bed, her thumb in her mouth, staring.

           NAZEEM, standing on the landing, wearing a good suit. 
           He presses a doorbell and waits. 

           The door opens and NAZEEM looks startled - 

           RUTH wearing a long black tunic dress with gold lacing, 
           her hair hanging wet and shining. 

                                 NAZEEM 
                                (laughs)
                        You look like a good Gaza wife. 

                                 RUTH
                        Except for the hair.

           As he steps inside RUTH takes in the suit, the effort 
           he’s taken. She looks after NAZEEM and is for a moment 
           stricken, not with anguish or grief but a new hunger. 
           INT APARTMENT 

           NAZEEM, at a breakfast bar, taking food from a bag. 
           RUTH watches him from the living room.

                        Humous, tomatoes, bread. This a feast.

                        Cola, but alcohol is forbidden - 

           NAZEEM produces a treasured bottle of Scotch Whiskey. 

           EXT BALCONY/ SISTERS APARTMENT - NIGHT

           RUTH and NAZEEM sit on plastic chairs, at a low table 
           covered with the remains of a meal. The balcony looks 
           out onto the vast darkness of the sea. The apartment is 
           in darkness. The only illumination is moonlight. 

                                 NAZEEM 
                        What happened with Sayed?

                                 RUTH
                        He told me to leave. I said some 
                        things I shouldn’t have. 

           A long pause. RUTH appears locked into herself.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        He’s bought a gun.

                                 NAZEEM
                        Sayed?

                        A Kalashnikov. 

           NAZEEM is obviously concerned but then a ‘ what can you 
           do shrug.’ 

                                 NAZEEM 
                        We don’t recognise ourselves. Living 
                        in this cage. Ten years ago I had 
                        never see a gun except in Israeli 
                        hands. Then came Oslo and guns, guns 
                        guns. Gun culture is like a cancer.

           RUTH is drinking in NAZEEM, his dark eyes, the timbre 
           of his voice.

                        hope. I see it in their eyes, their 
                        dreams are only of death.

                        You did what you thought was right. 

                                 RUTH
                        No. As long as I hadn’t told Joanna it 
                        wasn’t so real, not for me, not for 
                        Simon. I thought, I believed, one day 
                        she would forgive me. 

           RUTH  - but not now. 

                                 NAZEEM 
                        To the rest of the world Palestinians 
                        aren’t real people, our pain has no 
                        value, Joanna understood that, she 
                        knew we’d become pictures in a bad 
                        news story. The other night with 
                        Kalid, Joanna would have been proud of 
                        you. 

                                 RUTH
                                (shrugs)
                        I’m a doctor. 

                                 NAZEEM
                        No. That night you were a mother. 

           RUTH looks up, startled, at NAZEEM.

           NAZEEM, looks about, cautiously, as he leaves the 
           APARTMENT BUILDING. His heart sinks as he spots the 
           ELDERLY CLEANER from the hospital. 

           She has seen him and glances up at the apartment. Their 
           eyes meet again, NAZEEM abashed. She gives him a broad 
           wink. He grins.

           one of NAZEEM and what must be his WIFE and SON. 

           RUTH takes in a COMPUTER in a study area. She looks

           RUTH working at NAZEEM’s SISTERS computer. 

           She accesses her email account.

           HER INBOX is crammed with NEW MAIL.

           RUTH attacks her mail second nature efficiency. She 
           deletes, she makes brief replies.

           RUTH freezes - an email marked JOANNA. She stares in 
           disbelief. JOANNA @ hotmail. It includes an attachment. 
           RUTH steels herself. She opens the attachment.

           A VIDEO STREAM, loading. 

           RUTH the waiting feels unbearable. 

           THE VIDEO STREAM - first there is sound,  a deep 
           rhythmic groaning, then picture, a grainy black and 
           white image - an 

           ULTRA SOUND SCAN. 

           A FOETUS pulsating, floating in its WOMB. 

           A cry escapes RUTH. The foetus heart beat is fast and 
           strong. RUTH is transfixed, drinking it in. The 
           HEARTBEAT suddenly STOPS.

           RUTH flinches, she looks away, as if the FOETUS has 
           died in front of her eyes. 
           A long beat. RUTH is startled by JOANNA’s disembodied 
           voice, tinny, electronic - but JOANNA - 

                                 JOANNA’S VOICE

                                 RUTH
                        Oh Jo. 

           RUTH touches JOANNA’S digital face, her own cheeks wet 
           with tears - 

                                 JOANNA’S VOICE
                        I love you mum. I’ll see you soon.

                        Joanna....

           RUTH - grief streaming out of her - but with the ease 
           of the FORGIVEN.

           RUTH, sitting, her hands smoothing her suit. Adjusting 
           her blouse as best she can. She is calm, composed. 
           Satisfied, RUTH lifts her mobile and begins to dial.

           An ASSISTANT is brushing up shattered glass. RUTH picks 
           her way across to a chair. She sits down -  a CAMERA is 
           trained on her. RUTH looks up sharply as a door opens -

           SATED steps inside. He doesn’t meet RUTH’s eye.

           PAUL looks to ROBERT, appalled.

                        Was her death as result of safety 
                        failings or an attempt to silence her -

                        face, without a name, someone with 
                        power, with an agenda, someone in

                        Cairo. Someone in Washington or

                        served - by killing. I’m not a 
                        journalist. I can’t tell you his name.

           to lose it.

           SAYED looks up from behind the camera - his eyes meet 
           RUTH’s - her face wet with tears. SAYED gently shakes

           INT ARIEL’S SETTLEMENT HOME - NIGHT

           A table is set for Shabbat dinner. ARIEL’s WIFE is 
           lighting the Shabbat candle. To one side ARIEL sits 
           watching the television news, along with ISABEL and a 
           self conscious DANIEL. The news item causes ARIEL’S 
           WIFE to pause - 

           ON SCREEN: RUTH - 

                                 RUTH
                        The tank was shooting at civilians, 
                        children and old people. 

           ARIEL voids his face of any expression, staring fixedly 
           at the screen. As RUTH continues DANIEL does that same 
           but in a more obvious, self conscious fashion. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        I treated one child myself, ten years 
                        old, shot by an Israeli tank machine 
                        gun. He had been throwing stones. 

           ISABEL appears frozen, staring at the floor. All three 
           are determined to avoid any eye contact - one can 
           almost see the walls between them. 
                                 ARIEL’S WIFE
                        Ariel, it’s almost dark. 

           ARIEL flicks off the television with a remote. He 
           stands up. So do ISABEL and DANIEL. ARIEL indicates to 
           them to go ahead - 

                                 ARIEL
                        Please, come through. 

           As DANIEL turns towards the kitchen area ARIEL claps a 
           hand onto his back. 

           INT ARIEL’S HOUSE / BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           ARIEL is very gently making love to his WIFE - he 
           attempts to enter her but she resists - he pauses - 

                                 ARIEL
                        What is it? 

           ARIEL’S WIFE’s chest is heavily bandaged, she has had a 
           full mastectomy. 

                                 ARIEL (CONT’D)
                        I love you. 

                                 ARIEL’S WIFE
                        It’s not you. I can’t bear to look at 
                        myself. 

           ARIEL soothes and kisses her, lies back down on  his 
           side and holds her to him, her breathing is shallow and 
           fast. He kisses her gently and she slowly settles. 

                                 ARIEL’S WIFE (CONT’D)
                        Daniel was there, in Jabaliya. 

                                 ARIEL
                        I know. Don’t think about it. This is 
                        what the Arabs make us do. They drag 
                        us down. 

                                 ARIEL’S WIFE
                                (not convinced)
                        Sometimes I think we’ve lost our soul. 

           ARIEL and his WIFE lie awake in the dark.  

           INT CARNATION PLANT/ TEMPORARY MORGUE - DAY

           Dawn is filtering through slatted windows, casting a 
           speckled light over silent BODIES, wrapped and bound in 
           WHILE MUSLIN and resting on steel drying tables -
           RUTH, and SAYED’S MOTHER are cleaning JOANNA ‘s body, 
           They work together cleaning off bits of dirt, dried 
           blood, iodine stains and so on. There is a quality both 
           painful and soothing to ritual. 

           Along the tables other FAMILIES do the same, here and 
           there a cacophony of crying and keening erupts.

           JOANNA’s face, ashen, still, RUTH lifts a gauze flap 
           and, giving her a last kiss, closes it over her face. 

           INT ARIEL’S HOUSE - DAY 

           DANIEL waiting in JEEP as ARIEL says goodbye to ISABEL.

                        Your mum’s tired, let her sleep. 

           ARIEL kisses ISABEL. He watches her walk to the JEEP  
           and jump in. 

           ARIEL waves to DANIEL and ISABEL - he watches after 
           them a long beat. 

           INT CARNATION PLANT/ TEMPORARY MORGUE - DAY

           SAYED and various MALE FAMILY MEMBERS lift JOANNA, 
           wrapped in white cotton, high up on their shoulders. 

           RUTH reaches out with a desperate incredulity as the 
           MEN carry JOANNA towards the door. Suddenly, RUTH and 
           SAYED’s MOTHER cry out against the unthinkable - JOANNA 
           has passed out the door - she’s gone. 

           EXT GAZA/ ROAD TO THE MUSLIM CEMETERY - DAY

           people wave posters of a MARTYR.

           JOANNA, passes, a cotton figurine, carried high in the 
           MEN’s hands. RUTH her hair uncovered, is the only WOMAN 
           in the funeral march, 

           Dizzy with strain of it all RUTH stumbles, NAZEEM 
           catches her arm, steadies her and releases her. 

           RUTH carries on. 

           EXT GAZA/ CEMETERY - DAY 

           A SHEIK is closing a copy of the KORAN and walking away 
           from the grave side in a windswept MUSLIM CEMETERY. 
           RUTH and SAYED sit by the grave covered in a mound of 
           ROCKS. In the distance NAZEEM, some STRAGGLING MEN  and 
           the WOMEN MOURNERS at the cemetery entrance. 

           SAYED looks up at a DRONE flying overhead.

                                 SAYED
                        They’ve a new photograph by now -

                        Spies will come at night and check the 
                        grave, we’re not hiding guns, digging 
                        a tunnel. 

                                 RUTH 
                        What will you do now?

                                 SAYED
                                (shrugs)
                        Back to work. I have the only salary, 
                        for all the family. 

           RUTH watches SAYED with concern. She goes to say 
           something but hesitates. As she considers NAZEEM 
           approaches - 

                                 NAZEEM
                        The border is open. Two French 
                        Journalists have been allowed through. 
                        You should take your chance straight 
                        away. 

           RUTH looks from NAZEEM to SAYED - again she considers 
           saying something.

                                 NAZEEM (CONT’D)
                        We should hurry. 

           RUTH and SAYED stand. She looks back to the grave, 
           caught by the parting. A CAR engine revvs up nearby. 
           RUTH kisses her fingertips and quickly presses them to 
           the ground.

           SAYED’s car driving on a narrow road. SAYED at the 
           wheel, HANAN and his MOTHER are in the back seat. 

           SAYED slips on a CD of ANCIENT ARABIC singing.

           INT/ EXT YELLOW TAXI/ GAZA / CEMETERY ROAD - DAY

           RUTH sits turned slightly to face NAZEEM in the back 
           seat of a yellow Gaza taxi. 
           NAZEEM is staring ahead, strangely formal. He is 
           intensely aware of the DRIVER snatching glances at RUTH 
           in the rear view mirror. 

           RUTH is puzzled by NAZEEM’s stiffness, catches the 
           DRIVER’s curiosity and gets the picture. She places her 
           hand on the seat, near but not touching NAZEEM.

                                 NAZEEM
                                (heavily)
                        With Hamas winning a great victory we 
                        now have an Islamic government. 

                                 RUTH 
                        We should keep in touch, the two 
                        hospitals, we could work on a project 
                        together. 

                                 NAZEEM
                        I’d like that very much. 

           RUTH, her heart goes out to NAZEEM, he is all bottled 
           up but clearly finds this parting painful. 

                                 RUTH 
                                (suddenly)
                        We forgot a tree.

                                 NAZEEM
                        Huh?

                                 RUTH
                        I wanted to plant one, an olive tree, 
                        at the grave. 

           NAZEEM turns to RUTH with a smile. 

                                 NAZEEM 
                        I’ll find one.

           SAYED, driving, spacing off to the forlorn music. 

           A BLACK HUMMER

           suddenly 

           RAMS

           the front side of 

           SAYED’S CAR

           sending it spinning.

           SAYED 
           ricochets inside like crash test dummy. HANAN and 
           SAYED’s MOTHER are thrown, screaming, on top of each 
           other

           THE HUMMER

           with smoked windows it looks like a malevolent machine 
           as it 

           REVERSES

           and 

           SMASHES SAYED’S CAR

           against a low wall. 

           SAYED

           is confused, disorientated, his head bleeding - he 
           fumbles between the seats and lifts up his AK 47 

           MASKED MEN wearing jeans and T-shirts are out of HUMMER 
           and ripping open his car door - a gun barrel rams into 
           the back of SAYED’s head knocking him near unconscious. 
           A MASKED MAN  rips the K 47 from his hand. 

           HANAN is screaming as SAYED is pulled out of the car, 
           along the ground - his own AK 47 at his throat - HANAN 
           Clambers out of the car - she is dragged back by 
           SAYED’S MOTHER, wailing as - 

           SAYED is thrown up into THE HUMMER, it’s rear doors 
           open - 

           SAYED’S POV:

           MASKED MEN piling in cutting out the daylight with 
           their muscular bodies, black boots and black combats -  

                                 SAYED 
                        ( I haven’t done anything!)

           The doors slam shut - 

           DARKNESS

           MASKED GUN MEN, AK 47’s trained on SAYED’S CAR, pile 
           into the BLACK HUMMER which takes off as we 

           CUT TO 

           The YELLOW TAXI Rounding a corner and BRAKING HARD. 

                                 RUTH
                        Oh no. 
           RUTH’S POV: SAYED’s CAR abandoned, doors splayed open,  
           HANAN standing, helpless, disbelieving. RUTH and NAZEEM 
           leap out of the car. NAZEEM is talking to HANAN. RUTH 
           taking in SAYED’S MOTHER - her UTTER DESPAIR in face of 
           the empty car - 

           RUTH sees at fresh blood stains in the cinnamon earth. 
           Her eyes search the silent desolate landscape as if it 
           could give her an answer - 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Please God. 

           NAZEEM shouts RUTH back to the taxi.

           THE BLACK HUMMER, racing along an street in the centre 
           of the city. It makes a sharp turn into a LONG 
           BOULEVARD only it is a sea of GREEN FLAGS - a victory 
           march by HAMAS.

           THE BLACK HUMMER does a violent HANDBRAKE TURN which 
           throws SAYED about the floor, where he lies arms tied 
           behind his back. THE BLACK HUMMER shoots off down a 
           more narrow AVENUE. 

           INT YELLOW TAXI - DAY

           NAZEEM, in the front passenger seat is directing the 
           worried DRIVER rapidly. Squashed together in the back 
           seat are SAYED’S MOTHER and RUTH - on her mobile. 

                                 RUTH
                                (shouting)
                        Sayed! Yes Sayed, kidnapped - 

           HANAN wonders who she could be calling

                                 RUTH
                        No not by Hamas - 
                                (listens)
                        Surely there’s someone you can talk 
                        to? 

           NAZEEM - catches  that. He turns, looking back to RUTH 
           with concern. HANAN’S uneasy gaze catches NAZEEM’S - ’ 
           who is RUTH talking to?

           INT SECURITY 

           ARIEL, also on a mobile, hunched, focused, staring at a

                        Who could we talk to? 
           ARIEL’S eyes are following the red dot travelling the 
           maze like map on his screen. 

                                 ARIEL (CONT’D)

           RUTH, frustrated - she’s lost the line.

                                 NAZEEM
                        Who were you talking to?

           matter.’

           HIS POV: A ROAD BLOCK up ahead, manned by HAMAS MILITIA 
           in grey blue combats - THE DRIVER panics, tries to 
           reverse - he’s jammed tight, tries to turn. OTHER

           ARIEL emerges from the SECURITY CENTRE, and starts out

           A HAMAS FIGHTER is walking towards the disturbance, AK 
           47 prepped, a radio on his chest.

           A SECOND HAMAS FIGHTER shadows him. The BLACK HUMMER 
           DRIVER sees them. Freaks.

           THE BLACK HUMMER reverses violently, ramming a small 
           CAR  HAMAS FIGHTERS Run forward yelling, RADIO’s going 
           crazy THE HUMMER runs the smaller car off the road - 

           SAYED  and his CAPTORS are thrown about inside the 
           HUMMER which takes off, HAMAS FIGHTERS firing after it. 

           EXT GAZA REFUGEE CAMP - DAY 

           THE BLACK HUMMER tearing through narrow winding streets 
           at breakneck speed. It passes a junction - 

           THE DRIVER checks - no pursuit. Another junction - 
           nothing.  

           A real rocking CAR CHASE through as refugee camp ending 
           with the BLACK HUMMER crashing through a bombed out 
           building, topsiding and smashing into a wall - 
           scattering a herd of GOATS. 

           SAYED is among a tangle of bodies, his KIDNAPPERS, 
           screaming for mercy as the SMOKED WINDOWS explode under 
           GUN BARRELS.  

           In a shard of light SAYED’S bruised, bleeding face.

           A BEDOIN FAMILY watch with the blank eyes of utter 
           resignation as HAMAS FIGHTERS line up the KIDNAPPERS at 
           gun point

           SAYED is being dragging from the HUMMER, through a 
           shattered window. 

           INT FORMER PALESTINIAN SECURITY BUILDING - DAY 

           RUTH is walking towards us, tense, scared, but 
           determined to recover SAYED. YOUNG HAMAS FIGHTERS are 
           ransacking OFFICES, rifling files, smashing open locked 
           cabinets. 

           HAMAS FIGHTERS, their masks off, PHOTOGRAPH each other, 
           on mobile phones, too excited to notice or care about 
           this Western woman. 
           RUTH walks among YOUNG MEN posing with guns, delighting 
           in the iconic revolutionary stance of the AK 47 held 
           upright off the hip.  She passes offices with BOYS 
           swivelling on ‘ executive ‘ chairs, feet up on desks. 

           RUTH sees the person she is looking for - RAJA, in a 
           SENIOR PA OFFICIAL’S OFFICE, his back to her, talking 
           to some OLDER HAMAS FIGHTERS. She hurries forward. 

           As she nears RAJA RUTH sees, SAYED.

                                 RUTH
                        Oh thank God. 

           SAYED, smiling at RUTH. RAJA turns around.

                        Doctor, you’re just in time. 

           RUTH stands in the doorway.

                        Please, come in. 

           INT SENIOR PA OFFICIAL’S OFFICE

           RUTH steps into the office. She takes in the HAMAS 
           FIGHTERS these are MEN, experienced, tough, 
           unemotional, and RAJA is clearly the one in charge. 

                                 RAJA 
                        We rescued Sayed from the criminals, 
                        but we have something else for you. 

           RAJA indicates to RUTH to look, she turns -  MAJED KAZI 
           is being wheeled along the corridor towards them, tied 
           to an office chair. RUTH flinches as she takes in 
           MAJED’s light coloured suit, drenched with blood, his 
           face purple and swollen, he is barely conscious. 

                                 RAJA (CONT’D)
                        This is the man who hired Sayed’s 
                        kidnappers.  

           MAJED’S eyes roll about in their bruised sockets, 
           bloodshot and bovine, they finally settle on RUTH but 
           she has regained her self control, well aware of what a 
           dangerous place she has found herself. 

                                 RAJA (CONT’D)
                        He is also the man who had your 
                        daughter killed. 

           RUTH registers the information but gives no reaction. 
           She continues staring, unblinking, at MAJED.  
                                 RAJA (CONT’D)
                        Majed Kazi was as senior security 
                        official, trained by your governments 
                        advisors. He is also an Israeli 
                        collaborator. Joanna discovered more 
                        about him, 
                                (Ruth flinches at the 
                                name)
                        this piece of shit - the money he 
                        makes from smuggling drugs and guns 
                        into Gaza, organising prostitutes.

           Behind MAJED, in the corridor, the heady atmosphere of 
           liberation continues. 

                                 RAJA (CONT’D)
                        Majed has confessed he had Joanna 
                        killed to stop her releasing the 
                        evidence. We video’d his confession.

           SAYED staring venomously at MAJED

                                 RAJA (CONT’D)
                        Huh?

           MAJED looks up RAJA. He nods. RUTH that intense, 
           forensic stare, drinking in her daughters’s killer -  

           A bullet explodes into MAJED’s face, sending him 
           swivelling backwards, tumbling sideways, still tied to 
           the chair, on to the floor - 

           RUTH jumps with fright. 

           The CORRIDOR stills - YOUNG HAMAS, stopped in their 
           tracks, stare, they look from MAJED’s body to RAJA,   
           calmly holding a revolver and his own MEN unmoved. 

                                 SAYED
                        Good. 

           MAJED lies awkwardly, blood pooling from his head. 
           Nearby lies a framed photograph of ARAFAT, glass 
           shattered.

                                 RAJA 
                        It’s done. Your daughter was a very 
                        courageous young woman. I’m sorry we 
                        couldn’t do more.

                        Thank you.

           a video tape. 

                                 RAJA
                        There’s Majed’s confession. We still 
                        have to find out the details of what 
                        Joanna discovered. We looked at her 
                        laptop -

                                 SAYED
                        She had a hotmail address, Ruth found 
                        it. I’ll try to access it and see.

           RAJA shrugs, ‘there you go’. They have reached the 
           entrance. 

                                 RAJA
                        Things will be calmer now but I’ll 
                        arrange safe transport to the border.

                        People will do anything to live.

           INT TEL AVIV HOSPITAL - DAY 

           ARIEL leads a team of FEMALE and MALE AGENTS and a long 
           haired CIVILIAN TECHNICIAN into the reception area of a 
           modern TEL AVIV HOSPITAL  - more like a shopping mall. 

                                 ARIEL
                        For her to open a hotmail account she 
                        needed access to another computer.

                                 COLLEAGUE
                        There aren’t any Internet Cafe’s in 
                        Gaza.
                                 ARIEL
                        Correct but we know she had an 
                        appointment here four days ago. 

           ARIEL slows, looking around the RECEPTION - cafes, 
           newsagents, a card shop and a travel agents - several 
           PREGNANT WOMEN. 

                                 ARIEL (CONT’D)
                                (back on the move)
                        She returned to the border after only 
                        two hours so she didn’t have a lot of - 

           ARIEL stops sharply - tucked away behind the Travel 
           Agents is an INTERNET CAFE. 

                                 ARIEL (CONT’D)
                        Time. 

           ARIEL’s TEAM, talking into radio’s and cells are 
           already walking into the CAFE, flashing badges. 

           INT TEL AVIV HOSPITAL/INTERNET CAFE - DAY 

           ARIEL, watching his AGENTS at each computer terminal 
           working the keyboards with machine like efficiency. 

           CUT TO

           Above each screen is a WEB CAM and racing down the 
           screen are fish eye image after image of PREVIOUS USERS 
           flashing past - mainly women but some men, in intense 
           close up - 

           A FEMALE AGENT  stops and calls out in Hebrew. ARIEL 
           goes to her, he leans in to study an image

           ON THE WEB CAM CLOSE UP 

           JOANNA, wearing the same clothes as in her message to 
           RUTH, keying in information, studying her screen.  

           ARIEL, excited, he waves over the waiting TECHNICIAN.

           INT GAZA/ AL SHIFA HOSPITAL/ WARD  - DAY 

           KALID is clambering up onto a YOUNG MAN’s bed and using 
           a a Stethoscope to ‘listen’ to his heart.

                                 NAZEEM 
                        My new assistant.

           NAZEEM smiles at RUTH -  full of suppressed urgency. 
                                 NAZEEM (CONT’D)
                        Kalid says now that he’s been shot he 
                        doesn’t want to get shot again - he 
                        wants to make sick people better. 

           RUTH smiles. NAZEEM, surrounded by his patients looks 
           her directly in the eye. 

                                 NAZEEM (CONT’D)
                        Good luck.  

           RUTH looks about - trying to signal ‘will we go 
           somewhere?’ NAZEEM doesn’t respond. 

                                 RUTH 
                        Well - 

           RUTH moves to kiss NAZEEM but a perceptible energy 
           tells her stop - he holds out his hand. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Goodbye. 

           RUTH and NAZEEM shake hands. 

           RUTH walks past curious INJURED FIGHTERS, down to KALID 
           - she is suddenly on the verge of tears. She leans down 
           and kisses KALID on the head. 

                                 KALID
                                (busy playing)
                        Bye doctor. 

           RUTH crosses to the door - she slows for a look back 
           along the length of the ward to NAZEEM, watching her, 
           their EYES LOCK, longing for some more TIME. 

           RUTH walks out of the WARD. 

           EXT AL SHIFA HOSPITAL - DAY 

           RUTH walks out of the hospital reception. SAYED is 
           scuffing his heels on the pavement. RUTH steels herself 
           for another parting. SAYED looks up at her approach. 
           They both smile wanly. 

                                 RUTH
                        So?

                                 SAYED
                        You haven’t much time. 

           RUTH doesn’t reply, she studies SAYED, he’s hurting but 
           cannot look her in the eye. 
                                 SAYED (CONT’D)
                        I can get you a taxi, or of you want 
                        go with Hamas? 

           RUTH takes the plunge - 

                                 RUTH
                        I could help you take up your 
                        scholarship.
                                (Sayed - he can’t grasp)
                        There will be insurance money from 
                        Joanna, you can still support your 
                        family. 

                                 SAYED
                        They’ll never let me out. 

                                 RUTH
                        Come to the border, with me. 

                                 SAYED
                        I’m trapped here. 

           An in the heat and noise, the traffic all around them 
           it does feel like trapped. 

                                 RUTH
                        What have you to lose? Come with me 
                        and see what I can do?

           SAYED looking at RUTH, pain in his eyes, it seems 
           almost cruel to dangle this - he seems to despair.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Sayed please, let me try this for you.

           INT TEL AVIV HOSPITAL/INTERNET CAFE - DAY

           ARIEL crouched at the shoulder of the CIVILIAN 
           TECHNICIAN  - working with a laconic ease, despite the 
           urgency all around him.  

                                 CIVILIAN TECHNICIAN
                                (American)
                        This is her hotmail account. She’s a 
                        lot of files stored on line. 

                                 ARIEL
                        Can you get access? 

                                 CIVILIAN TECHNICIAN
                        I already have. 

           ON SCREEN a file opens up - STILL IMAGES. COVERT 
           PHOTOGRAPHY of HAMAS LEADERS. 
                                 ARIEL
                        Okay.

           Another file. 

                                 CIVILIAN TECHNICIAN
                        This a piece of video -
                                (closer look)
                        Most likely from a cell phone.

                                 ARIEL
                        Go on.

           The CIVILIAN TECHNICIAN clicks on and the video plays -

           ON SCREEN ;  

           SAMERA, close up, in a dimly lit room. The shot feels 
           accidental, she is fidgeting checking if the camera is 
           working -  

           THE SHOT WIDENS -

           SAMERA is wearing a black bra

           THE PHONE CAMERA MOVES

           Among swatches of blurred light and darkness it picks 
           out elements of a HOTEL room, MIRROR, a BED, then a 
           CRACK OF LIGHT, a doorway. 

           The camera steadies, through a half open door, a MAN is 
           sitting on a sofa. 

           THE CIVILIAN TECHNICIAN leans in closer to the screen, 
           then looks up, grinning, to a grim faced ARIEL. 

                                 ARIEL (CONT’D)
                        Don’t try to be funny.

           ON SCREEN:  

           Ariel, talking to someone who cannot be seen. The 
           camera POV moves in a little closer. Ariel stands up. 

           INTERNET CAFE 

           ARIEL, the FEMALE AGENT, even the CIVILIAN TECHNICIAN, 
           watch on the edge of their seats - it’s as if Fatima is 
           about to be discovered. 

           ON SCREEN:

           Ariel holds out his hand and into the light steps RAJA.

                                 ARIEL (CONT’D)
                        Shit.
           Raja and Ariel ON SCREEN shake hands.  

           ARIEL turns on his heel and walks out. 

           EXT SAYED’S FAMILY’S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           RUTH stands with a YELLOW TAXI, waiting for SAYED. The 
           mourning tent has gone, the streets are quiet, a sense 
           of normality returning. 

           SAYED, emerges from the stairwell, carrying his camera 
           bag. He walks towards RUTH. From a balcony HANAN and 
           SAYED’s mother wave to RUTH. She waves back. SAYED 
           reaches RUTH just as - 

           JEEPS sweep into the courtyard and MASKED HAMAS 
           FIGHTERS pour out and surround them. 

                                 YOUNG HAMAS
                        Stay. You stay, wait here. 

           CUT TO LATER: RUTH and SAYED wait, scared, surrounded 
           by the YOUNG HAMAS FIGHTERS. 

                                 SAYED
                        (She has to get to the border, it’ll 
                        be closed soon.) 

           The HAMAS ignore him. 

           A JEEP stops across the street. RUTH and SAYED can see 
           RAJA talking to some HAMAS. Casually, he glances in 
           their direction, he waves them over.

           CUT TO: RUTH and SAYED, very apprehensive, cross over.

                                 RAJA
                                (smiling, friendly)
                        Hey. I’ll take you to the border 
                        myself. Jump in. Come - 

           RUTH and SAYED, uneasy, scared, but with no option - 
           RUTH starts into the jeep.

           EXT/INT GAZA REFUGEE CAMP/ HAMAS JEEP - DAY

           RUTH, pumping with adrenaline, is crushed between YOUNG 
           HAMAS FIGHTERS, their faces masked, in the back seat.

                                 RAJA
                        (How could she open this account 
                        without you knowing?)

           SAYED, in the front seat, is PETRIFIED. 
                                 SAYED
                        ( I don’t know.)

           INT EREZ CROSSING POINT/ MILITARY BASE - DAY 

           ARIEL is on a mobile in, in a MILITARY JEEP  and it 
           curves into the MILITARY BASE. 

                                 ARIEL
                        There’s footage of Raja meeting me, 
                        surveillance photos he took of other 
                        Hamas leaders, it’s all out there. 

           The JEEP brakes and ARIEL gets seamlessly out and 
           starts towards a concrete PILL BOX. 

           INT EREZ MILITARY BASE/ BUNKER - DAY 

           ARIEL, still on his call, is striding down a concrete 
           tunnel in a MILITARY BUNKER.

                                 ARIEL
                        He’s out of control if you ask me. He 
                        had this journalist killed to stop her 
                        but if this film gets out we’ll be 
                        linked to her killing. 
                                (beat)
                        The television people are calling for 
                        a British Police investigation. 

           INT EREZ MILITARY BASE/ CONTROL ROOM - DAY 

           ARIEL, strides into a CONTROL ROOM manned entirely by  
           MILITARY - still on his mobile. 

                                 ARIEL 
                        It’s invaluable having a man inside 
                        Hamas but Raja’s compromised. 

           ARIEL immediately takes up a seat at a control panel - 
           like a sound board - beside a SENIOR OFFICER. He is 
           listening to the mobile but with one eye on complex 
           screen - like Air Traffic control. 

                                 ARIEL (CONT’D)
                        I’d say fatally. 

           ARIEL listens a beat and lowers the phone, all the time 
           focusing on two stationary red dots north of GAZA city.

                                 ARIEL (CONT’D)
                        What’s he stopping for? 
           EXT GAZA NORTHERN ROAD - DAY 

           RAJA’s JEEP is stopped - his YOUNG HAMAS FIGHTERS 
           protect it, bristling with vigilance. 

           RAJA stands a little away from the JEEP, facing RUTH 
           and SAYED, a pistol in his hand. 

                                 RAJA
                        You think they’ll let you through? 
                        When they don’t let anyone else? Why 
                        should they? Huh? Why should the 
                        Israeli’s let you go? Huh? 

           RAJA mobile rings. He answers.

           INT EREZ MILITARY BASE/ CONTROL ROOM - DAY 

           ARIEL, watching the screen dots as he speaks. 

                                 ARIEL
                        There’s nothing in the account. 
                        Nothing to worry about. Some personal 
                        stuff, that’s all. Stuff she didn’t 
                        want him to know about. 

           NORTHERN ROAD

           RAJA, listening intently. Instinctively RUTH knows her 
           fate hangs on this call. She looks away from RAJA to 
           the ARAB STALLION, ploughing nearby but a world away.

           MILITARY BUNKER

           ARIEL watches the two red dots. They begin to separate. 
           He looks to the SENIOR OFFICER sitting beside him. 

                                 SENIOR OFFICER
                        Okay?

           ARIEL stares at the screen - the TWO moving red dots. 

           EXT EREZ / BORDER CROSSING - TWILIGHT

           SAYED and RUTH stumbling forward, giddy at their 
           escape. Ahead, in the gathering TWILIGHT are the lights 
           of the EREZ CROSSING POINT. 

                                 SAYED
                        Twilight is the worst time to cross. 

                                 RUTH
                        This is our chance. Come on. I can see 
                        the lights. 

           RUTH and SAYED step out into NO MAN’S LAND. 
           SAYED freezes at the sight of a MERKAVA TANK sitting 
           squat and ominous. Sensing he is about to run RUTH 
           grabs his arm. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        There’s no other way. 

           RUTH and SAYED walk on, deeper into NO MAN’S LAND. The 
           TANK TURRET swivels - holding them in it’s sights.

           DANIEL

           watching RUTH and SAYED like stick figures making their 
           way through the twilight. 

           NO MAN’S LAND 

           RUTH and SAYED, gaining confidence, speeding up - 
           suddenly there is an INTENSE SCREAMING SOUND - 

           A GUIDED MISSILE tears down from the darkening sky - a 
           bullet of light like an AVENGING ANGEL - 

           NORTHERN ROAD 

           RAJA turns - the HAMAS FIGHTERS jump - the MISSILE 
           devastates the jeep - immolating RAJA in a tangle of 
           burning metal and rubber.

           TWO HAMAS FIGHTERS roll clear and immediately aim an 
           RPG and M I6 towards the border crossing - 

           NO MAN’S LAND 

           RUTH and SAYED are thrown to the ground as an RPG 
           ROCKET explodes near the MERKAVA TANK - 

           - the entire wasteland is lit up bright as a football 
           pitch by fluorescent white SECURITY LIGHTING. 

           RUTH and SAYED

           lie hugging the earth as bullets and rockets rain over 
           them - 

           HAMAS FIGHTERS

           run, firing towards the crossing - 

           INT TANK 

           DANIEL

           fires back - 

           RUTH and SAYED
           are two figures at the bottom of his screen - his TANK 
           COMMANDER is shouting orders to advance - 

           SAYED and RUTH

           terrified, digging into the earth as the gun battle 
           rages over them - 

           SAYED

           starts to wriggle back towards GAZA - 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                                (grabs his arm)
                        No!

                                 SAYED
                        You go.

                                 RUTH
                        I’m not leaving you here. 

           RUTH’s hand grips SAYED’s, dragging him towards her. 
           It’s soon too much. She tires The TANK is advancing 
           towards them. RUTH and SAYED’s eyes lock. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        You’re my family now. 

           SAYED pulls on RUTH’s hand and drags himself to his 
           feet. 

           INT TANK 

           DANIEL

           IN HIS SIGHTS : RUTH and SAYED running 

           DANIEL

           Fires....

           NO MANS LAND  

           RUTH and SAYED look back at a high pitched screaming 
           sound - the ARAB STALLION running, berserk, bullets 
           ripping through the air - he rears up, his magnificent 
           muscles coiling, glistening in the WHITE SECURITY 
           LIGHT, his eyes huge and wild with terror. 

           Bullets tear into the STALLION. 

           RUTH AND SAYED watch mesmerised as: 

           IN SLOW MOTION 
           The STALLION falls back onto his powerful hind legs. He 
           struggles to stand - legs kicking at air, his powerful 
           back arching and thrashing as BULLETS serrate his body. 

           RUTH and SAYED their faces wet with tears.

           The STALLION keels to one side, his eyes seem to be 
           staring at them, uncomprehending, frenzied with pain, 
           dying in an ever widening pool of blood. 

           EXT MUSLIM CEMETERY - TWILIGHT

           NAZEEM and KALID are watering a small freshly planted 
           cutting - an OLIVE TREE. 

           CUT TO : The last breath of twilight. NAZEEM slips his 
           arm around KALID’s shoulder, they walk on together, 
           down the slope away from the graves. 

           INT EREZ CROSSING POINT - NIGHT

           RUTH smiles at a blank faced ISABEL who, along with 
           several other ISRAELI SOLDIERS, are training their 
           machine guns on her and SAYED. SAYED is fascinated by  
           ISABEL’s striking beauty.

                                 SAYED
                                (murmurs)
                        They’re just kids. 

           RUTH nods, stiffens, seeing ARIEL approach, called to 
           deal with them. 

           CUT TO MOMENTS LATER:

           ARIEL, still incredulous at SAYED’s presence. 

                                 ARIEL
                        It’s impossible.

                                 RUTH
                        I’m not just a British Citizen, I’m 
                        the woman who’s pregnant daughter was 
                        murdered, and you won’t let her 
                        husband leave Gaza? To study in 
                        England? You’d like that broadcast? 
                        Night after night from Gaza city? 
                                (sudden perfect clarity)
                        Because I’m not leaving, I’m not going 
                        anywhere without my son in law. 

           SAYED blinks. 

           RUTH takes hold of SAYED’s sleeve with her fingers.

           SAYED, electrified. 
           ARIEL struggling.

           ISABEL gripped - 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                                (softening)
                        When he was kidnapped you saved his 
                        life. 

                                 ARIEL
                        There was nothing I could do. 

                                 RUTH
                        Oh I think you did a great deal. 

           RUTH and ARIEL’s eyes hold each other with a strange 
           ambiguous respect. 

                                 ARIEL
                        You’re mistaken. 
                                (steps aside)
                        ( Let them through)

           SAYED, stunned, he has to pinch himself to follow as 
           ISABEL and the other SOLDIERS part and RUTH walks 
           through. Not taking any chances, SAYED hurries to catch 
           up with RUTH.

           As RUTH passes ARIEL her HAND grazes his. 

                                 RUTH
                                (murmurs)
                        Good luck.

           EXT  EREZ CROSSING POINT - NIGHT

           A YELLOW TAXI, pulling away from under the SECURITY 
           LIGHTING of the military base WATCH TOWER. 

           INT YELLOW TAXI/MOTORWAY  - NIGHT 

           RUTH and SAYED in the back seat of the taxi. She seems 
           unconcerned by ALGERIAN HIP HOP blaring from the car 
           radio. She looks to SAYED - 

           SAYED is crying, his thin frame shaking with an 
           overspill of tension and loss.

           RUTH is surprised, uncertain what to do. SAYED sucks in 
           air to compose himself. He speaks sharply in Arabic to 
           the DRIVER who brings down the volume of the music. 

           RUTH and SAYED share a wry shy smile. 
           RUTH turns back to gazing out at the unfolding motorway 
           - a ribbon of light in the ink black Middle Eastern 
           night.
