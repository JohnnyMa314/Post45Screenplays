                           The Most Annoying Man in the World

           FADE IN:

           INT. SID’S COFFEE SHOP - AFTERNOON

           STUART PIVNICK, 32, sits alone at a table.  Stuart is an 
           enthusiastic, hyper, immature, naive, nosy, arbitrarily 
           opinionated, completely un-self-aware, chronic complainer 
           with no sense of personal space.  In short, Stuart Pivnick is 
           The Most Annoying Man in the World.  A WAITRESS sets a plate 
           of food in front of him.  Stuart examines the sandwich.

                                 STUART 
                        Excuse me.  There’s mayo on this 
                        and I asked for no mayo.

                                 WAITRESS
                        I don’t recall you asking for no 
                        mayonnaise.      

                                 STUART
                        Really?! 

           Stuart takes out a small tape recorder and pushes play.

                                 STUART’S VOICE 
                            (on recorder)
                        Yes... I would like a BLT sandwich 
                        please.  I would like to substitute 
                        the bacon with turkey.  Instead of 
                        lettuce, can I get cole slaw?  And 
                        instead of tomatoes, I would like 
                        onions.  Oh, and please, nooo mayo.  

           Stuart stops the recorder and grins at the stunned waitress.

                                 STUART
                        I guess someone owes someone an 
                        apology.  

           INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

           ALAN PIVNICK, mid-thirties, is wedged between two obese 
           passengers.  Alan is an uptight, impatient introvert.  He’s 
           speaking on the Airphone.  The OBESE WOMAN on his right holds 
           an INFANT.  The OBESE MAN on the left is clearly listening in 
           on Alan’s conversation, causing Alan to be self-conscious.   

                                 ALAN
                        ...and now I have a three hour 
                        layover in Chicago.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 ALAN (cont'd)
                        I’m sorry, honey, this was the only 
                        flight I could get on such short 
                        notice...  

           The obese woman undoes her blouse and exposes her huge 
           grotesque boob.  Alan recoils in disgust.  He tries not to 
           look as the woman breast-feeds her baby.

                                 ALAN (CONT’D)
                        So, I’m not gonna get to Philly 
                        ‘til like 8 o’clock.  Well, 8:55.

           INT. PATTERSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

           Alan’s fiance KRISTEN PATTERSON is getting her wedding dress 
           fitted as she talks on the phone.  Kristen is a sweet, perky, 
           outgoing, attractive woman in her early-thirties.   

                                 KRISTEN
                        You had to extend your bachelor 
                        party one more day.  You should 
                        have left Vegas yesterday when you 
                        were supposed to.  You still have 
                        the rings with you, right?

           INTERCUT BETWEEN AIRPLANE AND PATTERSON HOUSE

                                 ALAN
                        Of course, I still have the rings. 

           Alan frantically checks his pockets.  He pulls out a ring box 
           and checks to make sure rings are inside.  He SIGHS relieved.

                                 KRISTEN
                        Just hurry up and get here.  I miss 
                        you.  I love you.

           Alan looks at the passengers on both sides of him.  They are 
           both staring at him.  He is clearly uncomfortable.  Beat.

                                 KRISTEN (CONT’D)
                        Aren’t you gonna say you love me?

                                 ALAN
                        I can’t really talk right now.

                                 KRISTEN
                            (playful)
                        Honey, are you embarrassed because 
                        there’s people around you?  You 
                        know, Saturday you’re gonna have to 
                        show your emotions in front of a 
                        lot more people than a few 
                        strangers in coach.
                                 ALAN
                        Okay, fine.  I love you.  There, I 
                        said it.  Now everybody on the 
                        plane knows all my private love-
                        stuff.

           Kristen smiles.

           INT. TECHCORP - OFFICE - AFTERNOON

           MR. MUNSON, a well-dressed businessman in his early fifties 
           sits behind a desk, addressing a CLIENT.

                                 MR. MUNSON
                        ...and if this merger happens, all--   

           Stuart KNOCKS and steps into the room.

                                 STUART
                        Excuse me, Mr. Munson?  Arthur took 
                        my three-hole-punch out of my 
                        cubicle and he won’t give it back.

                                 MR. MUNSON
                            (annoyed)
                        Have Lucy get you another one.

                                 STUART
                        I would, but every time I go up 
                        there, Lucy is on one of her twenty 
                        minute cigarette breaks.

                                 MR. MUNSON
                        Stuart, I’m in the middle of a 
                        meeting.

                                 STUART
                        Right, sorry.

           Stuart backs out of the room.

                                 MR. MUNSON
                            (to client)
                        Sorry about that.  Anyway, as I--

           Stuart re-enters the room.

                                 STUART
                        I just want to make sure.  You are 
                        gonna reprimand Arthur, right?

                                 MR. MUNSON
                        We’ll discuss this later.
           He motions for Stuart to leave.  Stuart starts to go, then... 

                                 STUART
                        Real quick...  I also thought you 
                        should know that somebody keeps 
                        defacing my signs in the breakroom.

           Stuart holds up a handmade sign.  On top of the words “Please 
           clean up after yourself!  Your mom doesn’t work here.” is a 
           crude drawing of a man being hit over the head with a huge 
           cock.  Above the man it says “Stuart”.  

                                 MR. MUNSON
                        Stuart, please.  Get out.

                                 STUART
                        Gotcha.  
                            (as he exits; rapidly)
                        Mitchell was twenty minutes late 
                        again today.

           Stuart exits.  Mr. Munson grimaces.

           EXT. O’HARE AIRPORT - ESTABLISHING SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON

           The weather’s awful.  It’s snowing and the visibility is low.

           INT. O’HARE AIRPORT - TERMINAL - LATE AFTERNOON

           We PAN down a huge row of “Departure” monitors.  Next to 
           every single flight it reads “CANCELLED”.  Alan shakes his 
           head at the monitors as he speaks on his cell phone.

                                 ALAN
                        That’s right.  The whole airport’s 
                        closed.  They promised me I’d be on 
                        the 8AM flight tomorrow morning.

           INTERCUT BETWEEN TERMINAL AND PATTERSON HOUSE

           Kristen makes origami swans as she talks on the phone.

                                 KRISTEN
                        Our wedding is Saturday, and now 
                        you’re not getting here ‘til 
                        Tuesday?  We have a whole list of 
                        things we’re supposed to do.  

                                 ALAN
                        What do you need me to do?  I can 
                        do it from here.  
                                 KRISTEN
                        Well, you can’t try on your tuxedo 
                        from there.  You can’t help me make 
                        origami swans from there.  You 
                        can’t go to dinner with Uncle Bert 
                        and Aunt Liz tonight from there.

                                 ALAN
                        I can tell you’re stressing from 
                        here.  Listen, everything will get 
                        taken care of.  I’m in charge of 
                        the piano player and the flowers.  
                        I can handle that from here.  And 
                        I’ll be there early tomorrow to 
                        help out with whatever else comes 
                        up.  Everything will be fine.

                                 KRISTEN
                        Okay.  You’re right.  I know.  

                                 ALAN
                        Now I just have to figure out where 
                        the hell I’m gonna sleep tonight. 
                        As soon as the airport closed, 
                        every hotel within a fifty mile 
                        radius sold out.  I can’t sleep at 
                        the airport.  You know my back.

                                 KRISTEN
                        You’re from Chicago.  You must know 
                        somebody you can stay with.  How 
                        about that girl you dated in high 
                        school?  What was her name?  Becky 
                        Slutface?

                                 ALAN
                        I already tried calling her.  They 
                        didn’t have any listings for anyone 
                        with the last name “Slutface”.  But 
                        thanks for the suggestion.  I love 
                        you.  Goodbye.

           Alan hangs up.  He thinks and then cringes.  He looks pained.  
           He re-opens his phone to dial, then quickly shuts it.

                                 ALAN (CONT’D)
                            (to himself)
                        I can’t.  
                            (starts pacing)
                        It’s only one night...  It is an 
                        emergency... How bad can it be?

           He musters his courage, then opens his phone and dials.
           INT. ELEVATOR - SAME TIME

           Stuart stands in the crowded, moving elevator.  A few PEOPLE 
           roll their eyes as he pushes the lobby button repeatedly.  
           Then, Stuart lets out a FART.  People look disgusted.

                                 STUART
                        Sorry.  Turkey makes me gassy.

           Stuart’s CELL PHONE RINGS to the tune of Falco’s “Rock Me 
           Amadeus”.  He answers with his best Larry King impersonation.  

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        Caller, you’re on with Larry 
                        King...
                            (excited, regular voice)
                        Alan?! 
                            (to everyone)
                        It’s my brother Alan!  Oh my God!
                            (into phone)
                        Are you calling from the South 
                        Pole?
                            (to everyone)
                        Alan works at a research station in 
                        the middle of the South Pole!
                            (into phone)
                        You’re here in Chicago?!  
                            (to everyone)
                        He’s here in Chicago!

                                 ANNOYED BUSINESSMAN
                        I believe I speak for myself and 
                        everybody in this elevator when I 
                        say “I could fucking care less.”

           INT. COFFEE-TERIA - LATE AFTERNOON

           Kristen is drinking coffee with her younger sister, PATTI and 
           her childhood friend, DANA.  

                                 PATTI
                        It’s so great to see you, Kristen.  
                        I wish you’d come home more often.  
                        Have mom and dad been bugging you 
                        about moving back?

                                 KRISTEN
                        Yeah.  But it’s not gonna happen.  
                        Our jobs are in LA.  Besides, we 
                        really like it there.

           Dana lifts her coffee.  
                                 DANA
                        Here’s to marriage.  Hope yours 
                        lasts longer than Patti’s.

                                 PATTI
                        Me and Bill are only separated.  

                                 KRISTEN
                        You’ve been separated for like a 
                        year.  That’s not called a 
                        separation.  That’s called over.

                                 DANA
                        So, are there gonna be any cute 
                        single guys at the wedding?

                                 PATTI
                        Not that you haven’t already slept 
                        with.

                                 DANA
                        What about Alan’s friends?  

                                 KRISTEN
                        Alan only has a few friends coming 
                        to the wedding, and the only single 
                        one has one of those gross hairy 
                        moles on his face.  

                                 DANA
                        He must have a cute cousin or a 
                        brother or something.

                                 KRISTEN
                        No.  It’s kind of sad, but Alan 
                        doesn’t have any family.  His 
                        parents passed away a while ago, 
                        and he was an only child.  

           INT. STUART’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

           Tiny, immaculate.  Stuart throws open the door and sees Alan.

                                 STUART
                        Brother!

           Stuart grabs Alan and squeezes him.  Alan is clearly not as 
           excited about the reunion as Stuart is.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        I can’t believe it’s been eight 
                        years.  Wow.  You look so much 
                        older.  It is so good to see you.
           Stuart ushers Alan into the apartment.

                                 ALAN
                        Thanks for letting me stay here.

                                 STUART
                        I wish you were staying longer.  
                        So, what’s in Philadelphia anyway?  
                        A special lady?

                                 ALAN
                        No.  No girls.  I’m not seeing 
                        anyone.  I’m just stuck at that 
                        isolated research station in the 
                        middle of the South Pole.  I don’t 
                        have much interaction with anybody. 

                                 STUART
                        I’m not dating anyone either.  I’m 
                        focusing more on work.  I’m up for 
                        this big promotion.  I wouldn’t 
                        want a girl getting in the way.  

                                 ALAN
                        Right, sure.  I hear ya.

                                 STUART
                        You get my e-mails and my phone 
                        messages don’t you?

                                 ALAN
                        Yes.  Sorry I don’t really ever get 
                        to respond.  You know I’m not 
                        supposed to use the phone or the 
                        computer for personal use.

                                 STUART
                        I understand.  So you never said,  
                        why are you going to Philadelphia?

                                 ALAN
                        Oh, uh, it’s a scientist thing. I’m 
                        going to a, uh, summit between us 
                        scientists who work at the South 
                        Pole, and a bunch of scientists who 
                        work at the North Pole.  Philly’s 
                        kind of the halfway point.  

           Alan changes the subject by pointing to some framed photos of 
           him and Stuart.  He holds one up of them at a party.

                                 ALAN (CONT’D)
                        Hey.  I don’t remember this.
                                 STUART
                        That was my 30th birthday.  I 
                        Photoshopped you into the picture.  
                        Actually I Photoshopped all those 
                        people into the picture.  The 
                        original photo was just me standing 
                        in front of that wall right there.

                                 ALAN
                        I was wondering how you knew 
                        Jessica Alba.

                                 STUART
                        So, I have tonight all planned out.  
                        First we’ll go bowling.  Then we’ll 
                        get hot dogs at Portillos.  Then--  

                                 ALAN
                        I’m pretty beat.  Maybe I can just 
                        stay here?  You should go, though.

                                 STUART
                        Don’t be silly.  We’ll hang out 
                        here.  We can watch home movies!  
                        I’ve got hours and hours of ‘em.

           Alan winces.

           INT. STUART’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Stuart and Alan are sitting in front of the television. 

                                 STUART  
                        There’s you and mom.

           ON TV

           INT. PIVNICK LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON - 1979

           A 9-YEAR-OLD ALAN PLAYS an upright PIANO.  He is amazing for 
           his age.  His mother, JOAN, sits next to him.  

                                 STUART (CONT’D) (O.S.)
                        Mom sure loved your piano playing.  
                        You could have been a concert 
                        pianist.

           7-YEAR-OLD STUART dances up.

                                 JACK PIVNICK (O.C.)
                        Stuart, quit messing around.
           Stuart happily slams the piano lid shut on Alan’s fingers.  
           Alan SCREAMS.  Stuart LAUGHS hysterically.  

                                 JACK PIVNICK (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        Jesus, Stuart.

           The camera abruptly cuts.

           EXT. PARK - DAY - 1980

           A group of CUB SCOUTS are crowded around some ropes watching  
           10-YEAR-OLD ALAN climb.  

                                 STUART (O.S.)
                        That’s when we were trying to get 
                        our physical fitness badges.

                                 ALAN (O.S.)
                        Do we have to watch this?

                                 JACK PIVNICK (O.C.)
                        Come on, Alan.  You can do it.

           8-YEAR-OLD STUART starts climbing the rope behind Alan.  

                                 JACK PIVNICK (O.C.)
                        Stuart, one at a time.  Wait your 
                        turn.  Stuart!

           Stuart catches up to Alan, and grabs on to the bottom of his 
           Cub Scout pants.  He then falls to the ground, taking Alan’s 
           pants with him.  All of the Cub Scouts, and even Jack Pivnick 
           LAUGH HYSTERICALLY at the way-embarrassed, half-naked Alan.

                                 ALAN (O.S.)
                        I had to quit the Cub Scouts 
                        because of that.

           EXT. PIVNICK BACKYARD - DAY - 1982

           A banner reads “Happy Birthday Alan”.  A 12-YEAR-OLD ALAN and 
           a crowd of KIDS watch as the blindfolded 10-YEAR-OLD STUART 
           gets ready to swing at a pinata.  He wanders around 
           aimlessly, then takes a ferocious swing.  He misses the 
           pinata, but nails Alan square on the forehead.  KIDS SCREAM 
           and scatter.  Alan tries to shield himself as Stuart 
           repeatedly hits him with the bat as if he was the pinata.

                                 ALAN (O.S.)
                        You didn’t hear anybody saying 
                        “that’s not the pinata, that’s your 
                        brother?”
           INT. STUART’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

                                 STUART
                        I thought everyone was screaming 
                        because candy was pouring out.

                                 ALAN
                        Do you have any movies where you 
                        aren’t injuring or embarrassing me?

                                 STUART
                        Come on, it’s not that bad.  I got 
                        $500 from America’s Funniest Home 
                        Videos for that one.

                                 ALAN
                        Great.  I got seventeen stitches 
                        and a permanent scar.

           INT. STUART’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

           Alan sits on the toilet with his pants around his ankles.  He 
           whispers into his cell phone.

                                 ALAN
                        Tell your Uncle Bert and your Aunt 
                        Liz that I’m sorry I couldn’t be 
                        there, and that I look forward to 
                        meeting them.

           INTERCUT BETWEEN BATHROOM AND NICE RESTAURANT 

           Kristen is at dinner with Patti, her UNCLE BERT and AUNT LIZ.  
           She talks into her cell phone.  

                                 KRISTEN
                        Why are you whispering?

                                 ALAN
                            (still whispering)
                        I’m not whispering.

                                 KRISTEN
                        I’m really not in the mood for 
                        this.  

           Stuart starts to open the bathroom door.

                                 STUART (O.S.)
                        Alan!  Alan!  

           Alan, still on the toilet tries to hold the door shut as 
           Stuart continues to try to force his way in.
                                 KRISTEN
                        Aunt Liz wants to say “hi”.

           Kristen hands the phone to Aunt Liz.  

                                 AUNT LIZ
                        How’s my future nephew-in-law?

           Alan frantically struggles to keep the bathroom door shut.

                                 STUART (O.S.)
                        Let me in!  Let me in!  Or I’ll 
                        huff and I’ll puff...

                                 ALAN
                            (yells; to Stuart)
                        I’m trying to take a shit!  Okay?!

           Aunt Liz looks mortified.

                                 AUNT LIZ
                        Well, so sorry I bothered you.

           Aunt Liz hands the phone back to Kristen.

                                 ALAN
                            (into phone)
                        No.  Aunt Liz.  Not you.

           Stuart forces the door open and bursts in.  Alan quickly 
           hangs up the phone.  Stuart is holding a plate of S’mores.

                                 STUART
                        I made you some S’mores.  Remember 
                        the time we were camping and--

                                 ALAN 
                        I’m going to the bathroom here.  

                                 STUART
                        We’re brothers.  You can poop in 
                        front of me.  

                                 ALAN
                        I don’t want to.  

                                 STUART
                        You’re right.  I’m sorry.  I’m just 
                        so excited that you’re here.

           Stuart hugs the trapped Alan.  Alan looks way uncomfortable.
           INT. STUART’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - LATER

           Alan is dressed for bed.  

                                 ALAN
                        Thanks for letting me take the bed.

                                 STUART
                        I don’t mind sleeping on the couch.  

           Alan gets in bed as Stuart exits the room.  Seconds later, 
           Stuart reappears, dragging the couch into the bedroom.

                                 ALAN
                        When you said you were sleeping on 
                        the couch, I kind of thought that 
                        meant you were sleeping out there.

                                 STUART
                        How cool is this?  We haven’t slept 
                        in the same room since grade 
                        school.  Wanna tell ghost stories?

                                 ALAN
                        We should go to sleep.  We have to 
                        leave by 6AM if I’m gonna catch 
                        that flight.

                                 STUART
                        Okey dokey, artichokey.

           Stuart turns off the lights and gets on the couch.  

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        Goodnight, Brother.

                                 ALAN
                        Goodnight.

           Beat. Stuart turns on a bright flashlight and begins reading.

                                 STUART
                        “Harry wondered what to tell 
                        Hagrid.  ‘What about Dumbledore...”  

                                 ALAN
                        You still read out loud?

                                 STUART
                        Yes.  It’s a medical condition.  I 
                        can only read out loud.  You know 
                        that. I hope it doesn’t bother you.  
                        I can’t fall asleep unless I read.
                                 ALAN
                        How long does it usually take you--

           Alan is cut off by Stuart’s LOUD SNORING. Stuart’s arm flops 
           over, shining the flashlight directly onto Alan, bathing him 
           in bright light.  Alan pulls the blankets over his head.

           INT. STUART’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - LATER

           The alarm clock reads “4:08”.  Alan, still bathed in the glow 
           of the flashlight, is wide awake.  He looks annoyed.

                                 STUART
                            (sleep-singing)
                        ...beat it, beat it / no one wants 
                        to be defeated (oh no) / showin’ 
                        how funky strong is your fight / it 
                        doesn’t matter who’s wrong or right 
                        / just beat it beat it beat it...  

           INT. STUART’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING

           Alan stirs awake and looks at the clock.  It reads “6:15”.  
           He freaks and jumps out of bed.  Stuart is nowhere in sight.

                                 ALAN
                        Stuart!  Stuart!  We gotta go.

           INT. STUART’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Alan rushes in.  Stuart is nowhere to be seen.

                                 ALAN
                        Stuart?  Stuart?

           The front door opens and Stuart enters.  He is wearing the 
           tightest,smallest, brightest shiny Lycra workout suit, 
           complete with leggings.  He holds up a bag.

                                 STUART
                        Got you a muffin.  How’d you sleep?

                                 ALAN
                        Terrible.  I had a light shining in 
                        my face, and you sang the entire 
                        Thriller album in your sleep.  We 
                        were supposed to leave twenty 
                        minutes ago.

                                 STUART
                        Sorry.  My morning workout ran a 
                        little long.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 STUART (cont'd)
                        Somebody didn’t wipe down the glute 
                        machine after they used it, and I 
                        had to notify management.  This was 
                        the third time this week and-- 

                                 ALAN
                        Whatever.  We gotta go.

           EXT. STUART’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Stuart, still wearing his workout suit, lets Alan into the 
           passenger seat of his 2004 Honda Civic Hybrid.  Stuart then 
           walks around the front of the car.  Alan watches anxiously 
           from inside the car as Stuart meticulously picks leaf after 
           leaf off of the hood and windshield.  Each time Stuart picks 
           a leaf, Alan gets a little more upset.  Alan exits the car.

                                 ALAN
                        Is this necessary?  I don’t have 
                        any time.  My plane is leaving.

                                 STUART
                        Juuuuust removing the leaves.

           Stuart carefully and methodically continues to remove leaf 
           after leaf as Alan looks on.

                                 ALAN
                        Every leaf?  You parked under a 
                        tree.  They’re still falling on the 
                        car while you’re picking them off.

           A leaf falls onto the car.  Alan points.

                                 ALAN (CONT’D)
                        See?  There’s one that just fell.

                                 STUART
                        Thanks!

           Stuart picks the leaf off the car.

                                 ALAN
                        Don’t you think that once you’re 
                        driving to the airport, the wind 
                        from the motion of the car will 
                        blow the leaves off?

                                 STUART
                        This will only take a second.

           Stuart continues to examine the entire car for leaves.  An 
           antsy Allen starts helping.
           EXT. CHICAGO HIGHWAY - MORNING

           Stuart and Alan cruise slowly along the highway.

           INT. CAR - SAME TIME

           Stuart sits perfectly straight, staring ahead intensely.  
           Alan fidgets in the seat next to him.

                                 ALAN
                        We’re not in a parade.  Can you 
                        please go a little faster?

                                 STUART
                        We’re going the speed limit.

                                 ALAN
                        Can you maybe go a little over the 
                        speed limit?

                                 STUART
                        I don’t know.  Could you maybe rape 
                        somebody for me?

                                 ALAN
                        What?

                                 STUART
                        Maybe we should just throw all laws 
                        out the window. What do you say we 
                        go kidnap somebody?  

                                 ALAN
                        You’re equating rape and kidnapping 
                        with speeding?

                                 STUART
                        I’m equating breaking the law with 
                        breaking the law.

           EXT. CHICAGO HIGHWAY - SAME TIME

           The car pulls over.  Stuart quickly gets out, removes a leaf 
           from the windshield and gets back in.  The car pulls back on 
           to the highway.  

           INT. O’HARE AIRPORT - TICKET COUNTER - SHORT TIME LATER

           Stuart and an anxious Alan are at the front of the line.  
           Several TRAVELLERS SNICKER at Stuart’s outfit.
                                 STUART
                        ...so then the idiot chooses 
                        briefcase number ten, and instead 
                        of winning a million dollars, he 
                        goes home with fifty bucks.  
                        Obviously he should have picked 
                        briefcase number thirty-two. 

                                 ALAN
                        Obviously to who?  Deal or No Deal 
                        is just a guessing game.

                                 STUART
                        No it’s not.  It’s a complex system 
                        of statistics, strategy, numbers, 
                        and odds.  I’ve seen every episode.  
                        I’ve been taking notes, and I’m 
                        really close to cracking the code.  

                                 ALAN
                        The game is random.

                                 STUART
                        You’re entitled to your opinion... 
                        But you’re wrong.

                                 TICKET COUNTER LADY
                        Next!

           Alan and Stuart approach the counter.

                                 ALAN
                        Hi.  I’m checking in for the 
                        Philadelphia flight.  Last name is 
                        Pivnick.  First name, Alan.

           The lady hits a few keys on her keyboard.  The boarding pass 
           prints.  She grabs it and holds it up.  

                                 TICKET COUNTER LADY
                        Okay, Mr. Pivnick.  I just need to 
                        see some ID.

           Alan goes to grab his wallet... It’s not there.  

                                 ALAN
                        Huh.  I don’t have my wallet.  Hang 
                        on a sec.

           He begins to frantically search for his wallet.  He checks 
           his jacket.  He opens his carry-on and rummages through it. 
                                 STUART
                        Did you have it at my place?  When 
                        was the last time you saw it?  
                        Check your jacket.  Did you check 
                        all your pockets?  Your front 
                        pockets?  Your back pockets?

                                 ALAN
                        I’m looking.  Please.

                                 STUART
                        What does it look like?  Is it 
                        leather?  Is it a bi-fold?  Tri-
                        fold?  I use one of these.
                            (holds up wallet)
                        They call it a front pocket wallet, 
                        because it’s sleeker than your 
                        average bi-fold.  

                                 ALAN
                        That would be helpful, if I was 
                        looking for your wallet.

           Alan continues searching for his wallet.

                                 STUART
                        You know, it could have been 
                        stolen.  Oh my God.  You might have 
                        been pick-pocketed.  Or maybe--

                                 ALAN
                        Please be quiet.

                                 TICKET COUNTER LADY
                        Sir?  Do you have your ID or not?

                                 ALAN
                        I can’t find it.  

                                 TICKET COUNTER LADY
                        Well, I can’t issue your boarding 
                        pass without proper ID.

                                 ALAN
                        I have to get on that plane.  

                                 STUART
                        I can vouch for him.  His name is 
                        Guillermo Valdez, and he’s from 
                        Mexico City.  Ha!  Just kidding.

                                 ALAN
                        Really not helping.
                                 STUART
                        Do you have a passport on you?  Or 
                        an extra drivers license?

                                 ALAN
                        Stuart, stop talking.  Ma’am, can I 
                        please talk to a supervisor?

                                 TICKET COUNTER LADY
                        My supervisor’s just going to tell 
                        you the same thing.  No ID, no 
                        boarding pass.

           She holds up the boarding pass.  Alan grabs it.

                                 ALAN
                        There.  I have my boarding pass.  
                        I’m getting on that plane.  

           A few of the ticket counter ladies CO-WORKERS and a SECURITY 
           GUARD approach to watch the commotion. 

                                 TICKET COUNTER LADY
                        No you’re not.  You’re not gonna 
                        get past the security checkpoint 
                        without an ID.
                            (yells out)
                        Next!

                                 ALAN
                            (totally losing it)
                        This is bullshit!  I was supposed 
                        to be in Philadelphia last night.  
                        You cancelled my flight.  Now 
                        you’re telling me I can’t fly?  So, 
                        am I just stuck in Chicago forever?  
                        Should I start shopping for houses?  

                                 TICKET COUNTER LADY
                        I understand you’re upset, but I 
                        don’t appreciate your tone of 
                        voice.

                                 ALAN
                        Well I don’t appreciate your stupid 
                        shit-jerky airline! 

           Stuart steps between Alan and the Ticket Counter Lady.

                                 STUART
                        You’ll have to excuse my brother.  
                        He’s always had trouble controlling 
                        his temper.  It’s not his fault.

                                 STUART (cont'd)
                        It’s because he was born with three 
                        testicles.

           Everyone within earshot reacts.

                                 ALAN
                        For the record, my getting angry 
                        has nothing to do with my third 
                        testicle.  I’ve always been a very 
                        calm person.  I only get angry in 
                        situations that would make anyone 
                        angry.  You know, situations like 
                        losing your wallet?  Not being able 
                        to get on an airplane?  Or having a 
                        brother that always insists on 
                        telling everybody that I was born 
                        with three balls!  

           Alan storms off.  Stuart turns to the crowd.

                                 STUART
                            (apologetic)
                        He has three testicles.

           INT. O’HARE AIRPORT - MOMENTS LATER

           Alan walks angrily along.  Stuart races up.

                                 STUART
                        Where are you going?

                                 ALAN
                        I don’t know.  I’m screwed.  I 
                        don’t have my wallet.  No credit 
                        cards, no money.  I can’t rent a 
                        car.  You don’t understand.  I 
                        really have to get to Philadelphia.

                                 STUART
                        I’ll drive you.

           Alan stops walking.

                                 ALAN
                        What?

                                 STUART
                        I’ll drive you.   It’s not that 
                        far.  It’s only like 800 miles.  We 
                        can do it in no time.

                                 ALAN
                        I don’t know.
                                 STUART
                        You wouldn’t be putting me out at 
                        all.  Seriously, I don’t mind.  We 
                        have eight years of catching up to 
                        do.  It’ll be fun.  Besides, what 
                        other options do you have?

                                 ALAN
                            (thinks, then)
                        Alright.  Yeah.  Let’s do this.

                                 STUART
                        Yay!  Road trip!

                                 ALAN
                        Just one thing.  Can you please 
                        change out of those clothes?

           INT. TANNING SALON - SHORT TIME LATER

           Kristen is inside a tanning booth, talking on her cell.

                                 KRISTEN
                        Are you kidding me?

           INTERCUT BETWEEN TANNING SALON AND EXT. STUART’S APARTMENT 

           Alan stands by Stuart’s car, talking on his cell.

                                 ALAN
                        I know.  I shouldn’t have stayed an 
                        extra day at my bachelor party.  
                        Look, I said I’d be there by 12.  
                        That’s still true.  Just now, it’s 
                        12 midnight, instead of 12 noon.

                                 KRISTEN
                        Is that supposed to be funny?  And 
                        what did you say to Aunt Liz?

                                 ALAN
                        I didn’t say anything to Aunt Liz.  
                        Honey, I promise everything’s going 
                        to be okay.  

                                 KRISTEN
                        Tell me you at least called the 
                        florist and the piano lady.

                                 ALAN
                        Of course I did.  Everything is 
                        great.   
                                 KRISTEN
                        All right.  Please just get here.

           Kristen hangs up.  Panicked, Alan immediately begins dialing. 

           INT. GRETEL’S PETALS FLORIST - SAME TIME

           An upscale flower shop.  Trendy, pretentious a-hole LANCELOT 
           answers the phone.

                                 LANCELOT
                        Gretel’s Petals.  Lancelot 
                        speaking.  What can I do you for?  

           INTERCUT BETWEEN FLORIST AND EXT. STUART’S APARTMENT

                                 ALAN
                        Hi.  I’m calling about the Pivnick-
                        Patterson wedding.  I wanted to 
                        confirm the arrangements.

           Lancelot turns to a computer and punches a few keys.

                                 LANCELOT 
                        Let’s see.... Pivnick... Pivnick...  
                        Here we are.  Ooh.  Tiger Lillies.  
                        Tasteful.  Everything seems in 
                        order.  We’ll see you at 2 o’clock 
                        on Saturday the 13th.

                                 ALAN
                        You mean Saturday the 3rd. 

                                 LANCELOT
                        This says Saturday the 13th.

                                 ALAN
                        Well, there is no Saturday the 
                        13th.  Obviously, somebody added an 
                        extra teenth.

                                 LANCELOT
                        But the 3rd’s this Saturday.  
                        There’s no way we can get Tiger 
                        Lillies by this Saturday.

                                 ALAN
                        My fiance has to have Tiger 
                        Lillies.  It’s like a dream of hers 
                        since she was a little girl or 
                        something.  We hired you to get 
                        Tiger Lillies, so figure it out.
           Alan notices Stuart approaching and quickly hangs up.

                                 STUART
                        Philadelphia?  Look out, here come 
                        the Pivnicks!

           Stuart excitedly hops into the car.  Alan gets in after him.

           EXT. CHICAGO HIGHWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Stuart and Alan “speed” along the highway.  

           INT. CAR - SAME TIME

                                 STUART
                        Let’s put on some tunes.  There’s a 
                        case of CD’s in the glove box.

           Alan pulls out the case and flips through it.

                                 ALAN
                        Driving Miss Daisy?  Friday The 
                        13th Part 3?  Kramer Vs. Kramer?  
                        These are all movie soundtracks.

                                 STUART
                        No.  They are all original scores.  
                        There’s a difference.  Put in ET.  

           Alan reluctantly puts in the disc.  The instrumental score to 
           ET BLASTS through the speakers.  

                                 STUART
                            (singing)
                        ET / loves his Reeses Pieces. / 
                        Phone home / I’ll heal you with my 
                        finger.
                            (off Alan’s look)
                        I like to make up my own words.  
                        Hey, remember when I used to call 
                        you ET, the Extra Ter-testicle?  

                                 ALAN
                        Yes.  Yes I do.

           EXT. CHICAGO HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Stuart and Alan “speed” along the highway.  The Chicago 
           skyline just behind them.
                                 STUART (O.S)
                            (singing)
                        I am / driving with my brother / 
                        we’re going / to a place called 
                        Pennsylvania...

           EXT. HIGHWAY - SHORT TIME LATER

           The car travels along.  The score to Halloween PLAYS.

                                 STUART (O.S.)
                            (singing)
                        Michael Myers is gonna get you / oh 
                        no look out he’s got a steakknife / 
                        help me I’m being stabbed.
                            (screams)
                        Aarrrrrrrrgggggggghhhhh!!!

           EXT. HIGHWAY - SHORT TIME LATER

           The instrumental score to Seabiscuit PLAYS.

                                 STUART (O.S.)
                            (singing)
                        He’s the horse who can / the jockey 
                        was too tall...

           The car turns off of the highway on to a side road.

           INT. CAR - SAME TIME

           Alan is holding the jewel box for the Seabiscuit score.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                            (singing)
                        ...no one believed Seabiscuit could 
                        do it / that’s why--

                                 ALAN
                        Why did you turn off the highway?  

                                 STUART
                        I’m just taking a quick detour.

                                 ALAN
                        We’ve barely been driving an hour.  
                        We don’t have time for a detour.

                                 STUART
                        I thought we’d visit Mom and Dad.

           Alan’s eyes widen.
           EXT. CEMETARY - SHORT TIME LATER

           Stuart and Alan stand over the gravesites of Jack and Joan 
           Pivnick.  Alan seems a little affected by the experience.  

                                 STUART
                        Hey Mom!  Dad!  Look who’s here.  
                        I’ve got Alan with me.  
                            (to Alan)
                        I try to come out here at least 
                        once a month.  

                                 ALAN
                        I haven’t been here since mom’s 
                        funeral.

                                 STUART
                        That was the last time I saw you...  
                        You should have played the piano at 
                        the funeral.  

                                 ALAN
                        You know I don’t like playing in 
                        front of people.

                                 STUART
                        Still.  It would have meant a lot 
                        to her.  

                                 ALAN
                        Well there’s nothing I can do about 
                        that now.  

                                 STUART
                        At least I made up for it by 
                        playing the flute.  
                            (proud)
                        And I had never even played the 
                        flute before.

           Alan rolls his eyes.  They stand in silence for a beat.

                                 ALAN 
                        Remember that time they drove us 
                        around to look at Christmas lights 
                        and I got in trouble so they made 
                        me shut my eyes the whole time?

                                 STUART
                        Yeah.  I tried to describe them all 
                        to you.  Then I got in trouble.  

           Long beat.
                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        Remember the time mom caught you 
                        masturbating to that Wonder Woman 
                        Pez Dispenser?

           An ELDERLY COUPLE looks over.

                                 ALAN
                        Can you say that a little louder?  
                        A couple of people on the other 
                        side of the cemetary couldn’t hear.

                                 STUART
                        Hey, it’s a Pivnick family reunion.  
                        We should get a picture.

           Stuart notices a grieving FAMILY - several adults and a few 
           children - mourning at a new gravesite nearby.  He runs over. 

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        Welcome to the neighborhood!

           The family looks at him.  They are clearly not in the mood 
           for his exuberance.  Alan tugs at Stuart.

                                 ALAN
                        Let’s leave them alone.

                                 STUART
                        We were wondering if one of you 
                        could take our picture in front of 
                        our parents headstones.  You know, 
                        a family portrait.

           He hands a camera to a GRIEVING MAN in his fifties.

                                 GRIEVING MAN
                        We’re kind of in the middle of--

                                 STUART
                            (points to grave)
                        He’s not going anywhere.  Come on.  
                        This’ll just take a second.

                                 ALAN
                        Look, you don’t have to--

                                 STUART
                        Please please please please.  I’m 
                        going to keep sayin’ please until 
                        you do it.  Please please please...
           The Grieving Man gives in.  Stuart leads him to his parents 
           graves.  Stuart positions Alan next to him, then poses.

                                 ALAN
                        I’m really sorry about this sir.

                                 STUART
                        Make sure you get my parents in 
                        there.  Smile, Alan.

           Alan forces a smile.  The guy snaps the photo.  He hands 
           Stuart the camera and starts to walk back over to his family. 
           Stuart looks at the picture.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        My eyes are shut.
                            (yells after man)
                        You need take another one.

                                 ALAN
                        No you don’t.  It looks fine.

           Stuart walks back towards the family.  Alan gives chase. 

                                 ALAN (CONT’D)
                        Stuart?  I think it’s time to go.

           Stuart reaches the grieving family.

                                 STUART
                        So, what happened to...
                            (reads grave)
                        ...Benjamin? 

           The family exchanges sad looks.  There is a long, 
           uncomfortable silence.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        Car accident?  Heart attack?  Lead 
                        poisoning?  Choked on a grape?  
                        Drug overdose?  Cancer?  Drowned?  

           One of the grieving women begins SOBBING HYSTERICALLY.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        Electrocuted?  Hit by lightening?  
                        Quicksand?  Bad allergy?  Fell off 
                        a cliff?  He wasn’t murdered was 
                        he?  That would be horrible.  
                        Attacked by a mountain lion?     

                                 GRIEVING MAN
                        It was a suicide, okay?  
                                 STUART
                        Ouch!  Suicide.  Wow.  You know, 
                        they say that you shouldn’t blame 
                        yourselves.  But when you think 
                        about it, there must of been 
                        something one of you could have 
                        done to prevent this.

           Another woman begins SOBBING HYSTERICALLY.  

                                 ALAN
                        Come on Stuart.  Time to go.

           The family attempts to console one another as Alan pulls 
           Stuart away.

                                 STUART
                            (yells back)
                        Bye neighbors.  I’m sure we’ll be 
                        seeing a lot of each other.

           INT. SALON - SAME TIME

           Kristen, Patti, and Dana are getting pedicures.

                                 PATTI
                        So, what song did you guys end up 
                        picking for the first dance?  Me 
                        and Bill danced to “Endless Love”.

                                 DANA
                        You should have danced to “Three 
                        Years and Two Months Love.”  
                        Wouldn’t that have been more 
                        accurate?

                                 PATTI
                        How about the song, “I Can’t Have 
                        Children Because of my Syphillis”?  
                        Oh wait, that’s Dana’s song.

                                 DANA
                        It was Chlamydia, and I had only 
                        had it for like three weeks.

                                 KRISTEN
                        We’re not doing a first dance.  
                        Alan feels weird about doing things 
                        in front of everybody.  He’s not 
                        gonna give a speech either.

                                 DANA
                        Really?  What a stick in the mud.
                                 KRISTEN
                        It’s not that bad.

                                 PATTI
                        Kristen?  You gotta admit the guy 
                        is a little uptight.  I mean, he 
                        proposed to you in an e-mail.

                                 KRISTEN
                        He’s a really sweet guy.  He’s just 
                        a little uncomfortable showing his 
                        emotions.  It happened to be a very 
                        nice e-mail.

                                 DANA
                        Did he at least put one of those 
                        sideways happy faces with the colon 
                        and the parentheses thingy?

           Dana and Patti LAUGH.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - SHORT TIME LATER

           Stuart and Alan are back on the road.  The instrumental score 
           to Jaws PLAYS.

                                 STUART
                            (singing)
                        We are / having so much fun...

           INT. CAR - SAME TIME

                                 STUART
                            (singing)
                        Uh oh. / I have to pee. / I should 
                        have gone back at the cemetary.

           Alan turns off the radio.

                                 ALAN
                        I have a headache.  Maybe we can 
                        give the music a little break, huh?

                                 STUART
                        Great.  Let’s play a game.  Think 
                        of a number between one and a 
                        million, and I’ll try to guess it.  

                                 ALAN
                        I don’t really feel like playing.
                                 STUART
                        Come on.  It’s easy.  I’ll guess a 
                        number. And you just tell me if the 
                        number you’re thinking of is higher 
                        or lower.   

                                 ALAN
                        Seriously.  I don’t feel like 
                        playing.

                                 STUART
                        Just pick a number.  Come on!

                                 ALAN
                        Can’t we just have some quiet time?

                                 STUART
                        Don’t be a no-fun-nik.  Do you want 
                        me to pick a number and you guess?

                                 ALAN
                        No.  

                                 STUART
                        Then think of a number.  Any 
                        number.  Between one and a million.  
                        Just do it.  Any number.  Think of 
                        one.  Between one and a million. 

                                 ALAN
                        Fine!  I’m thinking of a fucking 
                        number!

                                 STUART
                            (thinks)
                        Is it 253 thousand, eight-hundred 
                        and fifty-seven?

                                 ALAN
                        Yep.  That’s the number.  You got 
                        it on the first guess.  Congrats.  
                        Game over.

                                 STUART
                        Oh my God!  That’s insane.  I can’t 
                        believe I guessed it.  Do you know 
                        the odds of guessing that in one 
                        guess?

                                 ALAN
                        Actually, it’s one in a million.
                                 STUART
                            (pointing ahead)
                        Look!

           Just ahead, off to the side of the road is a low-end 
           amusement park/carnival called Funzee’s Fun Zone.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        Funzee’s!  I knew it was coming up.

                                 ALAN
                            (perks up)
                        I haven’t thought of that place in 
                        years.  I totally remember coming 
                        here when we were kids.

                                 STUART
                        Let’s go.

                                 ALAN
                        I don’t know.

                                 STUART
                        Just a few rides.  I have to pee, 
                        so we have to stop somewhere.  
                        Might as well be Funzee’s.

                                 ALAN
                        We’re way behind schedule--

                                 STUART
                        I see what’s happening here.  I 
                        forgot.  You’re scared of the 
                        rides.

                                 ALAN
                        What are you talking about?

                                 STUART
                        When we were kids, you never went 
                        on any of the rides.

                                 ALAN
                        I went on rides.

                                 STUART
                        I’m not talking Merry-Go-Rounds.  
                        You’re scared of the real rides.

                                 ALAN
                        That is so untrue.
                                 STUART
                        Then let’s go.

                                 ALAN
                        Fine.

           EXT. FUNZEE’S - SHORT TIME LATER

           Stuart is eating cotton candy.  Alan is eating a funnel cake.  
           They’re clearly having a good time.  

                                 ALAN
                        Man, this is good.  I can’t believe 
                        all the crap we’re eating.  I can 
                        feel my arteries clogging, but it’s 
                        so worth it.

                                 STUART
                        See?  Aren’t you glad we stopped?

                                 ALAN
                        You know, I dream about these 
                        funnel cakes?

           Stuart smiles.  He spots something up ahead. 

                                 STUART
                        Look.  Fried candy apples!

           Stuart points with the cotton candy.  He accidentally brushes 
           a woman on the back of the head.  The entire cotton candy 
           sticks to her hair as she walks off, oblivious.  Stuart and 
           Alan both LAUGH HYSTERICALLY.  

           EXT. FUNZEE’S - SHORT TIME LATER

           Stuart and Alan walk up to the entrance of a ride called “The 
           Ring of Fire”.  It’s basically a huge vertical loop, and the 
           riders spin upside-down repeatedly.  Stuart couldn’t be more 
           excited.  Alan is clearly nervous. 

                                 ALAN
                        So, once this ride is over, we 
                        really should go.  Okay?

                                 STUART
                        You got it. 

           The two of them walk up the ramp, get in the front car and 
           sit.  Alan fidgets anxiously.  The gruff RIDE OPERATOR walks 
           up and helps them with their safety harnesses.
                                 ALAN
                        About how many times do we go 
                        around this loop?

                                 RIDE OPERATOR
                        I don’t know, man.  Five?  A 
                        hundred?

                                 ALAN
                        I don’t suppose you can narrow that 
                        down a little?
                            (off his look)
                        Or not.  All right.  That’s cool.

                                 STUART
                        Everybody put your hands up!  This 
                        is gonna be awesome!

           Stuart holds his arms out and waves them.  Nobody else does.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        When I say “Ring”, you say “of 
                        Fire.”  Ring!

           Nothing.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        Ring!

           Nothing.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        Okay, then.
                            (chanting)
                        Start the ride!  Start the ride!  

           Whoosh!  The ride begins.  Alan hangs on for dear life as 
           they are catapulted forward into the ring.  He couldn’t look 
           more uncomfortable.  Stuart SCREAMS a high-pitched feminine 
           wail as they travel the loop, again and again.  

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        Faster!  Make it go faster!  
                        Faster!  I know you can hear me!

                                 ALAN
                        We’re going fast enough.  Don’t 
                        anger the guy.

                                 STUART
                        Is that all you got?  Come on, 
                        faster, you weenie!  Faster!
           ANGLE - THE RIDE OPERATOR

                                 RIDE OPERATOR
                            (under his breath)
                        I’ll give you faster.

           The annoyed operator pulls on a lever.  The car immediately 
           begins spinning what seems like ten times faster.  People on 
           the ride SCREAM.  Stuart CHEERS happily.

                                 ALAN
                        We don’t want faster!  He wanted 
                        faster!

           Suddenly, there is a horrible POP followed by a SCREECHING 
           SOUND.  The car grinds to a halt - exactly at the top of the 
           loop, stranding all of the riders hanging upside-down.

                                 STUART
                        Boooo.

                                 ALAN
                        What’s going on?  It’s not supposed 
                        to stop up here like this.

           The ride operator frantically hits buttons on the control 
           panel, trying to regain control of the ride.  A few other 
           Funzee EMPLOYEES run over and try to help.

                                 STUART
                        Faster!  Faster!

                                 ALAN
                        Stuart, there’s something wrong.  
                        We’re stuck.

                                 STUART
                        No we’re not.

                                 ALAN
                        We’re upside-down, and we’re not 
                        moving.  What do you call this?

           A MANAGER speaks into a mic.  An overwhelmed MECHANIC stands 
           next to him, holding a wrench.  He looks very confused.

                                 MANAGER
                            (over loudspeaker)
                        Hello, everybody.  There has been a 
                        minor ride malfunction.  Our 
                        Funzee’s technicians are working to 
                        have the ride up and running as 
                        quickly as possible.

                                 MANAGER (cont'd)
                        We ask that you please remain calm 
                        and we’ll have you down in no time.

                            (way panicky)
                        This is bad.  This is bad.  How 
                        long is “no time”?  Technically, 
                        “no time” has passed, and we’re 
                        still stuck here.

                                 STUART
                            (screams)
                        We’re all gonna die!  We’re all 
                        gonna die!

           Everyone aboard the ride begins to panic.

                                 PASSENGERS
                        Help! / We’re gonna die! / Help!

           EXT. FUNZEE’S - SEVERAL HOURS LATER

           Everyone is still hanging upside down.  Calliope MUSIC PLAYS 
           from the nearby Merry-Go-Round.  Several maintenance workers 
           struggle with the equipment at the base of the ride.  News 
           reporter CONNIE MARRS speaks into a camera.  The ride 
           operator is standing next to her.

                                 CONNIE MARRS
                        ...the stranded riders are now 
                        entering hour five of their upside-
                        down ordeal.  They say “what goes 
                        up, must come down”, but today at 
                        Funzee’s, that’s simply not the 
                        case.  Back to you, Brent.

           ANGLE - ALAN AND STUART

           Alan and Stuart are beet-red from the blood rushing to their 
           heads.  Alan looks miserable.  Stuart seems perfectly happy.

                                 STUART
                        I-Spy with my little eye 
                        something... green.

                                 ALAN
                        I still don’t want to play I-Spy.  
                        I didn’t want to play an hour ago.  
                        I’m not gonna wanna play an hour 
                        from now.

                                 STUART
                        It’s that green trashcan.  
                                 ALAN
                        I can’t feel my neck.  

                                 STUART
                            (singing)
                        Upside down. / Girl, you spin me. / 
                        round and round / on the ring of 
                        fire.

           Alan’s cell phone begins to RING.  He struggles to pull it 
           out and looks at the caller ID:  “KRIS”.  Alan cringes.  He 
           motions for Stuart to keep it down, then answers.

                                 ALAN
                        Hello?

           INTERCUT BETWEEN FUNZEE’S AND THE PATTERSON HOUSE 

           Kristen sits on the couch.  On the TV in the background is 
           clearly live news coverage of the Chicago Roller Coaster 
           that’s stuck upside-down.  Kristen is oblivious to the news.

                                 KRISTEN
                        I’ve been calling you all day.

                                 ALAN
                        The reception’s been bad.  

                                 STUART
                            (whispers)
                        Who is it?

           Alan motions for Stuart to leave him alone.

                                 KRISTEN
                        How’s it going?  You getting close?

                                 ALAN
                        Yep.

                                 STUART
                            (whispers)
                        Who is it?

                                 ALAN
                            (covers phone; to Stuart)
                        It’s nobody you know.

                                 KRISTEN
                            (flirtatious)
                        Well, here’s little incentive for 
                        you to drive faster.

                        I’m gonna be waiting up for you.  
                        And I’m going to be completely 
                        naked.

                                 ALAN
                        Okay.  Sounds good.    

                                 KRISTEN
                        And guess what?  I just shaved... 
                        everything. 

                                 ALAN
                        Great.  Thanks for the update.  

                                 KRISTEN
                        Why are you acting so weird?  Is 
                        that calliope music?

                                 STUART
                            (whispers)
                        Is that a girl?

                                 ALAN
                            (covers phone; to Stuart)
                        No. 

                                 STUART
                            (whispers)
                        I don’t believe you.

           Stuart tries to grab the phone from Alan.  They wrestle.  The 
           phone falls out of Alan’s hands and goes crashing to the 
           ground, where it smashes into pieces.

                                 ALAN
                        Shit shit shit.  Great.  Really 
                        fucking great.

           EXT. FUNZEE’S - EVENING

           EMERGENCY CREWS are rescuing passengers.  A FIREMAN escorts 
           Stuart and Alan to the ground in a cherry-picker.

                                 STUART
                        Look.  There’s no line at the Tilt-
                        A-Whirl!

           Alan glares at Stuart.

           EXT. FUNZEE’S - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           A comically red-faced Stuart and Alan wobble up to the car.  
           They are both clearly dizzy and exhausted.
                                 STUART
                        That was nice of them to give us 
                        free passes to come back.

                                 ALAN
                        I’d rather have the last seven 
                        hours of my life back.

           Stuart and Alan get into the car.

           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

                                 STUART
                        I’m not so sure I should be 
                        driving.  I feel kind of dizzy.

                                 ALAN
                        We’ve wasted enough time.  Drive.

           EXT. FUNZEE’S - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           Stuart drives around and around in a tight circle.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - SHORT TIME LATER

           Stuart and Alan are back on the main highway.  In the 
           distance, a sign reads “Philadelphia - 662 miles”.  

                                 ALAN
                        Great.  In twelve hours, we’ve gone 
                        a hundred miles...  Wake me when we 
                        get to Philly.  

           Alan looks at the highway sign in the distance.  He SIGHS and 
           shuts his eyes.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - NEXT MORNING

           Alan stirs awake.  He looks at the clock.  It’s just after 
           7AM.  He looks over, and sees Stuart fast asleep in the 
           driver’s seat.  Alan sits up, realizing that they are parked 
           on the side of the road.  He shakes Stuart.

                                 ALAN
                        Stuart.  Wake up.

           Stuart stirs awake.

                                 STUART
                        Morning, sunshine.  Whew.  Sorry, I 
                        got so tired I had to pull over.  
                                 ALAN
                        How far did we get?

                                 STUART
                        I don’t know.  I drove for a while.

           He starts the car.  Alan looks at the road ahead and sees the 
           highway sign that reads... “Philadelphia - 662 miles”.  

                                 ALAN
                        You drove “for a while”?  We’ve 
                        gone five feet.  You must have 
                        pulled over the second I shut my 
                        eyes.  This isn’t happening.

                                 STUART
                        I was tired.  It’s not safe to 
                        drive in that condition.  Maybe 
                        you’d be happier if you woke up in 
                        a ditch with the car upside down, 
                        and my decapitated head in your 
                        legless blood-stained lap?

                        There are parts of that scenario 
                        that I find extremely appealing.  
                        Just drive.

           The car pulls out onto the highway.

           INT. CAR - SHORT TIME LATER

                                 STUART
                        I have to get something to eat.

                                 ALAN
                        We’ve barely been on the road.  
                        Can’t you wait a little bit?

                                 STUART
                        I can’t.  I have a very delicate 
                        metabolism, and it’s imperative 
                        that I eat between 9:10 and 9:15 
                        every morning.

                                 ALAN
                        You have a five minute window?

                                 STUART
                        Yes, and right now, it’s 9 o’clock, 
                        and I’m getting concerned.
                                 ALAN
                        Fine.  Stop at the next place.

                                 STUART
                        What if there isn’t a next place?  
                        I have to eat.  Now it’s 9:01!

           Stuart fidgets nervously and breathes heavily.

                                 ALAN
                        Calm down.

                                 STUART
                        You calm down!  
                            (moaning)
                        Ohhhhhhh.  Ahhhhh.

           Alan spots a Frappy’s fast food restaurant up ahead on the 
           other side of the highway.

                                 ALAN
                        There.  Over there.  

           Stuart swerves onto the shoulder and SCREECHES to a halt.  He 
           unbuckles his seatbelt.

                                 ALAN (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?  Get off at the 
                        next offramp.

                                 STUART
                        There’s no time!

           Stuart jumps out of the car and begins to run across the 
           highway.  He flails his arms like a maniac as he avoids 
           traffic and makes it to the other side.  Alan watches the 
           spectacle in horror.  Stuart reaches a fence separating the 
           highway from the street that Frappy’s is on.  He makes 
           repeated lame attempts to scale or jump over the fence.  He 
           continuously falls to the ground, hysterical.

           EXT. FRAPPY’S - MOMENTS LATER

           Stuart and Alan speed up to the entrance.  Stuart parks the 
           car at an angle over four parking spaces.  He runs out of the 
           car and towards the restaurant. 

           INT. FRAPPY’S - CONTINUOUS

           Stuart bursts in.  Alan enters behind him and sheepishly 
           stands by the door.  Stuart pushes his way past several 
           PEOPLE, making his way towards the front of the line.   
                                 STUART
                        Medical emergency...  Move...  This 
                        is a matter of life and death...      

           Stuart gets to the front of the line.  He pulls out a wad of 
           money and throws it on the counter.  Coins fly everywhere.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        I don’t have much time.

                                 CASHIER
                        Sir, there are people ahead of you.

                                 STUART
                        This is a medical emergency.  I 
                        have a condition.  I could just 
                        drop dead right here.  Do you want 
                        my blood on your hands?  

                                 CASHIER
                        Well, no...

                                 STUART
                        Okay, then.  I need a Vanilla 
                        Frappy Swirl, a French Toast 
                        Frenzy, no powdered sugar.  A Bacon-
                        ito Burrito with sausage instead of 
                        bacon.  Instead of a tortilla, can 
                        you just use lettuce?  Also, 
                        instead of cheddar Cheese, I’d like 
                        American cheese.  This is America.  
                            (yells back to Alan)
                        Hey Alan?  You want anything?

           Everyone in line looks at Alan.  

                                 ALAN
                            (way embarrassed)
                        No thanks.

           INT. FRAPPY’S - SHORT TIME LATER

           Stuart crams food into his mouth while simultaneously 
           SLURPING LOUDLY on his drink.  Customers shoot him looks.

           Alan is on the payphone.

                                 ALAN
                        ...so I’ll be there tonight.  The 
                        wedding’s still three days away.

                        promise.  

           INT. PATTERSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

           An exhausted Kristen talks on the phone, surrounded by 
           several concerned family members, including Patti, her mom 
           SALLY, her father, JIM, and her grandmother, NETTIE.

                                 KRISTEN
                        Please be careful. 

           Kristen hangs up and turns to her family.

                                 KRISTEN (CONT’D)
                        He’s fine.  The rental car broke 
                        down, and his cell phone died.  
                        He’s back on the road, and he 
                        should be in later tonight.

           Sally hugs Kristen.

                                 SALLY
                        Thank God, he’s okay.

                                 NETTIE
                        I think the whole thing’s a crock 
                        of crap, and he’s got cold feet.

                                 SALLY
                        Mother!

           Patti LAUGHS.  Kristen looks upset.

           EXT. FRAPPY’S / INT. GRETEL’S PETALS FLORIST - MOMENTS LATER

           Alan is still on the phone.  He is talking to Lancelot.

                                 LANCELOT
                        Mr. Pivnick.  You’re in luck.  I 
                        tracked down the Tiger Lillies.  
                        However, the supplier that’s 
                        getting them for us is considering 
                        this a rush order, so it’s going to 
                        cost you an additional 800 dollars.  

                                 ALAN
                        But it wasn’t supposed to be a rush 
                        order.  You guys made the mistake. 

                                 LANCELOT
                        Do you want Tiger Lillies or not?
                                 ALAN
                        Yes.  I want them.  My fiance has 
                        to have Tiger Lillies.

                                 LANCELOT
                        Okay then.  I just need to fax you 
                        the authorization form, and you 
                        need to sign it and send it right 
                        back.  Are you near a fax machine?

                                 ALAN
                        I don’t know.  Hang on.

           Alan turns to two 16-year-old KIDS in Frappy’s uniforms, who 
           are on a cigarette break.

                                 ALAN (CONT’D)
                        Do you guys have a fax machine 
                        here? 

                                 KID
                        Oh yes, your Highness.  We keep the 
                        fax machines in the south wing with 
                        the yachts and all the Rolls 
                        Royces.

           The two kids LAUGH and hi-five.  

                                 ALAN
                            (into phone)
                        No.  I’m not near a fax machine.

                                 LANCELOT
                        Well I suggest you get to one 
                        quick.  If you don’t sign this by 
                        noon, we’re gonna lose the Tiger 
                        Lillies.  

           The frustrated Alan hangs up the phone, drops in a few coins, 
           then dials another number.

                                 ALAN
                        Is this Cynthia?  I’m calling to 
                        confirm everything for the Pivnick 
                        wedding on Saturday. 

           INTERCUT - CYNTHIA’S APARTMENT / FRAPPY’S

           A small, cluttered apartment, brightly decorated with scarves 
           and beads.  The mousy, 30-something CYNTHIA paces as she 
           talks on the phone.
                                 CYNTHIA
                        I’m a little concerned that I might 
                        be losing my voice. 

                                 ALAN
                        You don’t have to speak.  You just 
                        have to play the piano.  You 
                        learned the Coldplay song, right?

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Not yet.  I don’t really like 
                        Coldplay.

                                 ALAN
                        Well my fiance does.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Got it.  Can you tell the caterer 
                        that I’m allergic to shellfish and 
                        Parmesan cheese, and that I don’t 
                        particularly care for mushrooms?

                                 ALAN
                        I’ll be sure to let them know.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Oh, one other thing. Is it cool if 
                        I get there at four instead of 
                        five?  I got Gwen Stefani tickets 
                        for that night.

                                 ALAN
                        No.  We want you there at five.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        You hired me to play for three 
                        hours.  I’d still be playing three 
                        hours, what’s the difference?

                                 ALAN
                        The difference is the reception 
                        starts at five, so the first hour, 
                        you would be playing for nobody. 

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Let me think about it.

           Cynthia hangs up.

                                 ALAN
                        Think about it..?  Hello?

           Stuart walks up as Alan repeatedly slams down the receiver.
                                 ALAN (CONT’D)
                        Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!

           A few people in the parking lot and the kid employees look 
           over at Alan.  Stuart announces to everyone...

                                 STUART
                        He has three testicles.

           Alan shoots Stuart a look.

                                 STUART
                        So, who were you talking to?

                                 ALAN
                        Nobody.

                                 STUART
                        You know, those payphones are 
                        covered with germs.  The government 
                        doesn’t want you to know, but more 
                        people contract tuberculosis using 
                        payphones than get mauled by bears. 

                                 ALAN
                        Why wouldn’t the government want 
                        you to know that?

                                 STUART
                        Exactly!  Why?

                                 ALAN
                        We need to get to a fax machine.

                                 STUART
                        How come?

                                 ALAN
                        Because I have a medical condition, 
                        and I need to use a fax machine 
                        between now and as soon as 
                        possible, or I’ll die.

                                 STUART
                        I know you’re mocking me.

                                 ALAN
                        Just get me to a fax machine.

                            (bad British accent)
                        I’ll get you to a fax machine or my 
                        name isn’t James.  James Bond.

           Stuart puts in a CD.  The James Bond Theme PLAYS. 

           EXT. HIGHWAY - SAME TIME

           In complete contrast to the music, the car drives slowly in 
           the fast lane.  Several cars speed around it.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - SHORT TIME LATER

           The car passes a sign that reads “Welcome To Toledo”.  The 
           bustling city can be seen in the near distance.

           INT. CAR - SAME TIME

           Alan stares straight ahead, stone-faced.

                                 STUART
                        Okay, now who am I?
                            (bad Australian accent)
                        Ahoy matey.  Oy, pass the 
                        boomerang.  Look a kangaroo.  My 
                        toilet flushes backwards.
                            (regular voice)
                        Give up?  Give up?  Give up?  I’m 
                        Mel Gibson.  You are terrible at 
                        this.  You’re like 0 for twenty.  

                                 ALAN
                        That’s not Mel Gibson!  You’re just 
                        saying random Australian things in 
                        a horrible accent.  If you’re going 
                        to be Mel Gibson you have to say 
                        stuff like, “I was in Lethal 
                        Weapon” or “I hate Jews.”     

                                 STUART
                        That doesn’t sound anything like 
                        Mel Gibson.  You’re not even using 
                        an Australian accent.

                                 ALAN
                        Just forget it.  Can you pull off 
                        at the next stop?  I’m sure one of 
                        those hotels has a fax machine.

                                 STUART
                            (bad Chinese accent)
                        No probrem.
                                 (MORE)
                                 STUART (cont'd)
                            (regular voice)
                        Jackie Chan.

           They drive for a few seconds.  Stuart looks at the dashboard 
           then suddenly slams on the brakes.  Alan lurches forward.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  

           EXT. HIGHWAY - SAME TIME

           The car comes to a screeching halt in the middle of the 
           highway.  Several cars swerve to avoid crashing into them.   

           INT. CAR - SAME TIME

                                 STUART 
                        Look!  The odometer is at 33,333.3 
                        miles!

                                 ALAN
                        You stopped in the middle of a busy 
                        highway to tell me that?

                                 STUART
                        I gotta get a picture.

           Stuart unbuckles his seatbelt.  He leans over into the 
           backseat and tries to find his camera in his bags.  Alan 
           nervously eyes the traffic behind them.

                                 ALAN
                        Pull over at least.  You’re gonna 
                        get us killed.

                                 STUART
                        If I pull over the odometer will 
                        change. 

           Alan’s eyes widen as he spots a semi speeding towards them.

                                 ALAN
                        Stuart!  Stuart!

                                 STUART
                        Hang on a sec.

           Stuart continues to search for his camera.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - SAME TIME

           The semi bears down on Stuart’s car.  It’s driver slams on 
           the brakes, and turns the wheel, causing the truck to 
           jackknife.  
           It slides on it’s side a few hundred feet before coming to a 
           stop blocking all lanes of traffic, inches behind Stuart’s 
           bumper.  There is a chain reaction as several cars join in 
           the pileup.

           INT. CAR - SAME TIME

           Alan is practically hyperventilating.  Stuart looks out the 
           back window, shocked.  

                                 STUART
                        Whoa.  That truck could have hit 
                        us.  It’s amazing how your life 
                        could change just like that.  

           Stuart snaps his fingers.  He then clicks a photo of the 
           odometer.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - SAME TIME

           Stuart and Alan drive off.  Behind them is a massive pile-up.

           EXT. MARRIOT HOTEL - SHORT TIME LATER

           Stuart’s car is parked out front.

           INT. MARRIOT HOTEL - LOBBY - SAME TIME

           Stuart sits at a grand piano.  He starts at the lowest note, 
           and slowly and LOUDLY PLAYS every consecutive note.  Some 
           HOTEL GUESTS give him nasty looks as they walk past.

           The anxious Alan approaches the DESK CLERK at the front desk.

                                 DESK CLERK
                        Sir, I just checked.  The fax isn’t 
                        here yet.

                                 ALAN
                        I’ve been waiting here over an 
                        hour, and the guy said he was gonna 
                        send it right away.

                                 DESK CLERK
                        I told you, I’ll let you know as 
                        soon as we get the fax.

           Alan walks up to Stuart.  Stuart stops playing the piano.

                                 STUART
                        No fax?

                                 ALAN
                        No.  This is ridiculous.  
                                 STUART
                        What’s so important about this fax 
                        anyway?

                                 ALAN
                        It’s nothing.  Stop asking.

                                 STUART
                        Can you give me a hint?  

                                 ALAN
                        No.

                                 STUART
                        Is it something medical?

                                 ALAN
                        No.  

                                 STUART
                        This is driving me crazy.  Come on, 
                        you gotta tell me something.

                                 ALAN
                        It’s personal.

                                 STUART
                        That makes me wanna know even more.  
                        What if I tell you a secret about 
                        me first?  When we were stuck on 
                        that roller coaster, I peed in my 
                        pants.

                                 ALAN
                        For the record, that isn’t a 
                        secret.

                                 STUART
                        Hey, why don’t you play something 
                        on the piano?

                                 ALAN
                        Absolutely not.  

                                 STUART
                        Why?  Because people are around?  
                        So what?  

                                 ALAN
                        I just don’t want to.
                                 STUART
                        I’ve never understood it.  You have 
                        this amazing talent, but no one’s 
                        ever even heard you play except 
                        maybe me, mom and dad.  What are 
                        you afraid of?  You need to lighten 
                        up.  Live a little.  Who knows, you 
                        might actually enjoy yourself.

                                 ALAN
                        I enjoy myself all the time.

                                 STUART
                        Please.  If you were any more 
                        uptight, you’d be a... 
                            (thinks)
                        A tightly wound, tight something 
                        that’s really tight.

                                 ALAN
                        Well said.

                                 STUART
                        You know, you really should have 
                        played at mom’s funeral.  

                                 ALAN
                        I know.  I should have played at 
                        mom’s funeral.  I wish I did.  I 
                        think about it all the time.  I 
                        regret it, okay?  Are you happy?  

                                 STUART
                        That doesn’t make me happy at all.  
                        I’m sorry.  I didn’t know.

           Alan notices a fax coming through behind the counter.  

                                 ALAN 
                        There’s my fax.  Thank God.

           He walks over.  Alan tries to get the desk clerk’s attention.  
           The desk clerk is now helping a CUSTOMER and doesn’t notice.

                                 ALAN (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me?

                                 DESK CLERK
                        Hang on a sec.  I’ll be right with 
                        you.

           The desk clerk continues with the customer.  Stuart gets up 
           and storms over.
                                 STUART
                        We will not “hang on a sec”.  My 
                        brother has been waiting a million 
                        secs already.

                                 ALAN
                        Stuart, it’s okay.

                                 STUART
                        No, it’s not.  
                            (to desk clerk)
                        We were here first.
                            (re: customer)
                        This guy just got here.

                                 DESK CLERK
                        Sir, when I am finished with this 
                        customer, then I will help you.  

                                 STUART
                            (mocking)
                        Sir when I’m finished with this 
                        customer then I will blah blah 
                        blah.

                                 DESK CLERK
                        Please don’t do that.

                                 STUART
                            (mocking)
                        Please don’t do that.
                            (then)
                        Look, jerk-o.  My brother has been 
                        waiting for this important fax for 
                        a long time.  How hard can it be to 
                        reach behind you, grab a piece of 
                        paper and hand it to him?  A blind, 
                        retarded monkey could do it.  

           The desk clerk just stands there, in shock.  Alan looks 
           embarrassed.  Beat. 

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                            (like he’s talking to a 
                             trained animal)
                        Come on.  You can do it.  Grab the 
                        paper.  Come on, moron.

           The desk clerk calmly walks over to the fax machine, removes 
           the paper and reads it.
                                 DESK CLERK
                        Is the fax you’re waiting for from 
                        a flower shop? 

                                 ALAN
                        Um, yeah.

                                 DESK CLERK
                        This isn’t it.

           The desk clerk proceeds to rip the fax into shreds.  Alan 
           watches helplessly.

                                 DESK CLERK (CONT’D)
                            (smug)
                        Why don’t you check back later?  

           INT. CAR - SHORT TIME LATER

           Stuart drives as Alan stews in the passenger seat.  

                                 STUART
                        We should have stayed.  The guy 
                        said that wasn’t your fax.

                                 ALAN
                        It was my fax.  And thanks to you, 
                        I’m never going to get it.  Just 
                        get me to Philadelphia, please.

                                 STUART
                        You know, I have the original score 
                        to the movie “Philadelphia”.
                            (off Alan’s look)
                        Never mind.

           EXT. DESOLATE STRETCH OF HIGHWAY - LATER

           The car drives down a desolate, secluded stretch of highway.

           INT. CAR - SAME TIME

           Alan is fast asleep.  Stuart looks over at him.  He’s 
           frustrated that Alan is asleep.  He CLEARS HIS THROAT, trying 
           to wake him up.  Nothing.  He HONKS his horn, and swerves the 
           car intentionally.  Nothing.  He slams on the brakes.  Alan 
           flies forward and hits the dashboard.

                                 ALAN
                        What the--?  Jesus!  What happened?
                                 STUART
                        You were sleeping, and I wanted to 
                        wake you up.  I’m bored.

                                 ALAN
                        Where the hell are we?

                                 STUART
                        I’m taking a shortcut.  It’s gonna 
                        take us a little longer but it’s 
                        worth it.

                                 ALAN
                        The definition of shortcut is that 
                        it makes the trip shorter.

                                 STUART
                        The important thing is that we’re 
                        going to bypass the toll booths.

                                 ALAN
                        You’re taking side roads so that 
                        you can save 75 cents?

                                 STUART
                        A dollar.  But the main reason is 
                        that toll booths are tools for the 
                        government to spy on us.  Toll 
                        booth?  John Wilkes Booth?  
                        Coincidence?  I don’t think so.

                                 ALAN
                        You should write a book about all 
                        this.  You can call it “I’m a 
                        Moron, and These Are All The Stupid 
                        Things I Believe.”  

                                 STUART
                        Sure.  It can be the sequel to my 
                        book “My Brother is Rude and 
                        Sometimes Says Things That Could Be 
                        Considered Hurtful”.

           The sit in silence for a beat.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        So, who were the flowers for?

                                 ALAN
                        It’s none of your business.
                                 STUART
                        You’re not exactly the flower-
                        buying kind of guy.  Are they for 
                        Chris?

                                 ALAN
                        What?  Why are you asking that?  
                        How do you know about Kris?

                                 STUART
                        While you were sleeping, you kept 
                        saying the name “Chris”.

                                 ALAN
                        What else did I say?  What do you 
                        know about Kris?

                                 STUART
                        Nothing.  All you said was the 
                        name.  So, who’s Chris?  Are the 
                        flowers for Chris?  I know there’s 
                        some story behind all this.  Tell 
                        me the story.

                                 ALAN
                        Just drop it.

                                 STUART
                        Okay.  Until you tell me, I’m just 
                        gonna imitate a car alarm.

           Stuart starts LOUDLY imitating that one car alarm that 
           changes alarms every five seconds.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        Whooooooooo.  Whooooooo.  Beep beep 
                        beep beep.  Ehhhhh.  Ehhhh.  
                        Ehhhhh.  Ehhhh.  Eee-ooh.  Eee-ooh.  
                        Eee-ooh.  Eee-ooh.  Bzzzzt.  Bzzzt.

                                 ALAN
                        Okay.  Please stop!

                                 STUART
                            (turning off “alarm”)
                        Beep-boop.

           Stuart looks at Alan excitedly.

                                 ALAN
                            (strains to make up story)
                        Kris is a... scientist friend of 
                        mine who I met at the South Pole.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 ALAN (cont'd)
                        The flowers are for him, because... 
                        he’s in the hospital.  

                                 STUART
                        That’s terrible.  What happened?

                                 ALAN
                        He was... bitten.  By a polar bear.  

                                 STUART
                        Is he gonna be okay?

                                 ALAN
                        He’s having surgery on Saturday. 
                        I’ll know more then.  I really 
                        would rather not talk about this.

                                 STUART
                        I understand.  Thank you for 
                        sharing that with me.  Sorry I did 
                        the car alarm thing.

           They drive on in silence for another beat.  Stuart suddenly 
           has an epiphany.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        Wait.  Everything suddenly makes 
                        sense to me.  Alan...  You’re gay!

                                 ALAN
                        What?  No!

                                 STUART
                        It’s okay, Alan.  I’m your brother, 
                        I still love you.

                                 ALAN
                        You’re wrong.

                                 STUART
                        It explains everything.  Why you 
                        keep sneaking away to use the 
                        phone.  Why you’ve been so 
                        secretive about your private life 
                        all these years.  Your effeminate 
                        mannerisms.

                                 ALAN
                        What’s so effeminate about my 
                        mannerisms?
                                 STUART
                        I bet I know how it happened.  You 
                        and your buddy, Chris, were stuck 
                        together in that ice station, 
                        isolated for months on end.  It was 
                        bound to happen.  I saw “Brokeback 
                        Mountain”.

                                 ALAN
                        I’m not gay.  All right?

                                 STUART
                        There’s nothing to be ashamed of.  
                        Wow.  I have a gay brother.  That’s 
                        so cool.  I always thought there 
                        was something gay about you.  

           Suddenly, the car begins to SPUTTER.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        Uh-oh.  Guess who’s out of gas?

                                 ALAN
                        Seriously?  Don’t you have a gas 
                        light that’s supposed to warn you 
                        about this?

                                 STUART
                        Yes.  It went on a ways back, but I 
                        didn’t want you to worry.

           EXT. DESOLATE STRETCH OF HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

           The car crawls to a halt on the side of the road.  Alan and 
           Stuart get out.  It’s breezy and cold.

                                 STUART
                        First, my brother’s gay.  Now, 
                        we’re out of gas.  What next?

                                 ALAN
                        Maybe somebody in one of these 
                        other cars will stop and help us.  
                        Oh no, wait, there are no other 
                        cars, because we’re in the middle 
                        of fucking nowhere, because you 
                        didn’t want to go through a stupid 
                        fucking tollbooth!

                                 STUART
                        Alan.  Indoor voice.  Please.  
                        Complaining isn’t gonna fill the 
                        gas tank.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 STUART (cont'd)
                        I saw a gas station two or maybe 
                        ten miles back.  We can walk it.

                                 ALAN
                        There’s a big difference between 
                        two and ten miles.
                            (points ahead)
                        Maybe there’s something closer if 
                        we go that way.

                                 STUART
                        I think we should go back the way 
                        we came.  It’s far, but at least we 
                        know there’s a gas station.

                                 ALAN
                        Fine.

           Stuart pops the trunk.  He pushes his bags towards the back 
           of the trunk, and puts a towel over them.   

                                 ALAN (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 STUART
                        In case someone breaks into the 
                        car, I’m hiding my stuff.

                                 ALAN
                        You think that if they break into 
                        the trunk, they’re not gonna look 
                        underneath the towel?

                                 STUART
                        It’s a deterrent.

           Stuart shuts the trunk.  They start walking.

                                 ALAN
                        At least it’s freezing out.

                                 STUART
                        So, what type of guys do you like?

                                 ALAN
                        I’m not gay.

                                 STUART
                        Are you also attracted to masculine 
                        women?

                                 ALAN
                        I’m not gay.
                                 STUART
                        Does penis size matter?

           EXT. DESOLATE STRETCH OF HIGHWAY - LATER

           The sweaty and exhausted Stuart and Alan walk along the 
           deserted highway.

                                 STUART
                        Johnny Depp or Leonardo DiCaprio?

                                 ALAN
                        Neither.

                                 STUART
                        What does sperm taste like?

                                 ALAN
                        I don’t know.

                                 STUART
                        If I kiss a lesbian, does that make 
                        me bisexual?

           A car approaches.  Stuart and Alan try to wave it down.  The 
           car HONKS at them as it speeds past.

                                 ALAN
                        Asshole!

                                 STUART
                        You can spot other gay guys, right?  
                        Is Simon Cowell gay?  

                                 ALAN
                        I wouldn’t know.

                                 STUART
                        What colors are gonna be in this 
                        Spring?   

           EXT. GAS ‘N STUFF - LATER

           A backwoods gas station/garage/general store with old gas 
           pumps out front.  Stuart and Alan stagger up to the entrance.  

           INT. GAS ‘N STUFF - CONTINUOUS

           The cluttered store is full of all kinds of useless crap.  
           Beef jerky, fishing poles, skunk traps, etc.  An amiable old 
           couple, HENRY and BETTY work behind the counter.
                                 ALAN
                        Hi, we ran out of gas way up the 
                        road.  Where are the gas cans?

                                 HENRY
                            (points)
                        Back in the corner, by the hunting 
                        gear.  If you guys like, I can give 
                        you a lift back to your car.

                                 ALAN/STUART
                        That would be great. / Wow, thanks!

           Alan and Stuart make their way to the back of the store.

                                 STUART
                        This store has everything.  

           Stuart grabs some sunglasses and puts them on.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                            (bad Arnold impersonation)
                        I’ll be back.  Eh?  Eh?

           Stuart puts back the glasses and grabs some souvenir bongos.  
           He plays them like a maniac while attempting what sounds like 
           some Swahili yodel.  Alan ignores him and grabs a gas can.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        O-eyo-yo-eyo-eyo-eyo-eyo!

           Stuart puts down the bongos, and grabs a bow and arrow.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        This is a real bow and arrow.  

                                 ALAN
                        Hey, Chief Jerky?  Put that down 
                        and let’s get out of here.

                                 STUART
                        This is really dangerous.  It 
                        shouldn’t be out here where just 
                        anybody can pick it up and shoot 
                        somebody.

           Stuart demonstrates by pulling back on the bow.  He 
           accidentally lets go, firing the arrow across the entire 
           store, and directly into the shoulder of the old man behind 
           the counter.  He lets out a feeble GROAN.

                                 BETTY
                        Oh my God!  You shot Henry!
                                 ALAN
                        Jesus, Stuart!  

                                 STUART
                        It was an accident.  I was just 
                        trying to show you that this 
                        shouldn’t be sitting out here.  See 
                        what can happen?  I was only 
                        pulling it this hard.

           Stuart demonstrates.  Again, he fires an arrow across the 
           store.  This time it hits Henry’s other shoulder.  Betty 
           SCREAMS and Henry GROANS.  Stuart and Alan look horrified.

                                 BETTY
                        Please stop shooting arrows at my 
                        husband!

           INT. GAS ‘N STUFF - SHORT TIME LATER

           Alan, Betty and a small crowd watch PARAMEDICS tend to Henry.  

                                 ALAN
                        We’re really sorry.  It was totally 
                        an accident.  Both times were 
                        totally accidents.  

           Nearby, Stuart talks to a HIGHWAY PATROLMAN.

                                 STUART
                        I was trying to make the point that 
                        it was dangerous leaving this bow 
                        and arrow just sitting out here.  I 
                        barely pulled on it.

           He pulls back on the bow.  He loses his grip, this time 
           sending the arrow flying directly into the shoulder of the 
           highway patrolman.  The patrolman SCREAMS and clutches his 
           arm.  Everyone looks over.

                                 BETTY
                        Enough!  Please, just leave.  We’ll 
                        move the arrows behind the counter.  
                        Just please get out of the store 
                        before you kill someone.

                                 STUART
                        But--

           The highway patrolman pulls his gun and points it at Stuart.

                                 HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
                        Get out.  Now.
           Everyone watches in uncomfortable silence as Alan grabs 
           Stuart and escorts him towards the door.

                                 STUART
                            (to Henry)
                        So, are you still going to give us 
                        a ride, or...
                            (off his look)
                        No?  Okay.  Anybody?  Can anybody 
                        give us a ride?

           Everyone just glares at Stuart and Alan.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        Okay, then.  

           They exit.

           EXT. DESOLATE STRETCH OF HIGHWAY - LATER

           Stuart and Alan make their way back to the car.  Alan, 
           holding a gas can, walks about 15 feet ahead of Stuart.  

                                 STUART
                        So, here’s what I’d do if I was a 
                        triplet.  I’d have me and my two 
                        other brothers dress up exactly the 
                        same.  All scary-like; Messed up 
                        hair, torn clothes, all dirty... 
                        Then we’d hitchhike on a road like 
                        this about two miles apart from 
                        each other.  A car would pass the 
                        first me and say, “whoa.  That’s a 
                        scary looking guy.”  Then two miles 
                        later they’d run into me 
                        hitchhiking again!  “Whoa!  Didn’t 
                        we just see that guy!?”  Then, two 
                        miles after that...  There I am 
                        again!  Isn’t that a great idea, 
                        Alan..?  Isn’t it?  Alan?  The 
                        triplet hitchhiking thing?  Alan?

           Alan stops and turns around.

                                 ALAN
                        You’re lucky you’re not in jail for 
                        murder right now.
                                 STUART
                        First of all, nobody died.  And if 
                        they did, for your information, it 
                        wouldn’t have been murder, it would 
                        have been involuntary manslaughter.  
                        There’s a difference.

           Stuart’s CELL PHONE RINGS to the tune of Falco’s “Rock Me 
           Amadeus”.  He answers.  Alan watches the conversation.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                            (into phone; DJ voice)
                        Congratulations!  You’re the tenth 
                        caller!  You’ve just won a dream 
                        conversation with Stuart Pivnick...  
                            (regular voice)
                        Oh, hey Mr. Munson, I--  I know, 
                        I’m so sorry.  I meant to call...  
                        Uh-huh... Uh-huh...  Right.  Okay.      

           Stuart hangs up.  He looks upset.  Beat.

                                 STUART 
                        I just got fired.

                                 ALAN
                        What happened?  Why?

                                 STUART
                        They were upset because I took the 
                        last two days off.  I guess I 
                        forgot to call and tell them.

                                 ALAN
                        I feel terrible.  You only took 
                        these days off because of me.

                                 STUART
                        Well, I did it because you needed 
                        my help.  If I had the chance to do 
                        it all over again, I’d do the same 
                        thing.  Family comes first.  I can 
                        get another job, but I only have 
                        one brother.

           Stuart goes up to Alan and hugs him.  Alan looks way guilty.  

           EXT. DESOLATE STRETCH OF HIGHWAY - EARLY EVENING

           It’s now dark out.  Alan and Stuart finally get back to the 
           car.  The trunk is wide open.
                                 ALAN
                        Someone broke into the car.

           Alan rushes up to the trunk.

                                 ALAN (CONT’D)
                        Goddammit.  They took my stuff!

           Stuart rushes up.  He leans in the trunk, and pulls his bags 
           out from under his towel, relieved.  He turns to Alan.

                                 ALAN (CONT’D)
                        Don’t say it.  

                                 STUART
                        I’m not gonna say anything.  But, 
                        if you’d put your stuff under the 
                        towel--

                                 ALAN
                        That’s not not saying anything... 

           INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Stuart starts the car, and pulls back on to the road.

           EXT. DESOLATE STRETCH OF HIGHWAY - SAME TIME

           The car rounds a bend.  There is a nice gas station literally 
           just around the curve.  

           INT. CAR - SAME TIME

                                 STUART
                        Hey, how about that?  There was a 
                        gas station right here, the whole 
                        time.  You were right.  We should 
                        have walked this way.  

           Alan shakes his head.  Stuart pulls into the gas station.

           INT. PATTERSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

           Kristen sits on the couch in her sweats.  Patti enters.

                                 PATTI
                        Are you sure you don’t want us to 
                        stay home with you?

                                 KRISTEN
                        No.  Go eat.  I wanna wait here for 
                        Alan.  
                                 PATTI
                        He should have been here already.  
                        You could be waiting a long time.  
                        You know, like years?

                                 KRISTEN
                        Why do you say that?

                                 PATTI
                        You got to admit, that his behavior 
                        has been a little fishy.  Maybe he 
                        does have cold feet.

                                 KRISTEN
                        You don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about.

                                 PATTI
                        He’s clearly in no hurry to get 
                        here.  First, he stayed in Vegas an 
                        extra day.  Then, he keeps giving 
                        you these crazy reasons why he’s 
                        still not here.  His plane was 
                        cancelled.  He lost his wallet.  
                        His rental car broke down.  You 
                        can’t even call him to see where he 
                        is, because his cell phone 
                        conveniently ran out of batteries.  

                                 KRISTEN
                        You just have trust issues because 
                        of Bill.

                                 PATTI
                        Tell me, how did Alan even rent a 
                        car with no ID?  Or get a motel 
                        room with no credit card?

                                 KRISTEN
                        I don’t know.

                                 PATTI
                        He’s lying to you about something.

                                 KRISTEN
                        Or maybe he’s telling the truth.

                                 PATTI
                        If that makes you feel better, then 
                        you just keep telling yourself 
                        that.

           Kristen looks upset.
           EXT. HIGHWAY - LATER

           Stuart and Alan are back on the main highway.  They drive 
           past a sign that reads: “Philadelphia - 286”. 

           INT. CAR - SAME TIME

                                 STUART
                        I’m so hungry...  I have to pee...  
                        I’m tired...  My back hurts...  I’m 
                        thirsty...  I’m hungry.

                                 ALAN
                        All right.  I get it.  I’m all 
                        those things too.

                                 STUART
                        I don’t think we’re gonna make it 
                        to Philly tonight.

                                 ALAN
                        Maybe we should stop at the next 
                        city.  We can get a motel, grab 
                        something to eat and get a good 
                        night’s sleep.  If we leave early 
                        enough, I can be in Philadelphia 
                        well before noon.

           EXT. FIESTA MOTEL - LATER

           A totally generic, forgettable, side-of-the-road motel.  Alan 
           and Stuart pull into the parking lot.

           INT. FIESTA MOTEL - OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Stuart and Alan enter.  Stuart taps the bell repeatedly.  
           GRADY, the shady-looking manager enters from the back. 

                                 GRADY
                        All right, okay, I hear ya.  

           Stuart continues to ring the bell.  Grady puts his hand over 
           the bell to stop him.  

                                 GRADY (CONT’D)
                        How can I help you?

                                 STUART
                        We’re looking for the new Harry 
                        Potter book.  Do you have it in 
                        stock?  
           Stuart turns to Alan and grins as if to say, “hey, aren’t I 
           funny?”  Grady looks at Stuart, completely unamused.  

                                 ALAN
                        We need a room.  Please.  

           Grady’s heavyset wife, STARLA, enters from the back.

                                 STARLA
                        Who’s ringing the damn bell?

                                 STUART
                            (raises his hand)
                        Guilty.  

           Stuart rings the bell.  Grady takes the bell and puts it 
           beneath the counter.  Stuart points at Starla’s stomach.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        Look who’s got a bun in the oven.  
                        You know if it’s a boy or a girl?

           Alan cringes.  Stuart walks over to Starla, lifts her shirt, 
           and starts rubbing her belly.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        This is gonna be a big one.  Are 
                        you having twins?

           He puts his ear to her belly.

                                 STARLA
                        I’m not pregnant.

                                 STUART
                        Please, look at you.  You are ready 
                        to pop.  Somebody get some 
                        newspaper.  We’re about to have a 
                        mess.

                                 ALAN
                        Stuart, she’s not pregnant.

                                 STUART
                        But, I felt it kick.

                                 GRADY
                        She’s just fat.  And that kicking 
                        was probably just one of the 16 
                        chimichangas she ate today.  I told 
                        you, Starla.  You’re a cow.  Moo. 
                                 STARLA
                            (screams)
                        Well you’ve got a tiny pecker!

                                 GRADY
                        Everything’s tiny next to you!

                                 STARLA
                        Stupid ass!  I hate you!

           She storms out.  Grady yells after her.

                                 GRADY
                        Whore!

           Long, uncomfortable beat.

                                 ALAN
                        So, we’d like a room?

           INT. FIESTA MOTEL - ROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

           Alan and Stuart enter the room.  Stuart drops his bags.  Alan 
           throws his jacket on the bed.  

                                 ALAN
                        Let’s get out of here.  I’m 
                        starving.

           They exit.

           EXT. ZESTY’S RESTUARANT - ESTABLISHING SHOT - LATER

           A cheesy Chili’s-type chain restaurant.

           INT. ZESTY’S RESTUARANT - SAME TIME

           Alan sits in a booth, perusing a menu.  A WAITER sets down 
           drinks and walks off.  Stuart walks up and sits down.

                                 STUART
                            (re: drink)
                        What’s this?

                                 ALAN
                        I ordered you a “Stuart Pivnick”.  
                        Tomato juice, Sprite, and chocolate 
                        syrup.

                                 STUART
                        You remembered.  I haven’t had one 
                        of these since I was like, eleven.
           Stuart, way excited, takes a huge gulp.

                                 ALAN
                        I know you must be down about 
                        losing your job, and I figured this 
                        might cheer you up a bit.

           Stuart stops drinking and makes a sour face.

                                 STUART
                        It’s not as good as I remember.  
                        Actually, it’s kind of disgusting.  
                        But, I’m gonna drink the whole 
                        thing anyway.

                                 ALAN
                        You don’t have to.

                                 STUART
                        I want to.  It was really nice of 
                        you to order this for me.  

           Stuart takes another sip and cringes.  A large party of about 
           fifteen MEXICANS take a seat at a table right behind Stuart.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        It’s been really nice seeing you 
                        again.  

                                 ALAN
                        It’s been an adventure.

                                 STUART
                        I can’t help thinking that when I 
                        drop you off in Philly, I’m not 
                        gonna see you for another eight 
                        years.  Promise me you won’t let 
                        that happen.

                                 ALAN
                        I promise.  Next time, it will be 
                        twenty years.

                                 STUART
                            (laughing)
                        Oh, Alan!

           Alan points at his menu, in an obvious attempt to deflect the 
           conversation.  

                                 ALAN
                        Do you know what you’re getting?  
                                 STUART
                        Everything looks good.  There’s too 
                        many choices. Italian.  Asian. You 
                        know what I don’t like?  Mexican.

           The entire table of Mexicans turn towards Stuart.  He is 
           oblivious.  Alan notices and tries to motion to Stuart to 
           keep his voice down.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        I hate Mexican!  Never liked 
                        Mexican!  Never will like Mexican!

           The Mexicans at the next table begin to exchange angry looks.

                                 ALAN
                            (trying to change subject)
                        Grilled cheese sounds good.

                                 STUART
                        Mexican is cheap, greasy, smelly, 
                        disgusting, and stupid.  

           One of the guys at the next table stands up and approaches.

                                 ANGRY MEXICAN
                        Excuse me.  Do you have a problem?

                                 STUART
                        Yes.  Thanks for asking.  As a 
                        matter of fact, this glass is a 
                        little dirty.  Can I get a clean 
                        one?  Thanks.

           He hands the glass to the angry Mexican, who immediately 
           smashes it to the ground.  CUSTOMERS look over.

                                 ANGRY MEXICAN
                        You think that’s funny?

                                 STUART
                        I don’t follow.

                                 ANGRY MEXICAN
                        What did you say about Mexicans?

           A bunch of the Mexicans stand up, ready to kill Stuart.  Alan 
           jumps up, trying to diffuse the situation.

                                 ALAN
                        Whoa, whoa.  This is just a big 
                        misunderstanding.  See, my brother 
                        here is talking about Mexican food.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 ALAN (cont'd)
                        He hates Mexican food.  It’s funny, 
                        really--

           BAM!  The angry Mexican punches Alan in the face.  Stuart 
           leaps into action.  He delivers a masterful series of rapid-
           fire karate kicks and punches that would make Jackie Chan 
           proud.  The rest of the Mexican party backs off in fear.  The 
           beating culminates with the angry Mexican trapped in a 
           submission hold.  Stuart bends the guy’s arm back.

                                 STUART
                        Next time, you’ll think twice 
                        before picking a fight with a 
                        Pivnick.  

           Stuart lets go of the guy.  Alan looks shocked.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        Don’t think I’m not telling your 
                        manager.

           Alan and Stuart exit.

           EXT. SLEEPING TOM MOTEL - SHORT TIME LATER

           Stuart and Alan walk towards their room.  They are holding 
           fast food bags.  Alan holds an ice bag on his cheek.

                                 STUART
                        Aren’t you gonna thank me?

                                 ALAN
                        Thank you?  I got punched in the 
                        face because of something you said.

                                 STUART
                        All I did was ask a busboy for a 
                        new glass.  If I did something 
                        wrong in there, I’m not seeing it.

                                 ALAN
                        Where did you learn to fight like 
                        that?

                                 STUART
                        For some reason, over the years, 
                        I’ve been a magnet for these 
                        confrontational, angry people.  

                                 ALAN
                        I can’t imagine why.
                                 STUART
                        I got sick of getting pushed 
                        around, so I learned to defend 
                        myself.  

           Stuart and Alan reach room 11.  Stuart tries to stick the key 
           in the door.  It isn’t working.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        That’s weird.  The key isn’t 
                        fitting.  

                                 ALAN
                        This is the right room, isn’t it?

                                 STUART
                        Yeah, room eleven.

           Stuart tries the key again.  He jiggles the doorknob.  
           Finally, the door swings open.  An angry BIKER-LOOKING DUDE 
           stands there in his underwear.

                                 BIKER-LOOKING DUDE
                        What the hell do you want?

                                 STUART
                        What are you doing in our room?  

                                 BIKER-LOOKING DUDE
                        This ain’t your room, sissy-boy.

           He slams the door.

                                 STUART
                        How did he know you were gay?

                                 ALAN
                        That’s weird.  You know what?  I 
                        don’t think this is our motel.
                            (points down the road)
                        Our motel didn’t have a gas station 
                        next to it.

                                 STUART
                        It didn’t have a swimming pool 
                        either.

                                 ALAN
                            (looks at sign)
                        “Sleeping Tom Motel”.  What was our 
                        motel called?
                                 STUART
                        I don’t know.  The something motel.

                                 ALAN
                        That helps.

                                 STUART
                        You don’t remember it either.

                                 ALAN
                        What’s it say on the key?

                                 STUART
                            (holds up key)
                        Just the room number.  

           EXT. STREET - LATER

           Stuart and Alan drive slowly down the street, trying to find 
           their motel.  The Pink Panther MUSIC PLAYS.

           INT. CAR - SAME TIME

                                 STUART
                        I recognize this street.  I think 
                        this might be it.

                                 ALAN
                        You recognize it because this is 
                        the fourth time we’ve driven down 
                        it looking for our motel.  Can you 
                        turn off the damn music?

           Stuart turns off the stereo.

                                 ALAN (CONT’D)
                        I think we should have made a right 
                        back there.

                                 STUART
                        No, there’s a motel up on the left.

                                 ALAN
                        That’s not it.  Ours had a blue 
                        sign.

                                 STUART
                        I think it had a red sign.

                                 ALAN
                        All these places look alike.  
           EXT. STREET - LATER

           It is now raining.  A WOMAN walks down the street under an 
           umbrella.  Stuart pulls up.  He rolls down the passenger 
           window and leans over Alan to talk to the woman.

                                 STUART
                        Excuse me?  We were wondering if 
                        you could give us directions?

                                 WOMAN 
                        Where are you going?

                                 STUART
                        I don’t know.

                                 WOMAN
                            (concerned)
                        Oooo-kay.

                                 STUART
                        It’s a motel.  It has a blue or red 
                        sign.  I know there’s a room 11.  

           He holds up the key.  The woman panics.  She pulls out pepper 
           spray, sprays Alan in the face, and takes off running.  Alan 
           GROANS in pain.

           EXT. GAS STATION - LATER

           The gas station is closed.  Stuart and Alan stand next to 
           each other.  Alan talks on a payphone.  His eyes are all 
           puffy and red from the pepper spray.  Stuart is on his cell.  
           In front of them, the Yellow Pages are opened to “Motels”.  

                                 ALAN
                        Hi.  Do you by any chance have an 
                        Alan or Stuart Pivnick staying 
                        there?

           Alan hangs up, frustrated.

                                 STUART
                        Hi, do you by any chance have a 
                        really fat lady who works there..?  

           He hangs up, frustrated.  Alan holds up the phone book.

                                 ALAN
                        There must be a million motels in 
                        here.  All of them sound familiar.  

           It starts raining harder.
                                 ALAN (CONT’D)
                        Great.  My jacket’s in the room.

           Alan suddenly looks concerned.

           FLASHBACK - SIDE OF THE ROAD

           Alan puts his wedding rings into his jacket pocket.

           FLASHBACK - FIESTA MOTEL ROOM

           Alan throws his jacket on the bed.

           BACK IN SCENE

                                 ALAN
                        I need to get my jacket.  We have 
                        to get back to the room.  I need my 
                        jacket.

                                 STUART
                        Alan, once we’re back in the room, 
                        you’re not gonna need a jacket.

           EXT. STREET - THREE HOURS LATER

           CHYRON: THREE HOURS LATER

           It’s now snowing, and it is totally pitch black.  Stuart and 
           Alan have clearly veered way off track.  Not only are they 
           nowhere near the highway, they are nowhere near anything.

           INT. CAR - SAME TIME

           Stuart and Alan are stressed, tired, and loopy.  

                                 STUART
                        I can’t see anything.

                                 ALAN
                        This is a nightmare.

                                 STUART
                        I’m really tired.  I was too tired 
                        before we checked into the motel.  

                                 ALAN
                        Just pull over somewhere.  We can 
                        get a little sleep.  It will be 
                        easier to find the motel when it’s 
                        light out.

           Stuart pulls the car over and turns off the engine.
                                 STUART
                        Wanna hear something funny?  With 
                        all the driving I’ve done tonight, 
                        we probably could have made it to 
                        Philadelphia.

           Alan shoots him a look.

           INT. CAR - EARLY MORNING

           It’s now light out.  Stuart and Alan stir awake.  

                                 STUART
                        Where are we?

           They take in their surroundings and suddenly look concerned.

           EXT. ICY RIVER - SAME TIME

           OVERHEAD SHOT - The car floats slowly on a huge chunk of ice 
           in the middle of a half-frozen river.

           INT. CAR - SAME TIME

           Alan and Stuart panic.  

                                 ALAN
                        You parked in the middle of a 
                        river.

                                 STUART
                        It wasn’t a river when I parked.

           Stuart pulls out his camera and takes a picture.

           EXT. ICY RIVER - SAME TIME

           The car begins to pick up speed as it floats downstream on 
           the mini-iceberg.

           INT. CAR - SAME TIME

           Stuart instinctively attempts to steer.  He HONKS the horn.  
           Alan rolls his eyes.

           EXT. ICY RIVER - SAME TIME

           They start floating even faster down the river.  
           INT. CAR - SAME TIME

                                 ALAN
                        We’re going faster!  We’re going 
                        faster!

           Stuart pumps the brakes.

                                 STUART
                        The brakes aren’t working!

                                 ALAN
                        Hitting the brakes isn’t going to 
                        help!

                                 STUART
                        Then why are you telling me that 
                        we’re going faster?  What do you 
                        expect me to do about it?

                                 ALAN
                        Nothing.  I was just commenting on 
                        what a fucked-up situation this is, 
                        and how it’s getting more and more 
                        fucked-up.

           EXT. ICY RIVER - SAME TIME

           The car is now careening towards a cliff.

           INT. CAR - SAME TIME

                                 STUART
                        What is it with you and the f-word?  
                        You swear a lot.  Is it really 
                        necessary?

           Alan notices the rapidly approaching cliff. 

                                 ALAN
                        Well, we’re about to go flying off 
                        a cliff.  Perhaps you can suggest a 
                        less offensive word that captures 
                        the mood? 

           Stuart looks ahead, towards the cliff and freaks.

                                 STUART
                        Fuck-Cock-Piss-Shit-Motherfucker-
                        Fuuuuuuuuuck!!!
           EXT. ICY RIVER - SAME TIME

           Stuart and Alan both SCREAM and SWEAR as the car reaches the 
           precipice.  They fly over the edge, and become airborne.  

           The car flies several hundred feet, before it comes crashing 
           down on land.

           INT. CAR - SAME TIME

           Stuart and Alan attempt to catch their breath.  They seem 
           shocked that they are still alive.

           EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - SAME TIME

           The car immediately begins rolling forward, down the side of 
           the heavily wooded mountain.

           INT. CAR - SAME TIME

           Stuart and Alan resume SCREAMING and SWEARING as the car 
           speeds out of control towards the bottom of the mountain.  
           Stuart keeps HONKING the horn.

           EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS

           The car reaches the bottom of the mountain, and continues 
           rolling forward through the woods at an ungodly speed.  The 
           car narrowly misses trees and rocks as it speeds along.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

           The car emerges from the woods, and careens out on to the 
           main highway.  

           Other cars SCREECH to a halt, and swerve to avoid Stuart and 
           Alan, as they fly across several lanes of traffic and the 
           center divider, before crashing through a fence on the 
           opposite side of the highway.  

           The car finally comes to a stop directly in front of... The 
           Fiesta Motel.

           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

                                 STUART
                        Hey.  Isn’t that our motel?

           Alan looks over, then begins LAUGHING hysterically.  Stuart 
           joins in.  It’s one of those great-to-be-alive laughs.
           INT. PATTERSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Kristen is really upset.  Her family and Dana are trying to 
           comfort her.  Everyone looks like they’ve been up all night.

                                 KRISTEN
                        Something happened to him.  I know 
                        it.  He’s hurt or dead.

                                 JIM
                        Honey, I’m sure he’s okay.  There’s 
                        probably a really good explanation 
                        for all of this.

                                 PATTI
                        Yeah, like he’s fleeing the country 
                        so he doesn’t have to marry you.

                                 KRISTEN
                        Give me a break, Patti.

                                 SALLY
                        Maybe he took a detour to buy you a 
                        special gift.

                                 NETTIE
                        Balls.  He probably ran off with 
                        some coked-up hooker he met in 
                        Vegas.  

                                 SALLY/JIM
                        Mom! / Nettie!

                                 NETTIE
                        I’m just being realistic.  These 
                        things happen.  I just read about a 
                        guy who had three wives in three 
                        states and none of them knew about 
                        each other. 

                                 KRISTEN
                        Okay.  Great suggestions everybody.  
                        Thanks.  I feel much better now.

                                 DANA
                        Listen, Kristen.  There is a guy at 
                        work, who I think you would really 
                        like.  He’s not my type, but--

                                 KRISTEN
                        Are you trying to set me up with 
                        another guy?  Alan could be dead.
                                 PATTI
                        Kristen, this is a guy who proposed 
                        to you in an e-mail.  If he was 
                        having second thoughts, it’s not 
                        like he’d exactly be open with you 
                        about it.

                                 KRISTEN
                        Are you enjoying yourself?  You’re 
                        happy about this, aren’t you?  Just 
                        because your marriage didn’t work 
                        out, it’s like you’re rooting for 
                        my marriage to fail.

                                 JIM
                        Girls!  Girls!  Calm down.  I think 
                        we’re all getting a little ahead of 
                        ourselves here...  Kristen’s right.  
                        Alan’s probably just hurt or dead 
                        or something.

           Kristen starts crying.

           INT. FIESTA MOTEL - ROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

           Stuart and Alan walk into the room.  They’re still laughing. 

                                 STUART
                        Excuse me?  Can you tell me how to 
                        get to the Fiesta Motel?  Sure.  
                        Just make a left on third street, 
                        take the iceberg, then go down the 
                        waterfall...

           They both crack up.  Stuart goes into the bathroom.  Alan 
           looks to make sure Stuart isn’t watching, then grabs his 
           jacket.  He reaches into the pocket and pulls out his wedding 
           rings.  He breathes a sigh of relief.  Stuart starts to exit 
           the bathroom.  Alan quickly hides the rings under the pillow.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        That was the most satisfying pee.  
                        You know, sometimes, how it’s just 
                        really fun to pee?

                                 ALAN
                        I’m gonna take a quick shower, then 
                        let’s get out of here. 

           Alan goes into the bathroom.  Stuart lies down on the bed and 
           turns on the TV.  He starts rearranging the pillows, and 
           discovers the box with the wedding rings.  Stuart opens the 
           box.  He looks at the rings, shocked.  
           INT. FIESTA MOTEL - ROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

           Alan comes out of the bathroom, and sees Stuart sitting on 
           the bed quietly.

                                 STUART
                        Guess what I just found under the 
                        pillow..?  Two wedding rings. 

           Alan looks busted.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        Obviously whoever was staying here 
                        before us left them here.

                                 ALAN
                            (relieved)
                        Right.  Sure.  Makes sense.

                                 STUART
                        That poor couple. They must be 
                        freaking out. Can you imagine 
                        losing your wedding rings?  They 
                        were beautiful.  You should have 
                        seen them.   

                                 ALAN
                        Should have?  I mean, I can still 
                        see them now, right?  You still 
                        have them here, don’t you?

                                 STUART
                        Of course not.  I took them up to 
                        the lost and found.  The guy at the 
                        front desk said he knows who the 
                        rings belong to, and promised me 
                        he’d return them.  I’m a hero!

           Alan races out of the room.  Stuart looks confused.

           INT. FIESTA MOTEL - OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Grady and Starla stand behind the counter.  Starla is 
           admiring her new ring, which she has crammed on to her pinky.  
           Grady is holding Alan’s other ring.  

                                 STARLA
                        This is beautiful.  It fits 
                        perfectly.

                                 GRADY
                        I’m sorry I called you a whore.
           Alan rushes in.  He immediately sees the rings.

                                 ALAN
                        There’s been a huge 
                        misunderstanding.  My brother just 
                        turned in those rings.  They 
                        actually belong to me.  

                                 GRADY
                        Rings?  I don’t know what you’re 
                        talking about.

                                 ALAN
                        Look, I don’t want a problem here.  
                        Just give me back my rings.

                                 GRADY
                        Well, if you don’t want a problem, 
                        I suggest you just turn around and 
                        walk back out that door.  

                                 ALAN
                        You... asshole!

           Alan lunges at Grady.  In one motion, he grabs the ring 
           Grady’s holding, and pushes him over the counter.  Alan then 
           turns to Starla. 

                                 ALAN (CONT’D)
                        Are you gonna give me the ring?  Or 
                        am I gonna have to take it?  

           Starla holds out her hand.  

                                 STARLA
                            (disappointed)
                        Take it...

           Alan walks towards her to take the ring off her finger.  As 
           he reaches her, Starla abruptly makes her hand into a fist 
           and punches Alan in the face.  

                                 STARLA (CONT’D)
                        ...over my dead body!

                                 ALAN
                        Oh, it’s on.

           They begin to wrestle.  The entire time, Alan tries to pull 
           the ring off her finger.  As they tussle, Grady runs behind 
           the counter and grabs his shotgun.  He tries to get a clear 
           shot at Alan, but his line of fire is obscured by his wife.  
           As the fight continues, Starla’s blouse gets ripped open, 
           exposing her mammoth breasts.  As if Starla’s fists weren’t 
           enough, Alan is now also being pummeled by the flopping 
           boobs.  She manages to pin Alan against the wall.  His face 
           is wedged between her chest.  He struggles for air, as she 
           continues to repeatedly punch his sides with her fists.

           Stuart enters and sees Alan and Starla wrestling. 

                                 STUART
                        Whoa!

           Stuart then looks over and sees Grady with the shotgun.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        Whoa!!

           Stuart looks back towards his brother, just as Stuart manages 
           to flip Starla around.  Stuart sees her massive boobs.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        Whoa!!!  

           Stuart pulls out his camera and snaps a picture.  Alan grabs 
           Starla’s hand.  He lifts his foot and puts it on Starla’s 
           stomach to brace himself.  He then pulls and pulls on the 
           ring, finally ripping it off of her finger.  The momentum 
           sends Starla flying backwards.  She crashes into her husband, 
           causing him to discharge a round into the ceiling.  They both 
           go crashing into the wall.  

                                 ALAN
                        Run!

           Stuart and Alan run out of the office.  Grady gives chase.

           EXT. FIESTA MOTEL - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           Stuart and Alan race towards their car.  Grady is right on 
           their tail, firing at them with his shotgun.

                                 ALAN
                        Why are you shooting at me?  These 
                        are my rings you jerk!  I can’t 
                        steal something that belongs to me!

           Stuart takes a picture of Grady shooting at them.

                                 ALAN (CONT’D)
                        And you stop taking pictures!

           Stuart and Alan get in the car and peel out.
           EXT. SIDE OF THE ROAD - SHORT TIME LATER

           The car is pulled over.  Stuart and Alan stand beside the 
           car, catching their breath.

                                 STUART
                        I don’t get it.  Those are your 
                        rings?  

                                 ALAN
                        Yes.  These are my rings.  And you 
                        gave them to that bumfuck hillbilly 
                        asshole and his fuckpig wife.  

           Stuart looks puzzled.  Alan loses it.

                                 ALAN (CONT’D)
                        I can’t take it anymore.  The last 
                        three days have been a total 
                        nightmare.  My entire life, you’ve 
                        done nothing but cause me pain, 
                        grief and embarrassment. You know 
                        why I left Chicago?  It wasn’t 
                        because I got a job at the South 
                        Pole, it wasn’t because mom died, 
                        it wasn’t because I’m gay, and it 
                        wasn’t because I have a third 
                        testicle.  I left Chicago because 
                        you’re in Chicago.  And guess what, 
                        I don’t really work at the South 
                        Pole, and I’m not on my way to some 
                        stupid scientist convention.  I’m 
                        on my way to my wedding.  A wedding 
                        that isn’t going to have any Tiger 
                        Lillies because of you.  A wedding 
                        that you almost ruined without even 
                        knowing about it.  A wedding that 
                        you’re not invited to, because I 
                        don’t want any of my new friends, 
                        or my new family, and especially my 
                        wife, to know that you even exist! 

           Stuart looks completely devastated.  Long, sad beat.

                                 STUART
                            (pathetic)
                        Wow.  Okay.  If that’s how you 
                        feel...  I appreciate your honesty.  
                        I’m sorry I ruined your entire 
                        life.  
           INT. CAR - SHORT TIME LATER

           Stuart and Alan both stare straight ahead in total silence.  
           Stuart is clearly fighting back tears.  It is the most 
           awkward, uncomfortable ride ever.

           EXT. ZESTY’S RESTUARANT - SHORT TIME LATER

           Alan and Stuart stand in front of the restaurant.  Stuart 
           stares at his brother sadly.

                                 ALAN
                        You don’t have to sit here and wait 
                        for the taxi with me.  You can go.

                                 STUART
                        Here.  I guess I should probably 
                        give you this back.

           Stuart hands Alan his wallet.

                                 ALAN
                        My wallet?  What are you doing with 
                        my wallet?

                                 STUART
                        I took it when you were sleeping at 
                        my apartment.  So that you couldn’t 
                        get on the plane.  

                                 ALAN
                        Why would you do that?

                                 STUART
                        You don’t think that I know how you 
                        feel about me?  I can count the 
                        number of times you’ve called or e-
                        mailed me in eight years on one 
                        hand, and I’d still have three 
                        fingers left over.  Just to 
                        clarify, I am counting the thumb as 
                        a finger...  I just wanted to spend 
                        as much time with you as possible.  
                        I thought maybe if you spent a 
                        little time with me, maybe you’d 
                        like me more.  I guess that didn’t 
                        work out.  

                                 ALAN
                        So you took my wallet?
                                 STUART
                        I also pulled over the first night 
                        when you fell asleep just to 
                        prolong the trip.  Also, I ran out 
                        of gas on purpose.  I wouldn’t have 
                        done it if I knew you were on the 
                        way to your wedding.

           Alan shakes his head in disbelief.  A taxi pulls up.  Alan 
           opens the door to the taxi.

                                 ALAN
                        Well, I guess this is goodbye.  

                                 STUART
                        Good luck with the rest of your 
                        life. 

                                 ALAN
                        Yeah.  You too.

                                 STUART
                        You know, Alan, this didn’t have to 
                        be the worst week ever.  You never 
                        even gave it a chance.  Try to 
                        lighten up.  If you opened up a 
                        bit, you might not be so miserable.  

           Alan looks pensive.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        And always remember, don’t be 
                        afraid to drink the cheese.  

           Alan looks confused.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        Have a nice wedding.  I’m sure your 
                        fiance is a very nice guy.  

           Stuart gets into his car.  Alan gets into the taxi and looks 
           back at Stuart.  Stuart takes a photo of Alan, then pulls out 
           the CD of “Terms of Endearment”.  He puts it on.  The sad 
           instrumental SCORE BLASTS from the stereo. 

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                            (singing sadly)
                        My brother / is going to get 
                        married / and I’m not even invited 
                        / because my brother hates me...

           Stuart continues to sing as he drives off.  
           EXT. PATTERSON HOUSE - AFTERNOON

           Alan gets out of the taxi and walks up to the front door.  He 
           SIGHS, then RINGS the doorbell.  Kristen opens the door.  Her 
           family stands behind her.  Kristen and Alan hug.

                                 KRISTEN
                        Oh my God, you’re okay.

           Kristen then pushes Alan away.

                                 KRISTEN (CONT’D)
                        What the hell is going on?  Where 
                        have you been?  I know you haven’t 
                        been straight with me.  Is there 
                        someone else?  Do you still love 
                        me?  Do you still want to marry me?  
                        I want the truth.  Don’t bullshit 
                        me.

                                 ALAN
                        You know how I told you that I 
                        don’t have any family?  Well, that 
                        isn’t exactly true.  

                                 KRISTEN
                        Don’t tell me you’re one of those 
                        assholes that has a bunch of wives 
                        and kids scattered all over the 
                        place.

                                 ALAN
                        No no no.  It’s nothing like 
                        that...  I have a brother.

           INT. PATTERSON HOUSE - DEN - SHORT TIME LATER

           Alan is slumped on the couch.  Kristen looks at him, upset.

                                 KRISTEN
                        I don’t know what to say.  I can’t 
                        believe you’ve been keeping this a 
                        secret from me all these years.   

                                 ALAN
                        You don’t understand.  

                                 KRISTEN
                        I can’t imagine what your brother 
                        could have done that was so 
                        horrible that you would pretend he 
                        doesn’t even exist.  What is it 
                        about him?  You can tell me.
           Kristen puts her hand on Alan’s shoulder.  He takes a deep 
           breath.

                                 ALAN
                        He sings in his sleep.  He can only 
                        read out loud.  He drives the speed 
                        limit.  He has to eat his food in 
                        alphabetical order.  He thinks OJ 
                        is innocent.  He’s convinced JFK 
                        faked his own death.  In third 
                        grade, he told Suzy Carmichael that 
                        I had a crush on her and totally 
                        ruined my chances with her.  He 
                        puts ketchup on his pancakes and 
                        maple syrup on his hamburgers.  He 
                        thinks Deal or No Deal is a game of 
                        strategy.  He actually sabotaged my 
                        trip so he could spend time with 
                        me!  

                                 KRISTEN
                        You disowned your only living 
                        family member, because he’s 
                        annoying?

                                 ALAN
                        He almost made me miss our wedding!

                                 KRISTEN
                        I don’t know what I’m more upset 
                        about.  The fact that you’ve been 
                        lying to me about him this whole 
                        time, or the fact that this is how 
                        you treat your brother.  He’s your 
                        family.  In two days, I’m gonna be 
                        your family.  God forbid I should 
                        develop some annoying habits.  What 
                        if our kids want ketchup on their 
                        pizza?  Are we gonna give them up 
                        for adoption?

           Kristen leaves the room.  Alan SIGHS.

           MONTAGE - THE TIME LEADING UP TO THE WEDDING

           Green Day’s “Wake Me Up When September Ends” PLAYS.

           INT. PATTERSON HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT - MONTAGE

           Alan lies in bed alone.  Kristen enters the room.  Alan is 
           clearly surprised to see her.  She gets into bed and curls up 
           next to him.  They kiss.  Everything is okay.
           INT. MOTEL - LATE NIGHT - MONTAGE

           Stuart lies in bed by himself and looks sad.  He watches 
           “Deal or No Deal” on the motel TV.  He bangs on the wall 
           behind the bed, clearly trying to get the couple in the next 
           room to keep it down.

           INT. PATTERSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON - MONTAGE

           Alan sits on the couch talking on the phone.  Kristen sits 
           down next to him as he hangs up.  She holds up the “Wedding 
           Checklist”, and crosses a couple of items off.  The list is 
           complete.  She and Alan hug.

           EXT. PARK - AFTERNOON - MONTAGE

           Stuart sits alone on a park bench.  He is looking at photos 
           on his digital camera.  He sees the picture of him and Alan 
           at their parents’ graves; he and Alan upside-down on the Ring 
           of Fire; Grady aiming a shotgun; and Alan in the taxi looking 
           back at Stuart.

           INT. RESTAURANT - EVENING - MONTAGE

           It’s the Pivnick-Patterson Rehearsal Dinner.  Alan and 
           Kristen are surrounded by FRIENDS and FAMILY.  Everybody is 
           laughing and having a great time.  

           INT. DINER - EVENING - MONTAGE

           Stuart sits at a table all alone.  He stares longingly at a 
           HAPPY FAMILY in a booth across from him.  An OLDER WAITRESS 
           sets a plate of food in front of Stuart.  He quickly examines 
           the sandwich and begins to complain.  He pulls out his tape 
           recorder.  The waitress looks at him like he’s crazy.

           END MONTAGE

           EXT. WEDDING HALL - DAY

           It’s the day of the wedding.  Alan, Kristen, and her 
           immediate family pose for a photo in front of the main 
           entrance.  Everyone is dressed for the wedding.  Alan and 
           Kristen are beaming.  They share a smile.  Cynthia, the 
           pianist, walks directly into the photo and up to Alan.  
           Everyone, especially The PHOTOGRAPHER, seems a little miffed.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        You’re Alan, right?  I’m Cynthia, 
                        the pianist.  Listen, I’m going to 
                        need a roll of paper towels?  I 
                        always cry at weddings and I’m 
                        allergic to Kleenex.

                                 CYNTHIA (cont'd)
                        I start crying, I go to wipe the 
                        tears, I sneeze.  I wipe my nose, 
                        then I sneeze.  I wipe my nose 
                        again, then I sneeze... 

                                 ALAN
                        Got it.  We’ll get you some paper 
                        towels.  The piano is in there. 

           Cynthia enters the Wedding Hall.  The Photographer motions 
           for everyone to move inside.

           INT. WEDDING HALL - CONTINUOUS

           The hall is beautifully decorated.  The floral arrangements 
           are breathtaking.  There is an over-abundance of Tiger 
           Lillies.  Alan and Kristen enter, and are both taken aback.

                                 KRISTEN
                        Tiger Lillies.  Alan, I can’t 
                        believe you did this.  You said 
                        they couldn’t get Tiger Lillies.  
                        This is the best surprise ever.

           Kristen gives Alan a big hug.  Alan looks shocked.  

                                 ALAN
                        I wish I could take credit for 
                        this, but I’m just as surprised as 
                        you are.

           They spot a FLORIST putting the finishing touches on one of 
           the arrangements, and approach.  

                                 ALAN (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me?  Where did these Tiger 
                        Lillies come from?

                                 FLORIST
                        You’re Alan Pivnick?

                                 ALAN
                        Yeah.

                                 FLORIST
                        This is for you.

           He hands Alan an envelope.  Alan and Kristen exchange curious 
           looks.  Alan pulls out a small tape recorder and hits play.

                                 STUART’S VOICE
                            (on recorder)
                        Alan, this is Stuart.  I took care 
                        of the flowers for you.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 STUART’S VOICE (cont'd)
                        It’s my wedding gift.  I hope Chris 
                        likes them, and that you’re out of 
                        the doghouse.  I want you to know 
                        that no mater what, I’ll always 
                        love you, because you’re my 
                        brother.  I’m sorry for... well, 
                        everything.

           Alan stops the tape.  He smiles.  Kristen shakes her head.

                                 ALAN
                        What?

                                 KRISTEN
                        He’s sorry?  He’s apologizing to 
                        you?  Jesus, Alan, don’t you think 
                        you’re the one who should be 
                        apologizing to him?  I can’t 
                        believe I’m marrying such an 
                        asshole.  I have to finish getting 
                        ready.  I’ll see you at the altar.

           She gives him a peck on the cheek and starts to walk off.  
           She stops and turns back to Alan.

                                 KRISTEN (CONT’D)
                        You have a nice big family now, but 
                        you’re all he’s got.

           She walks off.  It’s obvious Alan feels like a jerk.  He 
           stares at the Tiger Lillies, and then walks outside.  

           ANGLE - PIANO  

           Cynthia is literally bathing the piano keys in Purell.  
           Nettie stands nearby.

                                 CYNTHIA
                            (to Nettie)
                        You wouldn’t believe the kind of 
                        things they find on these pianos.  
                        Traces of feces, blood, mustard.  

           EXT. WEDDING HALL - SECONDS LATER

           Alan paces with a cell phone in one hand and Stuart’s tape 
           recorder in the other.  He takes a deep breath and dials.  

                                 ALAN
                            (into phone)
                        Stuart.  It’s Alan...  I’m calling 
                        to thank you for the flowers.    
                        They’re amazing...  I don’t really 
                        deserve them.

                                 ALAN (cont'd)
                        I haven’t exactly been the best 
                        brother...  I guess, I’m also 
                        calling to apologize for all that 
                        mean stuff I said and for lying and 
                        for the way I’ve kinda always 
                        treated you...  I really wish you 
                        were here at my wedding.   

           We WIDEN OUT to reveal Stuart is standing directly behind 
           Alan.  He’s holding his cell phone to his ear and tearing up.

                                 STUART
                            (into phone)
                        Turn around.

           Alan turns around and is shocked to see Stuart.  

                                 ALAN
                        What are you doing here?  How did 
                        you--

                                 STUART
                        I just wanted to see you get 
                        married.  I was gonna watch you 
                        from that window over there.  I was 
                        gonna stand on those boxes.

           Stuart points over to the side of the church, where there are 
           several boxes stacked by a high window.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        I know I’m not invited.  You’re not 
                        mad, are you? 

                                 ALAN
                        No.  Actually, I’m really glad 
                        you’re here.

           Alan smiles and hugs Stuart.  Stuart is beaming.

                                 ALAN (CONT’D)
                        Why don’t we go inside so you can 
                        meet our new family...

           Alan escorts an excited Stuart into the Wedding Hall.

           INT. RECEPTION AREA - LATER THAT NIGHT

           A huge outdoor tent is set up for the reception.  The crowded 
           reception is packed with WEDDING-GOERS eating, drinking, 
           dancing, and having a great time.  Alan and Kristen watch 
           Stuart, who is the life of the party on the dance floor.  
           Nearby, a very drunk Dana dances with a MAN who has a huge, 
           hairy mole on his face.     
           INT. RECEPTION HALL - LATER

           Cynthia walks up to Alan.  She holds up a wall thermometer. 

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Can you have them turn up the air 
                        conditioning?  Whenever I’m indoors 
                        and the temperature gets above 74, 
                        I get a migraine. 

                                 ALAN
                        You brought your own thermometer?
                            (suddenly gets thought)
                        Wait a second.

           Alan motions for Stuart to come over.  

                                 STUART
                        Hey, Alan. There’s a guy in the 
                        bathroom giving out expired gum.   

                                 ALAN
                        I’ll get right on it... Stuart this 
                        is Cynthia.  Cynthia, my brother, 
                        Stuart.

           Stuart shakes Cynthia’s hand.

                                 STUART
                            (re: thermometer)
                        Is that a tungsten thermometer?  
                        You know, 9 out of 10 times those 
                        are completely inaccurate.  Usually 
                        only a fraction of a percentage but 
                        that could be the difference 
                        between a fun afternoon and a 
                        serious earache.  

           Stuart and Cynthia continue to mingle.  Alan looks at them 
           proudly as if to say, “my work here is done.”    

           INT. RECEPTION HALL - LATER

           Kristen is dancing with Patti.  She waves to Alan and motions 
           for him to come dance.  He waves her off.

                                 PATTI
                        I’m not gonna say anything... I’m 
                        sorry I gave you such a hard time 
                        about Alan and the wedding.  I 
                        guess maybe I am a little jealous. 
                        I’m actually really happy for you.
                                 KRISTEN
                        Thank you... I’m sorry if I’ve made 
                        you feel bad about your situation 
                        with Bill.  I know I can be a 
                        little insensitive.  We’re sisters.  
                        We should be more supportive of 
                        each other.  

                                 PATTI
                        It’s a deal.
                            (smiles, then)
                        I promise I wont give you a hard 
                        time when you and Alan break up.

           They both LAUGH, then hug.

           INT. RECEPTION HALL - LATER

           Everyone is seated for dinner.  Alan takes a deep breath, 
           then starts hitting a glass with a knife to get everyone’s 
           attention.  He stands, grabs a microphone and addresses the 
           guests.  Kristen exchanges surprised looks with Patti and 
           Dana as if to say “I can’t believe he’s doing this.”

                                 ALAN
                        I’m not really good at this speech-
                        talking stuff.  See?  I just said 
                        speech-talking stuff and I’m pretty 
                        sure that’s lame.  

           Several wedding guests LAUGH.

                                 ALAN (CONT’D)
                        I guess all I have to do is speak 
                        from my heart, and say how I feel.  
                        Well, I feel great!  I have great 
                        friends.  I have an amazing new 
                        family.  

           Alan directs his attention to the family table.

                                 ALAN (CONT’D)
                        From day one, you all welcomed me 
                        with open arms, and treated me like 
                        a member of the family.  I haven’t 
                        been part of a family in a really 
                        long time...  

           The family looks genuinely touched.  
                                 ALAN (CONT’D)
                        This was partially my fault, 
                        because I have a family member who 
                        wanted to be a part of my life this 
                        whole time that I overlooked, and 
                        took for granted... And that’s my 
                        brother, Stuart.  

           Alan looks at Stuart.  Stuart fights back tears.  

                                 WEDDING GUESTS
                        Awwwwww.

                                 ALAN
                        Stuart, this is the most important 
                        day of my life, and I’m really glad 
                        you’re here to share it with me.  

           Stuart is overcome with joy.  Alan turns to Kristen.

                                 ALAN
                        One other person I’m glad is here, 
                        is my lovely wife.  I suppose, that 
                        if you weren’t here, this whole day 
                        would probably be completely 
                        different.  I want to thank you for 
                        your patience and understanding.  
                        And for teaching me about love and 
                        the meaning of family.  And I can’t 
                        wait to start creating new family 
                        members with you.  

           Alan catches himself and turns to Kristen’s father.

                                 ALAN (CONT’D)
                        I don’t mean the physical act of 
                        creating them.  Not that I don’t 
                        look forward to that-- I mean, well 
                        you know what I mean.  This is why 
                        I shouldn’t speak in front of 
                        people.

           The guests LAUGH and CLAP.  Alan turns to Kristen.

                                 ALAN (CONT’D)
                        I recently went on kind of an 
                        adventure, and I found out a few 
                        things about myself.  A guy pointed 
                        out that I’m a little uptight, and 
                        that maybe that’s been keeping me 
                        from making the most of my life.  
                                 STUART
                            (yells out)
                        Is the guy me?!  Are you talking 
                        about me?  Is the adventure you’re 
                        talking about our road trip?!

                                 ALAN
                        Yes.  Anyway, I know sometimes I’m 
                        not good at expressing myself 
                        emotionally.  I know that’s no way 
                        to go through life.  I don’t wanna 
                        be that guy anymore.  Stuart also 
                        told me not to “be afraid to drink 
                        the cheese”.  It’s not a very good 
                        metaphor, but I think I know what 
                        he was getting at.  Life is too 
                        short not to make the most of it.

           Alan confidently walks over to the piano.

                                 ALAN (CONT’D)
                        I should have played piano at my 
                        mothers’ funeral, but I didn’t.  
                        Now I wanna play for Kristen.  
                        Because I know if I don’t, I’ll 
                        regret it for the rest of my life.  
                        I wouldn’t be doing this if it 
                        wasn’t for Stuart... I also 
                        probably wouldn’t be doing this if 
                        Cynthia, the piano girl, learned 
                        the song like I asked her to.

                                 SALLY
                        I didn’t know Alan plays piano.

                                 KRISTEN
                        I didn’t know either.

           People watch in awe as Alan plays an incredible, moving, 
           rendition of Coldplay’s “Trouble”.  Kristen is moved to 
           tears.  Stuart SOBS like a baby.  Everybody APPLAUDS as Alan 
           finishes and walks back to Kristen.  He kisses her and sits.

                                 KRISTEN (CONT’D)
                        Is there anything else I don’t know 
                        about you?

                                 ALAN
                        I don’t like your lasagna as much 
                        as I pretend to.  But that’s pretty 
                        much it.  I swear.
           Stuart jumps up.  He grabs the microphone and begins banging 
           his full wine glass with a spoon.

                                 STUART
                        Okay, my turn!  My turn!

           Stuart bangs on the glass so hard that it shatters, spilling 
           red wine all over Kristen’s wedding dress.  She looks upset.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        Cheap glasses.

           Kristen looks over at Alan.  Alan grins as if to say, “I told 
           you he was annoying.”

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        First off, I would like to say that 
                        I asked for my salad dressing on 
                        the side, so if I can get a fresh 
                        salad, that would be great.  
                        Thanks.  

           Stuart CLEARS HIS THROAT for about ten seconds longer than 
           necessary.  

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        I just want to say that it means so 
                        much to me to be here.  

           Stuart looks down at his wrist, and notices that it’s 
           bleeding - a lot.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        I must have cut myself on the wine 
                        glass.  I thought that was wine, 
                        but it’s definitely blood... 

           Stuart becomes woozy, but continues on.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        Uh, where was I?  Um, nothing’s 
                        more important than family, and my 
                        brother’s the only family I have...  
                        Feeling dizzy.

           People begin to look concerned as more blood begins dripping 
           from Stuart’s sleeve.  Stuart grabs his arm and wobbles.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        I better speed this up.  I recently 
                        lost my job.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        I now realize that it was a 
                        blessing in disguise, because now I 
                        can move to Los Angeles and start a 
                        new life with Alan and Kristen!

           Alan’s jaw drops in shock. 

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        I also want to say that Kristen 
                        seems wonderful, and that I am just 
                        blown away by how much Kris talks 
                        and looks like a woman.  You would 
                        never know that she’s really a man. 

           Everyone looks confused.  Alan shakes his head.  Stuart 
           begins to teeter back and forth.  He passes out and falls 
           backwards into an outdoor heater.  The heater falls over into 
           table, instantly igniting the tablecloth.  People begin to 
           scatter as the fire spreads quickly throughout the tent.  
           Alan and Kristen hold hands as they run towards the exit.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. DEAL OR NO DEAL SET - AFTERNOON - MONTHS LATER

           Stuart is a contestant on “Deal or No Deal”.  He stands 
           smugly next to HOWIE MANDELL.  There is only one MODEL left 
           holding a suitcase.  On the money board, the only two numbers 
           left are “.01”, and “$1,000,000”.  The offer on the board 
           reads “$512,000”.  The STUDIO AUDIENCE is going crazy.

                                 HOWIE MANDELL
                        I’ve never seen anything like this.  
                        You have eliminated suitcase after 
                        suitcase with reckless abandon.  Up 
                        till now, you’ve ignored every 
                        phone call from the banker.  And 
                        somehow, you are now left with only 
                        two choices.  Inside your suitcase 
                        is either a penny or a million 
                        dollars.  

           Stuart nods smugly off to the side of the stage, where the 
           friends and family of the contestants stand.  Alan stands 
           next to a very pregnant Kristen, and Cynthia, the piano 
           player.  They all look very nervous.

                                 HOWIE MANDELL (CONT’D)
                        The final offer is $512,000.  
                        Stuart Pivnick... Deal or No Deal?

           Howie flips open the lid that covers the “Deal” button.
                                 ALAN/KRISTEN/CYNTHIA
                        Take the money. / Take the deal!

                                 STUART
                        Howie?  I’ve known from the second 
                        I stepped on this stage which 
                        suitcase has the $1,000,000.  I’ve 
                        just been toying with you this 
                        whole time.  That’s why I’m going 
                        to say No Deal!!!

           He slams down the lid over the “Deal” button.  

                                 HOWIE MANDELL
                        All right, Stuart, why don’t you 
                        open your suitcase?

           Stuart flips open his suitcase, revealing “$1,000,000”  
           Everyone immediately begins CHEERING WILDLY.  Stuart goes 
           nuts.  Streamers fall from the ceiling.  Alan, Kristen, and 
           Cynthia run up to Stuart and celebrate.  Stuart gives Cynthia 
           a huge kiss.  Howie approaches Stuart.

                                 HOWIE MANDELL (CONT’D)
                        How does it feel to be a 
                        millionaire?  What are you going to 
                        do with all this money?

                                 STUART
                        The first thing I’m going to do is 
                        give some of it to my brother Alan.

           He puts his arm around Alan.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        So that he can have an operation to 
                        have his third testicle removed!

           Alan’s joy turns to embarrassment.  Everyone else continues 
           to celebrate as we:

                                                      FADE OUT.

                                        THE END
