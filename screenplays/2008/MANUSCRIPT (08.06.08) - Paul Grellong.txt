           EXT. THE STRAND BOOKS -- DAY

           FINGERS move carefully along the spines of books: A shelf-
           full of TATTERED, USED HARDCOVERS. Row after row of "Buck-
           a-Book" bargain racks on the sidewalk. The shopper is --

           DAVID LEWIS, 25 -- smart, brainy, cagey -- browses the 
           hardcovers. He wears an off-brand overcoat; a hand-me-
           down scarf knotted at his neck. 

           Behind David, BUSTLING LIFE of New York City in winter -- 
           PEDESTRIANS, TOURISTS, traffic -- Union Square in b.g. A 
           CHRISTMAS WREATH on a HOT-DOG CART spells the season as --

           Finally David stumbles upon -- TWO HARDCOVERS of 
           interest. He looks surprised-annoyed. He pulls them from 
           the shelf -- both show the author as: "WILLIAM ALLEN 
           BANKS." The AUTHOR PHOTO is a 1980's Ettlinger portrait. 
           As David turns the books over in his hands --

                                 DAVID (V.O./PRE-LAP)
                        These shouldn't be on the bargain rack...

           INT. THE STRAND BOOKS -- DAY

           Moments later. David stands before a haggard, middle-aged 
           CASHIER at the register. As the Cashier rings up THE TWO 
           BANKS HARDCOVERS on the counter --

                                 DAVID
                                  (re: the books)
                        ... they belong inside. On the real 
                        shelves. It's a tragedy, really.

           But the Cashier has seen it all -- isn't interested --

                                 CASHIER
                                  (deadpan)
                        Ain't the world full of pain and shit.

           David shakes his head, takes out A COUPLE BUCKS to pay.

           INT. MADISON AVENUE BOUTIQUE -- DAY

           A PRICE TAG attached to a DROP-DEAD BLACK DRESS says it 
           all: Think Badgley Mischka, think a lot of money.

           ELIZABETH HAWKINS, 21 -- pretty, sharp, ambitious -- 
           holds the dress: Her face says she loves it; her head 
           says she can't afford it. She's dressed modest-nicely.

           A LARGE WINDOW in b.g. looks out on Madison Avenue 
           holiday-shopping frenzy. HIP, NON-HOLIDAY MUSIC plays.

                                 SALESWOMAN (O.S.)
                        May I help you?
           Elizabeth turns, sees a sexy young SALESWOMAN. Model-ish.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I need help. I'm in love with a dress.

                                 SALESWOMAN
                                  (smiles)
                        I know. It's gorge. Will you try it on?

           Elizabeth looks guiltily at the price tag. Considers.

           PRE-LAP the sound of FOOTSTEPS RUNNING on dirt --

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK RESERVOIR TRACK -- DAY

           CHRIS WOLCOTT, 25 -- confident, trim, WASP-y -- runs 
           hard. He wears high-end Nike winter running gear. His two-
           hundred-dollar sneakers bang the dirt. Catch THE GLINT of 
           an expensive watch. Heavy breathing, assured stride -- 
           he's sprinting now -- running faster --

           From the opposite direction, TWO CUTE FEMALE JOGGERS 
           glance and check him out, smile and giggle as they pass -- 
           but Chris doesn't even look their way. He runs on.

           EXT. BROOKLYN STREET -- DAY

           David exits the subway station at Clark & Henry Streets. 
           He holds the iconic shopping bag from The Strand. It's a 
           quieter part of the city out here. Can actually see sky.

           INT. LEWIS BROWNSTONE / DAVID'S BEDROOM -- DAY

           David stands at his bookshelves. The room's kind of a 
           mess. Old paint job -- old radiator -- this place speaks 
           for the rest of the brownstone: Seen better days.

           PHOTOS of male authors are tacked to the bookshelves: 
           Salinger, Vonnegut, Mailer, Roth, Bellow. One AUTHOR 
           PHOTO is prominently placed: William Allen Banks -- 
           recognize it from the back of the hardcovers. Then -- 
           David takes the TWO HARDCOVERS from the Strand Books bag 
           and maneuvers them onto their shelf spaces --

           In a row of Banks titles, they slide next to double- and 
           triple-copies -- different editions -- of the same books. 
           Perfect. As David admires his handiwork, his collection --

                                 SALESWOMAN (V.O./PRE-LAP)
                        It's beautiful...
           INT. MADISON AVENUE BOUTIQUE / DRESSING ROOM -- DAY

           Elizabeth stands before THREE HUGE MIRRORS wearing THE 
           BLACK DRESS. She looks amazing. The Saleswoman admires 
           her. Elizabeth admires herself -- looks for an excuse --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I don't know... I mean, I do want to 
                        impress my boyfriend's parents... 

                                 SALESWOMAN
                        Can't go wrong with this.

           Elizabeth never takes her eyes off herself --

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (it's killing her)
                        It's a little steep for my budget.

                                 SALESWOMAN
                        Honey, forget a budget. Look at you.

           IN THE MIRROR -- Elizabeth does. She smiles. Sold. PULL 
           BACK from the mirror into --

           INT. WOLCOTT DUPLEX / CHRIS'S BEDROOM -- DAY

           IN A TALL MIRROR -- Elizabeth, in the black dress (price 
           tag still on), admires herself. It's a Spartan-spare 
           room. Large bed. No bookshelves. The high-end opposite of 
           David's bedroom. As Elizabeth checks herself out --

           Chris enters, stripping off his sweaty running gear. To 
           show off the dress, Elizabeth spins seductively. Chris 
           smiles -- apparently he likes what he sees. As he walks 
           towards her -- puts his hands on her waist --

                                 CHRIS (V.O./PRE-LAP)
                        People who commit suicide, jumpers, off 
                        buildings and things...

           EXT. BROOKLYN HEIGHTS PROMENADE -- DUSK

           Blue-light time of day. Chris and Elizabeth stand at the 
           railing looking out over the East River -- at the skyline 
           of lower Manhattan -- at the BROOKLYN BRIDGE, prominent.

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (re: the Brooklyn Bridge)
                        Bridges.

                                 CHRIS
                        Yes.
           Chris wears an Armani tuxedo beneath a topcoat. Elizabeth 
           shivers a touch in her new dress and coat. Scarves. 
           PEDESTRIANS pass, walk dogs. Chris looks at the bridge --

                                 CHRIS (CONT'D)
                        What they say, if they live, people who 
                        do that sort of thing --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Who do that sort of thing and survive.

                                 CHRIS
                        Right. What they say, these people, is 
                        that as soon as they stepped their second 
                        foot off the ledge, the bridge, what have 
                        you -- they wished they could go back.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Go back and live.

                                 CHRIS
                        They regret their choice. Yes.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Cold feet.

                                 CHRIS
                        The ones who survive. A huge percentage 
                        of them. That's what they say.

           Elizabeth turns to him, places her hands on his face.

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (with care)
                        Baby, you don't have to think about that 
                        right now.

                                 CHRIS
                                  (pause)
                        My father told me today -- the Tribeca 
                        apartment... he's gonna buy it for me.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        That's great. Isn't that great?

                                 CHRIS
                        We can move in this summer, and I'll 
                        commute to New Haven for my classes in 
                        the fall. It'll just be for a year.

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  ("you're amazing")
                        You'd do that for me?

                                 CHRIS
                        Yeah, so... New York. Us. If you want.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        Of course I want. Don't you? Is that why 
                        you -- wait -- what you were saying -- 
                        are you having second thoughts about us?

                                 CHRIS
                        It's not that exactly, No. I just -- I 
                        want it to work. I've never had... quite 
                        these feelings for anyone before.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Neither have I. We're gonna be great.
                                  (then)
                        No cold feet. You won't regret a thing.

           She leans in, kisses him. He kisses back. Finally 
           Elizabeth pulls away, sweetly breaks it --

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                        I should get going.

                                 CHRIS
                        Have fun at the book thing.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I'm sorry I couldn't get another invite 
                        for you.

                                 CHRIS
                        No worries.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I'll only be an hour.

                                 CHRIS
                        See you at David's, then. You have the 
                        address?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yes.

                                 CHRIS
                        I did want to meet your sister, though.

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (a winning smile)
                        Next time.

           INT. BROOKLYN BAR -- NIGHT

           Elizabeth holds a NEW HARDCOVER BOOK, turns it over in 
           her hands. Stacked on a table are MANY COPIES OF THE 
           SAME. A PROMOTIONAL PHOTO of a Male Author propped up.

           It's a book-release party in the heart of hip Brooklyn. 
           INDIE ROCK MUSIC and lively chatter fill the bar. 
           Elizabeth is overdressed -- and a few years young for 
           THIS CROWD.  Across the room --  

           CAROLINE HAWKINS, 28, stands with NIKOLAS, the Male 
           Author from the promotional photo. They talk, laugh.

           Then -- Caroline catches Elizabeth's eye. With a wave she 
           BECKONS HER OVER. Elizabeth moves through the crowd to --

           Caroline, drink in hand, is a little cool, removed here.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Are you having fun?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What?

                                 CAROLINE
                        Are you having fun? I said.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Oh -- yeah, of course, yeah.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Nikolas, this is my sister Elizabeth.

                                 NIKOLAS
                                  (meek; an artiste)
                        Hey.

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (to Nikolas)
                        Congratulations. Can't wait to read it.

                                 NIKOLAS
                        Oh my God you're really nice thank you. 
                        We'll be saying the same to your sister 
                        next month at her book-release. Hell yes.

                                 CAROLINE
                                  (tipsy)
                        Aw, shucks.

                                 NIKOLAS
                                  (to Elizabeth)
                        Yeah wait -- you wrote that young adult 
                        book, right? The boarding school one?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yeah.

                                 NIKOLAS
                        My little cousin read that. She liked it.

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (strained)
                        Oh -- thank you. Thanks a lot.
                                 NIKOLAS
                        How's your next one coming?

           Elizabeth smiles, nods blankly in response. Off that --

           TIME CUT --

           AT A TWO-TOP IN THE BACK -- Elizabeth and Caroline sit, 
           drinks in front of them. A WAITRESS arrives, places a 
           fresh drink in front of Caroline -- takes up her empty.

                                 CAROLINE
                                  (to Elizabeth)
                        You sure?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I'm good.

           Caroline puts a ten on the tray. Waitress departs. Place 
           is packed -- occasionally they're jostled as they talk. 

                                 CAROLINE
                                  (big-sister stern)
                        So, I'm a little pissed at you.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What?

                                 CAROLINE
                        Roxanne called me today.

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (figured this was coming)
                        Okay. Okay, well --

                                 CAROLINE
                        How could you do that? Go behind my back?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Let me just... Peter's a junior editor. I 
                        think I should be -- I want to move up. 
                        That's why, a meeting with your editor --

                                 CAROLINE
                        Really, Lizzie --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        -- but hang on a second --

                                 CAROLINE
                        We're at the same house -- that's enough. 
                        Right? Have I not done a lot?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Of course you have.
                                 CAROLINE
                        Because I kind of feel like that's a lot.
                                  (pause)
                        An editor -- that's a personal 
                        relationship. You and I wouldn't share a 
                        therapist.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        No.

                                 CAROLINE
                        And you lied to her. I never said I'd 
                        organize a thing for us all to sit down.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I figured you would, though, if I asked.

                                 CAROLINE
                        But you didn't ask, which is the problem.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I know.

                                 CAROLINE
                                  (sips her drink)
                        You don't have to be in such a rush. 
                        Relax -- you're already way ahead. I 
                        mean, you graduate college in six months. 
                        Worry about that, then worry about this.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I'm perfectly capable of worrying about 
                        two things simultaneously.

                                 CAROLINE
                        You've got to see how crazy that was. As 
                        an idea, it's... it's unreasonable.

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (pause)
                        I think I'm gonna lose my deal.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Did Peter say that?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I'm six months past due on a first draft.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Don't you have any pages to show them?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I told them I do.

                                 CAROLINE
                        And you don't?
                                  (off her look)
                        That's not good.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        I don't know what to do here.

           Caroline, though annoyed, looks for an angle, a way in --

                                 CAROLINE
                        Well. Maybe there's a reason you're 
                        having trouble this time around.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I'm just blocked.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Okay. 'Blocked.' Okay. But can I say 
                        something? And really think about it, 
                        really consider, you know: What if there 
                        is no second book? What if you do 
                        something else? Would that be so bad?

           The hard look in Elizabeth's eyes says: "Yes. It would."

           EXT. BROOKLYN STREET -- NIGHT

           Outside the bar. Elizabeth and Caroline. Cold out here. 
           Sounds of the book-release gathering audible from inside.

                                 CAROLINE
                        I wanted to meet your new boyfriend. You 
                        could have brought him, you know.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        He doesn't like book stuff. Anyway, I 
                        thought it'd be better if I came alone.

                                 CAROLINE
                                  (checks watch)
                        We're gonna be late. I'm drunk. I hate 
                        being drunk.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        How long is the flight?

                                 CAROLINE
                        Counting the stopover in L.A., twenty-
                        three hours.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Holy hell.

                                 CAROLINE
                        And you cross the time line, or the date 
                        line or some kind of line, which 
                        basically means you fly into the future.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        That's insane.
                                 CAROLINE
                                  (pause)
                        I've never spent a holiday away from Mom 
                        and Dad.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        They're gonna miss you.

           HONK. A HATCHBACK pulls up, its backseat crammed with 
           luggage. The driver is JOEL, 30s, schlubby-handsome. As 
           he leans across the front seat to roll down the window --

                                 CAROLINE
                        Look at all those bags. He packs like a 
                        girl.

                                 JOEL
                                  (Australian accent)
                        I know, I know I'm late -- but there 
                        won't be any traffic.

           Caroline hugs Elizabeth, climbs into the car.

                                 JOEL (CONT'D)
                        Merry Christmas, Lizzie.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Thanks, Joel. You, too.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Kiss Mom for me.

           Caroline rolls up the window as Joel speeds away.  
           Elizabeth stands on the curb, alone, watches them go.

           BLACK SCREEN.

           SUPERTITLE "MANUSCRIPT" over the SOUND OF TIRES in city 
           traffic --

           INT. TAXI (TRAVELLING) -- NIGHT

           Lights wipe over Elizabeth's face as she stares out the 
           window. DRIVER checks her out a little in the REAR-VIEW.

           Elizabeth quickly pulls her cell phone from her purse. 
           She selects a number, hits "call." As the taxi stops at a 
           red light, hear FILTERED RINGING. Then Chris answers --

                                 CHRIS (PHONE/OVER)
                        My darling Clementine. You on your way?

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (into phone)
                        I want to stop and get David something.
                                 CHRIS (PHONE/OVER)
                        You really don't have to.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        They're called 'manners.' I'm doing it.
                                  (a practical princess)
                        I've never been in this neighborhood, and 
                        I don't want to get lost -- come meet me.

                                 CHRIS (PHONE/OVER)
                                  (pause)
                        Hang on...
                                  (long beat; then)
                        I'll meet you at the liquor store.

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (semi-annoyed)
                        What liquor store?

           EXT. MICHAEL-TOWNE WINES & SPIRITS -- NIGHT

           Chris waits outside as holiday CUSTOMERS come and go.

           ELIZABETH'S TAXI pulls up to the curb. Chris approaches 
           the passenger side, pays the Driver through the window. 
           Chris opens the door, helps Elizabeth out to the curb.

           INT. MICHAEL-TOWNE WINES & SPIRITS -- NIGHT

           Cash-register DINGS and piped-in HOLIDAY MUSIC, the 
           score. Crowded, a sense of claustrophobia in the place. 
           Chris has two bottles of Famous Grouse. They're in line.

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (re: the bottles)
                        I'm not showing up with cheap booze.

                                 CHRIS
                        It's not a housewarming, you don't have 
                        to show up with anything.

           Their turn. Chris plunks the two bottles on the counter, 
           then hands I.D. and A PLATINUM AMEX CARD to the CASHIER.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I want to make a good impression.

                                 CHRIS
                                  ("if you insist")
                        There's a bookstore up the street...

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Better.

           The Cashier hands over a credit card slip. Chris signs, 
           picks up the bag containing their bottles. Then spots --
                                 CHRIS
                        Hey, look: There's mistletoe hanging over 
                        the Pinot Blanc... you're coming with me.

           Chris puts one arm around Elizabeth's waist, push-carries 
           her towards the mistletoe. Already kissing. She laughs.

           EXT. BROOKLYN STREET -- NIGHT

           Elizabeth and Chris walk, hold hands. 

           INT. BOOKSTORE -- NIGHT

           POV OUT THROUGH THE WINDOW -- Chris and Elizabeth walk up 
           on the sidewalk. Something in the window display catches 
           her eye. She points to a pair of DECORATIVE BOOKENDS. She 
           enters the store. Chris checks his watch, then follows.

           PRE-LAP the sound of a DOORBELL --

           EXT./INT. LEWIS BROWNSTONE / ENTRYWAY -- NIGHT

           THE FRONT DOOR OPENS to reveal David -- dressed in casual 
           contrast to his polished, elegant guests. Hear in b.g. 
           from another room: LIVELY MUSIC plays. Chris holds the 
           bag of liquor bottles. Elizabeth holds A SMALL GIFT BAG.

                                 CHRIS
                        Sorry it took so long.

                                 DAVID
                        Are you kidding me? Come on in --

           They enter, then David shuts the door behind them.

                                 CHRIS
                                  (proudly)
                        David, this is Elizabeth.

           David pauses at the introduction --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        And here's the famous David. Chris has 
                        told me so much about you.

                                 CHRIS
                                  (off David's silence)
                        Dave?

                                 DAVID
                                  (snapping out of it)
                        Elizabeth, nice to meet you. Welcome!
                                 ELIZABETH
                        Wow! Volume! Thank you!

                                 DAVID
                        She's good -- already -- she's funny! 
                        Funny chick, man. 

           As they walk to the kitchen -- 

           A HALLWAY --

           OVERSTUFFED BOOKSHELVES abound on either side. Far from 
           spotless -- no cleaning lady here. MUSIC gets louder as 
           they walk. Elizabeth thrusts the gift bag at David --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Here.

                                 DAVID
                        What's this?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        It's for you and your parents. I'm in 
                        your home. You don't show up to someone's 
                        home without a gift.

                                 DAVID
                        I didn't expect this one.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Open it.

           David pulls a pair of DECORATIVE BOOKENDS from the bag.

                                 DAVID
                        What are these?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Bookends.

                                 DAVID
                        My parents will love them.

           INT. LEWIS BROWNSTONE / KITCHEN -- NIGHT

           WHISKEY SPLASH-POURS INTO ROCKS GLASSES on a Formica 
           counter. An EMBOSSED INVITATION is tossed down. Legible 
           sections: "BROOKLYN ACADEMY OF MUSIC -- WINTER GALA -- 
           THE PALM HOUSE -- BROOKLYN BOTANIC GARDEN." Over which --

                                 DAVID (O.S.)
                        What time to you have to be at the thing?

                                 CHRIS (O.S.)
                        Eight-thirty. Nine, the latest.
           The MUSIC is loudest now -- it plays on a stereo in here. 
           MELODIC, CUTTING-EDGE INDIE ROCK. David hands out drinks.

                                 CHRIS (CONT'D)
                        Still time to change your mind, come 
                        along.

                                 DAVID
                                  (sarcastic)
                        My penguin suit's at the cleaners.
                                  (raises his glass)
                        To good friends, pre-party narcotics, and 
                        the fact that my old buddy cradle-robbed 
                        such a lovely gal.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You're gonna make me blush.

           They toast and drink. Chris takes off his tuxedo jacket --

                                 DAVID
                        Jesus, man, you're wasting away. How much 
                        weight have you lost since Thanksgiving?

                                 CHRIS
                        What?

                                 DAVID
                        When a person is too thin, it reflects 
                        poorly on the people who love them. Just 
                        how lonely is the Long Distance Runner?

                                 CHRIS
                        Oh, he gets so lonely he could die.

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (to David)
                        He goes running twice a day.

                                 DAVID
                        You want a rugelach? I'll order Chinese.

                                 CHRIS
                        Not hungry, thanks.

                                 DAVID
                        It's sad. You go off to business school, 
                        now I can't take care of you anymore. You 
                        don't call, you don't write...

           As Chris takes a seat, kicks his feet up on the counter --

                                 CHRIS
                        Knock it off. I'm fine.
                                 DAVID
                        'You're fine.' Fine. But if you lose 
                        another pound I'm staging an 
                        intervention.

                                 CHRIS
                        Stage away.

                                 DAVID
                                  (sarcastic; faux self-help)
                        You're hurting. I get it. You're in pain. 
                        But also you're in luck -- 'cause I can 
                        think of something that will help you...

           Chris lights up, an old routine beginning -- stands --

                                 CHRIS
                        A certain something from the Orient --

                                 DAVID
                        That's racist.

                                 CHRIS
                        You're right. And it's unlike me. I 
                        apologize.

                                 DAVID
                        Accepted. A certain something from --

                                 CHRIS
                        The Far East. Asia. Asia?

           David nods with a grin. Elizabeth sits down, watches 
           closely, takes in the buddy-buddy show.

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (nervous)
                        I've never smoked it before.

                                 CHRIS
                        But I said to you: It's just like pot.

                                 DAVID
                        If, say, that pot was laced with happy-
                        juice and horse-tranquilizer.

                                 CHRIS
                        But other than that it's the same.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Who even smokes opium? This day and age -- 
                        who does that?

                                 DAVID
                        Lucky people.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Exotic. I'll try anything once.
                                 CHRIS
                        That's the spirit.

                                 DAVID
                        When I get word, I'll go pick it up.

                                 CHRIS
                                  (puzzled)
                        I thought we were all gonna go.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yeah. I'd kind of like to come along.

                                 DAVID
                                  (abrupt change of subject)
                        Who wants a tour?

           INT. LEWIS BROWNSTONE / STAIRCASE -- NIGHT

           Elizabeth, David and Chris ascending. FAMILY PICTURES on 
           the walls. David holds the open bottle of whiskey.

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (to David)
                        What's all this noise about you're not 
                        coming to the party with us?

                                 CHRIS
                        First of all, it's a 'gala.' There is 
                        value in lingo.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        This noise about you're not coming to the 
                        gala with us.

                                 DAVID
                        Chris invites me to these things every 
                        year, I never go.

                                 CHRIS
                        At least this one's at the Botanic Garden 
                        so we can hang with your curmudgeonly ass 
                        beforehand.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        How do you know if you like them or not, 
                        you never go?

                                 DAVID
                        I don't like crowds. I lose control.

                                 CHRIS
                        David loathes holiday season in the city.

                                 DAVID
                        Shoulder-to-shoulder sardines in Midtown. 
                        It's disgusting. You can't breathe.
                                 CHRIS
                                  (to Elizabeth)
                        You'll see tomorrow.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I don't mind a crowd.

                                 DAVID
                        Plus, these galas of which your boyfriend 
                        and his ilk are so fond? Too many rich 
                        people. And, well, you've seen my house.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I'm in your house...

           THE SECOND-FLOOR LANDING --

           As they walk -- the three of them enter --

           INT. FATHER'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

           A psychologist works in here. Dusty books. A Jung shelf.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        ... it's very nice.

                                 DAVID
                        We could never buy it now. My mother's a 
                        poet; my father's a shrink.

           They bounce back out to --

           THE SECOND-FLOOR LANDING --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Chris tells me they're away. I forget --

                                 DAVID
                        Utica. My aunt's house.

           As they ascend stairs to the top floor --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        That's right. 'Utica.'

                                 CHRIS
                        The armpit of New York State.

           THE THIRD-FLOOR LANDING -- 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You always spend the holidays alone?

                                 DAVID
                        No, but it's tough to get any writing 
                        done up there...
           He's hoping she'll ask. And, sure, she'll bite --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What are you working on?

                                 DAVID
                        A short novel about alcoholism and God.

           Elizabeth, raised eyebrows, suppresses a smile. Chris 
           grins. As they enter a dark room, LOW LIGHT FLICKERING --

           INT. TV ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           The TV's ON, "muted" -- Turner Classic Movies is showing 
           "Out of the Past." Mitchum, Douglas and Greer seated at 
           the breakfast table.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        How is it... living at home?

                                 DAVID

                        Free.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Well, it's cool your parents are gone so 
                        we can party here.

                                 DAVID
                        Oh, we'd be here anyway.

                                 CHRIS
                        This whole floor is David's. They never 
                        come up.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        That's amazing. You must have been up 
                        here all the time.

           David grabs a remote, shuts OFF the TV. Elizabeth 
           inspects FAMILY PHOTOS. She picks up a PHOTOGRAPH OF: 
           YOUNG DAVID AND YOUNG CHRIS at the Central Park Reservoir 
           Track -- in prep school phys. ed. uniforms, post-run 
           sweaty brows, smiles, arms around each other's shoulders.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                                  (re: photo)
                        Is this you two?

                                 DAVID
                        The annual Reservoir Run in third grade. 
                        Torture for yours truly -- and the 
                        beginning of a love affair with the sport 
                        for Prefontaine, over here.

                                 CHRIS
                        Yeah, yeah...
                                 DAVID
                                  (to Elizabeth)
                        If your boyfriend wasn't such a pansy, 
                        he'd tell his dad to screw himself, then 
                        go be a track coach like he actually 
                        wants.

                                 CHRIS
                        You try having a father like mine.

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (to Chris; the truth?)
                        Sweetie, you could be a garbage-man and 
                        I'd love you the same.

                                 CHRIS
                        Well, anyway. The job and everything -- 
                        it didn't work out for my... but I'll 
                        make it different with me.

           An awkward, heavy beat: The sense of loss. Elizabeth, to 
           occupy herself, over-closely studies the photo. David 
           spots that and pushes for a much-needed change of topic --

                                 DAVID
                        When we were kids, Chris was over so 
                        much, he kept things here. Clothes...

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (eagerly)
                        That's adorable.

                                 CHRIS
                                  (coming out of it)
                        You know, a toothbrush. No big deal.

                                 DAVID
                        We were never at your place. Were we?

                                 CHRIS
                        As infrequently as possible.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Why?

                                 CHRIS
                        My parents.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Ohh... I thought your mother was sweet.

                                 CHRIS
                        She was probably buzzed.

                                 DAVID
                        They give you money, though.
                                 CHRIS
                        So? Fuck that.

                                 DAVID
                        No, I know -- I'm just saying. Money is 
                        good.
                                  (then)
                        C'mon, my room's down the hall.

           INT. LEWIS BROWNSTONE / DAVID'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           The three of them enter. Still ultra-messy -- books and 
           magazines everywhere -- a vintage Harvard pennant not-so-
           subtly hung on the wall.

                                 DAVID
                        The end of the line -- my humble abode.

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (re: the mess)
                        I like the style -- pig-sty chic.

                                 DAVID
                        I call it 'Neoclassical Nagasaki.'

           Elizabeth bee-lines for the bookshelves. She checks out 
           titles for a beat, then --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Oh! "The Nun." Diderot -- nice.

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah, well.

           She stops at a shelf full of VINTAGE WRESTLING FIGURES.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What are these, a bunch of dolls?

                                 DAVID
                        Boys don't call them 'dolls.' We call 
                        them 'action figures.'

                                 CHRIS
                        Or 'figurines.'

                                 DAVID
                        Or 'action figurines.'

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (pause)
                        So, these are your dolls?

                                 DAVID
                        Those are my dolls, yeah.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        What are you, like, totally into 
                        professional wrestling?

                                 DAVID
                        It's the only innovative form of modern 
                        dance we've got left.

           As Chris lies down on the mattress, rolls his eyes --

                                 CHRIS
                        Oh, here we go...

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (to David)
                        Somebody read their Roland Barthes.

                                 DAVID
                        Have you ever watched pro wrestling?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You went to Harvard, probably think it's 
                        ironic or something. And, No, I haven't.

                                 DAVID
                        If by 'ironic' you mean beautiful and 
                        completely fuckin' genius, then yes.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What's beautiful about a bunch of 
                        hardbodies oiled up and pretending to 
                        beat the shit out of each other?

           During David's sermon, Chris gets up, refills glasses.

                                 DAVID
                        All production values aside -- and we're 
                        putting aside many incredible production 
                        values when we do that -- it's the 
                        choreography of the fights themselves 
                        that makes professional wrestling into 
                        not only a legitimate form of dance but 
                        the most commercially successful 
                        choreographed form in history.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You haven't answered my question. What's 
                        beautiful about --

                                 DAVID
                                  (gets into it)
                        The charade is beautiful. The ladders, 
                        splintering chairs, the blood -- all 
                        employed for calculated effect. And, my 
                        God, the audience participation. Tens of 
                        thousands of people -- the audience is 
                        the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        Screaming crowds? That's what you find 
                        beautiful?

                                 DAVID
                        Those people make the event. The whole 
                        charade, the whole lie is right there in 
                        front of them the whole time. And yet 
                        they scream and chant in ways that would 
                        put Bacchans to shame. They're not being 
                        duped -- just the opposite. People 
                        believe what they want to believe. These 
                        fans of pro wrestling, they make 
                        believing look active, sexy. It's their 
                        choice to believe the charade. As a 
                        result, they're part of the action -- and 
                        to borrow the root of that word, they're 
                        part of the act. It couldn't exist 
                        without them.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I never thought about professional 
                        wrestling that way.

                                 DAVID
                        Give the W.W.E. ten minutes, they'll give 
                        you the world.

           Chris claps for effect. Elizabeth joins in.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Bravo. That should be your novel.

                                 DAVID
                        I wish it was. Kind of run dry there.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        It happens. A dry patch.

           David crosses to the window, leans on the sill --

                                 DAVID
                        It's tough. Maybe I should have gone to 
                        grad school. I got into an M.F.A. 
                        program...

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Why didn't you go?

                                 DAVID
                        Hard to say. Guess I kind of felt like it 
                        was a waste of money. Like: I can write 
                        here, make my own grad school. But...

           He turns back from the window, looks a little defeated.
                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        ... hasn't quite panned out that way.
                                  (pause)
                        I mean, I've never had anything 
                        published.
                                  (then; nervous)
                        Anyway, I'm embarrassed to be talking 
                        about it with you... the whole young 
                        adult novel thing --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Oh... come on. It's just a book. Anybody 
                        can write one. 

           Chris clears old magazines from a chair, takes a seat.

                                 DAVID
                                  (to Chris)
                        You didn't tell me she was --

                                 CHRIS
                        What? I should have sent you her resumé? 
                        I'm her boyfriend, not her agent.

                                 DAVID
                        I know, I know. When you walked in, I 
                        mean -- I recognized you from the press 
                        you got -- your sister and stuff -- when 
                        your young adult novel came out.

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (with a tight smile)
                        You can just call it a 'novel.' Feel free 
                        to drop the 'young adult' qualifier.

                                 DAVID
                        Okay -- sorry. No disrespect. It's still 
                        a book! Anyway -- sorry -- okay -- I'm 
                        not gonna make a big deal out of this.

                                 CHRIS
                        Then maybe skip the intro.

                                 DAVID
                        Right.
                                  (to Elizabeth)
                        I... I really love your sister's writing.

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (pained)
                        Ohh. Oh, thank you so much.

           He gets up, crosses to Elizabeth -- really gets into it --

                                 DAVID
                        I mean I admire it. Her books are just -- 
                        like "Song of the Silent Bird"...
                                 ELIZABETH
                        That's a good one. Isn't she amazing?

                                 DAVID
                        Do you ever feel any pressure to --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I get that question a lot? And my answer 
                        is: Not at all.

                                 DAVID
                        Wow.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        We're totally different writers. There's 
                        a market for her and a market for me.

                                 DAVID
                        I feel like I remember -- didn't you have 
                        some article in the "New York Times" 
                        magazine?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        A few years back, yeah.

                                 CHRIS
                        My girlfriend is so smart.

                                 DAVID
                                  (recalling it...)
                        It was an amazing piece. I'd never seen 
                        boarding school captured like that. You 
                        were kind of a... drugged-up, female, 
                        Mini-Me version of John Knowles.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        High praise. Thank you.

                                 DAVID
                                  (re: the article)
                        Did your sister help you get it off the 
                        slush pile?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Well... good work gets itself off.

                                 CHRIS
                                  (all innocence)
                        Didn't she give it to them herself, like, 
                        personally?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Um, that's not exactly how it happened.

                                 DAVID
                        What are you, the youngest author of a 
                        cover article for them -- ever?
           Elizabeth and David share a couple of friendly smiles. 

           INT. LEWIS BROWNSTONE / FATHER'S OFFICE -- NIGHT

           Later. Elizabeth and Chris, seated on the couch, hold 
           drinks. David opens a desk drawer, removes a METAL LOCK-
           BOX, places it on the desk. He leans down, feels around 
           on the underside panel for something hidden there. Then --

                                 DAVID
                        Ah -- got it --

           David pulls a "hidden key" from a spot he clearly knows -- 
           uses it to open the lock-box. From inside, he removes HIS 
           FATHER'S BAG OF POT AND GLASS PIPE. After setting them 
           down, he removes the other item secreted away --

           A .38 REVOLVER. LAMP-LIGHT REFLECTS off the chrome. David 
           places it on the desk, calm as can be -- the casualness 
           of this gesture is eerie. Chris ignores the gun: "Seen 
           that thing before." But Elizabeth is shocked --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Whoa. Whose is that?

                                 DAVID
                        My dad's got a very antiquated idea of 
                        'protecting the homestead.'

           David packs the bowl, lights it. During the following, 
           they all pass and smoke. Getting stoned...

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        He bought it off a buddy from the Old 
                        Neighborhood, some Meyer-Lansky-wannabee.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Can I touch it?

                                 DAVID
                                  (holds it out to her)
                        Thirty-eight special. Jimmy Cagney shit.

           Elizabeth takes it from him, marvels at the object. Chris 
           comes to her side -- feeds her a hit from the pipe.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I never held a gun before.

                                 DAVID
                        It's no big deal. You'd be surprised how 
                        many people own them.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        It's lighter than I would have thought...

           Elizabeth handles at the .38. David takes it from her --
                                 DAVID
                        Show-and-tell's over.

           He puts the gun away. Chris exhales a huge hit, then 
           quickly makes for the door --

                                 CHRIS
                        Okay, now I'm hungry. Who wants Chinese?

           EXT. BROOKLYN STREET -- NIGHT

           David, Elizabeth and Chris walk. Chris has his arm around 
           Elizabeth. David walks apart.

                                 DAVID
                        So the article led to your young adult -- 
                        sorry -- to your novel?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yeah.

                                 DAVID
                        I'm so interested in this.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Come on, it's boring.

                                 DAVID
                        Not to me. I want to be like you. 
                        Published, out there, articles and stuff.

           As they walk past storefronts, a pizza joint, delis --

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  ("if you insist")
                        Fall of Freshman year at Yale, the 
                        "Times" published me. That's how I got my 
                        agent. I already had a few chapters of my 
                        novel by that point -- book came out when 
                        I was a Sophomore. The end.

                                 DAVID
                        How's your second book coming?

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (uneasy; covers okay)
                        I'm a little behind my publisher's 
                        schedule. Everyone is. Industry standard.

           Finally they hit the spot, arrive at the door of a 
           BUSTLING CHINESE RESTAURANT. A dive-y, local favorite.

           INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT -- NIGHT

           Later. David, Elizabeth and Chris seated at a curved, red-
           pleather booth. JAM-PACKED and FUN-CHAOTIC in here. 
           Every table full; it looks like it smells delicious in 
           there. A WAITER stands table-side. Only David holds an 
           open menu --

                                 DAVID
                                  (to the Waiter)
                        ... cold noodles -- scallion pancake -- 
                        chicken and broccoli -- eggplant with 
                        garlic -- shrimp with black bean sauce.

           He shuts the menu, hands it over. Chris chimes in --

                                 CHRIS
                                  (to Waiter)
                        Two whiskey-sodas and a glass of white 
                        wine.

           The Waiter nods, goes. Chris dips a crispy noodle in a 
           dish of hot yellow mustard -- eats it quick.

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (to David)
                        I'd love to hear some of your work -- 
                        from your novel, when we get back.

           As Chris grabs for his glass of ice water -- downs it --

                                 CHRIS
                                  (re: mustard)
                        Holy shit -- that's hot...

                                 DAVID
                                  (over him; to Elizabeth)
                        I thought we gathered this evening to get 
                        wasted on a ridiculously rare narcotic, 
                        not edit my half-baked fiction.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I'm sure it's fully baked.

           Chris, who's CHEWING ICE CUBES as a coolant, chimes in --

                                 CHRIS
                        It is fully baked.
                                  (then)
                        I gotta take a leak.

           Chris kisses Elizabeth on the cheek, stands up from the 
           table. He walks off through the swirl of restaurant 
           activity to A HALLWAY IN THE BACK. In his tux, he stands 
           out sharply from this local crowd. David and Elizabeth 
           watch him go -- until he's gone -- silence between them.

           Elizabeth and David stare at each other. Tense. Then --

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (sotto)
                        Before you say anything --
                                 DAVID
                                  (sotto)
                        Fuck you.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Real writers don't need to use profanity 
                        to express anger.

                                 DAVID
                        How dare you show up at my house. And 
                        this 'perfect strangers' act for Chris's 
                        benefit? I'm gonna be sick.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I'm having fun with it, you know you are, 
                        too, don't lie. You're on fire tonight.

           The RESTAURANT PULSES WITH NOISY LIFE around them. David 
           and Elizabeth truck through this secret conversation in a 
           kind of frenzy -- racing the clock of Chris's return --

                                 DAVID
                                  (looking off at hallway)
                        He'll be back any second --
                                  (then)
                        What the hell are you doing here?

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (all confident calm)
                        You really aren't happy to see me.

                                 DAVID
                        Not in the least.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You're a good actor.

                                 DAVID
                        Oh, please. You deserve an Oscar for the 
                        shit you were slinging earlier.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        'This is for my fans. I want to thank all 
                        my wonderful fans.'

                                 DAVID
                        He has no idea we know each other.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        And clearly you want to keep it that way. 
                        I don't blame you -- Chris is a good kid.

                                 DAVID
                        'Kid'? He's four years older than you.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You know what I mean. He's not old inside 
                        like us.
                                 DAVID
                        What? You're insane. How could you not 
                        tell him about the writing program?  That 
                        whole summer, you and me --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Three and a half years ago. Chris and I 
                        met in September. I didn't know who he 
                        was to you at first --

                                 DAVID
                        No... no --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        -- we're going out for a couple weeks 
                        when, hello! -- he tells me about his 
                        best friend David, wow, David Lewis from 
                        Brooklyn, and the blah blah blah. I 
                        almost fell over on Grove Street.

                                 DAVID
                                  (re: himself, their past)
                        You've always been a fan of older men.

           The Waiter arrives -- delivers their three drinks, goes. 
           David gulps his whiskey-soda.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You never told him.

                                 DAVID
                        I never told anyone. It was embarrassing 
                        for me.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        'Embarrassing.'

                                 DAVID
                        That was my article.

           Elizabeth sips her wine. Cool as hell.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Funny, I could have sworn I saw my name 
                        underneath the title.

                                 DAVID
                        What a joke.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        No, I'm serious. Right between the 'by' 
                        and the first word of the piece. My name.

                                 DAVID
                        That was the most heartless thing I've 
                        ever seen.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        I like to set records. Sue me.

           CLANG! O.S. of a dropped tray -- SHATTER! of glasses, 
           plates. David's startled, but he stays in it, focused --

                                 DAVID
                        So, what, you're here to torture me now?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I haven't told him. You haven't told him. 
                        There's gotta be something in that -- 

                                 DAVID
                        You came to my home...

                                 ELIZABETH
                        David, honey, I've been planning this for 
                        longer than you think.

           ELIZABETH'S POV -- THE HALLWAY IN THE BACK
           No sign of Chris. Yet. So there's still time for --

           Elizabeth slides on pleather, presses close to David --

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                        Do you want to kiss me, or hit me?

                                 DAVID
                        Both.

           Elizabeth leans in, kisses him hard. He kisses back. She 
           pulls away -- then cocks her chin out --

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  ("c'mon, hit me")
                        Well?
                                  (off his nothing)
                        You pussy.

           She slides away from him -- takes a sip of her wine. 
           David napkins his mouth clean of kiss evidence as --

           Chris rounds the corner from the back hallway, re-enters 
           the dining room. As Chris approaches the table with a 
           goofy, oblivious smile --

                                 DAVID
                                  (sotto)
                        How do you know I won't tell him 
                        everything right now?

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (sotto)
                        Because this is a game. Because playing 
                        it is turning you on.

           They hold eye contact -- Chris sits down in the booth.
                                 CHRIS
                                  (re: his waiting drink)
                        Refreshment.

           Chris drinks down half his whiskey-soda.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You might want to slow down, Tiger.

                                 CHRIS
                        Oh, sweetheart.

           Then -- the Waiter's back. With HEAPING PLATES OF FOOD. 
           Sets them on the table, goes. Chris serves Elizabeth as --

           BEEP -- David's cell phone announces an incoming text. He 
           takes his cell from his pocket, reads the screen --

                                 DAVID
                                  (re: text message)
                        The stuff is ready. After we eat, I'll 
                        head out.

                                 CHRIS
                        Well, wait, hang on --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I'd like to ride along.

           As David accepts a plateful of dinner from Chris --

                                 DAVID
                        I'd rather go myself --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Come on -- it's not every day I get a 
                        chance to meet William Allen Banks.

           That lands like a bag of bricks. A tense beat.

                                 DAVID
                                  (through gritted teeth)
                        Chris?

                                 CHRIS
                        That's a secret? What?

           Three full plates sit before them. No one touches a bite.

                                 DAVID
                        I don't believe this...

                                 CHRIS
                        That we know him? You didn't tell me not 
                        to say anything...
                                 DAVID
                                  (sotto)
                        I didn't think I had to. He's our dealer.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I didn't know it was top secret for the 
                        boys' club in the tree-house.

                                 DAVID
                        It's not -- but it is the man's home and 
                        he's serious about his privacy.
                                  (to Chris; pointed)
                        Something I thought you respected.
                                  (to Elizabeth)
                        It's a very kind of exclusive place and 
                        it's taken me -- it's taken us -- I don't 
                        know, a long time to cultivate a 
                        relationship with William. Trust.
                                  (an admission)
                        For the first time in years I'm actually 
                        writing again -- because of him. And, 
                        hey, look, I know you're already a 
                        celebrity and have books and shit --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I have a book, David.

                                 DAVID
                        -- but for those of us who are 
                        struggling. Right? Trying to establish 
                        ourselves in the real world -- a 
                        relationship like the one I've developed 
                        with William can be very valuable.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I know that. I completely understand 
                        that.
                                  (with gravity)
                        He's William Allen Banks...

                                 CHRIS
                        And that still means something?

           David and Elizabeth shoot him looks: "Are you kidding?"

                                 CHRIS (CONT'D)
                                  (off their looks)
                        What? I'm honestly asking. Hasn't it 
                        been, like, fifteen years since he put a 
                        book out?

           No response. Averted gazes, heavy silence at the table. 
           David SIGNALS FOR THE CHECK. Guess they're done here.

           PRE-LAP the SOUNDS of a Brooklyn street, with --
                                 DAVID (V.O./PRE-LAP)
                        I don't expect you to understand. William 
                        changed the game...

           EXT. BROOKLYN STREET -- NIGHT

           They walk. David holds a RED PLASTIC BAG OF LEFTOVERS.

                                 DAVID
                                  (to Chris)
                        ... none of those authors in the Nineties 
                        would have had readers without Banks's 
                        work from the Eighties. Post-post-modern 
                        before it was cool on campus -- but 
                        confident enough to write real scenes, 
                        real emotion --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        He did everything all together -- first. 
                        Blew the roof off in terms of how much 
                        you could mess with plot and voice, even 
                        naturalism, and still have a best-seller.

                                 CHRIS
                                  (pause)
                        You guys lost me at 'he changed the 
                        game.' I just think he's a really cool 
                        guy with good drugs.

           David gives the leftovers to a HOMELESS WOMAN huddled for 
           warmth on a subway grate. She mumbles a genuine "Thanks."

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Is he working on new stuff?

                                 DAVID
                        I've never seen any.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        No? Thought you were pals.

                                 DAVID
                        He never shows anything 'til it's done.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Because you asked...

                                 DAVID
                        Of course I asked. What am I, foolish? 
                        But that's his thing: Total lock-down. 
                        Just him and his 1965 Underwood...

           They round a corner -- approach a gleaming, new LAND 
           ROVER, parked. The damn thing is top-of-the-line, tricked 
           out. Chris digs in his pocket, takes out a set of keys.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        He still works on a typewriter?

                                 DAVID
                        He's old-school like that.

                                 CHRIS
                        David, can I jump in here? I don't get 
                        it. We can all head over there, he won't 
                        mind, but you don't want us to go. Why?

           David and Elizabeth trade looks. That's why. Finally --

                                 DAVID
                                  ("fuck it")
                        In and out -- we come right back.

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (smiles)
                        Shotgun.

           Chris hits a button, BEEP-BEEP unlocks the Rover.

           EXT. BROOKLYN STREET -- NIGHT

           Elsewhere. Later. CHRIS'S LAND ROVER pulls up outside a 
           brownstone in Brooklyn Heights.

           PRE-LAP the BEEP of an incoming text message --

           INT. LAND ROVER -- NIGHT / SAME

           RAP MUSIC on the stereo. In the backseat, David holds his 
           cell phone, reads the screen --

                                 DAVID
                                  (re: text on his cell)
                        Change of plans. William's not feeling 
                        well. He only wants one of us to go in.

                                 CHRIS
                        Be quick about it. I want to smoke.

           David and Elizabeth make EYE CONTACT IN THE REAR VIEW. 
           She's touching up -- a MAKEUP COMPACT in hand. As she 
           sets the compact down on the dashboard --

                                 DAVID
                                  (to Chris)
                        Go ahead.

                                 CHRIS
                        What?

                                 DAVID
                        You haven't seen him since Thanksgiving.
                                 CHRIS
                        You sure?

                                 DAVID
                        We'll be fine here.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        We'll talk about wrestling.

                                 CHRIS
                                  (cheerful)
                        I knew you two would hit it off. Back in 
                        a flash.

           Chris gets out, leaves the car running: The heat, the 
           MUSIC. Not half a second after THWAP! the door shuts --

                                 DAVID
                        Seriously, what are you doing here?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        How did you get to be friends with Banks?

                                 DAVID
                        Couple summers ago, just started hanging 
                        out at the coffee shop.

           As they talk: In b.g. Chris walks up the steps, knocks on 
           the door. THE DOOR OPENS, Chris is admitted. Elizabeth 
           TURNS DOWN the RAP MUSIC --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Then graduated to drug buddies. Very 
                        impressive.

                                 DAVID
                        I'm not introducing you -- you'll 
                        probably steal him, too.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Well. It would have been nice to meet 
                        Banks, but I'll settle for seeing you.

                                 DAVID
                        The hell do you want to see me? I don't 
                        want to see you.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        To thank you.

                                 DAVID
                        You want to thank me.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I want to say something: Thank you.

                                 DAVID
                        Go fuck yourself.
           Elizabeth turns fully in her seat, now facing David --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        The customary response is, 'You are 
                        welcome.' However, given the 
                        circumstances, I'll accept your version.  

                                 DAVID
                        You stole from me. I showed you my 
                        notebook -- the only copy.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        That was careless.

                                 DAVID
                                  (a bitter memory)
                        The look on your face when I confronted 
                        you... how smug.
                                  (still in disbelief)
                        Then you threaten to call the cops on me!

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (faux-innocent)
                        How can you blame me? I was only 
                        seventeen. Not to be crude, but... you 
                        were fucking a kid.

                                 DAVID
                                  (shakes his head)
                        You're sick. Sociopathic, really.

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (ignoring him)
                        It was so exciting... every day that went 
                        by and Chris didn't come to me with, 'Who 
                        the hell are you, you're a thief and all 
                        the rest of the blah blah blah,' that was 
                        me getting one day closer to you.

                                 DAVID
                        Fuck you.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You still want to.

                                 DAVID
                        I want to do something to you, but I'm 
                        not sure that's it.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Frown.

                                 DAVID
                        I thought I was going to fall over. When 
                        you walked in.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        You played it off. Admirably. I admired 
                        you.

           The tension mounting -- they're trapped in this space --

                                 DAVID
                        At the risk of sounding blurb-y: I looked 
                        back on those years and wrote about my 
                        experience, that of a young, Jewish male 
                        going to a WASP-y prep school.

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (sarcastic)
                        Oh, the hardship.

           EXT. LAND ROVER -- NIGHT / SAME 

           It looks like David and Elizabeth are having a perfectly 
           calm conversation. Body language unremarkable, unheated.

                                 DAVID (FILTERED)
                        And you stole it. You rewrote it and made 
                        it about being a girl.

           INT. LAND ROVER -- NIGHT / SAME

                                 DAVID
                        The whole point was me looking in on a 
                        thing from the outside. And you're the 
                        one who rips it off? You're an insider, 
                        you epitomize that, with your 
                        Philadelphia debutante pedigree, Aryan 
                        fuck-you eating clubs, Cape Cod bullshit. 
                        The irony of that is lost on you?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I couldn't have done it without you, 
                        David. Is that what you want me to say?

                                 DAVID
                        I want you to say a hundred Hail Marys, 
                        get cancer and croak.

           Elizabeth smiles. There's mischief in it. She opens her 
           door -- cold air rushes in -- she gets out of the Rover -- 

           David watches her through the window -- Elizabeth comes 
           to his door -- opens it -- David sweats a little as 
           Elizabeth climbs into the backseat next to him -- she 
           forces him to slide over, make room.

           She shuts the door. A silent beat. Close quarters. Tense.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        Let's agree on one thing: I wrote a 
                        halfway decent book --

                                 DAVID
                                  (with disdain)
                        'Young adult.'

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (over him)
                         -- let's agree on another: I may never 
                        have had it published if it wasn't for 
                        the article.

                                 DAVID
                        My article. You're a thief.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        No, I'm not. I rewrote it. I was a 
                        facilitator. I don't need to facilitate 
                        anymore. I got a two-book deal.

                                 DAVID
                        I might kill you in this car. I literally 
                        might strangle out your life-breath.

           Elizabeth puts her hand on David's knee, holds it there. 
           He glances down, then up to the come-hither look on her 
           face. He's turned on, despite his best efforts not to be.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Half of me took your article on 
                        principle.

                                 DAVID
                                  (quiet; melancholy)
                        But I shared it with you. I trusted you. 
                        I actually cared...

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You don't hand over something that good 
                        like it's a shopping list or a baseball 
                        card.

                                 DAVID
                        I was in love with you. Like an idiot. 
                        You knew I was. The whole summer 
                        program... and I was your mentor!

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You have a piece like that, you better 
                        protect it 'til someone snatches it up.

                                 DAVID
                                  (pause)
                        You'll never be your sister.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        Oh, please. Who wants to be her? She's a 
                        hyper-realist.

                                 DAVID
                        Okay, this has been super. I'm gonna fake 
                        a stomach flu and beg off for the night.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You can't shake me.

                                 DAVID
                                  (checks the time)
                        I'll go see what's taking him so long.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I'm coming with you, clearly.

                                 DAVID
                        No, you're not.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        No? So I sit out here -- stay out here 
                        like your dog? Not likely.

           David considers his options.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                        Best behavior. You have my word.

                                 DAVID
                        That's entirely reassuring.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You get out, I get out. Up to you.

           David thinks, decides. Then -- he leans forward, SHUTS 
           OFF THE IGNITION, GRABS THE KEYS -- then opens his door 
           and gets out.  Elizabeth opens hers, steps out onto --

           EXT. BROOKLYN STREET -- CONTINUOUS

           David and Elizabeth close doors, approach the brownstone.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You don't have my book on your shelf.

                                 DAVID
                        I don't have your book at all.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I know you've got the book.

                                 DAVID
                        You think I'd read your book?
                                 ELIZABETH
                        Cover to cover.

           As they ascend the steps --

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                                  (studies him)
                        I like your hair longer.

                                 DAVID
                        Thanks -- got scissors in your purse?

           Then -- SWOOSH! -- the brownstone door opens fast --

           CHAOS. FOUR PEOPLE -- TWO GUYS, TWO GIRLS -- flee the 
           brownstone, blow past David and Elizabeth on the stairs. 
           She's knocked off balance -- David catches her --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Whoa, Jesus...

                                 DAVID
                        What the --

                                 GUY 1
                        Go go go...

                                 GIRL 1
                                  (overlapping)
                        ... out of my way --

                                 GIRL 2
                        Get out of here -- fast -- now --

                                 GUY 2
                        Dave, man, go -- seriously --

                                 DAVID
                                  (to Guy 2)
                        Teddy, what's going on? 

                                 GUY 2/TEDDY
                        It's not okay -- fuck -- it's all fucked 
                        up in there...

                                 DAVID
                                  (calls after Teddy)
                        What the hell?

           But Teddy's gone -- the four people have scattered fast 
           in the blur of confusion -- all of them heading different 
           directions at varying speeds down the quiet street.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What's happening?

           Chris, freaked, worried, rushes out of the brownstone --
                                 CHRIS
                        Get in the car.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What?

                                 CHRIS
                        Get in the car, I said.

                                 DAVID
                        What's going on --

           Chris turns, shoots David a chilling look --

                                 CHRIS
                        David. Now.

           Running -- Chris to the driver's side -- David and 
           Elizabeth race to climb into their seats. Doors SLAM shut 
           -- then A LOW ROAR as Chris starts the engine --

           INT. LAND ROVER (TRAVELLING) -- NIGHT

           FRENETIC; BOUNCING AND HURLING with the Rover.  High 
           speed -- Chris navigates the STREET TRAFFIC and DOUBLE-
           PARKED CARS best he can. A mess of overlap --

                                 CHRIS
                        Shit -- everything -- shit --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Chris?

                                 DAVID
                        What happened?

                                 CHRIS
                        William -- William, he's --

                                 DAVID
                        What? He's what?

                                 CHRIS
                        He's dead.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        No --

                                 DAVID
                        What? No, he's not. No, he's not.

                                 CHRIS
                        I saw him --

           SWERVE -- HONK! -- Chris almost tagged another car --
                                 ELIZABETH
                        Calm down -- watch the street -- 

                                 DAVID
                        Fuck you -- turn around -- go back -- 

                                 CHRIS
                                  (pounds the steering wheel)
                        He's in a chair! Eyes open! David!

           EXT. BROOKLYN ALLEY -- NIGHT

           The Land Rover is parked, three doors splayed open, 
           HEADLIGHTS reflecting off a brick wall. Elizabeth, David 
           and Chris around the Rover -- trying to catch their 
           breath -- still overlapping, frantic --

                                 CHRIS
                        It couldn't have been just opium. He must 
                        have had a lot of other stuff in there.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        He could just be having some kind of 
                        attack or bad reaction.

                                 DAVID
                        No way -- no way...

                                 CHRIS
                                  (in his own world)
                        Did anybody see us? Someone could have 
                        seen us. My car -- my license plate --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You can't worry about that -- baby --

                                 CHRIS
                        They could call me in for -- I could go 
                        to jail.

                                 DAVID
                        There's no way William is dead.

           CLOSE ON ELIZABETH -- panicked curiosity in her eyes --

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (to Chris)
                        What did it look like in there?

           Chris takes a beat before responding.

                                 CHRIS
                                  (chilled by the memory)
                        William was alone in his office -- door 
                        cracked open...

           OFF CHRIS'S EYES, to his vision of the description...
           INT. BROWNSTONE / OFFICE -- NIGHT   

           ... shadowy, LOW LAMP-LIGHT in this crowded office -- 
           seasoned-shabby decor of a library -- spines of books, 
           thousands of them -- lit dimly, also lit by MOONLIGHT.

                                 CHRIS (V.O.)
                        Teddy and them must have taken one look 
                        at him and split -- I went in alone. Then 
                        I saw William's legs from around the 
                        other side of his chair --

           APPROACH A FIGURE -- not fully visible -- only A MAN'S 
           LEGS SPLAYED OUT FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF A CHAIR. In b.g. 
           AN OPEN WINDOW -- COLD AIR pushes at a tattered curtain.

                                 CHRIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        As I got close, I saw that his eyes were 
                        open --

           CLOSE ON THE MAN'S EYES -- open wide -- LOW LIGHT 
           reflected on the glassy, lifeless surface --

                                 CHRIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        His mouth was open, too, not breathing --

           CLOSE ON THE MAN'S MOUTH -- frozen there, gaping -- 
           neglected teeth -- dried saliva caked on the lower lip --

                                 CHRIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        There was a stack of pages in his lap...

           CLOSE ON A STACK OF PAGES IN THE MAN'S LAP. Just then --

                                 DAVID (V.O.)
                        Shut up! --

           EXT. BROOKLYN ALLEY -- NIGHT

           CLOSE ON ELIZABETH, listening, coming out of it. WIDEN TO 
           REVEAL DAVID as he rounds the Rover, charging at Chris --

                                 DAVID
                        -- excuse me, but shut the fuck up 
                        please. Fuck you and this prank --

                                 CHRIS
                        It's not a prank.

           David grabs Chris by the collar, throws him hard BAM! 
           against the Rover door. They grapple for the upper hand --

                                 DAVID
                        Yes, it is. Say it is. Say it is!

           Chris spins David -- pins him hard to the wall -- puts a 
           gloved hand over his mouth --
                                 CHRIS
                        Listen: Listen: Listen to me! I tried to 
                        revive him. I tried to bring him back. I 
                        couldn't. He's gone. David. He's dead.

           Chris holds David's face for a beat -- until David begins 
           to settle down. Chris removes his hand. Silence. Then --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        It's so awful, someone dying. Especially 
                        when they're famous...
                                  (then)
                        So, wait... you said there was a stack of 
                        pages. He has a new book?

                                 CHRIS
                        Had a new book.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Was there a pub date on it?

                                 DAVID
                        What do you care?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I just want to know when it's coming out.

                                 CHRIS
                        It's not coming out.

                                 DAVID
                        Why not?

                                 CHRIS
                        Well, first of all, he's dead.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        So, that happens all the time.

                                 CHRIS
                        And the second thing is --

           Chris reaches into the inside pocket of his overcoat, 
           pulls out a MANUSCRIPT -- creased pages, a mess. A hollow 
           THUNK as he tosses it on the hood of the Rover --

                                 CHRIS (CONT'D)
                        -- we have the only copy.

           They stare at the manuscript, trade looks. David walks to 
           it -- slowly -- traces his fingers along the page edges. 
           ON THE WRINKLED COVER PAGE, the title: "GRIEVING CITY" --

                                 ELIZABETH (V.O./PRE-LAP)
                        "Gazing down at the cracked prairie 
                        highway that tongued out of the grieving 
                        city was sickening because of the 
                        movement there."
           INT. LEWIS BROWNSTONE / DAVID'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT  

           Two hours later. ON THE PAGES of the Banks manuscript -- 
           typed, wrinkled, a booze-stained pile. Elizabeth holds 
           the manuscript, THE PAGE with the words she reads --

                                 ELIZABETH (O.S.)
                        "Dan Percy made a complete and total 
                        about-face."

           David and Elizabeth alone. He paces; seated, she reads. 
           O.S. FOOTSTEPS are audible as Chris climbs the stairs.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                                  (reads)
                        "Of course the view was different from 
                        where he now stood, above Winnipeg more 
                        so than in it."

           Elizabeth stops reading, looks up from the manuscript.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                        What do you think?

                                 DAVID
                        It's kind of a mess.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Needs work. But it's really very good.

           He takes the manuscript from her, reads the cover page --

                                 DAVID
                                  (reads)
                        "Grieving City." I can't believe this...

           Chris enters, takes off his overcoat.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Everything okay?

                                 DAVID
                        What took you so long?

                                 CHRIS
                        A cab from Park to come back out here...?

                                 DAVID
                                  (annoyed)
                        Like I live in East Serbia...

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Did you call 9-1-1?

                                 CHRIS
                        From a payphone in the city, yeah.

           Chris hands Elizabeth her MAKEUP COMPACT from before --
                                 CHRIS (CONT'D)
                        You left this in the front seat.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Thanks.

                                 CHRIS
                                  (re: manuscript)
                        How is it?

           Elizabeth puts down the manuscript, stands. She crosses 
           to David's bookshelves -- peruses titles --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Well, everyone needs an editor.

                                 CHRIS
                        I don't need an editor.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You're not a writer.

                                 CHRIS
                                  ("my point exactly")
                        That's what I'm saying.

           From the bookshelf, Elizabeth takes down a well-thumbed 
           copy of "SONG OF THE SILENT BIRD." She turns over the 
           book -- see HER SISTER'S AUTHOR PHOTO, labeled with her 
           name; a short bio listing credits and awards. 

           PRE-LAP the sound of RUNNING WATER --

           INT. LEWIS BROWNSTONE / ADJACENT BATHROOM -- NIGHT

           Moments later. Elizabeth studies herself in the mirror -- 
           opens the door of the medicine cabinet -- inspects 
           David's stuff in there -- toiletries, prescription pills.

           Then Elizabeth shuts the cabinet door. Washes her hands. 
           Dries them. Fixes her hair. Something in her eyes --

           INT. BROOKLYN BAR -- NIGHT -- M.O.S. (FLASHBACK)

           Familiar. The book-release party, from ANOTHER ANGLE. 
           Elizabeth, by the hardcovers on display, stares across 
           the room at -- CAROLINE AND NIKOLAS. They talk, laugh.

           CLOSE ON ELIZABETH as she seethes with jealousy bordering 
           on resentment -- a contested border. In her eyes, see the 
           kind of deep envy that can sink a person, or push them...
           INT. LEWIS BROWNSTONE / DAVID'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Elizabeth enters. Chris absentmindedly thumbs through the 
           Banks manuscript as David paces. 

                                 CHRIS
                        What are we gonna do with this 
                        manuscript?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Do you think anyone's seen it?

                                 DAVID
                        No. I told you, he doesn't show word one 
                        until it's finished.

           David crosses to the window, looks out. Chris goes to the 
           desk, pours himself a fresh whiskey.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What about colleagues? Agent... editor.

                                 DAVID
                        He told me he hasn't spoken to his agent 
                        in years. And there is no editor -- 
                        Farrar red-lined his deal after he handed 
                        them a translation of a Ukrainian 
                        cookbook. They said he was cracked up.

                                 CHRIS
                        Damn...

                                 DAVID
                        In the publishing world, the guy no 
                        longer exists.

           A quiet moment passes in the room.

                                 CHRIS
                        Okay. So. What do we do now?

                                 DAVID
                                  (re: manuscript)
                        There's a phone number scribbled on the 
                        back here -- maybe William was about to 
                        reestablish industry contact with 
                        someone. I'll call...

           David enters the numbers on his cell phone. Elizabeth 
           watches. But before he can hit "call" --

           Elizabeth crosses to him -- fast -- swipes the phone --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Hang on.

                                 DAVID
                        Pardon me?
                                 ELIZABETH
                        Why call?

                                 DAVID
                        What do you mean, 'why'? To give it back.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You want to give back the manuscript.

                                 DAVID
                        What else would we do with it?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Well, that's what I want to talk about.
                                  (careful pause)
                        I don't think we should make any rash 
                        decisions.

           David and Chris -- both confused -- stare at Elizabeth.

           INT. LEWIS BROWNSTONE / FATHER'S OFFICE -- NIGHT

           Elizabeth paces, intense focus. Chris sits. David stands 
           by the door. All drink -- only David and Chris smoke pot. 
           On the desk in b.g., the METAL LOCK-BOX sits wide open.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I'm only trying to say that we should 
                        talk about this.

                                 DAVID
                        We should talk about the best way to give 
                        it back.

                                 CHRIS
                        That's why I took it.

                                 DAVID
                        Chris rescued it, is more like it, from 
                        E.M.T.'s, whatever, would have used it to 
                        mop up his vomit or feces or, you know?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        So, we're not even gonna talk about 
                        alternatives?

                                 CHRIS
                        I don't see how there can be alternatives 
                        to, like, the only sane and reasonable 
                        course of action.

           Puff, pass... puff, pass... Elizabeth abstains.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I'll show you. Play this out with me. You 
                        call the agent, somebody --
                                 CHRIS
                        Or not even, we could just, you know --

                                 DAVID
                        We could just drop it off.

                                 CHRIS
                        Exactly. A completely anonymous thing.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        So, no one gets credit.

                                 DAVID
                        Credit for what?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        For returning the manuscript.

                                 DAVID
                        Who needs credit for that? Like it's a 
                        Cocker Spaniel?

                                 CHRIS
                        It's not a missing person, Elizabeth, 
                        it's a man's work.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Clearly he cared so much about it.

                                 DAVID
                        What is that supposed to mean?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Oh, I'm sorry. Have I spoken ill of your 
                        junkie mentor? My apologies.

                                 DAVID
                        You were being sarcastic. I want to know 
                        what you meant.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        That he would O.D. is a disrespect to the 
                        craft of writing and he doesn't deserve 
                        this book. He abandoned this book.

                                 DAVID
                        He wrote it.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        And Chris saved it. Now it has a chance 
                        for a new life.

                                 CHRIS
                        What's wrong with the old one?

                                 DAVID
                                  (to Elizabeth)
                        We lost a friend, first of all. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        I think you're being insensitive to, 
                        like, an absurd degree.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        We're only talking.

                                 DAVID
                        It's what you're talking about. The book 
                        is his, even if it is a mess.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Such a mess no one's ever gonna see it! 
                        Is that what you want for your friend's 
                        work? It becomes some curiosity, never 
                        published? The stuff of myth? Or legend?
                                  (then; a pace-change)
                        So, I'm saying: What if the book could be 
                        more than that? I think it can. And I 
                        think someone has to help it get there. 

                                 CHRIS
                        You're saying, you put your name on this?

                                 DAVID
                        Unfortunately, yes, she's -- that's what 
                        you mean?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        That's what I want to discuss with you. 
                        Yes.

           PRE-LAP a loud DING! --

           INT. LEWIS BROWNSTONE / KITCHEN -- NIGHT

           THE OVEN DOOR OPENS -- David's oven-mitted hand pulls out 
           a TAKE-AND-BAKE PIZZA -- he cuts it into rough slices. 
           David and Chris are a bit more stoned -- all still drink.

                                 CHRIS
                        I can't be a party to this. David?

                                 DAVID
                                  (to Elizabeth)
                        Scratch what I said before. This is now 
                        the most heartless thing I've ever seen.

                                 CHRIS
                                  (oblivious)
                        What did you say before?

           During the following, David and Elizabeth take occasional 
           bites of the food, pick at the crust; Chris doesn't.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I know you probably want to talk about 
                        the best way to go about this.
                                 DAVID
                        Absolutely not.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What do you mean, 'absolutely not'? Like 
                        it's yours already? Who the fuck are you?

                                 DAVID
                        No one to you, clearly, and I didn't have 
                        my first novel published in college.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        But with this manuscript you could have 
                        your first novel published in months.

                                 DAVID
                        Oh, so now I'm taking the book.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Well, do you want it?

                                 DAVID
                        I didn't write it.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        He was your friend.

                                 DAVID
                        All the more reason --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You had a relationship with him.

                                 DAVID
                        That's the reason I wouldn't put my name 
                        on the man's work.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Someone's got to clean it up, get it out 
                        there.

                                 DAVID
                        Why you?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Should it be you?

                                 DAVID
                        I would never do that!

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Fine. I would.

                                 CHRIS
                        Honey?
                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (to David)
                        For the good of the book. I'm asking you 
                        to think about that.

                                 DAVID
                        'For the good of the book.'

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I've been in the publishing business for 
                        three years. Okay? I know how things 
                        work. Even with Banks's name, no one's 
                        going to publish a scorched-earth mess.

                                 DAVID
                        It's not that bad...

                                 ELIZABETH
                        No? Yes -- you said it is. So, then what? 
                        Some cut-happy editor comes in with a red 
                        pen and Gordon-Lish-es the life out of 
                        it? How is that justice?

                                 CHRIS
                        You've got to be kidding me...

           Elizabeth stands, rounds the counter, homes in on David --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        But I think it's good. I want to help it. 
                        We have to help it if people are going to 
                        see the work. The text, in my opinion, 
                        deserves that.

                                 DAVID
                        Oh, I see. You're in it for the welfare 
                        of the art.

                                 CHRIS
                        You're saying: It's about the art?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I'm saying everybody wins.

                                 DAVID
                        Everybody except the two idiots who let 
                        this thing happen and are now so racked 
                        with guilt they can't sleep.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        No. They win, too.

                                 CHRIS
                        How do they win?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Your silence will not go unnoticed by me.
           INT. LEWIS BROWNSTONE / DAVID'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Later. David and Chris are on the opposite side of the 
           room from Elizabeth, who touches the manuscript pages --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Think about it: The great wide open, the 
                        world is a scary place. Don't you want to 
                        have a little security out there in the 
                        unknown? I know I do. This... is that.
                                  (emphatic pause)
                        This is gold.
                                  (to David)
                        I will facilitate this book into the 
                        world. I can. Then -- I will help you.

                                 DAVID
                        You're gonna help me.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I will pull every string within reach to 
                        get your work out there. An article, a 
                        short story, a novel, anything. You wash 
                        my hand, I will scrub yours spotless.
                                  (then)
                        It's your career, David. Get it while 
                        you're young.

           David lets this land. He crosses away from her, circles --

                                 DAVID
                        Well... but Chris rescued it. 
                        Technically, in our presently fucked 
                        system of logic, the manuscript is his.

                                 CHRIS
                        It's not mine.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        That's right. It's ours. Three of us.

                                 CHRIS
                        Well, no, I mean, I didn't rescue it for 
                        us. I rescued it from them. The E.M.T.'s, 
                        I don't know, I didn't know what they'd 
                        do. How the hell was I supposed to know?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You weren't, baby. You did the right 
                        thing.

                                 CHRIS
                        William's in the chair. I saw it, it was 
                        a spur-of-the-moment kind of thing.

                                 DAVID
                        I'm not saying you did a bad thing by 
                        taking it.
                                 CHRIS
                        I know you're not. At least I hope you're 
                        not.

                                 DAVID
                        Chris, I'm not.

                                 CHRIS
                        Okay.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Neither am I, sweetie.

           David picks up the manuscript --

                                 DAVID
                        Your first novel was young adult. Will 
                        anyone believe you produced this?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        After I rewrite it, they will. Everybody 
                        grows up sometime.

                                 CHRIS
                        You would do that?

           Elizabeth sets down her WHISKEY GLASS, lipstick on the 
           edge, on David's bedside table -- 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Given the circumstances, I have no choice 
                        but to utter a resounding Yes.

                                 CHRIS
                        Well, I think it's bullshit.

           A long beat. Finally -- because it pains him to say it --

                                 DAVID
                        I think she's right.

                            CHRIS
                                                       ELIZABETH
           What?
                                              You do? What?

                                 CHRIS
                        How stoned are you?

                                 DAVID
                        If she puts her stamp on it -- who's to 
                        say?

                                 CHRIS
                        But it's not her book, Dave.

           David and Elizabeth step into a private moment --
                                 DAVID
                        And you promise there's something for me 
                        on the other side of this.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Oh, I promise.

                                 DAVID
                        Because that could make up for a lot of 
                        things.

           Chris, frustrated, throws up his arms -- turns his back 
           on them, crosses to the window --

                                 CHRIS
                                  (innocent-oblivious)
                        What the hell are you guys talking about?

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (to David; loaded)
                        A lot of things.

                                 DAVID
                        If I can trust you.

           Elizabeth traces her hand along the side of his face --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You can trust me.

           David's hooked. Chris turns back to them -- didn't see --

                                 CHRIS
                        I'm standing here, I'm shocked and amazed 
                        by this. David? Are you being serious?

                                 DAVID
                        I'm thinking... it is a mess, really, 
                        when you look at it. But there's 
                        something there.

                                 CHRIS
                        Yeah -- William's work.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        But if it changes? What even is that?

                                 DAVID
                                  (to Chris)
                        She's already established, it would be 
                        easier --

                                 CHRIS
                        No...
                                 DAVID
                        I've been spinning my wheels for years. 
                        And then now it's, you know, she'll help 
                        me get my novel published. How else could 
                        I do that? Me? Who I am?

           Fed up, Chris grabs his coat and the GALA INVITATION, 
           storms out. David and Elizabeth follow him out to --

           THE THIRD-FLOOR LANDING --

           Chris races downstairs -- David and Elizabeth shout down 
           over the bannister --

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        Chris, wait --

                                 CHRIS (O.S.)
                        Fuck you both very much.

                                 DAVID
                        Where are you going?

                                 CHRIS (O.S.)
                        The Botanic Garden thing.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What about me?

                                 CHRIS (O.S.)
                        What about you?

           SLAM! of the front door O.S. Now they're alone together.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Get your tux.

                                 DAVID
                        You think I own a tux?

           INT. TAXI (TRAVELLING) -- NIGHT

           Lights of Flatbush Avenue wipe over Elizabeth and David. 
           David, in a suit now, adjusts his tie. Thinks he's all 
           set -- but Elizabeth thinks differently --

           She slides across the seat to him -- too close -- and 
           adjusts his knot. Brushes off some lint. Cleans him up.

           EXT. BROOKLYN BOTANIC GARDEN, PALM HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Establishing. A GLASS HOUSE structure lit gorgeously 
           inside and out. A banner announces: "BROOKLYN ACADEMY OF 
           MUSIC -- WINTER GALA."
           EXT. BROOKLYN BOTANIC GARDEN, PALM HOUSE / ENTRY -- NIGHT

           David and Elizabeth step out of a taxi to the sounds of 
           MUSIC -- of high-end nightlife. David pays the DRIVER.

           Parked LIMOS. A red carpet set-up is broken down by TIRED 
           WORKMEN. One last Press PHOTOGRAPHER, mid-20s, is left 
           packing up his gear. As David and Elizabeth pass him --

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Who are you? Should I know you?

           David and Elizabeth stop.

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D)
                                  (impatient)
                        Should I know you? What's your name?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Elizabeth Hawkins. I'm a novelist.

           The Photographer speaks into a recorder attached to the 
           base of his camera --

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Elizabeth Hawkins. Novelist.
                                  (to David; more impatient)
                        You?

                                 DAVID
                        David Lewis. I'm, uh...

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Fuck it. Smile.

           Elizabeth smiles. David edges up next to her --

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D)
                        Not him -- just you.

           Elizabeth shoots David a silent, half-assed apology. He 
           steps back. She poses with a smile. POP! FLASH! as the 
           Photographer SNAPS shot after shot. David watches. FLASH!

           INT. PALM HOUSE / GALA RECEPTION ROOM -- NIGHT

           David and Elizabeth enter -- they SWIPE DRINKS off a tray 
           held by a passing CATERER. A FEW HUNDRED PEOPLE party. A 
           BAND plays AGREEABLE MUSIC. The dance floor is packed 
           with SOCIETY WOMEN in expensive dresses propped up by 
           WEALTHY MEN in tuxedos. David's the only guy in a suit.

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (scans the room; wide-eyed)
                        Holy shit, this is... that guy --

           As she points out VARIOUS PEOPLE to David --
                                 ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                        That guy's the Publisher at Farrar...
                                  (nods elsewhere)
                        And those women -- two of the top editors 
                        at Random House. One on the right has her 
                        own imprint. Wow, there's Binky Urban...

           From across the room -- BINKY URBAN waves to Elizabeth.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                                  (looking around)
                        Drop a bomb here and there wouldn't be a 
                        book published in America for years.

                                 DAVID
                        How do you know these people?

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (playing it cool)
                        Everyone does.

           An EDITOR approaches, says "Hello" to Elizabeth... kiss-
           kiss... industry nice-making. As the Editor moves off --

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                                  (scanning the room)
                        And there are musicians, movie people...
                                  (an afterthought)
                        Do you see Chris?

                                 DAVID
                        There's his mom. No.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Where?

           ELIZABETH'S POV -- MRS. WOLCOTT
           A striking beauty in her early 60s, she moves on the 
           dance floor to the beat of two too many Chardonnays. She 
           dances sloppy-close with a GENTLEMAN, also early 60s.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                        I haven't met Chris's dad yet.

                                 DAVID
                        That's not Chris's dad.

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  ("yikes")
                        Oh.

                                 DAVID
                                  (nods across the room)
                        Over there.

           ACROSS THE ROOM -- Chris stands with his father, MR. 
           WOLCOTT, 60s, overworked world-beater, titan of industry. 
           Chris sees David and Elizabeth -- then turns his back.
                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        This is going awesome so far.

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (sips drink; re: Chris)
                        I'll go talk to him.

                                 DAVID
                        What am I supposed to do?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I don't care. Find a cougar to woo.

           TIME CUT --

           ACROSS THE ROOM -- Elizabeth cautiously approaches Chris 
           and Mr. Wolcott. Mr. Wolcott looks up from an active PDA.

                                 CHRIS
                                  (semi-cold)
                        Dad, this is my girlfriend, Elizabeth.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        So nice to meet you, sir.

                                 MR. WOLCOTT
                        Likewise. Are you feeling better?

           Chris shoots her a look: "Just go with it."

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (quick pick-up)
                        Yes. Oh, yes, much. Thanks.

           Elizabeth eyes Chris with interest, some concern --

                                 ELIZABETH (V.O./PRE-LAP) 
                                 (CONT'D)
                        Tell me, though, in a nutshell, what your 
                        main problem is...

           INT. PALM HOUSE / DANCE FLOOR -- NIGHT

           Later. Elizabeth and Chris dancing amid PARTY GUESTS.

                                 CHRIS
                        There is no nutshell on earth big enough 
                        to contain the multitude of my problems 
                        with this. I don't know where to begin.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Start anywhere. I'm listening. I'm here 
                        for you, really, to listen, hear you out.

           Elizabeth, distracted, turns, sees --
           ELIZABETH'S POV -- DAVID
           Standing alone by the dance floor. He sips his drink.

                                 CHRIS
                        I mean, if we do this, am I guilty by 
                        association because I sleep with you?
                                  (no response)
                        Elizabeth? Did you hear me?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What? Yes. No -- what?

           David approaches, drink in hand --

                                 DAVID
                                  (gently)
                        Hey, man.

                                 CHRIS
                                  (re: his suit; a dig)
                        Nice tux.
                                  (then)
                        You know this is crazy. We can't do this.

           Suddenly -- their private conversation is interrupted --

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Elizabeth?

           Elizabeth -- along with David and Chris -- turns to see -- 
           JONATHAN ROE, late 30s, in a tux. A book critic. Snarky.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Jonathan!

                                 MALE VOICE/JONATHAN
                        You look great.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Aw, shucks. And check you out, all dapper 
                        and 'James Bond'...

           Elizabeth makes no move to introduce David and Chris. 
           Jonathan schmoozes with sizeable professional bullshit --

                                 JONATHAN
                        Anyway, everyone at Publishers Weekly is 
                        downright salivating for your next book.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I'll finish the damn thing if you promise 
                        to give me another good review.

           David tries to hide his envy. He seethes in the failing.

                                 JONATHAN
                        We shall see. You done with school yet?
                                 ELIZABETH
                        May.

                                 JONATHAN
                        We'll grab lunch when you finish -- call 
                        me after graduation.

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (flirtatious)
                        The ink on my diploma will still be wet.

           David and Chris trade looks as -- Elizabeth and Jonathan 
           cheek-kiss goodbye. Jonathan walks off. Elizabeth turns --

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                        Sorry about that.

           When Chris is sure they're alone, out of earshot --

                                 CHRIS
                                  (ignoring her; to David)
                        What happens, we get caught doing this?

                                 DAVID
                                  ("too many people around")
                        Not here.

           EXT. BROOKLYN BOTANIC GARDEN / PATH -- NIGHT

           Secluded. Elizabeth -- Chris's coat draped over her own -- 
           shivers. Chris and David steel themselves to the freeze. 
           Muffled sounds of the gala audible from O.S.

                                 CHRIS
                                  (to David)
                        We're talking about William. Someone 
                        renowned. Took you under his wing, over a 
                        year ago, he didn't have to. Who are you?

                                 DAVID
                        It's me. Still me. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I am too freezing. I can't be out here.

                                 DAVID
                        Jesus Christ -- here --

           David takes off his overcoat, shoves it at her. Elizabeth 
           puts it on. She's big now, oversized in all three coats.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                                  (to Chris; an earnest plea)
                        I'm not you, man. I'm not set. But what 
                        we're talking about -- with her doing 
                        this, then helping me in return -- that's 
                        a guarantee of something. I need that.
           Elizabeth watches David work. She loves it.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                                  (loaded)
                        If anyone can make it work, she can make 
                        it work.

           David and Elizabeth exchange a private glance.

                                 CHRIS
                        I still don't know if someone saw the 
                        car, the plate -- 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        No one saw.

                                 CHRIS
                        Were you there? Up in every window of 
                        every brownstone, peering down through 
                        the curtains with the old Jewish ladies?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        No, I wasn't, but I'm sure you have 
                        nothing to worry about.

                                 DAVID
                        'Old Jewish ladies'?

                                 CHRIS
                        Oh, please.

                                 DAVID
                        Wait, no, why is it important that the 
                        women in the windows are Jewish?

                                 CHRIS
                        Because they're nosy!

                                 DAVID
                        Pardon me?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Okay, this is not productive.

                                 DAVID
                                  (to Chris)
                        You'd better watch your mouth.

                                 CHRIS
                        I need another drink...

                                 ELIZABETH
                        He didn't mean anything by it. Relax.
                                 DAVID
                        You think you know someone -- your whole 
                        life you consider them a brother -- then 
                        one night they start goose-stepping 
                        around the Botanic Garden!

                                 CHRIS
                        Oh, fuck you.

                                 DAVID
                        Fuck you, you Aryan fuck!

                                 ELIZABETH
                        David. Stop. It was a detail he 
                        mentioned, it meant nothing. You live in 
                        Brooklyn. It's not like the women are 
                        gonna be Mormon.

                                 DAVID
                                  (pause)
                        Fine.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Chris, why don't you apologize?

                                 CHRIS
                        In English or in German?

                                 DAVID
                        Oh, that's it --

           David lunges at Chris -- they hit the deck, wrestle like 
           ten-year-olds. Elizabeth tries to break it up but her 
           mobility is compromised by the bulk of three coats. David 
           locks Chris in some kind of wrestling hold. All tangled.

           INT. COPY SHOP -- NIGHT

           Late-night deserted. Elizabeth stands between David and 
           Chris, both dirty from the fight. A COPY CLERK manual-
           feeds their pages into a Xerox machine out of earshot. 
           Even so, all three of them talk sotto and restrained --

                                 CHRIS
                        Why would she send it tonight? I don't 
                        see what the rush is.
                                  (to Elizabeth)
                        Shouldn't you wait, do some work on it?

                                 DAVID
                        But you said yourself they're waiting on 
                        your second book. It's not like you'd be 
                        coming out of the blue with this.
                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (to David; dismissive)
                        You don't know how publishing works. I 
                        can handle it from here, thanks.

                                 DAVID
                        That's a nice attitude. Isn't this whole 
                        thing for my benefit as well? Aren't you 
                        trying to help me?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Of course it is. Of course I am.

                                 DAVID
                        Then listen to me, because I'm trying to 
                        help you, too.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Okay.

                                 CHRIS
                        I'm going to buy beer.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Will you get me a water, please?

           Chris, no response, exits the copy shop. When he's gone --

                                 DAVID
                        You've got to get this thing in before 
                        people -- and they might not even do 
                        this, but also they might -- before 
                        people start sniffing around for every 
                        stack of pages that smacks of Banks's 
                        work. You've got less than a day to beat 
                        that. Two days, tops. 
                                  (then)
                        If you go in with it now, go in confident 
                        and strong, then there's nothing to be 
                        suspected by anyone at any time. This way 
                        -- you're less likely to get caught.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        This is what you think.

                                 DAVID
                        Shouldn't it be? If you get caught, then 
                        I'm fucked, as well.
                                  (pause)
                        Just send the first three chapters. Give 
                        them a taste.
                                  (then)
                        It's covering all your bases, even the 
                        ones, in the end, you didn't have to.

           Elizabeth thinks it over. She can see his point.

           TIME CUT --
           David and Chris sit in silence -- empty chair between 
           them -- sipping TALL BOYS IN BROWN PAPER BAGS. Elizabeth 
           stands outside on her cell phone. She ends her call, then 
           enters the copy shop, BOTTLE OF WATER in hand.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Okay: Yay. My agent's waiting, soon as we 
                        can get the chapters over to her place...

                                 DAVID
                        Where?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        That's the bad news. Jersey City.

           David -- expectant -- turns to look at Chris -- 

                                 CHRIS
                        The car's in Manhattan, so why don't you 
                        eat a bag of dicks.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Honey, come on...

                                 CHRIS
                        I'm not getting the car. I'm not driving 
                        the car -- I don't want to be involved.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Well, what the hell?

                                 CHRIS
                        Use a messenger service.

                                 DAVID
                        I don't know about that.

                                 CHRIS
                        Why not?

                                 DAVID
                                  (extra sotto)
                        I think it might be a mistake to involve 
                        other people than the three of us.

           Chris calls off loudly to the Copy Clerk --

                                 CHRIS
                        Do you guys have a messenger service you 
                        recommend?

           EXT. BROOKLYN STREET -- NIGHT

           ON A DECAL READING: "BROOKLYN MERCURY MESSENGERS." WIDEN 
           TO REVEAL THE DECAL on the door of A PARKED, IDLING CAR. 
           CLASSIC ROCK dribbles from the tinny speakers. THE 
           MESSENGER, a late-40s burn-out, fills out a form as --
           Elizabeth, David and Chris stand on the curb. Elizabeth 
           holds a MANILA ENVELOPE -- David grips a copy shop bag.

                                 CHRIS
                        How can you possibly explain showing your 
                        agent a type-written manuscript? You 
                        don't write on a typewriter.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Now I do. I'm going back to my roots.

                                 CHRIS
                        Your 'roots'?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        The roots, I mean. The roots of writing. 
                        When writing was typewriting.

                                 CHRIS
                        Oh, my God...

                                 ELIZABETH
                        She probably won't even notice. I say 
                        it's a font. Whatever. I'm gonna have to 
                        re-type the whole thing eventually, so 
                        who cares?

           The Messenger hands the form to Elizabeth --

                                 MESSENGER
                        Initial the middle line, sign the bottom.

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (initials, signs)
                        When will this get there?

                                 MESSENGER
                        Within the hour.

           Elizabeth hands over the clipboard. Then the manila 
           envelope. The three of them watch this transaction with 
           interest: The point of no return. The Messenger tosses 
           the envelope on the passenger seat -- just another 
           package. He TURNS UP the FREEDOM ROCK jams, drives away.

                                 DAVID
                        So, that happened.
                                  (then)
                        You guys want to get a drink?

           But Chris has already stepped into the street --

                                 CHRIS
                                  (calls out)
                        Taxi!

           A TAXI stops across the street. Waits.
                                 DAVID
                        All righty, then.

                                 CHRIS
                        I hope you're happy with yourself.

                                 DAVID
                        Eventually I'll find the peace of mind to 
                        sleep again.

           Chris walks to the taxi.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                                  (calls out)
                        What about all the stuff we're supposed 
                        to do tomorrow? With your family? Do you 
                        still want me to come?

           Chris gets into the taxi, no response. He leaves the door 
           open for Elizabeth.

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (sotto)
                        I want you to come.
                                  (then)
                        It'll look weird if you're not around. He 
                        invited you -- they'll ask questions.

                                 DAVID
                        He invited me. His largesse...

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Come.

                                 DAVID
                        He's disappointed in me.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        He'll get over it.

                                 DAVID
                        I might be disappointed in myself.

           HONK HONK. The taxi horn. But neither of them moves. Not 
           an inch. They hold eye contact as --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Good night.

                                 DAVID
                        Is that what it was?

           A flirtatious look passes between them. Then Elizabeth 
           goes to the taxi, gets in. As it drives away, David waves 
           -- Chris gives him the finger -- David watches them go.
           INT. TAXI (TRAVELLING) -- NIGHT

           Chris and Elizabeth stare out the windows as their taxi 
           crosses back into Manhattan over the Brooklyn Bridge. 
           Then she places a hand on his leg. Looks at him. After a 
           moment, he takes her hand in his. Grips it tight.

           EXT. BROOKLYN STREET -- NIGHT

           David walks, hands in his pockets. Alone.

           INT. WOLCOTT DUPLEX / CHRIS'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           In the large bed, where Chris and Elizabeth are currently 
           having sex -- but she's distraught --

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (whispers)
                        I'm sorry... I'm sorry... don't worry...

           INT. THE GUTTER BAR -- NIGHT

           Williamsburg, Brooklyn. HIPSTERS and LOCALS in this 
           bowling alley bar. Crowded lanes visible in b.g. -- balls 
           rolling -- CRASH! of pins -- CHEERS of groups -- 

           David, seated on a bar stool, sips a whiskey neat. A CUTE 
           HIPSTER CHICK bellies up to the bar, eyes David, smiles. 
           He smiles back weakly, uninterested. He downs the rest of 
           his stiff drink -- then gets up to leave. Another CRASH!

           INT. WOLCOTT DUPLEX / CHRIS'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Chris and Elizabeth. In bed. Post sex. His back to her; 
           she leans up on an elbow, peers down over his shoulder.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Look at me: Look --
                                  (turns his face to hers)
                        Just this once. I'm sorry -- I am. Then 
                        I'll be out in the world, and -- okay?

           Chris turns away. Elizabeth gets out of bed -- goes off 
           into the ADJACENT BATHROOM.

           INT. LEWIS BROWNSTONE / DAVID'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           David. Sitting on the edge of his bed. Alone. Can't 
           sleep. Holding something -- can't make it out just yet. 
           He looks over at his bedside table, sees --
           ELIZABETH'S WHISKEY GLASS, her lipstick still on the 
           edge, sits parked where she placed it. He stares at it.

           Then David looks down -- he's holding THE .38 from the 
           lock-box. He turns it over in his hands, and turns over 
           something in his mind again and again. 

           INT. WOLCOTT DUPLEX / ADJACENT BATHROOM -- NIGHT

           Elizabeth sits on the closed toilet -- she cries. Faucet 
           RUNNING WATER to mask the sound. Something in her eyes --

           INT. BROOKLYN BAR -- NIGHT -- M.O.S. (FLASHBACK)

           Familiar. The book-release party, from ANOTHER ANGLE. At 
           a two-top in the back -- Elizabeth and Caroline sit. As 
           Caroline berates her kid sister, says how pissed she is --

           UNDER THE TABLE -- CLOSE ON ELIZABETH'S HANDS as she 
           angrily intertwines fingers, WHITE-KNUCKLES STRAINING to 
           keep her lid on. It's all she can do to grip the fucking 
           tablecloth and grip it hard. Frustrated, jealous as ever.

           INT. WOLCOTT DUPLEX / ADJACENT BATHROOM -- NIGHT

           Back again. Elizabeth tears off some toilet paper, wipes 
           her face: "Get your shit together." Shuts off the water. 
           She peers into the bedroom through a crack in the door --

           ELIZABETH'S POV -- CHRIS
           Seated on the edge of the bed, hunched, his back to her.

           PRE-LAP the familiar sound of FOOTSTEPS RUNNING on dirt --

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK RESERVOIR TRACK -- DAWN

           THE FEET OF SOMEONE RUNNING HARD in blue, pre-day light. 
           Sneakers bang the dirt. It's the next morning. Hear heavy 
           breathing, see white breath in the cold -- it's Chris in 
           his winter running gear. Sprinting -- running faster --

           INT. BROOKLYN COFFEE SHOP -- DAWN

           David pays for a cup of coffee. Grabs that day's "New 
           York Times" -- pays for that, too.

           INT. WOLCOTT DUPLEX / CHRIS'S BEDROOM -- DAWN

           Elizabeth wakes up -- gets her bearings. As she turns 
           over, REVEAL -- she's alone. Chris is gone. In his place: 
           A NOTE. She picks it up, reads the words: "GONE RUNNING."
           INT. WOLCOTT DUPLEX / KITCHEN -- DAWN

           Elizabeth FILLS A GLASS OF WATER from a freezer-door 
           fountain. The fridge-door is open -- Elizabeth inspects 
           everything in there. She closes the door, walks into --

           A HALLWAY --

           Decorated with expensive art. Fine tables. Sculpture. 
           Neoclassical touches. Her "tour" is the first glimpse of 
           the scale of the family's wealth: Large. She walks into --

           THE SITTING ROOM --

           Elizabeth pads over to a Biedermeier chair, the BANKS 
           MANUSCRIPT ON THE SEAT where she had been reading. In the 
           corner: A LARGE, EXPENSIVELY DECORATED CHRISTMAS TREE. 
           Elizabeth sits down and continues reading.

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK RESERVOIR TRACK -- DAWN

           Chris runs hard -- fast. Towards something? Away from it?

           INT. LEWIS BROWNSTONE / KITCHEN -- DAWN

           David, cup of coffee in hand, has that day's "New York 
           Times" spread out on the counter. He flips through pages, 
           searches for something. Sips his coffee, scans articles.

           INT. WOLCOTT DUPLEX / SITTING ROOM -- DAWN

           Elizabeth reads the last page, the last sentence of the 
           manuscript -- closes it in her lap. Takes a deep breath.

           INT. "21" CLUB / BAR ROOM -- DAY

           Lunch. Elizabeth sits between David and Chris. They look 
           tense -- guilt and worry. Mr. and Mrs. Wolcott are there 
           with Chris's GRANDMOTHER, 80s, frail, dressed to the 
           nines. The Wolcott party is squeezed at a table -- loaded 
           with food -- by the kitchen amid quite a scene. Place is 
           packed with New York's WEALTHY and eager-rich TOURISTS. 
           Chris and Elizabeth in new outfits; David the same suit.

                                 DAVID
                                  (to Elizabeth; sotto)
                        Have you heard from your agent?

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (sotto; on edge)
                        Not yet -- but she'll call.
                                 DAVID
                                  (reassuring; also on edge)
                        She'll call.

                                 MRS. WOLCOTT
                                  (chipper; buzzed already)
                        Christopher, isn't it nice to have your 
                        best friend -- and your special lady -- 
                        joining us for the first time this year?

                                 CHRIS
                                  ("not so much")
                        Yes. Very.

                                 MRS. WOLCOTT
                        Elizabeth, we're so happy to meet you.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Thank you for having me.

           Mr. Wolcott keeps his head down, ignores his hamburger 
           and his companions -- glued to his PDA, thumb-typing, 
           clearly stressed. Mrs. Wolcott, hating her husband, 
           drinking to drown him, hasn't touched her steak Diane.

                                 MRS. WOLCOTT
                                  (condescending)
                        And David -- I'm just so pleased when we 
                        can bring you to places like this.

                                 DAVID
                                  ("ouch")
                        Me, too. Thanks.

                                 MRS. WOLCOTT
                                  (to Mr. Wolcott)
                        Aren't you pleased? Bill -- Bill?

                                 MR. WOLCOTT
                                  (looks up)
                        What? Yes. Oh, yes.

           Then -- right quick -- he goes back about his business.

                                 MRS. WOLCOTT
                                  (overdoing it)
                        Ooh! Exciting -- both of you are new to 
                        our holiday ritual.
                                  (sips wine; re: Mr. Wolcott)
                        This has been a tradition since Bunny was 
                        a little boy -- 'Hamburgers and Handel' -- 
                        isn't that right, Mother?

           The Grandmother says nothing, cuts away at her hamburger.

                                 MRS. WOLCOTT (CONT'D)
                                  (to Elizabeth)
                        I have a little something for you.
           Elizabeth looks down, sees MRS. WOLCOTT'S HAND SLIDING A 
           SMALL TIFFANY & CO. BOX across the table. Bow tied on it.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Mrs. Wolcott, you didn't have to.

           David and Chris look on. Curious. Elizabeth unties the 
           bow, opens the box to reveal -- a BROOCH OF GOLDEN ROPES 
           INTERTWINED in a round knot.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                                  (holds it up)
                        It's beautiful. Thank you.

                                 MRS. WOLCOTT
                        You are entirely welcome. Maybe you'll 
                        wear it tonight.

           As Elizabeth fastens it to her dress --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I'll wear it now. Oh, I love it.

                                 MRS. WOLCOTT
                                  (with a song-lilt)
                        'Tonight'... The Condé Nast holiday party 
                        is one of the best of the season.

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (re: brooch)
                        There -- perfect.
                                  (dramatic pause)
                        Mr. and Mrs. Wolcott, if you'd allow me 
                        just a moment to say a few words...

           Everyone -- except Mr. Wolcott -- checks in. David 
           listens closely, hangs on every word and it shows --

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                        ... your son -- my Chris -- means the 
                        world to me. I couldn't be happier about 
                        this relationship.

           David sinks a little in his seat. Uncomfortable -- 
           jealous? -- it looks like it's killing him. Chris listens 
           coolly to Elizabeth's speech.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                        We have wonderful things ahead. Living 
                        together here in New York -- that Tribeca 
                        apartment... you're so generous. 

           Mrs. Wolcott gulps her wine, smiles enthusiastically. She 
           eyes her husband as Elizabeth takes Chris's hand -- 
                                 ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                        Now, he's probably too shy to admit it, 
                        but I know how much Chris is looking 
                        forward to finishing the M.B.A. and 
                        coming back to work at the firm.

           Mr. Wolcott doesn't look up as he speaks --

                                 MR. WOLCOTT
                                  (to Chris; cold)
                        Maybe you're more serious about grown-up 
                        work than I thought. It'd be a good thing 
                        to stop harboring childish fantasies.

           Chris reacts as -- CLUNK! Mrs. Wolcott sets down her wine 
           glass. As she signals the SERVER for another large pour --

                                 MRS. WOLCOTT
                        A new job, the company, yes. But if the 
                        Feds keep knocking on the firm's door...

           That gets Mr. Wolcott's attention. He looks up, annoyed, 
           puts down the PDA. During the following, Mrs. Wolcott is 
           drunk, inappropriate. Mr. Wolcott comes to a boil. The 
           kids are uncomfortable. The Grandmother's in space.

                                 MRS. WOLCOTT (CONT'D)
                        Who knows if I even want our son going 
                        through that, day to day for a living.
                                  (then; to Mr. Wolcott)
                        My Matthew couldn't handle it -- couldn't 
                        handle you. What on earth makes you think 
                        his little brother can?

                                 MR. WOLCOTT
                                  (stern; pissed)
                        Enough.

           PRE-LAP the busy SOUNDS OF MIDTOWN MANHATTAN --

           EXT. MANHATTAN STREETS -- DAY

           As Elizabeth, David and Chris walk uptown -- the city 
           seethes with stressful, joyous, seasonal life. A MONTAGE:

           -- FIFTH AVENUE
           where PEDESTRIANS are forced to walk in the bus lanes of 
           the streets because the sidewalk passed capacity --

           -- FIFTY-FIFTH STREET, 5TH AVENUE
           where the Disney Store actually has a line outside and 
           dogs nip at shopping bags dragged wearily by TOURISTS --

           -- FIFTY-SEVENTH STREET, BETWEEN 6TH AND 7TH AVENUES
           where MASSES come from all directions towards the 
           building on the corner -- visible ahead -- old New York -- 
           CARNEGIE HALL -- off the BLEAT of a taxi's LOUD HORN --
           INT. CARNEGIE HALL / STERN AUDITORIUM -- DAY

           THE BRASS SECTION of the Masterwork Orchestra blows out a 
           rousing section of Handel's "Messiah."

           IN A FIRST TIER PRIVATE BOX -- Elizabeth, wearing the 
           gold brooch, sits between David and Chris. Their minds 
           are far from here. Mrs. Wolcott and the Grandmother are 
           lost happily in the Handel. Mr. Wolcott has finally put 
           away his PDA, relaxed a bit.

           INT. CARNEGIE HALL / SHORIN CLUB ROOM -- DAY

           Intermission. Mingling PATRONS at the bar sipping drinks 
           in b.g. Elizabeth is on her cell with her literary agent, 
           ANNA, listening at first --

                                 ANNA (PHONE/OVER)
                        I read the chapters. Love it. I don't 
                        even really think it's young adult --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I was hoping you'd say that.

                                 ANNA (PHONE/OVER)
                        -- anyway, I wanted to get these pages to 
                        Peter Sablone a-sap -- he's been fully up 
                        my rear about you -- but I just found out 
                        he's leaving town at four, so --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Today?

                                 ANNA (PHONE/OVER)
                        -- so, we'll do it after the holidays.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I'll get him the pages today.

                                 ANNA (PHONE/OVER)
                        Nah, no, it's not that bad of a rush.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Are you my agent or my mother? I'll get 
                        him the pages, I said. He in the office?

                                 ANNA (PHONE/OVER)
                                  (pause)
                        I talked to him, he was at home. Packing. 
                        Said he's leaving Grand Central on a four 
                        o'clock train. That's an hour from now.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I'll be there -- I'll get it to him.

           Elizabeth hangs up. Turns -- David stands behind her.
                                 ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                                  (startled)
                        Jesus. Lurk, much?

                                 DAVID
                                  (re: her phone call)
                        All good?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I have to get the pages to my editor. 
                        He's leaving Grand Central in an hour.

                                 DAVID
                        Shit. Chris won't go.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Will you?

                                 DAVID
                                  (pause; wheels spinning)
                        Let me talk to him. Wait here.

           David walks off, joins Chris in b.g. Mrs. Wolcott, big 
           glass of scotch in hand, approaches Elizabeth --

                                 MRS. WOLCOTT
                                  (ugly-drunk by now)
                        You enjoying the classical music?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Oh, yes.

                                 MRS. WOLCOTT
                        I'm relieved... that Chris found such an 
                        attractive girl. You've made his father 
                        and me very happy, young lady.

           Elizabeth forces a smile and nods. Uncomfortable.

           Mrs. Wolcott wobbles away to join A FRIEND, calling out 
           her name too loud as she goes. Chris and David approach -- 

                                 CHRIS
                        I'm not going. My family is here.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I know. I feel bad. But, can I explain?

                                 CHRIS
                        You two want to run around, frolic, fine. 
                        But I don't want to play.

           He walks away, joins his father and grandmother across 
           the room. LIGHTS FLICKER ON and OFF. Intermission's over.
           EXT. MANHATTAN STREET (VANDERBILT AVE.) -- DAY

           David -- so chivalrous -- holds Elizabeth's AGENCY 
           ENVELOPE as she grips her overcoat closed against the 
           winter wind. They walk towards Grand Central Station. As 
           they navigate PEDESTRIANS, PRETZEL VENDORS and traffic --

                                 DAVID
                        I liked your speech at the lunch table.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Thanks.

           David feigns a bowing prayer, imitates her ass-kissing --

                                 DAVID
                        'All hail the mighty Wolcott family...' 
                                  (then)
                        Don't blow this meal-ticket.

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (mock-offended)
                        How shallow do you think I am?

                                 DAVID
                                  (endless possibilities)
                        Kiddie pool... rain puddle... spilled 
                        milk... should I go on?

           Smiles. Through glass-paned swinging doors, they enter --

           INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION -- CONTINUOUS

           A NOISY RUSH of life here. COMMUTERS and TOURISTS swarm. 
           The iconic CLOCK -- cameras FLASH! -- BOARDING NOTICES 
           post and change. Elizabeth and David survey the teeming 
           scene -- DINERS and DRINKERS in the second-level bar. 

                                 DAVID
                        You know how many people showed up to see 
                        Grand Central the day it opened? The 
                        throngs? Hundred and fifty thousand.
                                  (genuine reverence)
                        This is a palace.

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (unimpressed)
                        Yeah? Then who's the king?

                                 DAVID
                        It's not for a king. It's for everyone. 
                        It's for us.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yawn.
                                  (scans the bar)
                        There he is.
           ELIZABETH'S POV -- PETER SABLONE
           Seated at a table. He's Elizabeth's editor. Late 30s, 
           wearing wire-rims. He reads galleys on a hand-held SONY 
           READER; valise at his feet. Glass of water on the table.

                                 DAVID
                        You gonna introduce me?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Next time.

           Elizabeth tries to take the envelope from David. He holds 
           it out, then pulls it back -- away from her, over his 
           head. As she steps close -- too close -- to get it...

           A charged moment between them: This is a transaction, 
           professional and sexual. Finally -- David hands it over.

           TIME CUT --

           AT PETER'S TABLE -- 

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                        Peter.

                                 PETER
                        Elizabeth. Merry Holidays. Have a seat. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (sits)
                        You, too.

           In b.g. David takes a seat at the bar.

                                 PETER
                        Anna gave me the heads-up you were 
                        burning to get something into my hands.

           As Elizabeth hands him the agency envelope --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        First three chapters. My new novel.

                                 PETER
                        What a pleasant surprise.
                                  (re: the bar)
                        Do you want anything?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        No, thanks. Or, water's fine.

                                 PETER
                                  (re: waitress)
                        Let's see if I can get her. Zoo in here.

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (looks around)
                        Yes.
           Peter opens the envelope, slides out the pages.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                        I don't think it's young adult this time.

                                 PETER
                        What's it about?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Male protagonist, mid thirties. Dan Percy 
                        -- his parents are killed in a robbery.

                                 PETER
                        Like Batman.

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (embarrassed)
                        Yeah, but, y'know. This is different.

                                 PETER
                        I'm kidding.
                                  ("go on")
                        'Killed in a robbery'...

                                 ELIZABETH
                        After the two-casket funeral Dan spirals 
                        out, becomes obsessed with tracking down 
                        a girl -- the One Who Got Away. She left 
                        town, moved to Winnipeg in, like, the 
                        ninth grade.

                                 PETER
                        Winnipeg -- Canada.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Canada, yeah. So the book is Dan getting 
                        there, a kind of a... Walkabout. Buses. 
                        And what happens when he finally arrives.

                                 PETER
                        What does happen?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You'll see. I'm cleaning all that up now.

                                 PETER
                                  (flipping pages)
                        'You can't go home again.'

                                 ELIZABETH
                        That sort of thing.

                                 PETER
                        Have a title yet?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        "Grieving City."
                                 PETER
                                  (re: the pages)
                        Are you working on a typewriter?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        It's a font. I'll probably change it.

                                 PETER
                        Huh. Well, okay. Thanks, Elizabeth.

           Peter checks his watch. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Thank you. Hope you like it.

                                 PETER
                        I'll read it on the train, then we'll see 
                        where we are.

           PRE-LAP a thunderous CLACK CLACK CLACK! --

           INT. SUBWAY CAR (TRAVELLING) -- NIGHT

           CLACK CLACK CLACK! The 2/3 express -- COMMUTERS and 
           TOURISTS, shopping bags, luggage -- David and Elizabeth 
           are packed in tight. She looks dazed. He looks at her.

           INT. MICHAEL-TOWNE WINES & SPIRITS -- NIGHT

           Same as before. But now it's David and Elizabeth at the 
           counter. He places two bottles of Famous Grouse up for 
           tally -- then also -- 

           David grabs a BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE from a rack display 
           next to the register -- PLUNKS that down next to the 
           whiskey. The Cashier rings it all up. David pays CASH -- 
           no Platinum AmEx cards for him.

           INT. BOOKSTORE -- NIGHT

           Same as before. POV OUT THROUGH THE WINDOW -- but now 
           it's David and Elizabeth walking by on the sidewalk. She 
           stops, looks into the bookstore. He wants to keep moving. 
           Elizabeth enters the store. David waits outside.

           INT. LEWIS BROWNSTONE / FATHER'S OFFICE -- NIGHT

           David and Elizabeth. He sits at the desk. Full glasses -- 
           an open bottle of whiskey on a table. In David's lap -- 

           A PAPERBACK BOOK surrounded by torn wrapping paper, 
           ripped ribbon: "GOOD FORM, BY ELIZABETH HAWKINS." On the 
           back cover: Elizabeth's AUTHOR PHOTO is a sexy headshot.
                                 DAVID
                                  (staring at the book)
                        So nice of you.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You mentioned you didn't have a copy. 
                        Also I signed it.

                                 DAVID
                        Yes, you did.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I hope you like it.

                                 DAVID
                        Thank you, Elizabeth.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Thank you, David.
                                  (pause)
                        It'll go nicely with the bookends.

                                 DAVID
                        Oh, well, it'll go right in between.

           David sets the book aside. Off his attitude --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You're upset. You miss William?

                                 DAVID
                        It sucks, yeah. I do. It's depressing -- 
                        there was nothing in the papers this 
                        morning. And, come here, look at this...

           Elizabeth crosses to the desk where -- David types on the 
           computer keyboard. He spins the monitor so she can see --

           ON MONITOR SCREEN: A Google News search page. In the 
           search window David types: "WILLIAM ALLEN BANKS" -- then 
           hits the "enter" key -- and nothing comes up. Only the 
           stark words: "YOUR SEARCH DID NOT MATCH ANY DOCUMENTS."

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (re: screen)
                        Nothing new...

                                 DAVID
                        That's the biggest tragedy of all. 
                        Fifteen years ago it would have been 
                        front-page news.

           Elizabeth lets that land. Then --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        How are you... feeling about all this?
                                 DAVID
                                  (studies her; deadpan)
                        My mentor died of a drug overdose and 
                        we're stealing his unpublished 
                        manuscript. So, you know. I feel great.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I'm proud of you.

                                 DAVID
                        You're 'proud of me.'

                                 ELIZABETH
                        This is gonna be good for both of us.
                                  (then)
                        Try Chris again.

                                 DAVID
                        He's not picking up.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I should go to his apartment...

                                 DAVID
                        Let him cool off.

           David stands, paces. Elizabeth circles him like prey. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        It's not just that I'm proud of you. I'm 
                        grateful.

                                 DAVID
                                  (loaded)
                        How grateful?

           She leans in close, kisses him. David doesn't stop her.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        We're a team now. So... a few months 
                        pass, we'll talk again, make a plan.

                                 DAVID
                        That's it for you gracing me with your 
                        presence?
                                  (then)
                        I was actually starting to enjoy having 
                        you around.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Well, then, think of me fondly.

           David gets close to her, his hands on her waist --
                                 DAVID
                        Listen, there's this hotel in New Haven I 
                        heard about, very anonymous kind of a 
                        thing, name is something with a 'D.' They 
                        make you pay by the person in the rooms, 
                        even if it's only for a couple of 
                        minutes, but I could come up there.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Sounds nice, but we should maybe not have 
                        any contact at all. That way, even my 
                        agent can't suspect anything -- I want 
                        her to sign you when this is over.

                                 DAVID
                        Okay, but what if we just --

           Then quickly -- she reaches down for his belt buckle. 
           That shuts him right up. Elizabeth starts to work the 
           belt open -- she pull-presses her body tight to his --

           CLOSE ON THEIR FACES, just inches apart. Breathing 
           together. As Elizabeth slowly unbuckles David, her 
           version of "dirty talk" sounds like career counseling --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        David, we both want careers, we're trying 
                        to have long ones. Before, and even 
                        though you were older, we weren't at the 
                        same place. So all of that ugliness with 
                        the article -- but I completely feel 
                        you've caught up to me now. And now we 
                        understand each other. This thing -- 
                        it'll be our lie. We're not like everyone 
                        else. We're advanced. We're old inside.

           Then -- see DAVID'S PANTS HIT THE FLOOR. Elizabeth KICKS 
           OFF HER SHOES -- steps out of them, even closer to him --

           Elizabeth pushes David down on the couch -- pants around 
           his ankles, waiting, watching. He looks up at her, 
           expectant as... using only one hand, Elizabeth UNDOES THE 
           DRESS -- it flutters to the floor behind her as she 
           straddle-steps over him, settles her body onto his. She 
           kisses David back into the cushions. All wrapped up now.

           EXT. LEWIS BROWNSTONE / STEPS -- NIGHT / SAME

           Meanwhile, down on the street outside: Chris is back. He 
           ascends the front steps quickly, enters --

           INT. LEWIS BROWNSTONE / ENTRYWAY -- CONTINUOUS

           Chris enters, shuts the door behind him and calls out --
                                 CHRIS
                        Hello?

           Chris walks to THE STAIRCASE, climbs. STAY WITH HIM as he 
           arrives at --

           THE SECOND-FLOOR LANDING --

           Where just then -- Chris hears O.S. NOISES from the 
           Father's Office -- approaches the door, pushes it open --

           INT. FATHER'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

           David and Elizabeth are standing too close -- by a few 
           inches. Her dress is a little off -- a few stray strands 
           of her hair... Chris is in the open doorway wondering --

                                 CHRIS
                        The hell is going on here?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        We were just figuring out who should call 
                        you, baby...

                                 DAVID
                        To see if you still wanted to go to that 
                        party...
                                  (then; concerned)
                        How are you, man?

           INT. LEWIS BROWNSTONE / KITCHEN -- NIGHT

           Moments later. David hands Chris a full whiskey.

                                 CHRIS
                        I don't feel much like partaking tonight.

           Elizabeth moves to his side -- she really wants to go --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Oh, but the Condé Nast thing? Your 
                        parents are expecting us.

                                 CHRIS
                                  (to David)
                        Are you gonna come?

                                 DAVID
                        You want me to come?

                                 CHRIS
                                  (pause)
                        I'll go but I want to get high first.
                                 DAVID
                        Before lunch I went to that dealer chick 
                        in Fort Greene -- got some good stuff.
                                  (then)
                        It's okay. This is gonna be okay.

           Silence. Doesn't feel okay. Just then --

           RING. Elizabeth's cell. They all trade looks. RING.

           INT. LEWIS BROWNSTONE / STAIRCASE -- NIGHT

           Later. Elizabeth and Chris, who holds the bottle of 
           Champagne and three glasses, ascend behind David.

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (elated)
                        He said it needs some cleaning up --

                                 DAVID
                        What does he mean, 'cleaning up'?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        He means it's a first draft. Like that.

           THE THIRD-FLOOR LANDING --

           They walk towards David's bedroom.

                                 DAVID
                        Oh. But he liked it.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yeah. That's what he said. 'You've got 
                        your second book' -- that's what he said.

                                 CHRIS
                        Congratulations.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Thank you. We did it. I feel like I'm 
                        exhaling for the first time all day!

                                 DAVID
                        Speaking of exhaling...

           INT. DAVID'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           David crosses the room, opens a floor-level cabinet.

                                 DAVID
                        ... I'll set up the lab.

           From the cabinet, David removes an impressive-looking 
           display of drug paraphernalia.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        One cabinet door opens, this guy turns 
                        into an apothecary.

                                 DAVID
                        I believe in having the right tools for 
                        the job.

           From his pocket, David produces a plastic bag -- TWIST-
           TIE at the neck. The bag contains a SMALL, BROWNISH CUBE.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        Tell us some of the details, what your 
                        editor said.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You heard. It worked.

                                 DAVID
                        Come on.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Look, I told you: It's in. We did it. End 
                        of story.

                                 DAVID
                        Indeed.
                                  (then; smiling)
                        Can't believe we made it happen.

                                 CHRIS
                                  (to Elizabeth)
                        You're really gonna pull this off.

           Elizabeth sits on the bed, holds court from there --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        And I'm telling you: Sometimes you have 
                        to have the guts to make the bold move. 
                        It may seem like the scary one, but you 
                        just have to do it. The rewards can be 
                        ridiculous.

           As David tosses the plastic bag onto his desk --

                                 DAVID
                        One thing about last night is bugging me, 
                        though -- now that I think about it...
                                  (re: Elizabeth)
                        ... she and I never went inside, into the 
                        brownstone. We stayed on the steps.

                                 CHRIS
                        So?

           David takes a beat here, lets the tension build before --
                                 DAVID
                        We didn't see the body. 

                                 CHRIS
                                  (faux-oblivious)
                        What are you driving at, pal?

           Elizabeth has a bad feeling -- something's wrong here --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You guys...?

                                 DAVID
                                  (ignoring her; to Chris)
                        I mean -- you were inside the house. You 
                        saw William's body, saw him dead, right?

                                 CHRIS
                        Of course I did.
                                  (pause)
                        At least, I think I did...

           Elizabeth stands, speaks up louder this time --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Hey -- what's going on?

           David and Chris, both intense, focused, turn to face her.

                                 DAVID
                        The chapters: Which part did your editor 
                        like best?

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (pause)
                        I don't know.

                                 DAVID
                        Because I like the middle of chapter 
                        three.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Good for you.

                                 CHRIS
                        How did it go again? 

           As David paces, remembering --

                                 DAVID
                        Let me see... 'Gazing down at the cracked 
                        prairie highway that tongued out of the 
                        grieving city was sickening because of 
                        the movement there.'

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yeah, I think that's the part.
                                 DAVID
                        'Dan Percy made a complete and total 
                        about-face.'

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Someone takes their gingko-biloba.

           David picks up the Champagne bottle, unwires the cage --

                                 DAVID
                        'Of course the view was different from 
                        where he now stood, above Winnipeg more 
                        so than in it.'

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (with a nervous laugh)
                        Did you make a copy of the manuscript and 
                        fucking memorize it?

                                 DAVID
                        Not exactly.

           As Elizabeth -- slowly -- starts to back away from them -- 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Wait -- hang on...

                                 CHRIS
                        Is it all starting to come together?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I don't understand...

                                 DAVID
                        Elizabeth, honey, we've been planning 
                        this for longer than you think.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What do you mean, 'we'?

           POP! of David opening the Champagne. An eye-opening beat.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                        No.

                                 DAVID
                        Yes.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        No way.

                                 DAVID
                                  (quoting her)
                        'I have no choice but to utter a 
                        resounding Yes.'

                                 ELIZABETH
                        No, no, no...
                                 DAVID
                                  (to Chris)
                        See, I told you the Champagne would be a 
                        nice touch.

                                 CHRIS
                        I think it's a little stagey.

                                 DAVID
                        We'll agree to disagree.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        It's your manuscript?

                                 DAVID
                        It's mine, yes.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You wrote it?

                                 DAVID
                        I did write it.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Whatever. No one's gonna believe you.

                                 DAVID
                        I can't imagine why they wouldn't. Want 
                        to see the typewriter?

           David goes to his closet -- rummages -- emerges with a 
           late-model Underwood. Parks it on the table.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        The letter 'K'? It sticks.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You don't even know William Allen Banks.

                                 DAVID
                        No, but I sure would like to.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        He's not dead...

                                 DAVID
                        God, I hope not. Guy's one of my heroes.
                                  (then)
                        It really was the perfect set-up -- a 
                        temperament like yours -- you find out 
                        we're pals with Banks -- there's no way 
                        you can resist the pull to come here and 
                        rub shoulders with a legend.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        No...
                                 DAVID
                        People will believe whatever they want to 
                        believe.

                                 CHRIS
                        It's like pro wrestling.

           Elizabeth drifts across the room away from them --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        This is not happening...

                                 DAVID
                        It has been a weird twenty-four hours, 
                        hasn't it? Starting with the road trip to 
                        pick up the drugs...

           EXT. TEDDY'S BROWNSTONE -- NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           CHRIS'S LAND ROVER pulls up outside -- been here before. 
           But this time, in a first-floor window is a YOUNG MAN --

                                 DAVID (V.O.)
                        Off we go. To the house where our friend 
                        Teddy grew up...

           INT. TEDDY'S BROWNSTONE -- NIGHT / SAME (FLASHBACK)

           The Young Man (Teddy) watches the Rover pull up -- types 
           an outgoing text message on his cell. The words on the 
           screen read: "SEND CHRIS INSIDE" --

                                 DAVID (V.O.)
                        He sends word that William isn't feeling 
                        well... at least that's what we tell you.

           Teddy hits "send" on his cell --

           TIME CUT --

           The FRONT DOOR OPENS -- Teddy admits Chris, who enters -- 
           the Rover visible in b.g., Elizabeth and David inside -- 

           Chris spots -- THE BANKS MANUSCRIPT sitting ready on a 
           table by the front door.

           IN THE LIVING ROOM -- Chris sees THE SAME PEOPLE who ran 
           out of the brownstone -- they drink drinks, play Wii on a 
           flat-screen TV, or maybe "Guitar Hero III" on Xbox 360.

                                 DAVID (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        You'd come to know Teddy's house as the 
                        home of William Allen Banks -- site of 
                        Brooklyn's finest opium den...

           But there's no opium anywhere in sight. Not a puff. 
           TIME CUT --

           THROUGH A FRONT WINDOW -- see David and Elizabeth ascend 
           the front steps. Chris turns from the window --

                                 CHRIS
                                  (sotto; to the group)
                        Go.

           Chris opens the front door -- Teddy and the three others 
           flee the brownstone -- muffled voices O.S., the FAMILIAR, 
           OVERLAPPING, PANICKED DIALOGUE -- been here before -- 

           Under this, Chris calmly picks up the manuscript -- tucks 
           it into his coat -- takes a breath -- then darts out into 
           the night, towards David and Elizabeth on the steps --

           INT. LEWIS BROWNSTONE / DAVID'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           David wheels on Elizabeth --

                                 DAVID
                        And we were off to the races. So we come 
                        back here and do the thing, read the 
                        thing, you have your idea --

                                 CHRIS
                        I storm out.

                                 DAVID
                        He's the noble one. The true-heart.
                                  (then)
                        So we gotta follow him. Right? If we're 
                        gonna pull this off?

           David leans in close to her -- 

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        Because you and I got together on this -- 
                        'teammates.' That was my favorite part.

           She shrinks from him, squirms away, crosses the room.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        To the gala!

                                 CHRIS
                        Our buddy Taro is a great photographer, 
                        by the way, went to RISD...

           EXT. PALM HOUSE / ENTRY -- NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           THE PHOTOGRAPHER (Taro) takes note as David and Elizabeth 
           approach from the taxi -- been here before --
                                 PHOTOGRAPHER/TARO
                        Who are you? Should I know you?

           INT. LEWIS BROWNSTONE / DAVID'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           David tosses her THREE PHOTOGRAPHS, snapped last night --

                                 DAVID
                        You photograph well. I'll give you that.

           Elizabeth stares at the photographs in disbelief.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        I wanted to make sure you had a record of 
                        your last red carpet moment ever.
                                  (re: the photos)
                        They will be published. We can no longer 
                        say that of you.

                                 CHRIS
                        So, we go into the gala -- then there was 
                        the tussle outside. A distracting fight.

                                 DAVID
                        For the record, I made him say that stuff 
                        about the 'old Jewish ladies.' He's no 
                        anti-Semite -- I just needed to spark 
                        some conflict.

                                 CHRIS
                        Two old pals divided!

           David throws his arm around Chris's shoulders, smiles --

                                 DAVID
                        What would this world be without good 
                        friends? A world of pain and shit.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Please...

                                 DAVID
                                  (loving this)
                        Your head's gotta be all twisted up. 
                        Seeing everything in a new light -- from 
                        a new angle. Well -- allow me to keep 
                        untangling things. After the Xerox place, 
                        we said our goodbyes...

                                 CHRIS
                        'G'night, asshole.'

                                 DAVID
                        'Fuck you, buddy.' All the tension!

                                 CHRIS
                        Can these guys ever bounce back?
                                 DAVID
                        Their friendship? And, plus, there's a 
                        girl in the middle. It's so much worse 
                        when there's a girl in the middle.

                                 CHRIS
                        So we're at lunch... barely speaking...

                                 DAVID
                        Then the concert -- and something came 
                        up. Because you can't plan for 
                        everything. I didn't know we'd have to 
                        make that run to Grand Central --

           INT. CARNEGIE HALL / SHORIN CLUB ROOM -- DAY (FLASHBACK)

           David and Chris in tense conversation. Elizabeth and Mrs. 
           Wolcott have their exchange in b.g. -- been here before.

                                 CHRIS
                        ... you go with her.

                                 DAVID
                        And you stay here -- so come over now, 
                        tell us to screw off, go frolic. Then 
                        kill some time after, make her sweat 
                        before you show up at my place again --

                                 CHRIS
                        How long?

                                 DAVID
                        I don't know -- a couple hours...

           INT. LEWIS BROWNSTONE / DAVID'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Elizabeth looks at Chris --

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (small)
                        Where did you go?

                                 CHRIS
                                  (matter-of-fact)
                        The movies.

           She deflates, reeling -- settles into a chair.

                                 DAVID
                        And we went to Grand Central. For the 
                        handoff. It became official. It was in. 
                        And just now... your editor called -- 

                                 CHRIS
                        He liked it -- 'You've got your second 
                        book.'
                                 DAVID
                        But you've also got a problem.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        David, please...

                                 DAVID
                        You're finished. You submitted this to a 
                        publishing house -- as your work -- when 
                        it is not your work -- it is my work. 
                        I've got the early drafts, notes and 
                        Writers Guild registration numbers to 
                        prove it. And now there's the story of 
                        how we bamboozled you -- plus I have a 
                        three-year-old motive for why we did it. 
                        I'm gonna write an article about you.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Please. I didn't know it was yours. I 
                        thought it was Banks, and he was dead.

                                 DAVID
                        You can't go back now. You can't un-ring 
                        this bell.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Please call it off. Please...

                                 DAVID
                        All the stuff you had -- industry in-
                        roads -- your sister's reputation, that 
                        connection -- I had none of that. But I 
                        wrote something pretty good, something 
                        coulda gotten me noticed. And you took 
                        it. You fucked me. But in the last twenty-
                        four hours I fucked you back. Hard.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I'm sorry. Okay? Time out for a second --

                                 DAVID
                                  (stern; adamant)
                        I was in love with you. Remember that.
                                  (then)
                        How fuckin' stupid I was... shit, I 
                        remember that every day.

           Elizabeth can see the personal and professional betrayals 
           woven together in David's rage. Then Chris jumps in --

                                 CHRIS
                                  (genuinely asking)
                        What made you think you could do 
                        something like this twice -- twice -- and 
                        get away with it?

           Elizabeth hunts for the response she doesn't have.
                                 DAVID
                        Oh! And she wants to, holy shit, man I 
                        haven't told you -- she wants to stop in 
                        the same bookstore --

                                 CHRIS
                        Out here? From the bookends?

                                 DAVID
                        Yes! So she could -- she gave me this. 
                        Look at this --

           David tosses Chris the PAPERBACK COPY OF "GOOD FORM" --

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        Look at the inscription.

                                 CHRIS
                                  (flips a page; reads)
                        Huh. Little did she know.

           David lifts up his mattress -- from underneath he pulls 
           out a HARDCOVER COPY OF ELIZABETH'S BOOK. Been there all 
           along. Elizabeth sees this, sinks. Right under her nose.

           Then -- she moves quick, goes to Chris, touches his arm --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Chris, please --

                                 CHRIS
                                  (shakes her off)
                        Get away from me. Jesus, the last month -- 
                        I could barely stand to be around you.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Running every day, twice a day.

                                 CHRIS
                        I was tense. I found it helpful.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        We were together -- four months -- 
                        nothing? You felt nothing?

                                 CHRIS
                                  (re: David)
                        He may still be in love with you --

                                 DAVID
                        Ha! Fatty fuckin' Arbuckle chance.

                                 CHRIS
                        -- but I assure you, I am not. Never was.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        No. When I was starting to really care --
                                 CHRIS
                        That was a mistake.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You kissed me.

                                 CHRIS
                        I had to.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        We made love.

                                 CHRIS
                        Ooh. I wouldn't call it that.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        But you did. During it. Sometimes.

                                 CHRIS
                        Therein lies the Oscar-worthiness.

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (in disbelief)
                        Wait, did you come to Yale, go to grad 
                        school just for this?

           Chris nods Yes.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                                  (coming undone)
                        So -- what? -- so -- no -- your tight-ass 
                        parents? They're gonna kill you.

                                 CHRIS
                        Kill me? They don't even know me.
                                  (then)
                        Besides, my getting an M.B.A. is, like, 
                        Daddy Wolcott's wet dream -- fuck him.
                                  (getting worked up)
                        My brother jumped --
                                  (kicks over a chair)
                        ... because that fuckin' prick is un-
                        pleasable. That ain't gonna happen to me.

           David crosses, puts his hand on Chris's shoulder --

                                 DAVID
                        Amen to that.

           Elizabeth takes a step back.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Oh, my God --

                                 DAVID
                        We should maybe stop here.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        Sure. Sure...

                                 CHRIS
                        I don't think you should say any more --

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (to Chris)
                        You fucking queer. You faggot.

           A head-shaking beat.

                                 DAVID
                        It would have to be about that, wouldn't 
                        it? For you? Not about actual friends...

                                 CHRIS
                        Not about friendship -- that we'd do 
                        anything for each other -- of course not.

                                 DAVID
                        You couldn't wrap your mind around 
                        something like that. Because you're 
                        friendless -- and selfish -- and done.

                                 CHRIS
                        You poor, sad thing.

           Elizabeth rushes to Chris -- kneels -- begs --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I didn't mean that. I'm sorry. I love 
                        you. I do.

                                 CHRIS
                        Jesus Christ...

                                 DAVID
                        Pathetic.

           Elizabeth tries to tune out David. She corners Chris --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Listen to me: I think -- together, we 
                        were starting to have something special. 
                        You can be more than his accomplice, in 
                        your life, you can be more than that.

                                 CHRIS
                                  (calm)
                        Stop begging. It's ugly.

           Ouch. Elizabeth freezes. 

                                 CHRIS (CONT'D)
                        You did this. I wish you hadn't -- but 
                        you did. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHRIS (CONT'D)
                        All we brought to the table was a stack 
                        of white pages, a bunch of black words. 
                        You brought everything else. 

           But David's way past calm -- he gets worked up on her --

                                 DAVID
                        It was your choice to believe the 
                        charade. You were a part of the action. 
                        You were the action. You were the act.

           Elizabeth takes a deep breath, composes. Then --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Wait. I have an idea. Wait. I can 
                        straighten everything out with one phone 
                        call.

                                 DAVID
                        That so?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yeah. This is easy -- yes. Listen. One 
                        phone call -- I go to my agent, my 
                        editor, I say: 'Guys, I pulled one over 
                        on you. I knew you wouldn't read 
                        something unsolicited. So I slipped you 
                        my friend's work and said it was mine. 
                        You loved it. So sign him. Publish him.' 

                                 DAVID
                        Then what?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Then you're in. Easy. It'll work...

           David and Chris take a beat, check in with each other. 
           David turns back to Elizabeth --

                                 DAVID
                        You'd do that? You'd do that for me?

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (desperate)
                        Yes. David. Yes -- of course. Please...

                                 DAVID
                        Well... maybe we can work something out.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        We can.

                                 CHRIS
                        What? You're gonna trust her now?

                                 DAVID
                        Shut up, let me think for a second. It's 
                        a big offer -- it could be huge for me...
           As David crosses the room to his desk -- opens a drawer -- 
           Elizabeth watches -- eyes full of hope, seeing a way out.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Spare me, David. You can, you can choose 
                        to be merciful. Spare me and I'll make it 
                        worth your while. You have a choice.

                                 DAVID
                        No -- but you do.

           From the desk drawer, David produces -- THE CHROME .38.

           He carefully places the gun on the desk in front of her.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What the hell are you doing?

                                 DAVID
                        Presenting your options.
                                  (calm; collected)
                        One: You walk out of here and we tell the 
                        world about your perfidious, conniving 
                        bullshit. You'll be shamed into oblivion.
                                  (pause for effect)
                        Or... option number two: Kill yourself 
                        and we say the book is yours. All yours.

           A heavy beat.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What?

                                 DAVID
                                  (how it could be spun)
                        "A tortured young artist produces her 
                        best work to date, only to become 
                        depressed and suicidal at the 
                        achievement." Or something like that...

           Elizabeth backs away from the desk, the gun, the idea --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You can't be serious.

                                 CHRIS
                                  (as a heart-attack)
                        Two options. Walk out and be exposed, or 
                        leave a beautiful corpse. Just like Kurt 
                        Cobain... only not talented.

                                 DAVID
                        Take your own life and we'll lie for you. 
                        You'll be dead, but famous and acclaimed.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You actually expect me to commit suicide?
                                 DAVID
                        I don't know what I expect you to do. All 
                        I know is -- these are your two options.
                                  (then)
                        You're more than welcome to leave. You'll 
                        just have to face the consequences of 
                        what you've done here.

                                 CHRIS
                                  (faux-supportive)
                        Don't rush a decision. This is important.

           Elizabeth eyes the boys -- eyes the gun -- considers --

           David and Chris focus on her -- watch intently as --

           ELIZABETH PICKS UP THE GUN. Holds it all wrong in her 
           nervous hand -- stares at the violent, alien object --

                                 DAVID
                        I think you're making the right choice.

           Elizabeth is losing control of her breathing -- the 
           shaking of her arm -- the gun weighs a thousand pounds -- 

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                                  (the final push)
                        And just imagine... what a breathtaking 
                        eulogy your sister will write.

           At that -- Elizabeth looks up, dead into David's eyes. 
           She raises the gun to David's chest -- 

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                                  (nervous)
                        Put it down -- hey. That's not the idea.

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (raising her voice)
                        No? What is the idea, David? What's the 
                        Big Idea?

                                 DAVID
                        You are -- the choice you have to make...

                                 ELIZABETH
                        And you think I haven't already made it?

           Elizabeth aims -- levels the gun more squarely at him --

                                 DAVID
                        Hang on, no, wait a second, wait --

           RIP! of a gunshot EXPLODING in the room. Smoke -- BLOOD 
           SPREADS AT DAVID'S CHEST -- frightened disbelief in his 
           eyes. Elizabeth watches as if from twenty miles away as --

           David THUDS hard to the ground. Chris crawls to his side.
                                 CHRIS
                        No, no... David... fuck... fuck!
                                  (to Elizabeth; worked up)
                        How could... are you fuckin' psychotic?

           Elizabeth has to think fast -- scrambling for an "out" --

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (with purpose)
                        We can still do this together. Together. 
                        Make it like it was a robbery. Like it 
                        was about the drugs -- that someone came 
                        here, and... Will you? Chris? 

           David lies in POOLING BLOOD on the floor.

                                 CHRIS
                        David... oh, fuck... no...

           As Chris stands, races across the room to his coat --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What are you doing?

                                 CHRIS
                        Calling the fuckin' cops...

           Chris rifles through his coat pocket -- pulls out cell --

           Elizabeth runs hard to Chris -- KNOCKS THE PHONE FROM HIS 
           HAND. As she lunge-reaches down to pick it up --

           Chris grabs her, they tangle -- it's CLOSE, PHYSICAL, 
           FRENETIC. Then, to break free, needing to get the cell --

           CHRIS PUSHES HER AWAY -- she reels, trips back over the 
           chair, but she holds on to the gun as she hits the deck.

           Chris picks up the cell -- determined. Elizabeth, ground-
           level, her back against the wall, utters one final plea --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Chris, please! Don't... no, don't...

           Screw that: Chris dials 9-1-1 into his cell. Before he 
           hits "call" -- RIP! of a second shot RINGS OUT from the 
           gun -- the cell drops -- CHRIS CLUTCHES HIS BLOODY CHEST.

           Chris hits the floor. More blood. The gun's in her hand. 
           Elizabeth stands up from the floor slowly...

           CLOSE ON ELIZABETH as her breath quickens, then slows as 
           she surveys -- Chris and David on the floor -- blood -- 
           the manuscript pages -- the typewriter -- the whiskey 
           bottle and tumblers -- the bottle of Champagne and 
           glasses -- her books, the bookends -- wrapping paper -- 
           ribbon -- all the detritus of the con, the past day...
           Beat. Then -- Elizabeth throws on her coat, STUFFS THE 
           GUN IN HER COAT POCKET, leaves the room lightening-quick.

           INT. LEWIS BROWNSTONE / ENTRYWAY -- NIGHT

           Moments later. Elizabeth composes herself by the door. 
           All set. She opens it and exits out to the steps, the 
           street. She leaves the door open behind her as she goes.

           INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT -- NIGHT

           Been here before. Far less busy than last night. A few 
           PATRONS scattered at tables. Quieter, more subdued vibe.

           Elizabeth is seated in the same red-pleather booth from 
           the night before. She takes out her cell -- nervously 
           calls someone. Hear FILTERED RINGING. Then --

                                 CAROLINE (PHONE/OVER)
                        Hello -- Lizzie?

           Insisting on a happy, casual tone --

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (into phone)
                        Caroline. Hi! How was your flight?

                                 CAROLINE (PHONE/OVER)
                        Don't get me started. Hellacious delay at 
                        L.A.X. We just got to Joel's family's 
                        place. I was gonna call you after lunch.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You were?

                                 CAROLINE (PHONE/OVER)
                        Listen: I was thinking about you a lot on 
                        the plane. I want to help.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        'Help.'

                                 CAROLINE (PHONE/OVER)
                        I called my editor. She's gonna read you.

           CLOSE ON ELIZABETH as sadness wells up fast, mixes poorly 
           with the anxiety she carried here from the brownstone.

                                 CAROLINE (PHONE/OVER) 
                                 (CONT'D)
                        And I set up a lunch. For after I get 
                        back, after New Year's. The three of us.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Caroline...
                                 CAROLINE (PHONE/OVER)
                        I was a bitch to you in the bar.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        No...

                                 CAROLINE (PHONE/OVER)
                        I was. But there, I called her, and let's 
                        see if we can make this happen for you.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Thanks. Hey, listen -- things are a 
                        little weird here. Do you have a sec?

                                 CAROLINE (PHONE/OVER)
                        What do you mean, 'weird'?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        This friend of my boyfriend's, he's 
                        making me kind of nervous: David. I think 
                        he's a bad influence on Chris -- drugs, 
                        all these different dealers. And then...
                                  (sotto)
                        ... yesterday he was waving a gun around.

                                 CAROLINE (PHONE/OVER)
                        Jesus -- really?

           Elizabeth sets up an alibi here, a story, more lies --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yeah. They asked me to go get some take-
                        out while one of their dealers came by. 
                        Frankly, the whole thing freaks me out. I 
                        kinda want to get home to Mom and Dad...

                                 CAROLINE (PHONE/OVER)
                        Go home, then. What's keeping you there?

           THUNK! -- A BOTTLE OF BEER is placed down on the table. 
           Elizabeth, surprised, looks to see who dropped it off --

           WIDEN TO REVEAL DAVID -- he stands table-side with fake 
           blood on his shirt and a real smile on his face.

                                 DAVID
                                  (re: the beer)
                        Refreshment?

           Elizabeth stares at David, then monotones into her cell -- 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Hang on, Caroline --

                                 CHRIS (O.S.)
                        Oh, is that your sister...?
           Elizabeth turns, sees -- CHRIS behind her. Same fake-
           blood caked on his shirt, same grin on his face. As he 
           reaches out for the cell --

                                 CHRIS (CONT'D)
                        ... I want to say Hi.

           Elizabeth lets the phone slip from her fingers. As Chris 
           steps away from the table, cell in hand, out of earshot --

                                 CHRIS (CONT'D)
                                  (into phone)
                        Hi, Caroline? It's Chris Wolcott here...

           David, gripping TWO MORE BOTTLES OF BEER, slides into the 
           booth opposite Elizabeth. A nice, satisfying beat.

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (struggling for words)
                        What... what did --

                                 DAVID
                        Because we wanted to see how far you'd 
                        go. I gotta admit, there was a part of me 
                        that doubted you could be this soulless.
                                  (then)
                        But you've always been full of surprises.

           Chris approaches the table, tosses down the cell --

                                 CHRIS
                                  (to Elizabeth; re: Caroline)
                        She had to hop off -- lunch was served.

           Chris slides into the booth next to David, sips a beer.

                                 CHRIS (CONT'D)
                        Is she surprised? 

           David leans across the table towards Elizabeth --

                                 DAVID
                        Remember the wrestling? The ladders, 
                        splintering chairs... the blood. People 
                        believe because they want to believe.

                                 CHRIS
                                  (very pleased)
                        She looks really surprised.

                                 DAVID
                                  (to Elizabeth)
                        I have something for you.

           David reaches into his coat pocket and produces --

           The knock-out: David takes out a GALLEY -- tosses it to 
           Elizabeth. She fumble-catches it and reads the words -- 
           ON THE COVER: "GRIEVING CITY, BY DAVID LEWIS -- ADVANCE 
           UNCORRECTED PROOF -- NOT FOR SALE." The COVER IMAGE is 
           CRACKED HIGHWAY BLACKTOP. Elizabeth tries to keep it 
           together. The galley slips from her fingers to the table.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        Book comes out in the fall.
                                  (pause)
                        Guess I left that part out before. Sorry.

                                 CHRIS
                        He's excited.

                                 DAVID
                        What can I say? I'm excited.
                                  (to Elizabeth)
                        But I'm not sure about the cover art. 
                        What do you think -- too "Easy Rider"?

           Elizabeth, broken, leans on the table. To maintain.

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (to herself)
                        Okay... I see... I see...

                                 DAVID
                        You can keep the gun. Only fires blanks.
                                  (off her look)
                        Cost me two hundred bucks online.

                                 CHRIS
                        Worth every penny.
                                  (then)
                        You were an awesome die-er.

                                 DAVID
                        Are you kidding? You died so much better 
                        than I did.

           They're having a genuine blast with it.

                                 CHRIS
                        I deem your thud-landing superior.

           Elizabeth is speechless.

                                 DAVID
                                  (turns sharp)
                        You see, Elizabeth -- there's a price on 
                        things. There's a price for everything.

                                 CHRIS
                        And you're about to pay a big one.
                                 DAVID
                                  (full-on ranting now)
                        I'm going wide with this -- publish an 
                        article, go on the news -- America eats 
                        this stuff up -- someone like you, 
                        stealing -- willing to pull the trigger --

                                 CHRIS
                                  (re: David)
                        He was a victim, now he's a hero.

           David changes gears, lightens the tone, turns to Chris --

                                 DAVID
                        Can I just say something? You're a 
                        soldier.

                                 CHRIS
                        Yeah?

                                 DAVID
                        Can't believe you spent four months in 
                        New Haven for me.

                                 CHRIS
                                  (smiles)
                        I like having a sense of purpose, as it 
                        turns out.

                                 DAVID
                                  (smiles)
                        Thank you.
                                  (remembers something)
                        Oh -- check it --

           From his coat, he pulls out the plastic bag -- TWIST-TIE 
           at the neck. The bag contains the SMALL, BROWNISH CUBE.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                                  (to Elizabeth)
                        The 'opium.' If you feel like a hit...

                                 CHRIS
                        What did you put in there?

                                 DAVID
                        I wasn't gonna light it.

                                 CHRIS
                        No, I know, what did you put in the bag?

                                 DAVID
                        A cube of beef bouillon.

           Chris laughs. Elizabeth shakes her head, rueful, pissed.

           Then -- the Waiter arrives with A LARGE, RED PLASTIC BAG 
           OF TAKE-OUT.
                                 WAITER
                                  (to Elizabeth)
                        Cold noodles, two orders of black-bean 
                        shrimp, three rice, and three egg rolls.

           The Waiter leaves the bag, walks off.

                                 CHRIS
                                  (to Elizabeth)
                        Ordered for all three of us -- and left 
                        the door open when you bailed. Not bad.

                                 DAVID
                        No one said she was stupid -- just greedy 
                        and morally bankrupt.

           On that note, David and Chris -- lifelong friends -- 
           exchange a look. Both smiling. A sense of accomplishment.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                                  (to Elizabeth; faux-sweet)
                        Enjoy your dinner.

           Chris and David stand, get out of the booth. ON THEIR 
           BACKS as they walk out of the place.

           CLOSE ON ELIZABETH in shock, the "I'm-fucked" kind.

           PRE-LAP the SOUND OF HIGH-SPEED CARS in city traffic --

           EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE -- NIGHT

           Later. Elizabeth stands by the railing. Over the water. 
           Alone. The Brooklyn Heights Promenade visible in b.g. -- 
           where she talked with Chris yesterday. Bright city lights 
           on all sides. CARS AND TAXIS WHIP BY noisily behind her.

           She looks down at the cold water of the East River. She 
           looks end-of-the-line despondent. She shivers. Thinking.

           CLOSE ON HER FOOT -- down low by the ground. Just 
           slightly -- her foot begins to slip out of her shoe -- 
           slowly, just inches -- then a voice from behind her --

                                 TOURIST WOMAN (O.S.)
                                  (Midwestern accent)
                        Excuse me?

           ON ELIZABETH as she turns, sees -- a TOURIST WOMAN, 50s, 
           dressed up. Out on the town; dinner and a Broadway show.

                                 TOURIST WOMAN (CONT'D)
                        Are you -- oh, jeez, I hate to be a 
                        bother -- my daughter recognized you.

           The Tourist Woman indicates -- her daughter BRENDA, circa 
           12, standing back, shy, a few paces off.
                                 TOURIST WOMAN (CONT'D)
                                  (to her daughter)
                        Brenda?

                                 BRENDA
                        You wrote the book "Good Form"?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yeah, I did.

                                 TOURIST WOMAN
                        She loves that book.

                                 BRENDA
                        I read it three times.
                                  (hesitates)
                        Will you sign me an autograph?

           Elizabeth nods Yes. The Tourist Woman digs in her purse 
           for a pen. Finds one. Shoves it to Elizabeth as Brenda 
           hands over a "Playbill" from some Broadway spectacle.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What's your name?

                                 BRENDA
                        Brenda.

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (her mom just said that)
                        Right. Sorry.

           Elizabeth scribbles a note, signs it. Hands it back.

                                 TOURIST WOMAN
                                  (a parental nudge)
                        Whaddaya say, Bren?

                                 BRENDA
                        Thank you.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You're welcome.

                                 BRENDA
                                  (musters all her courage)
                        When I grow up, I want to be just like 
                        you.

           Elizabeth attempts a smile. She could break under the 
           weight -- she's drowning in something. The Tourist Woman 
           and her daughter Brenda walk away. Then, ON ELIZABETH --

                                 ELIZABETH
                                  (sotto)
                        No, you don't.

           Elizabeth watches them go, then looks down at the water.
           BLACK SCREEN.

           Beat. SUPERTITLE "THE NEXT FALL" over SOUNDS OF THE CITY.

           EXT. THE STRAND BOOKS -- DUSK

           Been here before. David -- stylish in a nice Freemans 
           Sporting Club suit -- stands on the sidewalk outside the 
           display windows. Behind him -- BUSTLING LIFE of Manhattan 
           in the fall. He looks in the store window to see --

           A PROMINENT DISPLAY OF HIS NOVEL -- "GRIEVING CITY, BY 
           DAVID LEWIS." Among the other books on view, there's his: 
           A STACK, MANY COPIES OF THE SAME -- complete with NEW, 
           IMPROVED COVER ART: THE OLD-SCHOOL UNDERWOOD TYPEWRITER, 
           vintage keys arranged to spell the title of the novel...

           A PLACARD boasts QUOTES FROM GOOD REVIEWS. ON A POSTER: 
           DAVID'S PROMOTIONAL PHOTO and the words: "BOOK-RELEASE 
           PARTY TONIGHT." GUESTS arrive, enter through the front 
           door. David exchanges nods, greetings.

           David turns, looks up and down the street -- but doesn't 
           see what he's looking for. He checks his watch. Notices --

           AT THE DOOR -- LITERARY CELEBRITIES going into the event, 
           David's event. Think Michael Chabon entering while 
           chatting with Jhumpa Lahiri. RECOGNIZE a few EDITORS 
           Elizabeth kiss-kissed at the Botanic Gardens -- and Binky 
           Urban -- and see the P.W. critic, Jonathan Roe. Even so --

           David checks his watch again. Shit. Then he looks up --

           CHRIS APPROACHES from up the block. David smiles. Chris 
           has filled out a bit -- looks healthy and good. Slung 
           over his shoulder, Chris grips A GYM BAG emblazoned with 
           the words: "STUYVESANT HIGH SCHOOL." On his NAVY BLUE 
           POLO SHIRT, Coach-issue, are the words: "CROSS COUNTRY."

                                 CHRIS
                        Sorry I'm late.

                                 DAVID
                                  (re: his clothes)
                        That you are -- and you didn't even 
                        change for the occasion...

                                 CHRIS
                        Yeah, about that -- I can't stay.
                                  (off David's look)
                        We're practicing late all week.

           David understands. Not pissed at all, but curious --

                                 DAVID
                        Then what's so important -- you showed up 
                        to wish me luck?
                                 CHRIS
                        And that's a crime?

                                 DAVID
                                  (smiles)
                        Thanks, man.
                                  (then; re: Elizabeth)
                        I invited her.

                                 CHRIS
                                  (smiles; relishing it)
                        You taunting bastard.

           A beat as they look in the window, at the fruit of their 
           labor. THEIR REFLECTIONS visible in the glass. Finally --

                                 DAVID
                        Sent her an e-mail -- never heard back.

                                 CHRIS
                                  (re: the arriving guests)
                        And she didn't show. Big surprise there.

                                 DAVID
                                  (genuine)
                        I wonder where she ended up.

                                 CHRIS
                        Well, after every law school rejected 
                        her...

                                 DAVID
                        And we know what high moral standards 
                        they have.

                                 CHRIS
                        Exactly. Bottom line is: No more fame. 
                        She's completely off the radar.

                                 DAVID
                                  (with finality)
                        And that's the ballgame.

           David lets it land. Then -- they both smile big, laugh.

           ON THEIR REFLECTIONS in the store window as -- Chris's 
           cell phone BEEPS WITH AN ALARM. He takes it out, checks --

                                 CHRIS
                        I gotta go.

                                 DAVID
                        Run 'em ragged, Coach.

                                 CHRIS
                        See you Friday -- Teddy's birthday thing?
                                 DAVID
                        Yeah, I'll be there.

                                 CHRIS
                                  (re: David's books)
                        They look great. I'm glad you changed the 
                        picture on the cover.

                                 DAVID
                                  (agreeing)
                        It was too "Easy Rider" before.

                                 CHRIS
                                  (re: the bookstore)
                        Good luck in there.

                                 DAVID
                        Thanks.

           Chris walks off -- disappears into the flow of 
           PEDESTRIANS down the street. David watches him go, then -- 

           David glances back at the window, at his books on 
           display. Then, without hesitation -- he goes to the front 
           door, opens it -- the RUSH OF PARTY NOISE from O.S. 
           sweeps him in. He enters the crowded bookstore -- his new 
           life waits inside. All eyes on David. As the door shuts 
           behind him...

                                                               FADE OUT.

                                                                    END.
