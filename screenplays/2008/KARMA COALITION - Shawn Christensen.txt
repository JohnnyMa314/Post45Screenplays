                                                            FADE UP

           CLOSE-UP:  A WOMAN’s face, on her side, eyes wide open.

           She’s a young, beautiful model with a small line of blood
           seeping out of her perfect lips.

           As she lays deathly still on the floor, INDISCERNIBLE PEOPLE
           hover over her, snapping FLASH photos and clearing the area.
           A blurred gurney arrives behind her.

           A HAND with a plastic glove carefully feels her neck for a
           pulse.  Nothing.  Her face is stoic, her lips are cold.

           Muffled DIALOGUE is the only sound that reverberates.  But as
           the gurney is fully laid down, and the on-looking PATRONS are
           cleared, the extraneous CHATTER turns eerily silent.

           Her face looks like a statue, her eyes like porcelain,
           projecting a glassy stare.

           They lift her on to the gurney.  But just before they zip her
           up in the body bag...

           She blinks.

                        The art of dying is a trivial
                        thing...

           INT. COLLEGE LECTURE HALL -- DAY

           The large classroom boasts at least 200 STUDENTS.  All
           onlookers quietly pay attention to Professor DONOVAN MILES,
           mid 70’s, dressed in professional tweeds.

                                 DONOVAN MILES
                        It’s for amateurs.  Anyone can do
                        it, and we all eventually will.
                        Houdini died from being punched in
                        the stomach, and most people
                        consider that his worst trick.

           A light CHUCKLE erupts from some students.

                                 DONOVAN MILES (CONT’D)
                        The art of not dying, however, is a
                        different story.

           On the side of Miles’ desk, hidden under one of the legs, is
           a mini recording device, no bigger than a finger nail.  A
           tiny red light indicates it is activated.

                        It takes a lot of effort to stay
                        alive.

           Miles writes the word ‘Reproba Nexism’ on the blackboard.

                                 DONOVAN MILES (CONT'D)
                        And it takes even more effort to
                        live in tranquility.  Telephones,
                        satellites, internet, mass media...
                        These are all advanced forms of
                        communication to be sure.  But they
                        are also invasions of privacy.  And
                        we’re going to talk about that
                        today.

           INT. BILLIARDS HALL -- NIGHT

           Donovan walks through this seedy pool hall like he owns it.
           He passes through dozens of PATRONS on his way to the back
           door -- KNOCKS three times exactly.  The door opens.

           INT. BACK ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Donovan enters an off-track betting room with scattered
           GAMBLERS.  He approaches the window teller, GARRETT LAWSON,
           late 30’s, heroin skinny.  Garrett immediately starts paying
           him out in thousand dollar bills.

                                 GARRETT
                        Jamie’s not so happy about you
                        puttin’ a dent in his vault.

                                 DONOVAN MILES
                        Then tell him not to bet against
                        me.

           After Donovan is paid out, Garrett starts to shut the window.
           But Donovan grabs his arm first.

                                 DONOVAN MILES (CONT’D)
                        I’ve got one more.  One last bet.
                        And then we’re through.

           Donovan hands Garrett a piece of paper.  Garrett reads it.

                                 GARRETT
                        He’s younger.  Not even rich or
                        famous or nothin’.

                                 DONOVAN MILES
                        That’s what makes him so special.
           EXT. CITY STREET -- NIGHT

           Donovan walks down a damp, dark street.  He uses a cane for
           assistance, but still keeps a decent pace.  The SOUND of
           garbage being tossed in a nearby dumpster startles him.  A
           cat MEOWS.  He moves on.

           After a few paces, he hears the faint sound of FOOTSTEPS. He
           slowly turns his head to see if someone is following him, but
           a thin fog skews his vision.

           INT. MILES’ APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           Donovan enters his apartment in the dark.  He goes to turn on
           the light switch, but it doesn’t work.  Just as he realizes
           it won’t turn on, he notices a dim, flickering light coming
           from his living room.  It looks like the reflection of a
           fire.

           Suddenly, an INTRUDER grabs him from behind and covers his
           mouth.

           The intruder brings him into the living room, where two MEN
           await him.  One of the men, COSSY, early 40’s, ponytail,
           facial scars, tatoos, comes out of the shadows, while Miles
           is brought in.

           The other man is throwing all of Miles research and pages
           into the fireplace.

                                 DONOVAN MILES
                        Stop it!  What are you doing?

           Cossy takes out a syringe and puts on a pair of plastic
           gloves.

                                 DONOVAN MILES (CONT'D)
                        Wait a second...  Please, I kept my
                        promise.

           Cossy brings the syringe up to Miles’ neck while the two men
           hold him up.

                                 COSSY
                        The art of dying is a trivial
                        thing.

           Cossy shoves a sock in Miles’ mouth and injects the needle
           into his neck.

           Miles begins shaking terribly, eyes bulging.  He turns white
           as a ghost as he convulses to death.  Finally, after a
           moment, he turns serene.  Gone.

           OPENING TITLES SEQUENCE
           EXT. MILES’ APARTMENT BUILDING -- NIGHT

           Two Police Cars and an ambulance are staked outside.  The
           December air is cool and crisp.  Detective BENJAMIN YATES,
           50’s, trench coat and scarf, walks past a couple OFFICERS on
           his way inside.

           INT. MILES’ APARTMENT BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS

           He enters the building from the rain.  The LANDLORD, 40’s,
           greets him.

                                 LANDLORD
                        You Detective Yates?

                                 YATES
                        Yup.

                                 LANDLORD
                        He’s on the third floor.

           INT. MILES’ HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

           The Landlord leads Yates towards Donovan Miles’ apartment.

                                 LANDLORD
                        A tenant downstairs kept yappin’
                        about this smell.  Drivin’ me
                        crazy.  I thought maybe it was a
                        rat caught in the heating duct, but
                        when I come upstairs, this teacher
                        wouldn’t answer his door.  Then I
                        find out why.

           INT. MILES’ APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS

           Yates enters the apartment past the police tape.  Miles is
           sitting on his recliner, skin rotting, mouth wide open, flies
           scurrying around his limp carcass.

           JOHN DEELS, late 30’s, Forensics, is already on the scene.
           VANESSA GRAVITZ, early 30’s, another detective is in
           attendance as well.  Random OFFICERS also decorate the
           apartment.

           Yates calmly sits at a nearby chair, observing the body while
           John Deels gathers samples around the body.

                                 YATES
                        So?

                                 JOHN DEELS
                        No signs of trauma.  Skin’s pale,
                        legs are a little swollen.  First
                        guess, heart attack.

                                                        (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 YATES
                        Second guess.

                                 JOHN DEELS
                        He was gasping for air.  Heart
                        attack.

                                 YATES
                        How long has he been here?

                                 JOHN DEELS
                        A while.  Could be six days, could
                        be more.

           Yates gets up and looks around the room -- very clean,
           organized, simple.  Framed pictures of anatomy drawings and
           Norman Rockwell paintings fill the walls.

                                 YATES
                        A man who takes six days to be
                        found doesn’t have many friends.

           Vanessa walks in from the kitchen area.

                                 VANESSA
                        Never married.  No kids.  No
                        siblings.

                                 YATES
                        What’d he do?

                                 VANESSA
                        He taught Biochemistry and Medical
                        Science at Mt. Saint Johns.

           Yates picks up an odd-looking sculpture of the human brain.

                                 YATES
                        Is there a Will?

           Vanessa brings over the Will.

                                 VANESSA
                        Everything goes to charity.  But
                        there is one name in there.

           Yates takes a look at it.  It reads:  William Craft

           INT. UPSTATE COLLEGE / LARGE ROOM -- MORNING

           WILLIAM CRAFT, mid 30’s, suit and sneakers, enters the
           daunting room.  His sneakers SQUEAK as he walks across the
           newly waxed floor.

           He is greeted by a panel of four Faculty Members: JACK BOYLE,
           COREY, QUALLS and HEINSBERG.  They are all in their 50’s and
           60’s.

                                                        (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           William sits down, facing the panel and places his briefcase
           on the table.  The Panel seem disappointed.

                                 JACK BOYLE
                        Good Morning, William.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Jack.

                                 HEINSBERG
                        William, before we get started, I
                        just want to say that I think
                        you’re one of the best teachers
                        we’ve got.  And it saddens me that
                        we have to meet here today, under
                        these circumstances.

                                 COREY
                        However, you were hired under the
                        assumption that you would act as a
                        professional.  Which you clearly
                        have not.  And your recent actions
                        have brought a great deal of
                        disgrace to this school and
                        community.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Why don’t we just cut to the chase?

                                 JACK BOYLE
                         (hesitant)
                        William, the evidence is
                        overwhelming.  And the media’s
                        giving us pressure.

                                 QUALLS
                        We’re going to need your
                        resignation by this afternoon.

                                 COREY
                        Or we can fire you, if you’d like.
                        Effective immediately.

           William nods, thinking about it.

                                 WILLIAM
                        The real disgrace is you, Corey.
                        Gossiping behind my back like a
                        little schoolgirl.  Why didn’t you
                        talk to me, face to face?  Instead
                        of going to the Journal.  Playing
                        yourself out to be the victim.
                        Fuck you.

                                 HEINSBERG
                        All right, that’s enough of that.

                                 COREY
                        At least I didn’t sleep with a
                        student.

                                                        (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 WILLIAM
                        You couldn’t pay a student to sleep
                        with you, you ugly fuck.  And  I’m
                        not the only one in this room who’s
                        slept with a student.

           Heinsberg suddenly looks very uncomfortable.

                                 JACK BOYLE
                        Still, William, you’re the only one
                        who got caught.

           INT. WILLIAM’S OFFICE -- DAY

           William is packing up his belongings in boxes.  His office is
           a disaster zone.  Papers, folders, office supplies scattered
           everywhere.

           A KNOCK at his open door distracts him.  It’s Jack Boyle.

           Jack wanders in, lights a cigarette and sits down at the only
           vacant chair while William continues cleaning house.

                                 JACK BOYLE
                        Where will you go?

                                 WILLIAM
                        New York.  New Hampshire.  New
                        anything.

                                 JACK BOYLE
                        I’ve been to those places.  There’s
                        nothing there.

           William packs away a baseball and mitt.

                                 JACK BOYLE (CONT'D)
                        Look, William.  I want you to know
                        I did everything I could.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I know you did.

                                 JACK BOYLE
                        No, that’s not good enough.  I want
                        you to know that I could’ve done
                        more.  I could’ve blackmailed the
                        whole lot of ‘em, for chrissake.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I chose to sleep with the Dean’s
                        daughter, Jack.

                                 JACK BOYLE
                        You’ve been fired before, and it
                        didn’t stick.  I’ll get your job
                        back within the week.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Not this time.  This time, I’m
                        leaving for good.

           William takes a framed picture of a WOMAN, 30, and packs it
           away.  She is posing with William somewhere in the Pacific.

                                 JACK BOYLE
                        You know, it’s been five years
                        since Deirdre passed away...

           No response.

                                 JACK BOYLE (CONT’D)
                        Maybe you should go back to doing
                        stem cell research.  Take your mind
                        off things.  The Kennedy Center
                        would take you back with open arms.

                                 WILLIAM
                        It took Albert Calmette twenty one
                        years to invent the cure for
                        Tuberculosis.  And in that time,
                        forty three new diseases entered
                        the world.  It’s a battle that
                        cannot be won.

           The phone RINGS.  William ignores it.  Jack picks it up.

                                 JACK BOYLE
                        Hello?

                        Yeah, he’s here.

                        Well, hold on a second.  Let me put
                        him on.

           Jack holds out the phone towards William.

                                 WILLIAM
                        It’s not my office anymore, Jack.

                                 JACK BOYLE
                        Donovan Miles has died.

           William takes the phone.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Hello?

                        I know where it is.

           He hangs up.

                        I’m going to New York.

           INT. POLICE PRECINCT CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

           John Deels, holding a file folder walks briskly past OFFICERS
           and EMPLOYEES.  Vanessa joins him midway.  They’re clearly in
           a hurry.

           INT. YATES’ OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

           Deels and Vanessa enter Yates’ office and SLAM the file
           folder on his desk, opening it up to a photograph.

           Yates looks at the forensic photograph.  It shows a slightly
           miscolored area of Donovan Miles’ neck.

                                 YATES
                        What is this?

                                 JOHN DEELS
                        It’s called liposene residue, a
                        type of mercury.

                                 VANESSA
                        It’s basically post-mortem make-up.

                                 YATES
                        What’s it covering?

                                 JOHN DEELS
                        Syringe mark, maybe.  Hard to tell.

           Yates leans back in his chair.

                                 YATES
                        Is your diagnosis still a heart
                        attack, Deels?

                                 JOHN DEELS
                        No sir.

                                 VANESSA
                        And you know who Miles’ Landlord
                        claimed would come around the
                        apartment building?  Garrett
                        Lawson.

                                 YATES
                        Does the Landlord know that Garrett
                        Lawson has a criminal record?

                                 VANESSA
                        Probably not.
           INT. KEY SHOP -- NIGHT

           Yates and Vanessa enter the shop -- small, cluttered,
           thousands of keys and hardware.  A sheepish Garrett Lawson
           mans the counter.

                                 GARRETT
                        Oh man.

           Vanessa turns the ‘open’ sign around to ‘closed’.

                                 GARRETT (CONT’D)
                        I’m clean as a whistle, man.

                                 YATES
                        Sure you are, Garrett.  Let’s talk
                        in the back room.

           INT. BACK ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           Garrett, Yates and Vanessa.  More clutter.

                                 YATES
                        You know Donovan Miles?

                                 GARRETT
                        Yeah, I know him.  We play pool
                        down at Logan’s.  Why?

                                 YATES
                        You’re friends?

                                 GARRETT
                        We’re acquaintances.

                                 YATES
                        You know your acquaintance is dead?

           Garrett takes pause.

                                 GARRETT
                        You serious?

                                 YATES
                        That’s right.  And it wasn’t
                        exactly of natural causes.

                                 GARRETT
                        Hey man, I don’t know nothin’ about
                        no dead Professor.  I ain’t no
                        murderer, if that’s what you’re
                        insinuating.

                                 YATES
                        Then who did it?

                        It’s karma, man.  That guy was
                        fuckin’ with the higher powers.

                                 YATES
                        Who are the higher powers?

                                 GARRETT
                         (slightly laughing)
                        God, man.  God took a special
                        interest in Donovan Miles.  And so
                        did the devil.

                                 VANESSA
                        Doesn’t sound like very nice words
                        for a friend who just passed away.

                                 GARRETT
                        Like I said, Miss Vanessa, he was
                        an acquaintance.

           Yates takes out his gun and grabs Garrett by his hair.  He
           shoves his gun in Garrett’s cheek.

                                 GARRETT (CONT'D)
                        Okay, okay.  He was starting pools
                        in the Logan’s back room.
                        Management wasn’t happy about it.

                                 YATES
                        What kind of pools?

                                 GARRETT
                        He’d bet on when people were gonna
                        die.

                                 YATES
                        Example?

                                 GARRETT
                        Presidents, world leaders,
                        corporate bigwigs, even some
                        celebrities.  He’d come in and
                        place a bet on when they were gonna
                        die.  Usually within a couple
                        weeks.  And, of course, we all
                        would go in on it because the odds
                        were unimaginable.  But then he’d
                        win.  And it got so he’d win so
                        often, we had to stop betting.

                                 YATES
                        How often would you say he won?

                                 GARRETT
                         (beat)
                        Every time.

           Yates loosens his grip a little.

                                 YATES
                        How many bets are we talking about?

                                 GARRETT
                        Nineteen, twenty.  Enough so that
                        we started getting scared for our
                        own lives, you know?  He’d be
                        laughin’, thinkin’ it’s all fun and
                        games.  But after a while, it got
                        real uncomfortable.

                                 YATES
                        You think he was murdering these
                        people?

                                 GARRETT
                        We didn’t know what to think.  One
                        day he came in said some Catholic
                        Priest was gonna get it.  And
                        that’s where I was like, no fuckin’
                        way, pal.  I ain’t bettin’ against
                        a man of the cloth.  No matter what
                        the stakes.

                                 YATES
                        So...

                                 GARRETT
                        So?

                                 YATES
                        So, how did the Priest die?

                                 GARRETT
                        Well, we don’t know yet.  He came
                        in with that one last week.

           This really grabs Yates’ attention.  He let’s go of Garrett.

                                 YATES
                        Last week?  And what was the
                        spread?

                                 GARRETT
                        Gave him ten days, I think.

           Yates takes out his Blackberry -- opens it.

                                 GARRETT (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, it was ten days.  I’ve been
                        glued to the television ever since.
                        Waitin’ for this Priest to show up
                        dead in the news.  My girlfriend
                        thinks I’m nuts.

                                 YATES
                        You remember his name?

                        It was ‘Ferucci’.  From Italy.  You
                        know, those group of Bishops they
                        were investigating for feeding
                        money to the Polish Secret Service?
                        Remember that?

           Yates nods while writing the information in his phone.

                        This Ferucci was one of ‘em.

           INT. CATHEDRAL OF ST. PETER APOSTLE -- DAY

           ARCHBISHOP FERUCCI, 60’s, leads the mass.  THOUSANDS are in
           attendance.

           Title fades up:  Cathedral Basilica, Italy

                                 ARCHBISHOP
                         (in Italian)
                        “He had a dream in which he saw a
                        stairway resting on the earth, with
                        its top reaching to heaven, and the
                        angels of God were ascending and
                        descending on it...”

           Way in the back, in the second to last pew, sits the MAN,
           British, late 30’s, horn-rimmed glasses.  We’ll call him the
           SALESMAN.  He carefully takes notes while watching Ferucci
           SPEAK.  Ferucci’s words ECHO throughout the large chapel.

           ALEXANDER VICELLI, 40’s, calmly slides into the pew behind
           the Salesman’s.  He leans up to speak quietly with him.  The
           following exchange is subtitled.

                                 VICELLI
                         (in Italian)
                        The Archbishop wants to see you
                        this afternoon.

                                 SALESMAN
                         (in Italian)
                        Tell the Archbishop that we did not
                        agree on such a meeting.

                                 VICELLI
                         (in Italian)
                        Still, he knows that you are here
                        in Frascati, and wishes to meet
                        with you sooner rather than later.

                                 SALESMAN
                         (in Italian)
                        We will meet in four days as
                        previously discussed.  And no
                        sooner.

                         (in Italian)
                        I urge you to reconsider.  He is
                        eager to meet with you today, but
                        tomorrow he may change his mind.

                                 SALESMAN
                         (in Italian)
                        He has no choice in the matter.  We
                        will meet in four days when I have
                        thoroughly evaluated his
                        intentions.  If you approach me
                        again, the deal is off.

           Vicelli is not used to being strong-armed.  But he
           reluctantly gets up to leave.

           INT. POUGHKEEPSIE TRAIN STATION -- NIGHT

           William enters the station with a duffle bag and walks up to
           the ticket booth.

                                 WILLIAM
                        One way to Grand Central.

           The TICKET SELLER brings up the stub while William takes out
           a twenty.

           On a tiny television in the booth, the BBC News is on.  A
           graphic of JOMO KIBAWI, late 50’s, is on the screen.

                                 NEWS REPORTER
                        Jomo Kibawi, the President of Kenya
                        was assassinated at a National
                        Alliance rally in Othaya earlier
                        tonight.  It’s the fifth World
                        Leader assassinated within the past
                        two months.  So far, there are no
                        suspects...

           William takes his ticket and his change.

           INT. TRAIN -- NIGHT

           William stares out the window as the train winds through the
           Hudson Valley -- bridges are lit up, and lights illuminate
           from tiny houses across the river.

           He takes out a small, unused handkerchief from his inside
           pocket.  It is an off-white linen with a red stitched
           embroidery which reads:  For Whispering William

                                                     FLASHBACK TO: 

           William, five years earlier, staring at a stained glass
           window in a large Church.  His hands clutching a similar
           handkerchief.

           Jack Boyle, and some other FRIENDS, sit by his side.

           William slowly rises and walks down the aisle towards an open
           coffin.  Scattered MOURNERS fill the pews as he makes his way
           towards the casket.

           When he arrives, he sees his wife, DEIRDRE, 30, lying inside,
           eyes closed, flower on her chest.  She was the young woman in
           his framed picture.

           As a single tear releases from his watery eyes, he places his
           handkerchief on her chest next to the flower.
           It reads:  For Dreaming Deirdre

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. YATES OFFICE -- EVENING

           Yates pours himself a cup of coffee and washes down some
           pills.  A slight THUNDERSTORM is brewing outside.  A KNOCK at
           his open door reveals William.

                                 YATES
                        William Craft?

           Yates gets up and shakes his hand.

                                 YATES (CONT'D)
                        I’m Detective Yates.  Nice to meet
                        you.  Please, sit down.

           William sits down as Yates retreats to behind his desk.  The
           walls are decorated with post-expressionism art.  One
           particular piece perks William’s interest.

                                 WILLIAM
                        That’s a Scheile.

                                 YATES
                        Yes, it is.  You know his work?

                                 WILLIAM
                        I know Austria.  I studied there
                        for two years.

                                 YATES
                        You studied to become a teacher.

                                 WILLIAM
                        No, actually.  But that’s how it
                        turned out.

                                 YATES
                        Until you were discharged.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I don’t know if ‘discharged’ is
                        quite the word.

                                 YATES
                        I suppose it’s a matter of
                        semantics.  Fact is, you were fired
                        unceremoniously.  It’s okay to be
                        defensive about it.  Fornication is
                        a delicate matter.

                                 WILLIAM
                        You believe everything you read in
                        the papers?

                                 YATES
                        I believe in absolution.  What do
                        you believe in?

                                 WILLIAM
                        Just the details.  Types of shoes
                        people wear.  A firm handshake.
                        Things like that.  Everything else
                        is vanity.

           Yates smiles and takes Donovan’s file.

                                 YATES
                        When was the last time you spoke
                        with Donovan Miles?

                                 WILLIAM
                        Five years ago.

                                 YATES
                        You had a falling out?

                                 WILLIAM
                        That’s right.

                                 YATES
                        What was the issue?

                                 WILLIAM
                        I didn’t like some of the people he
                        was associating with.

                                 YATES
                        What made them unlikable?

                                 WILLIAM
                        They were secretive.  They had this
                        secret handshake bullshit
                        mentality.  I got out of there.

                                 YATES
                        So one day you were great friends,
                        and the next day you weren’t?

                                 WILLIAM
                        One day he was normal, and the next
                        day he was preaching about
                        apocalyptic theology.  Kept saying
                        the end of the world was near.

                                 YATES
                        Well, maybe you can explain
                        something to me.

           Yates pulls out a small postal package and places it on his
           desk in front of William.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What’s this?

                        It’s a package he left for you.

           William picks it up and looks it over.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Don’t things like this get handled
                        by a signatory?

                                 YATES
                        Fact is, there have been recent
                        developments in the matter of
                        Donovan Miles’ death.  And we took
                        the liberty of withholding his
                        possessions temporarily.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What kind of developments?

                                 YATES
                        I’d like to ask you to open up the
                        package here.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Well now, I’m no lawyer, but that
                        doesn’t sound very legal.

                                 YATES
                        I don’t care what it sounds like.
                        You’ll open up the package here, or
                        I’ll be forced to arrest you.

                                 WILLIAM

                        have any problems.

           William looks back at the door he came through.  Two OFFICERS
           are staked outside, ready to obtain him, should he try to
           leave.

                        The coroner discovered this small
                        needle mark located on his lower
                        neck.

                                 WILLIAM

                        I know he was murdered.  I also
                        know this;  He left everything to
                        charity --  every penny of his
                        savings.  His clothes, his car, his
                        favorite hat.  Hell, he even
                        donated his body to science.  All
                        except for this package.  There’s
                        only one name written on his Will
                        and Testament, and it’s yours.
                        This one package he wanted you to
                        have.  And it wasn’t just laying
                        around the apartment or tucked
                        safely under his bed.  No, sir.
                        This package was buried inside the
                        floor boards of a five-story
                        depository on the lower East Side,

                        until I speak with my lawyer.

                                 YATES
                        You were working on stem cell
                        research, illegally, in the state
                        of Michigan for over six months.
                        Now that may be a bullshit charge,
                        but the fact is, I can lock you up
                        for as long as I want, until I
                        build up enough evidence that
                        proves that you were linked to the
                        death of Donovan Miles.  How’s that
                        sound?

                                 WILLIAM
                        It sounds like blackmail.  And you
                        can go fuck yourself.

                                                        (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (4)

                                 YATES
                        That’s not the way to my heart,
                        William.  Open the box.

                                 WILLIAM
                        And then what?

                                 YATES
                        And then we mourn your involvement
                        or celebrate your innocence.  If
                        there’s nothing in it to
                        incriminate you, I’ll let you go
                        for the time being.  You have my
                        word.

           William thinks for a moment.  Finally:

                                 WILLIAM
                        You wait outside while I open it.

                                 YATES
                        No.

                                 WILLIAM
                        If it’s something personal to me,
                        or some sort of sentimental gift,
                        I’d rather take in the moment that
                        was rightly bestowed upon me,
                        without someone breathing over my
                        shoulder.  Just give me that.

           Yates puts out his cigar.

                                 YATES
                        Fine.  You have two minutes.  I’ll
                        be right outside.

           Yates leaves the room, but he can still see William through
           the window.

           William looks at the box.  He takes out a pocket knife
           attached to his key chain and carefully cuts open the
           wrapping tape.  When he opens it, a small wooden chest is
           packed inside.  He removes the wooden chest and sits down
           placing it on his lap.

           He unsnaps the tiny hinges and opens the top of the chest,
           revealing a lone photograph of Deirdre, his deceased wife,
           placed carefully on top of a gray foam.  He picks up the
           picture and looks at it.  She seems lonely in the picture.
           He turns the photograph around.  A hand-written note on the
           back reads:  She’s still alive

           Not understanding, he continues lifting the foam and finds a
           printed pamphlet entitled:  Corrupt List, New York City

           In this pamphlet, is an alphabetical list of City Officials.
           William scans through the pamphlet until he reaches the ‘Y’
           section.  He reaches the name; Yates

                                                        (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (5)

           He looks up at Yates, outside, who is CHATTING with the two
           officers and occasionally glancing over.

           When he returns his attention to the list, he reads a hand-
           written piece of paper:  If you are linked to me, they will
         kill you

           William continues to find a mini-cd placed underneath the
           paper.  It’s entitled:  The Karma Coalition

           Finally underneath it all are two tiny smoke bombs and a 9mm
           Glock -- loaded.

           William immediately shuts the box, afraid for his life.  He
           tries to think quickly about what he should do.

           EXT. YATES’ OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

           Yates is speaking with the officers.

                                 YATES
                        I’ll call you in, in five minutes.
                        He’s not going anywhere tonight.

           INT. YATES’ OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

           Yates enters his office and sees William holding the chest in
           his lap still.

                                 YATES
                        Well?

           William places the chest on Yates’ desk.

           When Yates opens it, there is only one item left inside --
           the torn page out of the Corrupt List.  He unfolds the piece
           of paper and reads his name.

           Suddenly, he realizes William has the gun pointed straight at
           his ribs.

                                 WILLIAM
                        No sudden moves.

                                 YATES
                        Are you out of your fucking mind?
                        What is it you plan to do?

                                 WILLIAM
                        Don’t know, don’t know.  I’m
                        thinking.

                                 YATES
                        That’s a life sentence you’re
                        holding in your trembling hand.

                                                        (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 WILLIAM
                        Shut up and open the window.

                                 YATES
                        Think about what you’re doing.  You
                        make it through that window, you
                        will be running for the rest of
                        your life.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I’m not exactly filled with options
                        right now, Yates.  So why don’t you
                        just do me a favor and coolly,
                        calmly open the fucking window.

           Yates slowly leads William towards the window.  The officers
           outside are not paying attention.

           Yates unlocks the large window and opens it.  A fierce WIND
           rushes in from the outside storm.  The officers take notice
           and enter the room.

           The officers take out their weapons as soon as they realize
           what’s happening.  William shoves the 9mm under Yates’ neck.

                                 YATES
                        Stay back.  Stay back.  Wait to
                        shoot him while he’s climbing out
                        the window.

           William looks out the window -- a two story drop.

                                 YATES (CONT’D)
                        That’s right, William.  You’ll be
                        dead by the time you hit the
                        ground.  Or you can put down the
                        weapon and be reasonable.

           William takes out the smoke bomb, and throws it at the
           officers’ feet.  The second it EXPLODES, the room fills up,
           and the officers no longer have a clean shot.

           William darts for the window.  One of the officers SHOOTS at
           William, but nearly hits Yates.

                                 YATES (CONT’D)
                        Don’t shoot!  Don’t shoot!

           While everyone is getting smoked out, the FIRE ALARM goes
           off.  William climbs out the window, hanging on for dear life
           before he jumps out.

                                 YATES (CONT’D)
                         (over the alarm)
                        What was in the box, Craft?  Talk
                        to me.

           William leaps out the window and...
           EXT. POLICE STATION -- CONTINUOUS

           ...lands hard on the cold sidewalk, hurting his side.  He
           quickly gets up and runs as fast as he can down 8th Avenue.
           As he runs off into the night, POLICEMEN and cars start
           dispatching from the Precinct.

           William runs down the street into the 50th Street subway.  He
           speeds down the stairs and hops over the turnstile to catch
           an incoming train.  Scattered PEOPLE move out of his way.

           The trains’ doors open, and William rushes on board.  The
           doors slowly close.  As the train is pulling out of the
           station, he sees a half dozen OFFICERS coming down the
           stairs, followed immediately by the blackness and RUMBLING of
           the dark tunnel.

           He takes out the CD and picture from his pocket to make sure
           he still has them.  He catches his breath and puts his head
           in his hands.

           EXT. ATRIUM / ITALY -- DUSK

           Vicelli is leading the Salesman through the Cathedral
           courtyard.  As we pass the cloisters, the large archways
           surrounding the atrium seem to loom down, almost eerily.

           INT. PRESBYTERY -- DUSK

           Vicelli and the Salesman enter the Archbishop’s private
           quarters, where three members of the DIOCESE await their
           arrival.  The Diocese are seated.

           Archbishop Ferucci enters with his PRIVATE COUNCIL and
           everyone stands.  He approaches the Salesman, who kneels down
           to kiss his hand.

           When the Archbishop sits, everyone else sits.

                                 VICELLI
                         (to Archbishop, in Latin)
                        This is the man who claims to offer
                        you sanctuary, my Lord.

                                 ARCHBISHOP
                         (in Latin)
                        He may speak.

                                 VICELLI
                         (to Salesman)
                        His Majesty is well versed in
                        English, if it suits you.

           The Salesman removes a tiny notebook from his inside pocket
           and reviews it for a moment.

                                                        (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 SALESMAN
                        Nothing will be discussed until the
                        Diocese and his Majesty’s Private
                        Council are adjourned.

                                 VICELLI
                        You can speak freely here.

           The Salesman and Archbishop stare at each other for the
           moment...

           Finally, the Archbishop whispers to his Council.  Both the
           Council and the members of the Diocese leave the room.

                                 SALESMAN
                        The Cross is falling in the West.
                        Ellanto and Vincenz, both close
                        friends of yours, have disrobed in
                        shame.  We have reason to believe
                        you may be next.  What I offer you,
                        is a second life.

           The Archbishop SPEAKS Latin to Vicelli.

                                 VICELLI
                        His Majesty wants to know if you’ve
                        heard something that particularly
                        pertains to his reputation.

                                 SALESMAN
                        No.

                                 VICELLI
                        Then why should he need a second
                        life?

           The Salesman thinks carefully before he speaks again.  Then:

                                 SALESMAN
                        There is the matter of his
                        homosexuality.

                                 VICELLI
                        How dare you accuse the Archbishop
                        of-

           The Archbishop puts his hand up to silence Vicelli.  He is
           willing to listen.

                                 SALESMAN
                         (to Archbishop)
                        It took me three days to find out.
                        How long do you think it’ll take
                        the Church?  The media?  How long
                        before Vincenz starts talking in
                        order to free his soul?  Time is of
                        essence, my Lord.  My organization
                        would very much like to help you,
                        and keep your legacy in tact.

           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 VICELLI
                        And how, exactly, would you help
                        him?

                                 SALESMAN
                         (ignoring Vicelli)
                        I’ll give you two days to decide.
                        You know our practices, and you
                        know our reputation.  We would be
                        honored to aide you in anyway
                        possible.
                         (gets up to leave)
                        Good day.

           The Salesman exits.  Leaving the Archbishop deep in thought,
           and Vicelli frustrated.

           EXT. OVERGROUND SUBWAY STOP -- NIGHT

           William is at a run-down phone booth in a dismal area of the
           city.  The booth’s fluorescent light flickers, barely
           illuminating the graffiti-ridden interior.

           RINGING is heard on the other end, followed by an away
           message from Jack Boyle.

                                 WILLIAM
                         (on phone)
                        Jack...  I’m in trouble, man.
                        Something went terribly wrong, and
                        I’m in big fucking trouble.  I’m
                        going to try and find Laura
                        Galloway.  I think she has a place
                        on the Upper West Side.  I’ll call
                        you from there at 1:00 AM.  Make
                        sure you pick up.

           William hangs up and adjusts his collar from the cold.

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY -- NIGHT

           William RINGS the buzzer to Laura Galloway’s apartment.
           LAURA GALLOWAY, 40’s, answers the door.

                                 LAURA
                        William?

                                 WILLIAM
                        I’m sorry to bother you this late
                        at night, but I had no where else
                        to go.

                                 LAURA
                        Don’t worry about it.

           Laura invites him in.
           INT. GALLOWAY’S APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS

           William enters the apartment -- large rooms, high ceilings,
           fine art, 1970’s wood paneling.  Laura closes the door behind
           him.

                                 LAURA
                        What’s going on?

                                 WILLIAM
                        Would it be okay if I could just
                        use your computer for a few
                        minutes?  It won’t take long.

                                 LAURA
                        Sure.  There’s one in the Den, down
                        the hall, on the left.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Thank you.

           INT. DEN -- NIGHT

           More wood paneling, beautiful view of the sparkling city,
           shelves and shelves of books.

           William injects one of the ‘Karma Coalition’ cds into John’s
           desktop.  As the disc loads, he looks over the photograph of
           Deirdre from the package.

           After a moment, a screen pops up with a still shot of Donovan
           sitting in his Living Room.  William presses ‘play’.

                                 DONOVAN MILES
                         (on computer)
                        Hello, William.  It’s been a long
                        time.  And I apologize for the
                        circumstances of this little
                        reunion.  However, to be
                        forthright, if you are watching
                        this, there is a strong chance that
                        I have died prematurely.  If this
                        package has fallen into the wrong
                        hands... then I have installed a
                        password protection key that only
                        William would know.  The clue for
                        this password, William, is simply
                        the revised title of your first
                        submitted essay.  If this password
                        is not inputted within two minutes,
                        the disc will erase itself and it’s
                        contents will be destroyed.

           The transmission stops, and the password box appears in the
           center of the screen, as advertised.

           William throws his hands up in confusion.  He has no idea
           what the clue means.

                        You’ve got to be kidding me.

           The clock counts down.  William jumps up and starts pacing to
           figure it out.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT’D)

           ‘Access Denied’ flashes on the screen.  The clock has thirty
           seconds to go.  William types it again.

           He types again, all capitals.  Access denied.  The clock has

           INT. CLASSROOM -- MORNING

           William, 22, sits at his desk when Donovan Miles places his
           ‘Karma’ paper in front of him.  A big ‘F’ is circled on the
           top of the page.

           The word ‘bad’ is handwritten before ‘karma’.

                                                     FLASH FORWARD:

           William types again.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Bad... karma.

           A pixelized image comes into focus.  It’s an image of
           Deirdre.  The screen flashes ‘password accepted’.

           Donovan appears on the screen again.

           CONTINUED:

                                 DONOVAN MILES
                        William, for many years I have been
                        working for an underground
                        organization called the Karma
                        Coalition.  It’s a program that has
                        existed for over half a century,
                        and it’s one of the worlds deepest
                        and darkest secrets.  The Coalition
                        has a list of certain people they
                        deem to be important, or greatly
                        significant.
                         (beat)
                        You, William, are on this list.
                        And when they find you, and they
                        will find you very soon -- I
                        suggest you take into careful
                        consideration what they have to
                        offer you.  I know we haven’t
                        spoken in a while, but I still
                        believe, as i did back then, that
                        you have a much greater purpose in
                        this life than merely teaching the
                        effects of modern medicine.  A
                        noble, but dead end job.  Good
                        luck.

           The screen goes blank.  A count down appears on the screen
           with the words ‘erasing disc’ BLINKING in red.

           Suddenly, the phone RINGS.  William looks at the clock.  It
           reads: 12:57am.  He picks it up.

                                 WILLIAM

                        What?

                         (on phone)
                        You’re on the news, William.  Right
                        now.  Your fifteen minutes of fame
                        has just begun.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Who is this?

           Click.  DIAL TONE...

           William hangs up the phone and scrambles for the remote
           control.  He clicks on the television and surfs through a
           couple channels before landing on the Evening News.

           A graphic of William is above the NEWS ANCHOR’S head.

                        kill three police officers this
                        evening, before jumping out of a

                        Mr. Craft was fired recently from
                        Kainsburgh College for having an
                        affair with one of his students.
                        He is wanted on at least 6 charges
                        of attempted murder.  If you see
                        anyone fitting this description...

           The reflection of red lights gradually starts blinking on the
           ceiling of the Den.  William looks out the window -- two
           Police cars have pulled up to the front of the building.

           The phone RINGS again.

           He looks at the phone and chooses to ignore it.  As it
           continues RINGING, he quickly grabs the box contents and
           shoves them inside a nearby empty backpack.

           As the SIRENS can be heard fifteen stories below, William
           retreats to the door only to find Laura, waiting for him in
           the hallway, phone in hand.

                                 LAURA
                        It’s... for you.

           She hands him the phone, which he reluctantly takes.  He
           slowly holds it up to his ear.

                        You don’t happen to have a
                        staircase to the roof, do you?

           Laura leads him down the hall to the:

           LIVING ROOM

           Sure enough, a spiral staircase makes it’s way up to an
           alcove which leads to the roof.  William begins climbing up
           the steps, but stops for a moment.  He looks at Laura, with a
           thankful expression.

           Laura nods.

           EXT. ROOF -- MOMENTS LATER

           William pops open a door that resembles a man-hole cover.  As
           he starts climbing out, SIRENS can be heard fifteen stories
           down below.  When he’s on his feet, he scans the moonlit
           horizon in all directions, guessing which way to go.

           He starts running across the close-knit apartment roofs --
           the moonlight guiding him as he carefully hops from one roof
           to the other before finding a fire escape to climb down.

           EXT. ALLEY -- MOMENTS LATER

           William drops down on top of a closed dumpster.  BAM!  He
           quickly jumps to the ground and runs as fast as he can away
           from the SIRENS in the distance.

           But before reaching the end of the alley, two MEN IN SUITS
           come from around the corner, followed by headlights.  William
           turns around and starts walking in the other direction, but
           two more MEN IN SUITS come out from the shadows at the other
           end.

           William quickly looks around for options while the Men close
           in on him.

           He chooses a long ladder on the side of the building and
           starts to climb it.  After he passes the second floor, the
           Suited Men quietly and calmly climb after him.

           He spots an open window and climbs through it to a:

           INT. CHEAP APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS

           William runs through the apartment into the Living Room,
           where a MOTHER and two CHILDREN are watching William on the
           Evening News on television.  The Mother SCREAMS.

           William finds the front door and exits.

           INT. CHEAP APARTMENT HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

           William enters the dank, fluorescent corridor and heads
           towards the stairwell.  A lone pay-phone on the wall starts
           RINGING.  The mother’s SCREAMING can still be heard from
           beyond the wall.

           CONTINUED:

           When William reaches the top of the stairs, more MEN IN SUITS
           are already coming up towards him.  He looks in the other
           direction -- dead end.

           The phone keeps RINGING.

           William slowly backs in towards the dead end, as six MEN IN
           SUITS make their way up to the floor and quietly move towards
           him.  They’re expressionless.

           William takes out his gun, but is immediately greeted with
           six guns back at him, all cocked and ready to shoot.  He’s in
           deep trouble.  The phone still RINGS.  Finally:

                                 MAN IN SUIT 1
                        Drop it.

           William relents and slowly lowers his gun.  The phone keeps
           RINGING, again... and again.  Finally:

                                 MAN IN SUIT 1 (CONT’D)
                        Answer it.

           William looks at the pay-phone and carefully picks it up.  He
           listens first.

           A MAN IN SUIT approaches William.

                        Well, I’m really happy for you.

           BAM!  The MAN IN SUIT smashes William in the back of the head
           with his gun.  BLACK OUT.

                        Okay, take the blindfold off him.

           When the cloth is unleashed, forty of Williams’ POST-GRAD
           FRIENDS are waiting in the Student Union for him. (eight
           years earlier).

           William, 27, sees a banner above the crowd that reads:
         Outstanding Merit in Biochemistry

           Donovan Miles shakes William’s hand.

                                 DONOVAN MILES
                        You’ve done well, william.  I have
                        three interviews set up for you
                        next week.

           William shakes his hand, but pays more attention to DEIRDRE
           BENNETT, 24, sipping wine in the corner.

           LATER

           MUSIC is on, PEOPLE are harmlessly drunk and CHATTING.

           William approaches Deirdre, who is pouring more vodka into
           the Punch Bowl.

                                 WILLIAM
                        So, what brings you here?

                                 DEIRDRE
                        Just supporting a fellow classmate.

                                 WILLIAM
                        In three years, I’ve never known
                        you to support me on anything.

                                 DEIRDRE
                        I should probably get going.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Why do you hate me so much?

                                 DEIRDRE
                        I worked really hard for that Merit
                        Award.  You did most of your
                        homework during breakfast, if at
                        all.  You coasted through every
                        class using loopholes and gaudy
                        charm tactics.  Your thesis was
                        hollow and incomplete.  And you
                        took advantage of Miles’ soft spot
                        for the perennial unknown.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Sounds like you have a lot to get
                        off your chest.  Why don’t we talk
                        about it over dinner?

                                 DEIRDRE
                        You think you can charm me the way
                        you charmed half the faculty at
                        Columbia?

                                 WILLIAM
                        No, I just like it when you’re
                        angry.

                                 DEIRDRE
                        Unfortunately, I don’t have room in
                        my life for narcissistic male
                        chauvinists.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What about at eight o’clock on
                        Thursday at the Tea Room?  You have
                        room then?

           Deirdre stares at him in disbelief.

                                 DEIRDRE
                        Maybe, maybe not.

                                 WILLIAM
                        When will I know?

                                 DEIRDRE
                        If you show up, and I’m not there,
                        then you’ll know.

           And with that she walks away.  William’s hooked.

           INT. THE TEA ROOM -- NIGHT

           William sits alone -- empty glass of wine.
           The clock reads: 8:43

           As he raises his hand for the check, Deirdre enters the
           restaurant in her winter coat, looking around for him.  When
           she spots him, she comes over and sits across from him.

                                 DEIRDRE
                         (beat)
                        I can’t get involved.

                                 WILLIAM
                        It’s just dinner.

                                 DEIRDRE
                        It’s not you.  I might be leaving
                        soon.

                                 WILLIAM
                        When?

                                 DEIRDRE
                        I don’t know.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Where?

                                 DEIRDRE
                        I don’t know.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Well, as much I’m enjoying this
                        cryptic conversation, I’m starving.
                        So before you leave, whenever that
                        is, why don’t you have something to
                        eat?

           William slowly slides the menu over towards her.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT’D)
                        I hear the open range chicken is
                        heavenly.

                                 DEIRDRE
                         (smiling)
                        You don’t take ‘no’ for an answer,
                        do you?

                                 WILLIAM
                        You haven’t said ‘no’ yet.

           The CONCIERGE approaches, with a digital camera.

                                 CONCIERGE
                        Sorry to interrupt, but we’re
                        taking pictures of our customers
                        this month for the ‘Opening Wall’.

           William and Deirdre see the far wall he’s referring to,
           loaded with photographs of recent patrons.

           William and Deirdre pose for the picture, as the Concierge
           SNAPS a shot.  He shows them the picture in back of the
           camera.

           The same photograph of William and Deirdre, in a framed
           collage.  Yates observes other photographs on the wall --
           family pictures with William’s parents, faculty photos, award
           ceremonies.

           Vanessa and two OFFICERS sift through William’s upstate home -
           - stone fireplace, half-redone kitchen, unmade bed, scattered
           books on art and photography, old television (still on),
           multiple grandfather clocks.

                                 VANESSA
                        Can’t find any background
                        information on his wife.

           Yates walks away.

           EXT. OLD ITALIAN HOUSE -- DAY

           Vicelli knocks on the CREAKY front door.  A BODYGUARD, built,
           turtle-neck sweater, opens the door and lets him in.

           INT. OLD ITALIAN HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           The Bodyguard leads Vicelli through a tiny kitchen towards a
           secret back door.  He unlocks the back door and allows
           Vicelli to go in first.

           INT. SALESMAN’S OPERATIONS ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Vicelli enters a large loft space with computers, machines
           and world maps decorating the walls.  TECHS and SCIENTISTS
           wander the office space, quietly working on unknown different
           projects.

           In the middle of the room, at an old wooden table, sits the
           Salesman, eating oatmeal by himself.

           Vicelli sits across from him.  He waits for Vicelli to say
           something worth hearing.  Finally:

           CONTINUED:

                                 VICELLI
                        I wanted to speak to you about a
                        serious matter that may present
                        problems in the future.

                                 SALESMAN
                        Then speak.

                                 VICELLI
                        There are documents... that could
                        prove to be incriminating to the
                        Archbishop.

                                 SALESMAN
                        And where are these documents?

                                 VICELLI
                        They are securely hidden inside the
                        East Mausoleum.  The Pope himself
                        has guards protecting the room at
                        all times.  These documents could
                        potentially surface in the
                        aftermath of his... death.

           The Salesman wipes his mouth with a napkin while mulling it
           over.

                                 SALESMAN
                        Then we’ll burn down the Mausoleum,
                        with the Archbishop inside it.

                                 VICELLI
                        I hope you’re joking.  This is a
                        delicate issue and should be
                        treated as such.

           As the Salesman continues eating, Vicelli realizes he is not
           joking.

                                 VICELLI (CONT’D)
                        Now hear this...  Any man who plans
                        to burn down the house of God will
                        most certainly burn in hell
                        himself.  The Archbishop won’t have
                        it.

                                 SALESMAN
                        The Archbishop hasn’t believed in
                        God for years, and we both know it.
                        The Mausoleum will burn to the
                        ground next Friday, with the
                        documents and the Archbishop firmly
                        inside it.

           Vicelli is speechless -- red with anger.

                                 SALESMAN (CONT’D)
                        You can leave now.

           Vicelli gets up to go.

                        Archbishop receives this
                        information.

           Vicelli leaves.

           INT. DINER -- LATE NIGHT

           Vanessa and Yates eat together in the corner of the tiny
           eatery.

                                 VANESSA
                        Statewide search of two children
                        who went missing in Cleveland.
                        Three days of media blitz,
                        browbeating and broken promises.
                        Finally, on the fourth day, they’re
                        found dead inside the trunk of a
                        car just twenty feet from their
                        parent’s house.  They were playing
                        hide-and-go-seek.

                                 YATES
                        Well, they obviously found a good
                        hiding place.

                                 VANESSA
                        You’re fucked, Yates, you know
                        that?  Cursed with a steady diet of
                        death and Diamorphine.  I can’t
                        tell if your ambivalence is an art
                        or a disease.  But it’s getting to
                        the point where you don’t even care
                        about the living.

                                 YATES
                        If this is about yesterday, I don’t
                        have an answer for you.

                                 VANESSA
                        It’s not about just one thing.
                        It’s a string of white lies that
                        goes so far back, I can’t even
                        begin to catch up.  You have no
                        conscience.

                                 YATES
                        Your diagnosis is duly noted.

                                 YATES
                        There’s no science to it.  He was
                        scared.

                                 VANESSA
                        Because you scared him.

                                 YATES
                        He’s a suspect, Vanessa.

                                 VANESSA
                        He’s the son-in-law of a CIA agent.

           Vanessa unveils a folder with information on William’s
           connection to the Agency.

                                 YATES
                        Who gave you this?

                                 VANESSA
                        Not you, apparently.  I had to find
                        this out through the Town Hall
                        sewing circle.  Not only was
                        Deirdre Bennet’s father a CIA
                        agent, but he was cited as the main
                        person responsible for the
                        disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa.  And
                        according to this file, the car
                        accident that killed his family is
                        under investigation.

                                 YATES
                        I was going to tell you-

                                 VANESSA
                        Bullshit.  It’s okay if you want to
                        share my bed and check your
                        emotions at the door, but I’ll be
                        damned if we’ll have secrets while
                        we’re working together.  I’m not
                        interested in playing the role of
                        the estranged concubine.

                                 YATES
                        That role’s already being played by
                        my wife.

           Vanessa gets up to leave.

                                 YATES (CONT’D)
                        Don’t leave.

                                 VANESSA
                        I’ve lost my appetite.

           She’s gone.  Yates sits alone with his thoughts.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

           Yates sits up on the bed, alone, in his robe, watching
           television.  He takes some pills off the night stand and
           swallows them without water.  He then unfolds a piece of
           paper he was previously clenching.  It is the “Corrupt List”.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

           He scans his finger down the list of names, and stops at his
           own.  As he folds it back up, a NEWS REPORT gradually seeps
           into his consciousness from the television.

           Footage of an Italian Church on fire appears on the screen
           with a JOURNALIST narrating over the images.

                                 JOURNALIST
                         (on television)
                        The Cathedral of St. Peter Apostle
                        had a detrimental fire this
                        afternoon, killing two people and
                        injuring at least thirteen others.
                        The church is one of the oldest
                        Cathedrals in Europe.  It is
                        unknown as to what caused the fire,
                        but there are reports that the
                        Archbishop of the Church may very
                        well have been one of the two
                        people killed.

           Yates slowly rises, walking towards the television. “Breaking
         News” appears on the bottom of the screen while the report
           continues.

                                 JOURNALIST (CONT’D)
                         (on television)
                        There is speculation that the
                        Archbishop’s head Deacon, Alexander
                        Vicelli, may have been the other
                        casualty...

           Pictures of Vicelli and the Archbishop appear on the screen,
           along with subtitles which read:
         Archbishop Johandro Ferucci killed in Cathedral fire

           Yates stares at the television, almost in a trance.  He’s
           completely astonished.  Donovan’s prediction was spot on.

           INT. BLUE HALLWAY -- NIGHT

           William lies atop a gurney, strapped down with belts.  A
           small crew of UNKNOWN SURGEONS are wheeling him through a
           damp corridor.

           William slowly stirs awake, and immediately sees the masked
           Surgeons.  He’s groggy and drugged.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What’s... happening?

           The Surgeons ignore him as they apply black latex gloves to
           their ghostly hands, preparing for surgery.

           They carefully steer the apparatus through a gigantic
           revolving door into the:
           INT. OPERATING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           When the gurney slows to a halt, a bright laser lamp is
           adjusted to shine a bright light over William.  The tarp
           covering his body is oddly fitted to his size and stature.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What’s going on here?  Someone TALK
                        TO ME.

           The Surgeons prod his eyes and ears with tiny laser lights.
           One of them takes out a tiny drill and turns it on.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT’D)
                        What is that?!  WHAT IS THAT?

           Another one of them puts a wooden block in William’s mouth,
           gagging him.  He emits a MUFFLED SCREAM as they inject an
           I.V. into his left arm and input a syringe.  He struggles to
           get free, uselessly, as they inject an anesthesia into his
           body.

           Everything becomes blurry as they turn his head and bring the
           drill towards his right ear.  The SOUND of the drill slowly
           fades as everything turns blurry until... BLACKOUT.

           INT. LOG CABIN -- DUSK

           William awakens on a couch.  He’s inside a cozy log cabin
           with hardwood floors and a stone fireplace.  A small fire
           CRACKLES in the fire place, illuminating the room in a
           welcoming fashion.  The room is spacious and tidy, with a
           dining table, grandfather clock and a large flat-screen
           television on the wall.

           As gentle BRAZILIAN MUSIC plays in the room, he gets off the
           couch to look around.  His ear is in slight pain -- feeling
           it makes it hurt more.

           There is a sliding glass door towards the back.  It reveals a
           view of thousands of green trees from above.  He’s high up in
           the mountains.  The sliding door is locked from the inside.

           He feels around his person, looking for the photo or CD or
           gun or anything -- all taken away.

           A sexy MAID, 20’s, Donna Reed-ish, enters the room from
           another door, carrying a tray with food and drink.  William
           watches her as she places the tray on the table and pours him
           a cup of coffee.  She smiles at him and leaves back where she
           came from.

           A WOMAN, 30, British accent, enters the room.  She brings a
           clipboard with her and sits across from William on an
           adjacent couch.  Her name tag reads:  Interviewer 113

                        I apologize for the nature in which
                        you were brought in, Mr. Craft.
                        However, under the circumstances,
                        it was necessary.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Who are you?

                        I’m just here to interview you.  It
                        shouldn’t take too long.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Interview me for what?

           Interviewer 113 reads notes from her clipboard, as well as
           jots things down during their conversation.

                                 INTERVIEWER 113
                        You’ve said before that you believe
                        in the details, such as a firm
                        handshake and the types of shoes a
                        person wears.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I said that in a police station
                        less than twenty four hours ago.

                                 INTERVIEWER 113
                        Is it true?  Or do you really
                        believe in the big picture?

                                 WILLIAM
                        I’m not following the question.

                                 INTERVIEWER 113
                        If you knew the end of the world
                        was less than five years away, and
                        you had the chance to avoid it,
                        would you take that chance?

                                 WILLIAM
                        You mean stop it from happening?

                                 INTERVIEWER 113
                        No.  To stop something from
                        happening and to avoid something
                        from happening are two different
                        things.  Clearly, your natural
                        impulse is to stop it from
                        happening.

                                 WILLIAM
                        That’s because I can’t comprehend
                        avoiding it.

                        If you knew there was a safe haven,
                        here on earth, which would survive
                        such an apocalypse.  Would you go
                        there, knowing you’d never see the
                        rest of the world again?

           William thinks about it.  Finally:

                        No.

                        Why not?

                                 WILLIAM
                        Because that’s the hand I was
                        dealt.  It’s my world.  My New
                        York.  My Paris.  I’m as much a
                        part of those places as they’re a
                        part of me.

                        Your wife, Deirdre, drowned to
                        death in the East River on May
                        13th, 2004.

           No response.

                                 INTERVIEWER 113 (CONT’D)
                        At the time of her death, you were
                        working on a cure for diabetes, as
                        well as helping to develop key
                        stages of stem cell research.  You
                        were the youngest biochemist at the
                        Kennedy Medical Center ever to be
                        admitted into the program.  Is that
                        true?

                                 WILLIAM
                        Yeah, I suppose.

                                 INTERVIEWER 113
                        But after Deirdre’s death, you quit
                        research.  You relocated to upstate
                        New York and became a teacher at a
                        public college.  Why?

                                 WILLIAM
                        There’s no shame in teaching.

                        wife hadn’t died in that river, you
                        would still be curing diseases

                        It’s only relative to you, the

                        rephrase it.  Do you think you
                        would still be curing diseases

                        Well, that’s good, because I
                        haven’t asked you any.  But thank

           INT. BILLIARDS HALL -- NIGHT

           POOL PLAYERS and SEEDY PATRONS fill the Hall that Donovan
           once frequented.  MUSIC is playing and the place is very
           alive.

           Suddenly, a SWAT TEAM busts through the front lobby ordering
           everyone to GET DOWN!  The CLIENTELE scatter everywhere
           SCREAMING.  Over twenty POLICE OFFICERS and Swat Team members
           quickly infiltrate the room, controlling the area.

                        hands behind your heads!  NOW!

           Everyone follows the orders instantly.  The place calms down
           and the MUSIC is unplugged.

           After the dust has settled, Yates and Vanessa enter the
           premises, heading for the back room.
           INT. BACK ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Yates and Vanessa enter the room to find more OFFICERS
           holding down the fort.  GAMBLERS and DRUG DEALERS are down on
           the floor.  Garrett is manning the betting window.

           Yates quickly enters the betting office and grabs Garrett by
           the collar.

                                 YATES
                        How did he know?!  How did he know
                        about the Priest?

           Garrett shakes his head in fear.

                                 YATES (CONT’D)
                        ANSWER ME!

                                 GARRETT
                        I don’t know, man.  I swear to god,
                        I don’t know.

                                 YATES
                        There’s no way you can predict with
                        a hundred percent accuracy a
                        person’s death...  unless you’re
                        the murderer.

                                 GARRETT
                        Well, it’s not a hundred percent
                        yet.

                                 YATES
                        What do you mean?

                                 GARRETT
                        There’s still one more out there.
                        And he’s alive.

                                 YATES
                        Well, what’s his name, Garrett?
                        Maybe we can stop it from
                        happening, you ever think about
                        that?

                                 GARRETT
                        His name is...  Craft.  William
                        Craft.  He’s been all over the
                        news.

           Yates turns pale.  He looks at Vanessa, who is equally
           shocked.

                                 GARRETT (CONT’D)
                        The guy’s got two more days to
                        live.

                                 YATES
                        And how, exactly... does he die?

                                                        (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Garrett grabs the betting form with his free hand and holds
           it out for Vanessa to take it.  She rips it from his hands
           and reads it over.

                                 GARRETT
                        He gets shot by a Police Officer.
                        A Lieutenant... just like you,
                        Yates.
                         (smirking)
                        Just like you...

           Yates throws Garrett to the ground and takes the betting form
           from Vanessa.  It has a small black & white picture of
           William and all of the information regarding his future
           death.  Yates can’t believe his eyes.  He looks over at
           Vanessa, who seems disgusted.  She leaves the room.

           INT. DIVE BAR -- NIGHT

           Yates is slumped on a stool, drowning himself in scotch.
           Vanessa is reading aloud the betting form.

                                 VANESSA
                         (reading)
                        On the night of May 12th, 2009,
                        William Thompson Craft will be shot
                        dead by an officer of the law.  A
                        Lieutenant from the 41st Precinct,
                        NYPD, will have shot Mr. Craft
                        inside an abandoned building on the
                        Lower East Side.  He will be shot
                        in vain.  Signed, Donovan Miles,
                        May 2nd.
                         (beat)
                        That’s the day Donovan died.

           Yates looks over at the sheet and calmly takes it from
           Vanessa.  After re-reading it himself, he takes out a lighter
           and lights the paper on fire, before dipping it in his glass
           of ice.

                                 VANESSA (CONT’D)
                        You’re not going to shoot him,
                        Yates.

                                 YATES
                        41st Precinct.  That’s us.

                                 VANESSA
                        It’s superstition.

                                 YATES
                        It’s a game of chance.  Either I’m
                        being set up, or there’s something
                        out there way bigger than any of
                        us.  Something beyond human.
                        Either way, I don’t have control.

                        You choose what you will and will
                        not do.  You can stop this right
                        here.  He’s not a cop-killer and we
                        both know it.  There’s no reason to
                        shoot him.

                                 YATES
                        What if a reason presents itself
                        between now and Thursday.  What
                        then?

                                 VANESSA
                        Then we wait.  We have over 165 men
                        combing the city and surrounding
                        counties for him.  All we can do is
                        wait.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

           William wakes up on the bed of an empty hotel room.  His head
           aches.  He feels drugged and slightly disoriented.

           A strange looking bag sits atop the adjacent bed.  He’s never
           seen it before.  He gets up, wipes his eyes and quickly opens
           the bag.  It contains:  fake glasses, fake beard, razor, hair
           dye, clothes.

           Next to the bag is a remote control.  A post-it memo taped to
           it reads:  press ‘play’

           William presses the ‘play’ button

           The Salesman appears on the television screen.

                                 SALESMAN
                         (on TV)
                        Hello, William.  You are currently
                        being reviewed and processed by the
                        Karma Coalition.

           William sits on the bed, tuning the VOLUME up.

                                 SALESMAN (CONT’D)
                         (on TV)
                        There are three steps to the
                        recruitment procedure.  One:  Our
                        information.  We have concrete
                        evidence that in the fall of 2013,
                        a World War of irreversible
                        proportions will begin, essentially
                        wiping out over ninety percent of
                        the human race.  This is not an
                        educated opinion, it’s a fact.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Yeah, sure...

                                                        (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           As the salesman SPEAKS, a super-imposed map of the world is
           shown with large red areas, alluding to areas of the world
           which will be wiped out.

                                 SALESMAN
                         (on TV)
                        Two:  Our objective.  We recruit
                        specific individuals from around
                        the world to a remote island called
                        ‘Parista’ which will be unaffected
                        by this nuclear holocaust.  It’s
                        not an easy task, as this area of
                        the world will only fit thirty
                        thousand people, safely.

           A blueprint of an unknown city is superimposed, briskly
           showing the Parista layout -- public transportation vehicles,
           buildings and streets, grid-like overhead view.

                         (on TV)
                        And three:  Our execution.  Our
                        practice is to forge people’s
                        deaths, quickly and quietly, in an
                        attempt to transport them to
                        Parista without gaining
                        international attention.  This
                        insures two things -- that no one
                        knows Parista exists, and that no
                        one will be looking for the people
                        we recruit.

           An image of a file on William appears on the screen --
           profile, age, height, birthplace etc.

                        Which brings us to you, William.  A
                        skeptic.  A man with great ideals
                        and great talent, yet lacking in
                        faith of humanity.  A man who only
                        believes what he sees with his own
                        two eyes.  So watch closely,
                        William...

           Suddenly, recent footage of Deirdre, smiling and waving at
           the camera, appears.  She’s with the Salesman and her father,
           GEORGE BENNETT at an unknown Marina.  Another piece of
           footage reveals her and the Salesman and Donovan Miles, at a
           Retreat.  She smiles again, self conscious about being
           filmed.

           William walks up and slowly touches the television screen.

                        Deirdre is one of these special
                        people, William.  And she’s alive
                        and well today, and will be alive
                        and well after the Fall of 2013.

                        file is processed, but we want to
                        show good faith.  And we trust that

           INT. BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           William enters the dank bathroom and dumps out the contents
           of the bag.  He starts transforming himself by:

           - shaving

           - putting on the fake glasses

           - applying the fake beard

           - combing his hair differently

           EXT. BEDFORD STUYVESANT -- DUSK

           The Salesman walks through an area of New York that resembles
           a nuclear holocaust.  Garbage, graffiti, rats and drug
           dealers lace the streets.

           INT. COSSY’S DEN -- MOMENTS LATER

           Cossy’s abode is almost a satanic altar.  It’s filled with
           burning candles and upholsteries made of human skin.

           The windows let in a strange light, illuminating the room
           with late-afternoon blues and yellows.  But the vintage desk
           lamps and steel bedframe don’t match in a way that celebrates
           madness and ignorance.

           Cossy sits indian-style in the middle of the room, listening
           to CLASSICAL MUSIC.  He’s topless, and has two nails sticking
           out of his upper chest.  The small stream of blood that
           erupts from the nails almost match perfectly.  He is using a
           tattoo gun on himself in the mirror.  Drawing something on
           his upper left peck.

           The Salesman enters -- looks around.

           Cossy sees him in the reflection of the mirror and stands up
           to greet him face to face.

                                 COSSY
                        I didn’t invite you here.

                                 SALESMAN
                        I like to keep the element of
                        surprise.

           Cossy slowly takes out each nail, and lightly tosses each one
           at the Salesman’s torso.  He might as well be spitting on
           him.

                                 COSSY
                        I don’t like salesmen in my

                        look like murders.  Especially when
                        it’s on my beat.  They found a
                        needle mark on the Professor.

                        It all worked out.  The end result
                        will be the same.  If you gotta
                        problem, you can report it to the
                        Monarch.

                                 SALESMAN
                        I already did.

                                 COSSY
                        The hell you did.

                                 SALESMAN
                        You’re getting sloppy, Coss.

           Cossy immediately takes out a large custom-made handgun with
           two barrels and an eyepiece.  He places it right between the
           Salesmans’ eyes.

           Suddenly, in response, seven MEN IN SUITS infiltrate the room
           and unsheathe their guns right back at Cossy.  He’s instantly
           surrounded.  The Salesman’s power is undeniable.

           Cossy slowly lowers his weapon.

                                 COSSY
                        He was placing bets on our clients.
                        Practically advertising our
                        existence to the scumfucks of the
                        underground.  He had to be taken
                        care of.

           The Salesman slaps an envelope at him.  Cossy grabs it and
           quickly opens it.

                                 SALESMAN
                        Your next assignment.

           A smile creeps across Cossy’s face while he reads it.

                                 COSSY
                        No hard feelings about the
                        Professor, right?  It was a small
                        slip up.  Won’t happen again.

                                 SALESMAN
                        You know what the difference
                        between us is, Coss?

                                 COSSY
                        What?

                                 SALESMAN
                        You’re expendable.

           After the stare-down between Cossy and the Salesman goes on
           for a minute, the Salesman leaves.  The SUITS all file out
           after him.

           INT. JACK BOYLE’S DEN -- NIGHT

           Jack, in his robe, is feeding his fish -- a thirty gallon
           tank which decorates his den.  The walls are filled with
           books, computer software programs, encyclopedias, playing
           cards, knick knacks, small statues of dragons.  He’s a
           collector of many things.

           He hears a RUSTLE come from outside his window.  Curious, he
           approaches the window, but can’t see anything.

           Suddenly, the light over his garage turns on -- motion
           detector.  He tightens the belt on his robe and opens the
           door to get outside.

           EXT. JACK BOYLE’S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           The sounds of CRICKETS are everywhere.  Jack carefully makes
           his way over to the garage and looks around.  Nothing.  He
           looks straight into the overhead light and watches the flies
           swarm around the illumination.

                                                        (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           He walks back to the front porch which is pitch black.

           Out of nowhere a DARK FIGURE comes from behind him and
           immediately covers his mouth.  He squirms to get loose.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Jack, it’s me.  It’s William.

           William slowly uncovers his mouth.

                                 JACK BOYLE
                        What the hell are you doing?

           Jack turns around -- sees william.

                                 JACK BOYLE (CONT'D)
                        Christ, William.  You scared the
                        shit out of me.

           INT. JACK BOYLE’S KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER

           Jack and William are sitting at the kitchen table, eating
           donuts.  Jack’s house is well taken care of, with drawings
           from his two children hanging all over the fridge.

                                 JACK BOYLE
                        They come around asking...
                        questions.  I don’t know what to
                        tell them.  They say my best friend
                        is running rampant around New York
                        City.  That he’s wanted for
                        attempted murder.  I mean, what
                        happened down there?

                                 WILLIAM
                        I can’t tell you.  But I’m not a
                        murderer, Jack.  You’ve got to
                        believe that.

           Jack nods.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT’D)
                        I hate to involve you with this,
                        but I need a favor.

                                 JACK BOYLE
                        Anything.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I need to borrow your car.  I’ll
                        bring it back tomorrow.

                                 JACK BOYLE
                        I wish I could help you, but Martha
                        took it for the weekend to visit
                        her parents.

           CONTINUED:

                                 WILLIAM
                        What about you’re other car?

                                 JACK BOYLE
                        Won’t start.  I keep putting off
                        bringing it to the shop.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What about the other other car?

           INT. GARAGE -- MOMENTS LATER

           As the automatic garage door slowly opens, Jacks ‘other car’
           is revealed.

                                 JACK BOYLE
                        1967 Corvette Stingray.  Big Block
                        engine, independent rear
                        suspension, goes from zero to sixty
                        miles per hour in under eight
                        seconds.  Only two hundred and
                        sixteen of this particular model
                        were ever made.

           The Corvette Stingray shines.

           Jack leans on his broke-down Toyota, while holding out the
           Corvette key.  William carefully pries the key from his
           hands.

                                 JACK BOYLE (CONT’D)
                        I can’t let you have it.

           As Jack stares at his beautiful silver Coupe, William opens
           the passenger side door.

                                 JACK BOYLE (CONT’D)
                        It took me half my life to save up
                        for this car.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I’ll bring it back tomorrow.

           William grabs a shovel from the side of the garage and puts
           it on the passenger seat.

                                 JACK BOYLE
                        What’s the shovel for?

                                 WILLIAM
                        Jack, nobody can know I was here or
                        spoke with you.  Okay?

           Jack nods, wondering if he’s nuts for letting William borrow
           the car.

           William gets in the car and turns the IGNITION.  As he REVS
           the engine, Jack leans through the passenger window.

                                                        (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 JACK BOYLE
                        Take me with you.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Not this time.  Don’t follow me or
                        try to figure out what I’m doing,
                        either.  It’s important.

           Jack nods again.  He takes one long look at his pride and
           joy, and steps back from the car so William can pull out.

           INT. UNMARKED POLICE VEHICLE -- CONTINUOUS

           Two UNDERCOVER COPS, parked a few yards from Jack’s house,
           watch as the Corvette pulls out of Jack’s driveway and into
           the street.  They TURN ON the ignition and start following
           it.

           One of the Cops grabs the CB.

                                 UNDERCOVER COP
                         (on CB)
                        Hey, we have the suspect leaving 68
                        Cedar Drive in a Chevy Corvette.
                        License plate number...

           INT. YATES BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Darkness.  The phone RINGS.  Yates turns on his night stand
           lamp and answers it.  His WIFE, barely visible under the
           covers, lies next to him.

                                 YATES
                         (on phone)
                        Hello?

                                 VANESSA (V.0.)
                        They have Jack Boyle leaving his
                        house at 2:30 in the morning.

           Yates quickly sits up.

                                 YATES
                         (on phone)
                        You sure it’s Jack Boyle?

           INT. UNMARKED POLICE VEHICLE -- NIGHT

           The Cops are following the Corvette as it turns down one
           street and onto another.

                                 VOICE
                         (over CB)
                        Pull him over.

                                                        (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 UNDERCOVER COP
                        Yup.

           The Undercover Cop puts their siren on the roof and begins
           assailing the corvette.  After the siren WAILS for a moment,
           the corvette pulls over.

           The Undercover Cops get out their guns and open their doors.

           EXT. UNMARKED POLICE VEHICLE -- CONTINUOUS

           The Undercover Cops slowly approach the corvette.  They both
           have their guns pointed at the vehicle.

                                 UNDERCOVER COP
                        Put both your hands outside the
                        window so we can see them!

           Two hands poke outside the driver’s side window.

                                 UNDERCOVER COP (CONT’D)
                        All right, keep them there.

           The Undercover Cop reaches the Corvette.

                                 UNDERCOVER COP (CONT’D)
                        Get out of the vehicle, slowly.

           Jack Boyle slowly gets out of the car with his hands up.

           The Undercover Cops look at each other in mild confusion.

                                 JACK BOYLE
                        He knew.

                                 UNDERCOVER COP
                        Who knew?

                                 JACK BOYLE
                        William.  He knew you were
                        watching.

           The Cops lower their weapons.

           INT. JACK’S TOYOTA -- NIGHT

           William is driving Jack’s Toyota along the Taconic Parkway,
           headed upstate.  Jack’s shovel in the back seat.

           William stares out at the open road, trying to piece things
           together.

                                                      FLASHBACK TO:
           INT. LARGE BALLROOM -- NIGHT

           A New Year’s celebration party, years earlier.

           William and Deirdre, dressed to kill, are dancing to BIG BAND
           MUSIC.  Hundreds of PARTY GUESTS are also on the dance floor.
           When the song’s over, they kiss each other deeply, smiling
           and in love.

           William looks across the room at GEORGE BENNETT, 60’s, and
           his WIFE, sitting at one of the tables.  These are Deirdre’s
           parents.  William nods a ‘hello’ towards George, but George
           turns the other way.

           INT. WILLIAM’S HOUSE / DEN -- DAY

           William is pinning up his own wedding invitation on the wall.
           It shows a photo of Deirdre and himself.

           A KNOCK at the door interrupts him.

           INT. WILLIAM’S LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           William answers the door to find George.

                                 GEORGE
                        May I come in?

                                 WILLIAM
                        Sure.

           George, wearing a hat and trench coat, wanders inside,
           looking around William’s apartment.  He’s quietly judging it.

                                 GEORGE
                        I hear you’ve become good friends
                        with Donovan Miles.

                                 WILLIAM
                        That’s right.

                                 GEORGE
                        Interesting...  May I sit down?

                                 WILLIAM
                        Of course.

           William quickly cleans off the sofa, which has clothes and
           popcorn bowls strewn across it.  The place is a mess.

           They both sit down, facing each other.  Awkward silence.

                                 GEORGE
                        Why a man of your intelligence
                        insists on being unorganized and
                        unambitious I’ll never know.

                        never know either.  But what’s done
                        is done, and there’s nothing I can
                        do to change her mind.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Well, I’m glad to hear that.

           George takes out an envelope from his inside pocket and
           places it on the coffee table.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT'D)
                        What’s that?

                                 GEORGE
                        It’s more money than you’ll make in
                        your entire lifetime.  All you have
                        to do is walk away.

           William picks up the envelope and sees the outline of a check
           inside, through the sunlight.

                                 WILLIAM
                        You don’t know anything about me.

                                 GEORGE
                        I know you’re the only person with
                        a PHD who works at a pizza
                        restaurant.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I just got hired at the Kennedy
                        Medical Center.

                                 GEORGE
                        That’s not good enough.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I’m the youngest ever admitted into
                        the program.

                                 GEORGE
                        Not good enough.

           William rips the envelope in half.

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                         (nodding)
                        I guess we’re done here.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I guess so.

           George gets up to leave.

                                 GEORGE
                        It’s not so much you, William.
                        It’s the climate.  Things aren’t
                        going so well in our family right
                        now.  The last thing we need is a
                        new addition.

           George leaves.  William stares at the torn envelope.

           EXT. PAMONA STATE CEMETARY -- LATE NIGHT

           It’s raining as William (present day) pulls up outside the
           side gate.  The headlights are turned off.

           EXT. PAMONA STATE CEMETARY / SIDE HILL -- MOMENTS LATER

           William, carrying a shovel, trudges up the hill in the rain.
           He turns on a flashlight to find the right spot.  After
           browsing a few tombstone’s, he comes across the one he’s
           looking for.  It reads:  Deirdre Craft, 1977 - 2004

           This is where he’ll dig.

                                                          DISSOLVE:

           He digs through the night until the sun starts to rise.  At
           the break of dawn, he has most of the coffin uncovered.  He
           wipes away the dirt and takes one side of it to lift.

           He lifts the coffin out just enough to open it.  While trying
           to regain his breath, William pries open the coffin...

           Inside, lying peacefully, is Deirdre.  She has minimal
           deterioration.  There are numerous erosions on her cheeks and
           forehead, but nothing that would happen to normal human skin.

           William slowly grabs Deirdre and lifts her up... finding out
           that some of her backside is made out of hollow wire frame.
           She’s a fake.  William lifts her up more to see for himself.

           William places her back and sits on the dirt, completely
           shocked.  He is drenched from the rain, and haggard.  Doesn’t
           know what to think.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        “Reality is merely an illusion,
                        although a very persistent one”.

           William looks up to find the Salesman, standing over the
           grave.

                                 SALESMAN
                        Albert Einstein.

           The Salesman holds out his hand out, to help William out of
           the grave.  When William is completely out of the hole, he
           sees at least twenty MEN IN SUITS surrounding the premises.

                                 WILLIAM
                         (beat)
                        Why?

                        Her family was CIA, and they needed
                        to be hidden.  If she stayed
                        behind, she would’ve been a
                        casualty.

                                 WILLIAM
                        If she stayed behind, she would’ve
                        been with me.

                                 SALESMAN
                        She’d be dead.  KGB has no
                        boundaries, William.  They’ll take
                        your daughter, take your son.
                        They’ll take everything.

                                 WILLIAM

                        Jesus Christ.

           The Salesman dusts William off a bit, while one of the MEN
           brings him a towel.  The Salesman hands William the towel to
           dry himself off.

           William looks around at the MEN IN SUITS and the cemetary.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT'D)
                        Why me?

                                 SALESMAN
                        We want you join our Biochemistry
                        division.  As a matter of fact, we
                        want to spearhead it.  You would
                        have unlimited funding.  No
                        politics, no government
                        intervention.  No rules.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Why now?

                                 SALESMAN
                        We can’t do everyone at once,
                        William.  Now is your time.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Is she expecting me?

                                 SALESMAN
                        I don’t have direct contact with
                        the other side.  I can’t guarantee
                        she’ll know you’re coming.

           William takes out Deirdre’s handkerchief.  Looks it over.

                        What’s the going price for a re-
                        birth?

                                 SALESMAN
                        You can’t come back.  No trips to
                        Paris or New York, or visiting old
                        friends, or even saying goodbye.
                        Small price considering it won’t be
                        here for much longer anyway.

           William nods.  Finally:

                                 WILLIAM
                        I’ll go.

                                 SALESMAN
                         (smiling)
                        We’ll start prepping you
                        immediately.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I didn’t tell Jack anything.

                                 SALESMAN
                        I know, William.  I know...

           William finally nods, yes.  The Salesman smiles.

           EXT. JACK’S HOUSE / GARAGE -- DAY

           More rain. Jack’s Toyota pulls into his driveway.  It BEEPS
           for the garage door to open.

           INT. JACK’S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           Jack looks out the window and sees the car.  He runs into
           the:

           INT. GARAGE -- CONTINUOUS

           Jack presses the button to OPEN the garage door.  As the door
           rises, the heavy RAIN skews Jack’s vision of the driver.

                                 JACK BOYLE
                        Come on in!

           The Toyota slowly pulls into the garage, but Jack can’t see
           the driver.  When the car is fully pulled in, Jack walks
           around to the driver’s side window and leans down.

                                 JACK BOYLE (CONT’D)
                        William?

           The window rolls down and a gun sticks out.  Jack quickly
           puts his hands up. 

                                                        (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Two SHOTS come from the gun, hitting Jack dead in the chest.
           He goes down immediately, FALLING into the toolbox and
           garbage cans on his way to the ground. SMASH!

           Jacks eyes are still alive while Cossy exits the Toyota, gun
           in hand.  He stands over Jack while Jack gasps for his final
           breath.

                                 COSSY
                        Sleep...

           Jack’s gone.

           Suddenly, a NOISE erupts from behind Cossy.  He quickly turns
           to find Jack’s wife, MARTHA, mid 40’s, at the door.

                                 MARTHA
                        Jac-

           Cossy wastes no time and SHOOTS her twice in the chest.  She
           goes down in seconds.  Dead.

           Cossy takes a moment to admire his handy-work before tossing
           the gun on the floor.

           EXT. JACK’S HOUSE / GARAGE -- DAY

           It’s a crime scene.  POLICE OFFICERS, EMS DRIVERS, FORENSICS
           and state vehicles line the premises.

           Yates pulls up to the scene and gets out of his BMW.  He
           shows his badge to the surrounding OFFICERS and pushes the
           yellow tape out of his way.

           Vanessa and Deels are already in the garage, investigating.
           After Yates and Vanessa make eye contact, she pulls off her
           plastic gloves and goes inside the house.

           Deels is taking samples from Jack’s body.  The gun used to
           shoot both victims is being placed in a zip-loc bag by Deel’s
           ASSISTANT.

                                 DEELS
                        We’ll have prints within the hour.

                        Don’t bother.  That’s the gun
                        William had in my office.

           Yates watches as Martha’s body is being covered.  He’s angry.
           He leaves the garage towards his car.  Deels chases after
           him.

                                 DEELS
                        Yates!

           Yates stops at his car and turns around.

                        Just so you know.  These two
                        victims were shot twice each, in
                        the middle of their chest.  Like a
                        bull's-eye.

                                 DEELS
                        I know, but this guy didn’t move
                        from his mark.  He shot them both
                        from the same spot within five
                        seconds of each other.  Now, I know
                        you have it in for the teach, but
                        off the record... this was

                        On the record, everything revolves
                        around Craft.  We’re never gonna
                        solve these crimes.  But... if you
                        get Craft, I have a feeling this
                        all goes away.

           Yates gets into his car.

                                 DEELS (CONT’D)
                        Where are you going?

                        I’m going back to the Depository.
                        Maybe there was something else
                        there besides the box.

           Yates drives off.

           EXT. ABANDONED DEPOSITORY -- NIGHT

           The building looks like it survived a nuclear explosion --
           walls knocked out, electric wiring exposed, windows smashed
           and broken.

           Yates pulls up in his BMW and crosses the street to enter the
           building.

           INT. ABANDONED DEPOSITORY -- CONTINUOUS

           Yates walks up the CREAKY stairs on his way to the fifth
           floor.

           When he reaches the fifth floor, half the walling is punched
           out, exposing a moderate view of the city.  Empty bookshelves
           and over-turned file cabinets decorate the interior.

           Moonlight illuminates Yates’ way to the exact place where he
           dug up Donovan’s box -- a floor board.  He yanks up the tile
           flooring and feels around for anything else besides the box.
           After a moment, his hand feels something.  He grabs it and
           pulls it out...

           It’s an odd-looking digital compass, with electronic
           coordinates displayed on the front.

           around.

           William is standing over him, holding a gun at him.

                        You’re in trouble, William.  And

                                 YATES
                        If that’s true, then you need to
                        put the gun down.

           Inside Yates’ right sleeve, a small gun peeks out from inside
           his palm.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Know any really magnificent
                        attorneys?

           No response.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT’D)
                        Can’t offer a lawyer?

                                 YATES
                        I don’t think there’s much of
                        anything a lawyer can offer you,
                        right now.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Is that irrefutable?  Or non-
                        negotiable?

                                 YATES
                        It’s my opinion.

                                                        (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           William takes out a file from behind a nearby bookcase and
           slides it across the floor to Yates’ feet.  Yates looks down
           and carefully pick it up.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Eventually, xeroxed issued
                        statements tell stories.

           Yates sifts through the folder, realizing it’s a complete
           breakdown of all his under-the-table dealings over the years
           -- dollar figures per month, phone records, photographs of
           him speaking with the mob.  All the dirt on him contained in
           one tidy package.

                                 YATES
                        Where did you get this?

                                 WILLIAM
                        Blackmail, ransacking international
                        networks, gambling... maybe even
                        bribery.

                                 YATES
                        You’ve got my whole life in here.

           William puts the gun right between Yates’ eyes.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Asshole... corrupt... cop.

                                 YATES
                        You’re no different than me if you
                        blackmail me with this.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Horrible of me, eh?

           William backs up holding his gun straight at Yates.  He cocks
           the hammer.

                                 YATES
                        You don’t have the stomach for a
                        killing.  You’ve been trembling
                        since I met you.  What are you
                        caught up in, William?  Who’s
                        driving you over the edge?  I can
                        help.

           William seems worried -- sweat pouring from his forehead.

                                 YATES (CONT’D)
                        I know I’m not perfect.  I’ve
                        skimmed off the top and I shouldn’t
                        have.  But I got into this business
                        to do something good.  And I’ve
                        gotta tell you, if there’s one
                        person in this world who’s not
                        setting you up... it’s me.

           William doesn’t know what to think.  He looks scared.

                                                        (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

           Suddenly, a BEEPING HORN from the street distracts William.
           He POPS off a shot by accident, but Yates quickly draws his
           palmed weapon and SHOOTS William three times in the arms and
           chest.  BANG!  BANG!  BANG!

           William flies backwards into a metal beam.  He falls to the
           ground, spitting up blood.  Yates runs over to him.  William
           tries to say something... but goes limp.  Dead.

           Yates pries the gun from William’s dead hands.  He checks the
           cartridge.  His face grows pale.

                                 YATES (CONT'D)
                        Blanks?...  BLANKS?!

           Yates goes on a rampage, PUSHING over bookcases and drawers.
           KICKING everything in front of him.  After a moment, he sees
           the file folder laying on the ground.

           As SIRENS can be heard in the distance, Yates takes out a
           lighter and lights the folder on fire.  He tosses it in a
           metal drawer while it burns to ashes.

           Next on the agenda is to retrieve the digital compass.  He
           grabs it from under the floorboards and shoves it inside his
           tench coat.

           As the SIRENS get LOUDER, Yates dials his cell phone.

                                 YATES (CONT’D)
                         (on phone)
                        Yeah, it’s me.  Tell them I’m up on
                        the fifth floor and everything’s
                        under control.

           Hangs up.

                                 YATES (CONT’D)
                         (to himself)
                        Everything’s under control.

           POV:  William’s serene face, eyes closed...

                                                         FLASHBACK:

                                 DEIRDRE (V.O.)
                        What are you afraid of, William?

                                 WILLIAM (V.O.)
                        I don’t know if I can do this.  I’m
                        not very good with kids.

           INT. HOSPITAL / CHILDREN’S WARD -- MORNING

           Deirdre and William are having a discussion outside of a
           hospital room.

                                                        (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 DEIRDRE
                        You’re going to be fine.

           Deirdre kisses William, who seems slightly nervous.

           They enter the room.

           INT. CHILDREN’S NURSERY -- CONTINUOUS

           A nursery school for kids with Leukemia.  Many of the
           CHILDREN, ages 6 through 12, are bald -- some with bandages
           wrapped around their heads.

                                 CHILDREN
                        Good morning, Mrs. Bennett!

           The room is filled with toys and children’s finger paintings.
           It’s a colorful place, filled with hope and good spirits.

                                 DEIRDRE
                        Good morning, friends.  This is my
                        friend, William.

                                 CHILDREN
                        Hello, William.

           William nods at them, then leans over to Deirdre.

                                 WILLIAM
                         (whispering)
                        They’re going to hate me.

           All of the children start pointing at William.

                                 CHILDREN
                        Ooooohh.  Whispering!

           One of the children, Angie, 8, SPEAKS up.

                                 ANGIE
                         (smiling)
                        Not supposed to whisper, it’s rude.

                                 CHILDREN
                         (chanting)
                        Whispering William!  Whispering
                        William.  Whispering William!

           William LAUGHS at himself for being teased -- loosens up.

                                                          DISSOLVE:

           MOMENTS LATER

           Deirdre sits at a table with JAMES, 8, helping him paint
           words onto a handkerchief.  William sits at another table on
           the other side of the room.

                                                        (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 DEIRDRE
                        I want you to write down Angie’s
                        name, with an adjective in front of
                        it.  So she could be amazing Angie,
                        or angelic Angie, or-

                                 JAMES
                        Awesome Angie.

                                 DEIRDRE
                         (smiling)
                        That’s right, awesome Angie.

                                 ANGIE
                        I’m awesome!

           William helps Max hold his paint brush at another table.  He
           watches Deirdre across the room, LAUGHING with the kids.  He
           falls more in love with her each passing moment.

                                 MAX
                        What is your job?

                                 WILLIAM
                        I, um, help make cures for people
                        who are sick.  Like you.

                                 MAX
                        Well, hurry up, already!

           William CHUCKLES a little.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I will.  I’m almost done, okay?
                        We’ll have it real soon.

           Max nods.

           EXT. CHILDREN’S NURSERY -- LATER

           William and Deirdre look at each other after the children are
           seen off by their PARENTS.

           When they’re alone, William takes out a handkerchief he made,
           handing it to Deirdre.  It reads:  For Dreaming Deirdre

           Deirdre smiles and hands him one, in return.  It reads:  For
         Whispering William

                                 WILLIAM
                        Marry me.

           Tears stream down Deirdre’s eyes.  She nods and kisses
           William long and hard.

                                                     FLASH FORWARD:
           INT. DARK CORRIDOR -- DAY

           A doorway opens, letting in the blinding daylight.  Two
           SILHOUETTES enter the dimly-lit hallway as the doors close
           behind them.  It’s William and the Salesman.

           A ramp declines underground, and they follow it for a while.

                                 SALESMAN
                        Tomorrow night you’ll be sent to an
                        abandoned building in lower
                        Manhattan.  You’ll find Detective
                        Yates there.  There’ll be a
                        confrontation, and he’ll shoot you.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Shoot me?

           William stops walking just before they reach another door.
           VOICES can be heard behind it.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT’D)
                        You didn’t say anything about
                        getting shot!  Can’t I die of a
                        heart attack or a stroke or
                        something?

           The Salesman types in a code and places his hand over the
           module for authorization.

                                 SALESMAN
                        Heart attacks lead to hospitals.
                        Gunshots lead to graves.

           The door opens and they continue there discussion inside.

           INT. LARGE AUDITORIUM -- CONTINUOUS

           Hundreds of PEOPLE are busily running around, answering PHONE
           CALLS, TYPING at their desks, watching one of forty different
           televisions airing the world news.  There are maps and graphs
           and even astrology charts outlining the entire room.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What if he shoots me in the head or
                        somewhere not protected?

                                 SALESMAN
                        Don’t worry.  You’ll be protected.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Why is he going to shoot me?

                                 SALESMAN
                        Because you’re going to give him
                        this...

           CONTINUED:

           The Salesman takes out Yates’ file folder of corrupt
           activities.  William takes it from him and flips through it.

                                 SALESMAN (CONT’D)
                        He’s been on the payroll for years.
                        He also has some politicians in his
                        pocket.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Jesus Christ.  You have folders
                        like this on everybody?

                                 SALESMAN
                         (beat)
                        Yes.

           Over to the left, a SNIPER shoots a MAN in the back!  William
           is initially shocked.  After a moment, the Man pushes himself
           up, and takes off a thin bullet-proof vest.  The Sniper
           wanders over to his opponent, and investigates the newly-shot
           apparatus.

           KAITLIN, mid-30’s, energetic, sassy, no-bullshit, approaches
           them.

                                 KAITLIN
                        Hello, William.  I’m Kaitlin.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Hello.

                                 SALESMAN
                        This is where I leave you.  Kaitlin
                        will walk you through the entire
                        process and prep you on everything
                        you need to know.  You’ll be in
                        good hands.

           And with that, the Salesman walks away.

                                 KAITLIN

           INT. KAITLIN’S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

           William and Kaitlin enter her office, where a consultant,
           MORGY, 40’s, Chinese, extremely intelligent, is waiting.

                                 MORGY
                        I need more time.

           He holds up a bullet-proof vest, with fake blood-bags
           attached throughout the exterior.

                         (pointing)
                        They replaced the blood bags with a
                        Polyethylene hybrid.

                        It simply won’t work.  These bags
                        have been known to leak.

           Kaitlin grabs William and hands him the vest.

                                 KAITLIN
                        Here, try this on.
                         (to consultant)
                        Morgy, no one’s going to get close
                        enough to him to figure that out.

           William fits himself with the vest.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Um... Can we discuss something?

                                 KAITLIN
                        Jesus Christ, Morgy.  Look how big
                        that is!

                                 MORGY
                        Those were the measurements given
                        to the Council.

           Morgy takes out some measuring tape and sizes up William.

                                 KAITLIN
                        Oh no, this won’t do.  I can’t have
                        him roaming around New York City
                        like this.

           Kaitlin begins lifting the vest off William, handing it to
           Morgy.

                                 KAITLIN (CONT’D)
                        Fix it.  Get it away.

           INT. MEDICAL FACILITY -- LATER

           William is sitting on a medical table being examined by four
           PHYSICIANS.  They are checking his blood pressure, prodding
           his ears, eyes, nose, taking his blood, etc.

           Kaitlin is pacing around the room, going over more details.

                                 KAITLIN
                        You’ll be taking a pill called
                        Chlonepcine shortly before the
                        shooting.  It’s a shock drug that-

                                 WILLIAM
                        I know what it does.  It triggers
                        the nervous system.  Makes me
                        appear dead for a few minutes.

                                 KAITLIN
                        Seven minutes, to be exact.
           INT. CARDIOLOGY ROOM -- LATER

           William is lying down, receiving an EKG.  The CARDIOVASCULAR
           SPECIALIST performing it watches for anything abnormal on the
           X-ray machine.

           Kaitlin sits in the corner, legs crossed, overseeing the
           procedure.

                                 KAITLIN
                        Tomorrow afternoon, we’ll leak a
                        tip to the Detective leading him
                        back to the same Depository where
                        Donovan hid the box.  You’ll be
                        there waiting for him.

           William nods.

           INT. KAITLIN’S OFFICE -- LATER

           William, wearing a hospital gown, sits across from Kaitlin
           while she fills out some forms.  She has a large “Man Who
         Fell to Earth” poster on her wall.  William finds himself
           staring at it.

           He turns his attention to a small digital compass sitting on
           Kaitlin’s desk, and picks it up to look at it.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What’s this?

                                 KAITLIN
                         (looking up)
                        That’s you.  It’s the monitor for
                        the little tracking device inside
                        your head.  It tells us your
                        coordinates.

           She gets up and takes it out of his hands, clearly not
           wanting him to touch it.

                                 KAITLIN (CONT'D)
                        Tomorrow, we’ll go over to the
                        Vapor Factory.  They’ll develop a
                        mix of liquid and gas sealant to
                        shield your head and hands.

           She hands him a pile of paper.

                                 KAITLIN (CONT'D)
                        Now I’m going to need you to sign
                        these forms.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What do they say, exactly?

                                                        (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 KAITLIN
                        You know the old joke ‘signing your
                        life away’?

           William nods.

                                 KAITLIN (CONT’D)
                        That’s what you’re doing.

           William stares at the paperwork.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What’s it like there?  I don’t even
                        know anything about it.

                                 KAITLIN
                        First of all, there’s no turning
                        back now, William.  Second of all,
                        I’ve never been there.

                                 WILLIAM
                        You’ve never been there?

                                 KAITLIN
                        Karma Coalition policy states that
                        no employee is permitted to set
                        foot in Parista.  Ever.

                                 WILLIAM
                        How do I know this place even
                        exists?

                                 KAITLIN
                        When Yates shoots you in the
                        depository, you will wake up in
                        another place, here on earth.
                        That’s a fact.  You will be
                        provided with a house, a car and a
                        new life.  I can’t prove to you it
                        exists, because the point of
                        Parista is to cut off all
                        communication with the outside
                        world.  But it exists, William.
                        And in time you’ll realize why I’m
                        so sure of it.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What about the Salesman?

                                 KAITLIN
                        Salesmen can retire there after
                        fifteen years of service.  Provided
                        they have a good sales record.

                                 WILLIAM
                        How can you sell something, if
                        you’re not sure what you’re
                        selling?

           CONTINUED: (2)

           The phone RINGS.  Kaitlin picks it up, says ‘hello’, and
           turns her back to William for a second, SPEAKING softly to
           the person on the other line.

           William steals the digital compass off Kaitlin’s desk and
           stashes it away while she’s not looking.

           INT. PRECINCT LOCKER ROOM -- NIGHT

           Yates, back from the pool, is buttoning up his shirt.  When
           he puts his coat on, he reaches inside and takes out the
           digital compass, wondering what it is.

           A light BEEP erupts from somewhere else in the coat.  He
           searches the other pocket while it BEEPS again, unveiling a
           tiny mini CD Recorder.  The battery is dying.

           He presses ‘play’.

                                 RECORDER
                        I remember the title of my first
                        essay... Steganography...

           Yates presses ‘stop’.

           Suddenly, an envelope is slipped into his locker by a passing
           OFFICER.  Yates puts away the recorder and compass and opens
           the envelope -- filled with hundred-dollar bills.

           He shuts his locker and approaches the Officer who gave it to
           him, handing it back.

                                 YATES
                        You can keep this from now on.

                                 OFFICER
                        I don’t understand.

                                 YATES
                        Tell Costello he can keep his
                        money.  I’m not interested anymore.

                                 OFFICER
                        With all due respect, sir, I don’t
                        think a lot guys around the
                        Precinct are going to be very
                        comfortable with that.

                                 YATES
                        I’m not concerned about the comfort
                        level of the precinct.  I’m playing
                        it straight from now on.

           Yates walks away, back to his office.

                                                        (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 OFFICER
                         (calling after him)
                        You’re on your own, Yates.  You
                        hear me?  You’re on your own.

           INT. YATES OFFICE -- LATE NIGHT

           As the clock TICKS, echoing throughout the room, Yates stares
           at the compass and mini-cd recorder.  He presses ‘play’.

                                 RECORDER
                        W: Know any really magnificent
                        attorneys?
                         (beat)
                        W: Can’t offer a lawyer?
                         (beat)
                        Y: I don’t think there’s much of
                        anything a lawyer can offer you,
                        right now.

           Yates STOPS the recorder.  PLAYS it again.  STOPS it.  PLAYS
           it again.  Listening to different bits of the conversation.
           Rewinding, fast-forwarding.  PLAYING it again.  STOPPING.

           EXT. VANESSA’S HOUSE -- 3:00 AM

           Yates is KNOCKING on Vanessa’s door.  No answer.  He KNOCKS
           again, impatiently.

           Finally, a light is turned on inside.  Vanessa answers the
           door in her robe, barely awake.

                                 VANESSA
                        Yates?  What are you doing here?

                                 YATES
                        He was going to blackmail me.  He
                        had this file on me.  It had dirt
                        on me going so far back, I can’t
                        even say for sure if I did half of
                        it.  I-

           Vanessa’s husband, HANK, 40, average-looking, comes down from
           upstairs, wondering what the hell is going on.

                                 YATES (CONT’D)
                        Hank.

                                 HANK
                        Yates.

           Vanessa nudges Yates out onto the front porch.

                                 VANESSA
                        We’ll be right back, hun.

           Vanessa walks Yates out into her front yard.

                        What the fuck are you doing at my
                        house at three in the morning?
                        Hank is suspicious enough as it is.

                                 YATES
                        Vanessa, you’ve got to listen to
                        me.  I wasn’t planning to shoot
                        this guy.  But he came at me with
                        this furious mindset.  He had this
                        folder on me that even the CIA
                        couldn’t conjure up.

                                 VANESSA
                        Well, where is this folder?

                                 YATES
                        I burned it.

                                 VANESSA
                         (shaking her head)
                        You’re a real piece of work, you
                        know that, Yates?

                                 YATES
                        I’m telling you, something big is
                        going on here.  Something not
                        right.  I went to church tonight
                        for the first time in ten years.

                                 VANESSA
                        Well, I’m proud of you, Yates.  But
                        I suggest you do your mourning at
                        William’s funeral, not on my front
                        lawn.

           Yates takes out the mini-CD Recorder.  Holds it up.

                                 VANESSA (CONT'D)
                        What’s that?

                                 YATES
                        It’s a recording of the entire
                        conversation between William and I
                        before I shot him.

                                 VANESSA
                        A recording?  Is there
                        incriminating information about you
                        on there?

                                 YATES
                        Yes.

                                 VANESSA
                        Then you get rid of it, Yates.  You
                        destroy the CD, the recorder, the
                        whole thing.

                                 YATES
                        I would.  But there’s only one
                        problem.

                                 VANESSA
                        What?

                                 YATES
                        It’s not my recorder.

                                 VANESSA
                         (beat)
                        What are talking about?

                                 YATES
                        My pockets were empty when I went
                        down to the Depository.  But when I
                        got back to the Precinct, after
                        hours of paperwork, I found this
                        little recorder, stored safely in
                        my right pocket, beeping at me.
                        Begging me to play it.

                                 VANESSA
                        I don’t understand.

                                 YATES
                        William must’ve planted it on me,
                        when he patted me down for my gun.

                                 VANESSA
                        Why would he do that?

                                 YATES
                        I don’t know.  But I’m going to
                        find out.

           The front door opens, revealing Hank, wondering what’s going
           on.

           Yates looks at Hank, then Vanessa, then leaves --
           disappearing into the darkness.

                                                         FLASHBACK:

           INT. ABANDONED DEPOSITORY -- NIGHT

           William seems nervous while he sloppily pats down Yates.  As
           he removes Yates’ gun, he slips a mini-CD Recorder inside
           Yates’ right pocket.

           William tosses Yates’ gun twenty feet away.

                                                    FORWARD CUT TO:
           INT. ABANDONED DEPOSITORY -- MOMENTS LATER

           Yates is being pushed aside as the EMS Workers arrive on the
           scene.  Everything shifts into slow motion as swarms of
           POLICEMEN and CITY WORKERS gradually fill up the floor.

           William, dead to he world, is being lifted onto a cot and
           covered with a blanket.  As time dissolves on, and the scene
           becomes more convoluted with PHOTOGRAPHERS, POLICE, and
           FORENSICS, Yates slowly gets pushed into the background,
           nodding to his COLLEAGUES questions.

           Everything becomes a blur as Yates watches William being
           carried down the stairs on the cot.

           EXT. CROWDED STREET -- MOMENTS LATER

           William is being loaded into the ambulance.  POLICE are
           everywhere.  Scattered CITIZENS wonder what’s going on.  The
           ambulance doors SHUT.

           INT. AMBULANCE -- CONTINUOUS

           Four (fake) EMS WORKERS clamor to resurrect William as the
           ENGINE turns on and they speed away from the scene.  They
           tear off his shirt and pants.  Underneath his shirt is a thin
           bullet-proof vest and multiple blown blood-bags.  The pouches
           of blood have left an ugly mess.

           One of the Workers clears away the bags while another one
           uses a tiny vacuum to suck away the gases around William’s
           face.  As the vacuum HUMS, slight gas particles can be seen
           swirling around William’s head.

           Once the blood bags are cleared and the vest is torn off, one
           of the Workers injects a sedative into William’s arm before
           taking some tweezers to dig out the bullet engraved in his
           bicep.  He digs inside the bullet hole, carefully pinches the
           bullet, and slowly removes it.

           A large tube is shoved deep down into Williams throat.  After
           they lodge it in William’s seemingly dead body, a blue liquid
           is pumped inside him, causing him to CHOKE back to life.  His
           eyes bulge out as he GASPS for air, not fully conscious of
           his whereabouts.

           As the Workers remove the tube, William starts shaking and
           trembling.  One of them takes a damp wash-cloth and pats down
           William’s forehead.  The Monitor shows his heart-rate
           beginning to return to normal.  He closes his eyes almost as
           quickly as they opened, calming down.

           After a few seconds, he drifts into a deep sleep...

                                                         FLASHBACK:
           INT. LARGE AUDITORIUM -- DAY

           William, standing on a podium, is presenting a slide show on
           modern medicine.  There are over a thousand DOCTORS in
           attendance.

                                 WILLIAM
                        This is the best visual evidence
                        yet for ‘immortal DNA’.  When the
                        stem cell divides into two daughter
                        cells, only the specialized cell
                        inherits the imperfect copied DNA.
                        The other one retains the original
                        “immortal” DNA strand...

           INT. AUDITORIUM CORRIDOR -- LATER

           William exits the auditorium to find Jack Boyle waiting for
           him in the lobby.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Jack?  What are you doing here?

           They shake hands.

                                 JACK BOYLE
                        I heard you’d be in Paris.  I’ve
                        got a field program here on the
                        other side of town.

                                 WILLIAM
                        It’s great to see you.  Where are
                        you staying?

                                 JACK BOYLE
                        You know you should teach a class
                        up at Wexford.  Just one night a
                        week.  We could use a someone like
                        you.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I don’t know, Jack.  I’m really not
                        very good with kids.

                                 JACK BOYLE
                        Well, the offer’s there if-

           Suddenly, they’re interrupted by  a french CONCIERGE, 50’s,
           and his ASSISTANT, 40’s.

                                 CONCIERGE
                        Monsieur?

           The Concierge seems troubled.

                                 CONCIERGE (CONT’D)
                        There’s been... an accident.
           INT. POLICE STATION -- NIGHT

           William is being briefed on Deirdre’s death.

                                 POLICEMAN
                        Your wife was with her parents
                        driving north on the FDR.  They
                        were... apparently sideswiped by a
                        delivery truck.  The collision
                        forced them over the railing into
                        the East River.

           William stares off into nothing -- almost comatose.

                                 POLICEMAN (CONT’D)
                        Her parents may have been killed on
                        impact.  But there’s a chance your
                        wife was still alive when she went
                        under the water... and couldn’t get
                        out of the car.  Her death will be
                        described as a drowning.  I’m
                        sorry.

           William’s life, as he knows it, is over...

                                                           BLACKOUT

           The back doors of an ambulance open, letting in a blinding
           light...

           INT. LARGE LOADING DOCK / WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT

           William (present day) is rolled out of the ambulance, still
           unconscious.  DOCTORS and MASKED HELPERS guide him down a
           ramp.

           More ambulances are lined up around the one where William
           came from.  Each one has unconscious BODIES on gurney’s being
           wheeled out.  Separate EMS WORKERS and Helpers guide all of
           the gurneys down the same ramp towards the submarine.

           Each of the multiple bodies is carefully loaded onto a wide
           platform.  A large aircraft is located on the far side of the
           Hangar.  Hundreds of Karma Coalition OFFICIALS are lined in
           offices surrounding the plane.  All of them busily completing
           their assigned tasks.

           PILOTS and OFFICERS are YELLING out to each other technical
           language about the exterior of the plane, in order to get it
           up and running within the next few minutes.

           A MAN WITH A CLIPBOARD, 40’s, checks each body as it is
           loaded into the plane, making sure they have a pulse and
           writing down their names.  When William’s gurney is wheeled
           up to him, he lifts the thin blanket and checks off his
           clipboard.

                                                        (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 EMS WORKER
                        William Thomas Craft.

                                 MAN WITH CLIPBOARD
                        Time of death?

                                 EMS WORKER
                        9:37pm.

           The Man with a clipboard waves them through.

           William is loaded on to the plane, still in a deep sleep.

           The Salesman observes from above -- making sure William is
           loaded on safely and signed off.  Other SALESMEN, with name
           tags that read ‘Salesman’, stand near him, observing each of
           their own commissions.  Most of their expressions are blank.

           INT. YATES’ OFFICE -- NIGHT

           Yates, John Deels, Vanessa and LT BERNARD, 40’s, jolly-
           looking, are all sitting around the mini-cd recorder, playing
           it back.  As the recorder PLAYS in the background, Yates
           stares out the window while his colleagues chat about the
           recording.

                                 BERNARD
                        He presses ‘record’ right before
                        the conversation.

                                 JOHN DEELS
                        Right before the conversation he
                        started.

                                 BERNARD
                         (eating a donut)
                        Either way, he’s self-editing.  Why
                        not start recording a few minutes
                        earlier, when he enters the
                        building?

                                 VANESSA
                        He’s frantic.

                                 BERNARD
                        He’s particular.

           The CD repeats itself from the top.

                                 JOHN DEELS
                        He cues the CD, dominates the
                        conversation, forces the
                        dialogue...

           CONTINUED:

                                 VANESSA
                        But it’s against character.  He’s
                        normally laid back.

                                 RECORDER
                        W: I remember the title of my first
                        essay.  Steganography...

                                 BERNARD
                        What is that?  Steganography?

                                 JOHN DEELS
                        It’s a simpleton code.  First
                        letter of each word, last letter of
                        each word...

                                 BERNARD
                        That’s too specific.  Like
                        Steganology.

                                 JOHN DEELS
                        Steganology?  You’re making that
                        up.

                                 BERNARD
                        It’s in the dictionary.

                                 JOHN DEELS
                        Bullshit.

           Yates’ interest is perked.  He gets up and STOPS the
           recorder.

                                 YATES
                        He minored in linguistics, codes.

                                 JOHN DEELS
                         (to Yates)
                        Steganography is for the written
                        word.  Even if he did hide a code,
                        it most likely would’ve been inside
                        the folder he handed to you while
                        this exact conversation took place.
                        And as we all know, that folder is,
                        um... gone.

           Yates grabs a notepad and pen and hands it to Deels.

                                 YATES
                        Maybe he dictated it.

                                 JOHN DEELS
                        Maybe you’re giving him too much
                        credit.

                                 YATES
                        Why would he record the
                        conversation?  Because something he
                        said is important.

                        Now, what’s the most common
                        interpretation of Steganography?

                                 JOHN DEELS
                        First letter of each word, I guess.

                        essay.  Steganography...

           Yates STOPS the recorder while Deels writes it out.

                        What is that?  Latin?

                                 JOHN DEELS
                        No, it’s not Latin, you fucking
                        moron.  It’s nonsense.

           Yates PLAYS the recorder.

                                 YATES
                        Keep going.

           Yates STOPS it again.  Deels writes.

                                 JOHN DEELS

                        Let me see that.

           Vanessa takes the notepad from Deels, and sure enough, the
           first letter of each word spells out an acronym.  Deels takes
           it back to continue.

           Yates presses PLAY.

           Yates STOPS the tape, while Deels finishes off the decoding.

                        Bring.  Me.  Bacc... home.

           Dead silence in the room.  Deels looks down at what he wrote
           in complete shock.

           Yates immediately gets on the phone.  DIALS.

           BINOCULARS POV:  Someone is spying on Yates’ office from
           across the street -- watching him get on the phone.

                                 YATES

           Yates hangs up.  Goes pale.  Takes the digital compass out of
           his pocket.  Examines it.

                                 BERNARD
                        What’s the Karma Coalition?

                        It’s a myth.  Urban legend.

                                 JOHN DEELS
                        What if it’s not?  According to
                        this CD, William Craft is alive and
                        well, out there somewhere, on an
                        island or wherever they hide these
                        people.  That would explain how
                        Donovan knew about those deaths.

           Yates walks over, opens the recorder, and snaps the CD in
           half.

                                 YATES
                        If it’s true, there are only two
                        types of people on earth who know
                        about the Karma Coalition.  The
                        people faking their deaths, and the
                        people who take them to the island.
                        No one in this room fits either of
                        those descriptions.

                                 YATES
                        That’s exactly what I’m-

           Suddenly, two GUNSHOTS SHATTER the window and go straight
           through the back of John Deel’s head.  Blood splatters
           quickly as his face drops down onto the recorder.  Dead.

                                 YATES (CONT’D)

           A barrage of BULLETS come SMASHING through the walls and
           windows into the room.  Bernard gets nailed multiple times
           while trying to dive down to the floor.  He continues to get
           filled with bullets once he’s lying on the ground.

           Yates gets hit in his side as he ducks behind the divider.
           He takes out his gun and shoves a cartridge inside it.

           Vanessa is under the window, taking out her gun as well.

                                 YATES (CONT’D)
                        You all right?!

           Vanessa nods.

           Yates FIRES off some rounds back out towards the roof of the
           building across the street.  He shoots blindly.

           Three OFFICERS barge into the room to help out.  All three of
           them are shot through the head and heart upon entry.  They
           fall quickly.

           Vanessa FIRES off a few shots, but it’s hopeless.  They have
           no idea where the snipers are.

                                 YATES (CONT’D)
                        We need to get out of here on the
                        count of three!  READY?

           Vanessa nods again.

                                 YATES (CONT’D)
                        One... two...  THREE!

           They both make a run for the door, but Vanessa gets shot
           twice shielding Yates as he makes it out into the hallway.

                                 YATES (CONT’D)
                        VANESSA!!

           EXT. YATES OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

           A SWAT team immediately enters the precinct offices and pulls
           Vanessa out of the doorway while taking Yates safely out of
           harms way.

           Yates rushes to Vanessa.

                                 YATES
                        Vanessa?  Vanessa?!

           She’s still barely alive.

                                 YATES (CONT’D)
                        Hold on, dear.  Hold on.  You’re
                        going to be okay.  You’ll be okay.

           Vanessa’s mouth TREMBLES, trying to force out some words.
           But nothing.

           The SWAT MEN try to pull Yates away from the doorway while
           other SWAT MEMBERS get on their CBs and discuss the sniper’s
           possible location.  He shoves them away, staying with
           Vanessa.

           Tears develop in Yates eyes as he holds Vanessa in his arms.

                                 YATES (CONT’D)
                        Don’t leave me.  Don’t leave me...
                        please.

           The PARAMEDICS rush in to try and revive her, amidst the
           CHAOS -- SHOTS still RINGING OUT throughout the precinct.

           Her eyes go blank.

           Everything turns into a blur for Yates as the Paramedics try
           to revive her with a CARDIAC PUMP.  But she never wakes up...
           gone.

           Yates sits with his head in his hands up against the wall,
           watching Vanessa leave him forever.

                                                     FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. REHABILITATION FACILITY -- NIGHT

           A room lined with bunk beds of new Karma Coalition CLIENTS.
           All of them sound asleep in this dark room.  Two GUARDS
           quietly monitor the inhabitants.

           William’s eyes slowly open.  Before he can look around, a
           flashlight shines in his face.

           INT. REGISTRATION ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           A tiny office inside the facility.

           William, in a comfortable robe, sits across from the
           REGISTRAR, 40’s, classically handsome.  The Registrar, on an
           odd-looking computer, types down information into William’s
           file.

                        I had trouble walking here from my
                        bed.  It was like I had to re-train
                        myself to move my legs.

                        That’s a common reaction to
                        Chlonepcine.  Everyone loses their
                        sense of balance temporarily.

                                 WILLIAM
                         (beat)
                        Maybe try ‘Bennett’?

           The Registrar kindly continues scanning the list of Parista
           inhabitants.

                                 REGISTRAR
                        Ahhhh.  There was a Deirdre Bennett
                        here, but she changed her last name
                        to James.  Recently, as a matter of
                        fact.

                                 WILLIAM
                        No... that’s not possible.

                                 REGISTRAR
                        I’m afraid so, Mr. Craft.  She was
                        married to a Timothy Gordon James
                        almost six weeks ago.

           William is completely shocked.

                                 REGISTRAR (CONT’D)
                        I’m just telling what’s in the
                        system.

           William gets out of his chair and grabs the Registrar by the
           collar.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Are you kidding me?!  Are you
                        fucking kidding me?!  Check it
                        again!

                                 REGISTRAR
                        Sir, your wife has been re-married.
                        There’s nothing I can do about it!

           Two SECURITY GUARDS rush in and take William off the
           Registrar.  William tries FIGHTING them off, but they hold
           him back.

                                 REGISTRAR (CONT’D)
                         (regaining his breath)
                        Things happen, Mr. Craft.  Life
                        goes on.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I want to be brought to where she
                        lives the second we arrive.

                                 REGISTRAR
                        Mr. Craft... we’ve already
                        arrived...

           The Registrar pushes a button, opening the electric powered
           blinds.

           CONTINUED: (3)

           As they open, the vastness of Parista is unveiled --
           skyscrapers, monorail trains, spaghetti highways, rivers
           going in between some buildings.  It looks like a hybrid of
           Tokyo and Venice.

           William takes in the breadth of the City.  As the Security
           guards let him go, he slowly walks towards the window, taking
           it all in.

           There are neon signs and advertisements for products he’s
           never heard of -- Official Cola, Government Detergent, All-in-
           one Fast Food Hut.  All of the signs are written in multiple
           languages.

           - PEDESTRIANS everywhere, with electric cars and mopeds.
           Every car that has ever been released by any country are
           here.

           - The architecture is also eclectic, from 1950’s neo-modern
           to conventional to modern to futuristic.

                        When we send you downstairs, you
                        will be assigned a Welcome Captain.
                        They will provide you with all the
                        information you’ll need to know
                        about Parista.  I trust you’ll show
                        them a little more respect than
                        you’ve shown me.

           EXT. BUS STOP -- NIGHT

           A bus pulls up and starts letting a handful of people on.

           INT. BUS -- CONTINUOUS

           One of the people who gets on the bus is Yates, slightly
           disguised with sunglasses and baseball cap.  He sits down in
           his seat, looking around, making sure he’s not being watching
           by the other COMMUTERS.

           He cringes in pain and opens his trench coat a little,
           revealing a bullet wound in his lower abdomen.  He’s in great
           pain.

           INT. SMALL DOCTOR’S OFFICE -- LATE NIGHT

           A SURGEON, 60’s, is pulling the bullet out of Yates while he
           lays on an operating table.  Yates GROANS in pain.

           The Surgeon takes the bullet out with tweezers and takes a
           quick look at it.

                                 SURGEON
                        Cop-killer bullet.  Surprising it
                        didn’t go right through you.
                        Must’ve been a ricochet.

           CONTINUED:

           Yates grabs a bottle of whiskey and chugs it.  The Surgeon
           begins stitching Yates up.

                                 SURGEON (CONT’D)
                        This stitch is just temporary, you
                        understand.  You still have
                        internal bleeding that I can’t stop
                        without someone assisting me.

                                 YATES
                        You can’t... tell anyone you’ve
                        seen me.

                                 SURGEON
                        Where are you going to go?

                                 YATES
                         (beat)
                        Parista.

                                 SURGEON
                        Where’s that?

           Yates forces up a small LAUGH.

                                 SURGEON (CONT’D)
                        I have to tell you, Yates, you only
                        have a few days, maximum.  If you
                        don’t get professional surgery
                        soon, you’ll die.

           Yates nods.

           INT. BAGGAGE CLAIM

           Much like an airport baggage claim, only there are numerous
           MASKED GUARDS prominently securing the premises

           The Karma Coalition CLIENTS, including William, grab their
           personal luggage and head towards the exit.

           INT. CUSTOMS HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

           As the Clients form a line to enter Parista, they must show
           specified badges to the CHECKERS.  William, carrying a
           suitcase, shows the Checker his badge.  They allow him to
           enter.

           A large sign above the Parista entrance reads:
         No expansion workers beyond this point.
           INT. WELCOME LOBBY

           A large Dome, with multiple facets of media hovering above
           the ticket offices and shops -- television stations William’s
           never seen before.  Brand new TV shows, News programs, Comedy
           specials -- all exclusive to Parista.

           A TOUR GUIDE and two TRANSLATORS welcome them as they enter.

                                 TOUR GUIDE
                        Hello everyone and welcome to
                        Parista.  You are in the main city
                        of Parista, called Bahoe.  It’s
                        considered sort of the ‘Capital’.

           The Translators for this particular group SPEAK German and
           Swedish and relay everything the Tour Guide says.

           Two AIDES start passing out some side bags to William and the
           other new CITIZENS.

                                 TOUR GUIDE (CONT’D)
                        The bags my assistants are handing
                        you are filled with pamphlets and
                        maps of Parista, as well as your
                        commerce.  The denominations are
                        tens, twenties and fifties and
                        should last you a few weeks while
                        you get situated.  The Monarchy
                        will provide you with allowances on
                        the first of each month...

           EXT. CAR STATION -- DAY

           It’s a sunny day in Parista.

           Hundreds of cars are waiting at the station for incoming
           citizens, very much like the hub at JFK.  The car models
           range from British to Mexican to American and beyond,
           including models dated back to the 1950’s.

           COURTNEY, 20’s, female, reaches out to shakes William’s hand.
           She’s dressed in a suit and has a clipboard with her.

                                 COURTNEY
                        William?  I’m Courtney, your
                        Welcome Captain.

           William shakes her hand, looking at a beautiful red ‘67
           Mustang.

                                 COURTNEY (CONT’D)
                        You like it?

                                 WILLIAM
                        My favorite car...

                                                        (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 COURTNEY
                        Well, it’s yours.

           Courtney tosses him the keys and heads to the check-out
           window.

           While Courtney signs out the car, William gets into the
           Mustang -- white leather interior, power windows, V-6 engine,
           etc.

           But more importantly... a GPS system.  William turns on the
           GPS and types in:  Deirdre... James

           The address comes up:  1405 Brothers Road, Moshiba

           William PEELS out of the parking space and SPEEDS up the
           ramp.

           Courtney CALLS after him.

                                 COURTNEY (CONT’D)
                        HEY!!

           EXT. WELCOME STATION -- CONTINUOUS

           PEDESTRIANS leap out of William’s way as he DRIVES down the
           street, throwing caution to the wind.

                                 GPS SYSTEM
                        Turn left at the next light.

           William turns left and drives underneath the monorail hub.

           A spaghetti of overhead trains shoot out of the hub in
           several directions at speeds of over 100 miles per hour.
           ZOOMING sounds from departing monorails can be heard
           constantly.

           William SHIFTS the Mustang at full throttle, heading straight
           to Deirdre’s.

           INT. RODEO BAR -- NIGHT

           Yates sits across from ROLEN, 40, handle-bar mustache,
           trucker hat.  Rolen eats his barbecue sloppily while Yates
           places the digital compass in front of him.

                                 YATES
                        The coordinates on this compass are
                        encoded.  I need you to decipher
                        it.  Find out the location.

                                 ROLEN
                         (looking it over)
                        And what’s at the other end of this
                        rainbow?

                                                        (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 YATES
                        I can’t tell you.

                                 ROLEN
                        Word is, you’re off the books,
                        Yates.

                                 YATES
                        It’s not like that.

                                 ROLEN
                        Then what’s it like?

           Yates places a block-shaped paper bag on the table next to
           the compass.  Rolen opens the bag -- a wad of hundreds.

           Rolen wipes his mouth with a napkin and looks at Yates long
           and hard.  Finally, he stands up and grabs the compass and
           the money.

                                 ROLEN (CONT'D)
                        Two days.

           Rolen leaves Yates with the check.

           EXT. SMALL NEIGHBORHOOD -- LATER

           William DRIVES through a quaint little villa-esque
           neighborhood, following the GPS.  The region is wooded and
           feels comfortable.  The houses are conventional with brick,
           wood and stone exteriors.

           FIFTIES MUSIC lightly plays out of a distant loudspeaker.
           It’s probably been on for most of the day.

           William pulls up to a mailbox.  It Reads:  JAMES

           Just as he contemplates pulling in to Deirdre's driveway, the
           garage door opens -- a Buick pulls out of the driveway with
           two PASSENGERS.

           When they pull out of the driveway, William sees that Deirdre
           is in the passenger seat, doing her make-up.  She looks up
           just as they pass William by.

           William and Deirdre’s eyes meet for a split second.

           INT. BUICK -- CONTINUOUS

           Deirdre looks like she’s been struck by lightning.  Her
           husband, TIMOTHY, 40, average looking, is driving.

                                 TIMOTHY
                        Something wrong?

                                                        (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 DEIRDRE
                        No, I uh... thought I forgot
                        something.  But I found it.

           INT. MUSTANG -- MOMENTS LATER

           William is following them from a safe distance back.  He
           turns right when they turn right.  He turns left when they
           turn left.

           EXT. INDIAN RESTAURANT -- MOMENTS LATER

           William follows them to a fancy restaurant.  He parks and
           watches Deirdre and Timothy get out of their car.  He adjusts
           his rear view mirror to get a better look as they enter the
           restaurant.

           INT. INDIAN RESTAURANT / LOBBY -- MOMENTS LATER

           Deirdre and Timothy are approaching the HOST about their
           table when William enters the restaurant.  He walks right up
           to Deirdre.

           When she turns around, her heart sinks.

                                 DEIRDRE
                        William?

           Timothy turns around as well.  He sees Deirdre and William
           staring at each other.  Eyes locked.

                                 TIMOTHY
                        Hello?

           Deirdre snaps out of it, sort of.

                                 DEIRDRE
                        Oh, umm.  This is... William.  I
                        ahh, knew him in New York.

                                 TIMOTHY
                        Hi, William.
                         (shaking his hand)
                        You here to meet with someone?

                                 WILLIAM
                        Well, I was supposed to.  But it
                        looks as though I’ve been stood up.

                                 TIMOTHY
                        Oh, I’m sorry.

                                 WILLIAM
                        No, it’s nothing.  I suppose I’m
                        the one who’s late.

                        I guess I just thought this person
                        would wait for me.

                                 DEIRDRE
                        Well, maybe she didn’t know you
                        were going to be here.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Maybe.

           Timothy seems confused by their conversation.  Finally:

                                 TIMOTHY
                        Well would you like to join us?
                        The food is excellent.

           Deirdre seems very uncomfortable.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Okay, sure.  I’ll stay for a few
                        minutes.

           INT. DINING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           William enters the dining area with Timothy and Deirdre.
           More FIFTIES MUSIC sweeping through the venue.

           And there... sitting at their table, are Deirdre’s parents,
           George Bennett and his wife, LINDA, 60’s.

           George rises, completely surprised.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Hey, George.

                                 GEORGE
                         (practically speechless)
                        William...

           The tension is thick.  Everyone sits down and there’s an
           awkward silence for a moment.  Timothy is unaware of the
           history here.

                                 TIMOTHY
                        So, William.  How did you know
                        Deirdre back in New York?

                                 WILLIAM
                        Well, Timothy.  She was my wife.

                                 TIMOTHY
                        Oh...

           The WAITER starts handing out menus to the table.

                                 GEORGE
                        Tell us, William.  Why, exactly,
                        are you in Parista?

                                 WILLIAM
                         (looking at the menu)
                        Well, you see, George.  It seems to
                        me that there are only two types of
                        people who live in Parista.  People
                        who are chosen... and people who
                        are hiding.  I was chosen.  Which
                        one are you?

                                 GEORGE
                        Unfortunately, the complexities of
                        my decisions don’t quite fit into
                        your black and white bullshit
                        theorem.  Maybe you’re the third
                        type of Parista resident -- the
                        type that pays, and pays well.

                                 DEIRDRE
                        Dad-

                                 WILLIAM
                        Or maybe I’m on a scholarship.

                                 GEORGE
                        And what kind of scholarship would
                        that be?

                                 WILLIAM
                        The George Bennett scholarship
                        fund.  Remember George?  You gave
                        me a large check to not marry your
                        daughter. Maybe I decided to cash
                        it in and come on down here to eat
                        some dinner with ‘the fam’.

           Timothy is completely confused.

                                 GEORGE
                        You snobby little shit.

                                 WILLIAM
                        You always had a way with words,
                        George.

           The ‘check’ is news to Deirdre.

                                 DEIRDRE
                        Is that true, dad?

                                 GEORGE
                        There are some negotiations, that
                        you wouldn’t understand, Deirdre.

                                 WILLIAM
                         (standing up)
                        No, I think she understands,
                        George.  She just figured it out
                        too late, is all.  You smothered
                        her through school, through
                        college, through life.

                        You bullied her into being what you
                        wanted her to be.  And finally, you
                        took her life away, forcing her to
                        join you here in this isolated
                        hellhole, because you couldn’t hack
                        it in the real world.  Forcing her
                        to dedicate her life to your
                        miserable ego.  And she’s paid in
                        spades.

           William wipes his mouth, preparing to leave.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT’D)
                        Know this.  I’m going to find a way
                        out of here, and when I do, I’m
                        taking your daughter with me.  No
                        offense, Timothy.  And all you’ll
                        have left, George, is an empty
                        soul, devoid of any sense of pride
                        or dignity.  Failed your job,
                        failed your family.  Doesn’t seem
                        too complex to me.

           William turns to leave.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT’D)
                         (to Deirdre)

           EXT. TRUCK STOP -- DAY

           Yates walks past a row of Semi’s.  When he gets to the fifth
           one, he KNOCKS on the back door three times only.  After a
           moment, the door opens.  It’s Rolen.

           INT. ROLEN’S TRUCK -- CONTINUOUS

           Computers, gadgets, digital maps and all sorts of technical
           equipment fill the truck.  It’s sort of a den.

           Yates sits down next to Rolen at the computer.

                        You think this compass belongs to

                        possible Coalition connections for
                        five years and we’ve never received
                        physical evidence before.

                        extracted it, he could’ve.

                        Well, I’m not buying it.  The
                        alleged destination is supposed to
                        be an island utopia.

                        Maybe you should leave this one
                        alone.

                        Due to the nature of this mission,
                        and the fact that I don’t think it
                        leads anywhere, I’m gonna have to

                        Excuse me if I don’t exactly trust

                        The people looking for me would pay

           INT. BAR TAVERN -- NIGHT

           William enters a packed club.  A JAZZ band is playing on
           stage.  There is a joyous vibe to the place, filled with
           smiles and drunken conversations.

           As William is taken to his booth, Archbishop Ferucci and some
           ASSOCIATES are dining at a nearby table.

           When he sits down, a nearby flat screen TV is broadcasting a
           news flash with a picture of an OLDER WOMAN on the screen.

                                 TV ANCHOR
                        Marilyn Monroe died earlier this

                        sorely missed.  She was eighty-two
                        years old...

           The WAITRESS approaches him.

           As the Waitress walks off, a JOLLY POSTAL WORKER, 50’s,
           slightly drunk, spots William from the bar and comes over to
           his table.

           INT. LAILA’S ICE CREAM SHOP -- DUSK

           DEAN, 40, large chops, beard, sunglasses, Harley Davidson-
           type, purchases his chocolate ice cream cone at the cash
           Register.  The CLERK, 25, hands him his change as Dean tastes
           the ice cream.

                        Thank you.

           EXT. LAILA’S ICE CREAM SHOP -- CONTINUOUS

           A street surrounded by desert, like a ghost town.

           From a rooftop across the street:

           LENS POV:  Dean leaves the shop with his ice cream cone.

           Rolen lowers his binoculars.  He’s with three MEMBERS of his
           crew.  They all look like ex-convicts.  He looks across the
           way to two other rooftops -- more of his CREW scattered all
           over the place.

           INT. MOTEL HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

           Dean walks up to room 402.  KNOCKS.  The door opens.

           When he enters, over twelve more BIKER TYPES are staked out
           inside the room.  But unlike normal bikers, these guys are on
           computers with long lens cameras dispersed out the windows.
           They’re clearly a smart group -- still setting up shop.

           Dean tosses the ice cream cone in the garbage and opens up a
           blueprint with BARMES and Yates.  He points to the blueprint
           of the ice cream shop interior.

                                 DEAN
                        Three employees.  Two new counters.
                        Two doors behind the cashier.

                                 BARMES
                        How many ice cream flavors?

                                 DEAN
                        Fuck you.

                                 YATES
                        There’s only one door in the
                        blueprint.

           Rolen enters the room and looks on with them.

                                 DEAN
                        This second door is locked with a
                        scan lock.

                                 ROLEN
                        Shouldn’t be too hard.

                                 DEAN
                        It’s what’s behind the door that’s
                        the problem.

           EXT. BACK ALLEY -- NIGHT

           The rain is pouring down as Cossy and a HOOKER exit through
           the back door of a bar, LAUGHING and drinking.

           Cossy tries to take off her top, but she pushes him away,
           teasing him.

                                 COSSY
                        Take off your clothes.

           The Hooker GIGGLES, playfully pushing his hands off her.

           Cossy SLAPS her, hard.

                                 HOOKER
                        What the fuck?

                                 COSSY
                        Take off your clothes.

                                 HOOKER
                        No!

           Cossy slaps her again, harder, causing her to fall to the
           ground.  He continues to PUNCH her and HIT her while she’s on
           the ground.

           After a moment, a knife slides up from behind him and pushes
           up against his neck.  The knife belongs to the Salesman.

           The Hooker sees that she has a chance to make a break for it
           and runs away down the alley, as fast as she can.

           Cossy turns towards the Salesman, smiling.

                                 COSSY
                        What the fuck do you want?

                                 SALESMAN
                        Because of you, there’s a man out
                        on there on the loose, who’s not
                        only aware of our organization, but
                        has the resources to give us a lot
                        of problems.

                                                        (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 COSSY
                        I’ll take care of it, Salesman.
                        Now get off my fucking neck.

                                 SALESMAN
                        Why do you disappoint me, Coss?

                                 COSSY
                        I told you, I don’t like salesmen
                        in my district.

                                 SALESMAN
                        And I told you...

           The Salesman STABS Cossy in the side of his neck.  Cossy
           starts sliding down the wall, losing life.  As blood sprays
           out of his neck and his eyes bulge out in pain, the salesman
           stands over him.

                                 SALESMAN (CONT’D)
                        ...you’re expendable.

           A large van pulls up and opens it’s back doors.  Two MEN IN
           SUITS get out and load Cossy into the Van.  The Salesman gets
           in the van and closes the doors as it pulls away.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM -- LATE NIGHT

           Yates is sitting up on the bed, watching the Late Night News.
           He sees footage of his Precinct, shot to pieces.

                        violent attack of gunfire at New
                        York City’s 41st Precinct and still
                        no evidence of who was behind it.

           Footage of a COP appears, being interviewed.

                        are going to be found and they’re
                        going to be prosecuted to the
                        fullest extent of the law.  You
                        don’t kill three Police Officers

           Yates shakes his head.

           Rolen walks in to the room.

                                 ROLEN
                        You should see this.

           INT. ROOM 402 -- DUSK

           Rolen and Dean are showing Yates photographs of the exterior
           of the Ice Cream Shop they’ve taken over the past couple
           days.  Rolen lays out three specific snapshots of three
           different MEN, dressed in suits.

                                 ROLEN
                        These three guys came in at
                        separate times yesterday and the
                        day before.  They’re wearing suits
                        in ninety degree weather.

                                 DEAN
                        And they ain’t ordering ice cream.

                                 YATES
                        It’s not a crime to wear a suit in
                        hot weather.

                                 DEAN
                        We think they’re salesmen.  They
                        sell people on the idea of escaping
                        from the world, get they’re money,
                        and then report to this hub.  They
                        go in there with briefcases, and
                        they come out empty-handed.

           Rolen takes out another photograph of the Salesman, horn-
           rimmed glasses and all, walking into the shop.

                                 ROLEN
                        Then there’s this guy, who went in
                        there without a briefcase just
                        before sunrise this morning.

                                 YATES
                        And?

                                 ROLEN
                        And he hasn’t come out yet.

                                 DEAN
                        It’s been ten hours and he’s
                        nowhere to be found.

           Yates takes a closer look at the photograph.  He has a
           feeling that he’s seen this particular Salesman before.

                                 YATES
                        How long before we can go in?

                                 ROLEN
                        We can go in right now.
           INT. LAILA’S ICE CREAM SHOP -- MOMENTS LATER

           “Strangers in the night” is playing over the shop speakers.

           Yates and Rolen wander in, pretending to be browsing the
           different ice cream flavors.

           The CASHIER, 24, and the Clerk eye them suspiciously almost
           upon entry.  The Cashier quietly pushes a red button behind
           the counter, aware of potential trouble.

           The Clerk spots a gun in the back of Rolen’s pants and feels
           for a shotgun of his own, attached underneath the counter.

           Yates approaches the Cashier.

                                 YATES
                        How late are you open?

           BANG!  The Clerk gets off a shot on Rolen, hitting him in the
           arm.  Rolen immediately retaliates with his gun.  Three SHOTS
           fired back.  BAM!  BAM!  BAM!

           The Clerk flies back against the wall, dead.

           Yates pulls his firearm on the Cashier, making sure he
           doesn’t move.  The Cashier calmly raises his hands.

           Rolen, holding his arm in pain, comes around the counter and
           quickly tapes the Cashier’s mouth shut -- binds his hands
           together.

           Dean and three CREW MEMBERS come through the front door with
           gadgets and machinery.  Dean goes to the back door and clamps
           an electronic device on the scan lock, attempting to unlock
           it.

           Two of the Crew bring in a large drill and wheel it towards
           the back.  The third Member sprays black paint on all the
           security cameras.

           Rolen spots the blinking red light under the counter.

           EXT. LAILA’S ICE CREAM SHOP -- DUSK

           In the distance... fifteen cars come into view heading
           towards the shop.  As they get closer, artillery can be seen
           on some of the exteriors.

           Dean is close to cracking the lock.

           The Walkie-talkie BUZZES.

                        Fifteen SUV’s coming in fast.
                        Repeat, fifteen armed vehicles
                        approaching in thirty seconds.

                                 ROLEN
                        Lock it down!

           The Crew Members SHUT the front door and start bringing down
           the steel gate.  The gate is stuck, and Yates comes over to
           help.

           Dean cracks the back door lock code and KICKS it open.

           As the Members get the gate down half way, GUNFIRE comes
           through from outside.  The RAPID FIRE kills two of the
           members instantly as Yates dives behind the counter.

           EXT. LAILA’S ICE CREAM SHOP -- CONTINUOUS

           Over fifty MEN IN SUITS evacuate their vehicles with guns and
           ammo, SHOOTING at the ice cream shop gate as it slowly closes
           on them.

           Ten CREW MEMBERS from room 402 and twenty more from
           surrounding rooftops start SHOOTING at the Men in Suits from
           up above.  The Men in Suits SHOOT back, as well as other
           Coalition REPRESENTATIVES with bullet proof jackets and
           Bazooka’s.

           The street becomes a chaotic battleground, with Rolen’s Crew
           SPRAYING BULLETS across the length of the street.

           One CREW MEMBER tosses a grenade out the window, BLOWING
           twenty Men in Suits to bits.

           INT. LAILA’S ICE CREAM SHOP -- CONTINUOUS

           As Dean moves into the back room, GUNFIRE can be heard
           outside the front gate -- bullets RICOCHETING off the steel
           and constant BANGING to get it open.

           INT. BACK ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Yates, Rolen, Dean and the surviving Crew Member enter the
           room, wheeling in the drill and some hefty electronic
           equipment.

           Everyone puts on goggles and vests for security.

           A large vault awaits them.  The drill contains an electronic

           lock.

           EXT. LAILA’S ICE CREAM SHOP -- CONTINUOUS

           A BULLET-PROOF VESTED MAN sets up his bazooka during the
           chaos and FIRES a MISSILE towards room 402.

                                 CREW MEMBER
                        GET DOWN-

           BLAM!!! Half the side of the hotel is obliterated.  Surviving
           Crew Members escape the room and head down the stairs, where
           the Men in Suits have infiltrated.  More GUNFIRE.

           EXT. LAILA’S ICE CREAM SHOP -- NIGHT

           The war in the street continues with Missile launchers and
           grenade BOMBINGS, while some Men in Suits slowly break open
           the ice cream shop gate.  It starts to get lifted, gradually.

           INT. BACK ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           The vault BREAKS open.  Yates, Rolen and Dean pull open the
           vault to get a look inside...

           It’s an elevator -- looks normal with an up and down button.

           The gate has been opened up front and they can HEAR the Men
           in suits coming in.

                                 DEAN
                        I’ll stay behind.  You guys get in
                        there!

           Yates, Rolen and the Crew Member quickly press the ‘close
           doors’ button.  As the doors close, the Men in suits enter
           the back room SHOOTING.

           Dean retaliates with an UZI, getting SHOT to death as he
           sprays bullets at anyone who enters.

                                 DEAN (CONT’D)
                        AAAAAAAAAAAAHH!!!  MOTHER
                        FUCKERS!!!!!

           INT. ELEVATOR -- CONTINUOUS

           There are -94 floors.  Before Yates can press one, the
           elevator starts going down by itself.

           CONTINUED:

           There’s a glass wall to the elevator, exposing each floor as
           they swiftly go past them.  Every floor seems to be wide and
           vast, with odd cubes spread throughout.

           The elevator continues to go down...

           And down...

           And down...

           Until finally, they get to the -94th floor, deep inside the
           bowels of earth.

                        Floor negative ninety four.  Have a
                        nice day.

           When the elevator doors open into a dark foyer, they all get
           out.  It’s dead silent.

                                 ROLEN
                        What the fuck is this place?

                                 SALESMAN (O.S.)
                        It’s home.

           The lights come up, revealing thirty Men in Suits,
           surrounding Yates, Rolen and the Crew Member.  They all have
           a gun pointed at them.

           Rolen and the Crew Member are immediately SHOT in the head,
           DROPPING to the floor.  Quick execution.

           Yates is the last one left.  He has thirty guns pointed at
           his head.  He slowly takes his gun out and drops it on the
           floor as the Salesman approaches him, face to face.

           Yates lifts his hands to surrender.

                                 YATES
                        I don’t mind dying.  I just want to
                        know.

           The Salesman calmly lights a cigarette.  Then, after looking
           over Yates for a moment, he slowly waves off his men.  They
           lower their weapons almost in time with his hand motion.

                                 SALESMAN
                        Haven’t you heard the expression
                        ‘curiosity killed the cat’?

                                 YATES
                        I’m dead already, anyway.  Fact is,
                        I’ve been dead for years.  Dead
                        marriage, dead job, dead wrong on
                        almost every decision I ever made.
                        I’d like to be alive, for just one
                        moment.

           The Salesman reaches inside Yates pocket and pulls out the
           digital compass.  He smiles.

                                 SALESMAN
                        Would you like to see William,
                        Detective?

           EXT. POST OFFICE / BAHOE SQUARE -- AFTERNOON

           The streets are alive and busy.  More 50’s MUSIC spills
           through the loudspeakers.

           INT. POST OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

           William is next on a long line.  PEOPLE are scattered
           throughout the large mail depot, scurrying to receive their
           mail from different windows.

           A large projected screen reads:
         Joke of the day:  All mail is local

           William reaches Harry’s window.

                                 HARRY
                        Hey there, Mr. Craft!

           Harry digs out William’s envelope.

                                 HARRY (CONT'D)
                         (handing it to him)
                        Hear ya go.

           William notices that the front of the envelope reads:
         From Benjamin Yates

                                 WILLIAM
                        Excuse me.  You said you received
                        this months ago?

                                 HARRY
                        That’s right.  ‘Bout ten months
                        ago, to be exact.  Came down from
                        the Consulate.  Which is kinda like
                        saying it came from the ‘powers
                        that be’.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I didn’t even know this man ten
                        months ago.

                        Welp, funny things happen in
                        Parista.  I have some mail here
                        backed up twenty years for people
                        who haven’t arrived yet.

           William stares at the envelope as the next PERSON in line
           goes ahead of him.

           EXT. BAHOE SQUARE -- MOMENTS LATER

           William sits on a park bench, overlooking the river.  As
           PASSERSBY walk on the boardwalk and enjoy the sunny day,
           William opens the envelope and pulls out a letter inside.  He
           reads it.

                                 YATES (V.O.)
                        Dear William.  By the time you read
                        this letter, I’ll be long gone, and
                        you’ll be starting a new life in a
                        new reality.  I wish I could
                        deliver this letter to you
                        personally, but my destiny lies in
                        a different path then yours.  And I
                        want you to know that I came for
                        you, and this what I found...

                                                         FLASHBACK:

           INT. DARK FOYER -- NIGHT

           Yates, hands raised, stands in front of the Salesman,
           surrounded by Men in Suits.

                                 SALESMAN
                        Would you like to see William,
                        Detective?

                                 YATES
                         (nodding)
                        Yes.

           INT. MEDICAL OFFICES -- MOMENTS LATER

           The Salesman and two MEN IN SUITS lead Yates through what
           looks like a futuristic hospital facility.  As they pass
           offices, strange DOCTORS and ASSISTANTS are working busily on
           SUBJECTS.

                                 YATES (V.O.)
                        ...it was a vast facility.  Some
                        ninety floors deep in the heart of
                        earth.  The temperature was cold,
                        as was the demeanor of the workers
                        inside.  But it was here that the
                        Salesman would lead me to a place I
                        never would’ve dreamt existed...
           INT. THE FLOOR -- CONTINUOUS

           Yates is lead onto a wide and vast floor.  The floor is
           filled with large glass cubes, each holding a PERSON.  Yates
           realizes that these people are frozen.

                                 YATES (V.O.)
                        ...It was an entire floor of
                        cryogenically frozen people, as far
                        as the eye could see.  And,
                        according to the Salesman, there
                        were eighty more floors just like
                        it.

           The Salesman EXPLAINS things to Yates as they pass SUBJECT
           after SUBJECT.

                                 YATES (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        He told me of a time, in the near
                        future, when the human race would
                        be wiped out.  He didn’t reveal
                        exactly how this would happen, but
                        he told me that all clients of the
                        Karma Coalition would be asleep for
                        close to fifty six years, before
                        they would wake up in a new world,
                        where no humans were left...

           They approach William’s cube.  He looks serene.

                                 YATES (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        The Salesman told me the bullet I
                        shot you with was extracted from
                        your arm before they officially put
                        you under...

           EXT. BAHOE SQUARE -- CONTINUOUS

           William, holding the letter, pulls up his sleeve to view his
           bullet scar.  Nothing is there.

           INT. THE FLOOR -- CONTINUOUS

           The Salesman points to an computer clock attached to the side
           of William’s cube.

                                 YATES (V.O.)
                        He said that all clients wake up in
                        order of when they’re sent, so as
                        not to disturb the psychological
                        effects of the trip.

           Yates looks around the circumference of the floor.  He sees
           SCIENTISTS monitoring the room, to make sure nothing goes
           wrong.
           EXT. BAHOE SQUARE --CONTINUOUS

           William can’t believe what he’s reading.

                                 WILLIAM
                        No...

                                 YATES (V.O.)
                        Think about it, William.  Did you
                        feel abnormally cold when you
                        arrived?  Felt like you needed to
                        re-learn how to walk?

                                                         FLASHBACK:

           INT. REHABILITATION FACILITY -- NIGHT

           The GUARDS are helping William walk, step by step, from his
           bunk to the door.

                                                     FLASH FORWARD:

           INT. THE FLOOR

           Yates is kneeling down, writing this letter to William on top
           of William’s cube.

                                 YATES (V.O.)
                        Knowing that they wouldn’t let me
                        live, I asked them if I could write
                        you this one last letter before
                        leaving.  I wanted you to know,
                        William, that I came for you.  It’s
                        probably the only good deed I’ve
                        committed in my twenty five years
                        as an officer.  But unfortunately,
                        as you can see, I can’t bring you
                        back home.  I wish I could.
                        Signed, Benjamin Yates, May 15th,

           INT. THE FLOOR

           Yates finishes his letter, signs it, and stands up.  He hands
           it to the Salesman.  The two Men in Suits near him.

                                 YATES
                        ... I’m ready.

           One of the Men in Suits, injects a syringe in Yates’ neck.
           Yates begins shaking terribly, eyes bulging.  He turns white
           as a ghost as he convulses to death.  Finally, after a
           moment, he turns serene.

           CONTINUED:

           As they carefully lay him on the floor, the Salesman stands
           over him, putting the letter inside his pocket.

                                                          DISSOLVE:

           EXT. BAHOE SQUARE -- DUSK

           William, sitting on the bench, folds up the letter and puts
           it back in the envelope.

           Subtitles appear:  May 15th, 2065

           He hangs his head low, realizing he’ll be in Parista forever.

           EXT. BAHOE SQUARE PARKING LOT -- NIGHT

           The rain is coming down, hitting William hard as he walks to
           his car, grasping the letter.  When he looks up towards his
           Mustang, Deirdre is sitting on the hood, waiting for him.

           William walks up to her, looking deep into her eyes.

                                 WILLIAM
                        It’s a dangerous thing, playing
                        god.

           Deirdre kisses him, long and hard.

                                 DEIRDRE
                        I can’t change my father and I
                        can’t change the past.  But I can
                        change what’s happening right here
                        and right now.

           She lifts her hand up, showing William that her Wedding ring
           is gone.

                                 WILLIAM
                        You are, literally, the only thing
                        I have left in this world.

                                 DEIRDRE
                        Well mister, I would hope that’s
                        enough.

           She smiles.

                                 WILLIAM
                         (hesitant)
                        What... year do you think it is?

                                 DEIRDRE
                        Two thousand nine.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Is that what everybody thinks?

                                                        (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 DEIRDRE
                         (confused)
                        Yes, of course.  Why?

                                 WILLIAM
                        No reason.

           EXT. WILLIAM’S MUSTANG -- MOMENTS LATER

           William and Deirdre get in his car and pull out of the
           parking space.  They drive into Parista, a huge skeleton of a
           city, forever under construction.

                                 YATES (V.O.)
                        They say you’re only as sick as
                        your secrets.
                         (beat)
                        Well, I won’t be sick any longer.

                                                           BLACKOUT

                                 THE END
