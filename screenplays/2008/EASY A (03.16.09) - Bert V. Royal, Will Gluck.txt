           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           It's an average sized high school in an average sized town with 
           average sized cars in the parking lot.  Yet there's something 
           special about it.  

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALL - DAY

           It's empty.

                                 OLIVE (V.O.)
                        The rumors of my promiscuity have been 
                        greatly exaggerated.

           The bell rings and students pour out of the classrooms.

                                 OLIVE (V.O.)
                        I used to be anonymous.  A nothing.  A 
                        nonentity.  Google Earth couldn't find 
                        me if I was dressed up as a ten story 
                        building.  I know, pretty cutting edge 
                        stuff, huh?  A high school girl 
                        feeling anonymous.  Who am I?  Why am 
                        I here?  Do I matter?  Blah blah 
                        snore.  Don't worry, this isn't one of 
                        those tales.  But it sure started off 
                        that way.

           The camera starts to track a group among the masses.  Olive 
           could be any one of a number of girls. 

                                 OLIVE (V.O.)
                        Let the record show that I, Olive 
                        Penderghast, being of sound mind, 
                        ample breast size and the occasional 
                        corny knock knock joke, do enter this 
                        into evidence in the case against me.  
                        Because I'm being judged by a jury of 
                        my peers, I will attempt to insert 
                        'like' and 'totally' into my 
                        confession as much as possible.  I 
                        will also end statements with a 
                        question mark?

           The masses turn a corner.  Still crowded.  Olive still 
           unidentified, but we're narrowing it down.

                        So here it goes... I confess I'm, in 
                        no small part, to blame for all the 
                        gossip that has turned my varsity 
                        letter scarlet.

                        But -- for any guy hoping that the 
                        sizzling details of my sordid past 
                        will inspire you to lock the bathroom 
                        door and 'do it to it' with your 
                        sister's moisturizing lotion - you'll 
                        be gravely disappointed.  Not to 
                        mention unsatisfied.  And smelling 
                        like hibiscus. 

           The group walks out the doors of the school.

           EXT. SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

           Still in a group, now narrowed down to two girls.

                                 OLIVE (V.O.)
                        I just need to set the record straight 
                        and what better way to share my 
                        private thoughts than to broadcast it 
                        on the Internet.

           One girl is now clearly the camera's muse.  She's pretty, 
           fashionable, and carefree.  As she walks off across the median 
           without a care in the world she bumps into... Olive (18) our 
           hero.  She's pretty yet still blossoming.  Books and papers go 
           flying.  She gives chase.

           INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY

           Olive speaks directly into a webcam atop her computer.

                                 OLIVE
                        So, here it is: Part One.

           She holds up pieces of paper on which she has written:

                                 OLIVE (CONT'D)
                        The Shudder-Inducing-and-Clich√©d, 
                        However-Totally-False Account Of How I 
                        Lost My Virginity To A Guy At A 
                        Community College.  And Lost my 
                        Anonymity Along The Way.  Let me just 
                        begin by saying that there are two 
                        sides to every story.  This is my 
                        side, the right one.
                             (beat)
                        Like, totally?

           EXT. SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

           Olive continues to wrangle up her books and papers as her best 
           friend, Rhiannon (18) brash and usually angry, watches her 
           offering no help.  A paper flies away and Olive crawls on all 
           fours after it.
                                 RHIANNON
                        Fuck off!  George is not a 'sexy' 
                        name.  George is like what you name 
                        your teddy bear, not the name you 
                        wanna scream out during climax.

           The paper is stopped in flight by a large sneaker.  Olive looks 
           up and sees it belongs to Mr. Griffin (early 30s) a handsome but 
           hopelessly goofy English teacher.

                                 MR. GRIFFIN
                        I hope by climax, you weren't talking 
                        about--

                                 OLIVE
                             (covering)
                        The stable and self-perpetuating 
                        endstage in the evolution of a plant 
                        community.  Like "by George, that tree 
                        has reached the final stage of 
                        ecological succession!"

                                 RHIANNON
                        And it only took twenty seconds.

           Mr. Griffin doesn't buy it, but is charmed by Olive's attempt.

                                 MR. GRIFFIN
                        Hit the books.  They don't hit back.

           He heads back toward the school's entrance.  He sees some STONER 
           SKATEBOARDERS, leaning on the front steps.  They stare at him 
           with the same indifference all the students do.

                                 OLIVE (V.O.)
                        Mr. Griffin is one of those sweetly 
                        intense guys who could've had any job 
                        in the world after college but instead 
                        became a teacher 'cause he thinks 
                        "youth is our most precious resource."  
                        Which is weird, 'cause if you think 
                        about it, oil is our most precious 
                        resource.  Followed closely by potable 
                        water and then Jake and Maggie 
                        Gyllenhaal.

           Mr. Griffin takes a cigarette out of one of the kids' hands, 
           inhales it, then blows it out on a napkin.  He shows the 
           resulting brown tar mark on the napkin a la "this is what you're 
           doing to your lungs."

                        No, but that's kind of a hot couple.  
                        I wonder who'd wear the pantsuit in 
                        that relationship.

                                 RHIANNON

                        as a sexy George.

                        just put this conversation to bed.

           Olive and Rhiannon eat at the dining room table with Rhi's 
           parents in a long uncomfortable silence.  A lot of liquor has 
           been drunk.

           Mrs. Abernathy smiles and reaches for the bottle.  She drunkenly 
           knocks over Olive's glass.  Mr. Abernathy drunkenly goes to help 
           her and knocks over his glass.  He starts laughing hysterically 
           as Mrs. Abernathy throws down her napkin and stalks into the 
           kitchen.

                        her but if she was a true friend, 
                        she'd understand why I refused to take

                        I'm not proud of this.  Less about the 
                        lie and more about the unoriginality 
                        of it.  Have you ever watched "The

                        this weekend, so I said yes.

                        fucking babies with him and then

                        Even though we now hate each other, 
                        Rhi, I really hope you're watching 
                        this.  Because this part's for you.  
                        The lurid details of my weekend en
                        flagrante delicto with the all-too-

           INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Olive watches "The Brady Bunch" on MUTE.  The song on the radio 
           turns to "Pocketful of Sunshine" by Natasha Bedingfield.  Olive 
           winces at the song.

                                 NATASHA BEDINGFIELD
                        I got a pocket, got a pocket full of 
                        sunshine.  I got a love and I know 
                        that it's all mine.  Oh, oh, oh.

                                 OLIVE
                             (to herself)
                        Ugh.  Worst song ever.

           INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           Olive paints her toenails Jungle Red.  She's quietly humming, 
           unaware that she's doing it.

                                 NATASHA BEDINGFIELD
                        Do what you want, but you never gonna 
                        break me.  Sticks and stones are never 
                        gonna shake me.  Oh, oh, oh.

           INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - THAT AFTERNOON

           She picks up a magazine with Ryan Gosling on the cover.  She's 
           doodled a picture of herself hand-in-hand with him.  She starts 
           to paint the stick figure's toes red.  She's now singing along--

                                 OLIVE/NATASHA BEDINGFIELD
                        Take me away.  A secret place.  A 
                        sweet escape.  Take me away to better 
                        days.  Take me away.  A hiding place.
           INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT

           Olive stands on her chair, dusting the top corners of her rooms 
           as she sings--

                                 OLIVE/NATASHA BEDINGFIELD
                        I got a pocket, got a pocketful of

                        that it's all mine.  Oh, oh, oh. Do 
                        what you want, but you never gonna 
                        break me...

           INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           She's eating a bowl of cereal in her underwear, reading the 
           newspaper online.  She drinks out of an orange juice carton.

                                 OLIVE
                        Wish that you could, but you ain't 
                        gonna own me.  Do anything you can to 
                        control me.  Oh, oh, oh.

           INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - THAT EVENING

           Olive dances around and sings like crazy--

                                 OLIVE
                        Take me away.  Take me away.  Take me 
                        away to better days.  Take me away.  A 
                        hiding place!  

           She trips over her chair and crashes into the floor.

                        my weekend was...

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           Olive and Rhi walk to class, weaving in and out of people.

                                 OLIVE
                        It was nothing short of perfection.

                                 RHIANNON
                        Are you limping?  Sweet.

                                 OLIVE
                        Get your head out of the gutter.  I 
                        strained my vastus intermedius doing 
                        yoga with him.  Did I mention he does 
                        yoga?
                                 RHIANNON
                        You didn't mention anything.  I want 
                        details, bitch.  Wait, first I need a 
                        scope of reference.  Who would play 
                        him in the movie of your life?

                                 OLIVE
                        Ryan Gosling, definitely.

                                 RHIANNON
                        That works.  Continue.

                                 OLIVE
                        He was charming.  A real gentleman.

                                 RHIANNON
                        Are you going to see him again?

                                 OLIVE
                        Probably not.  It was just one of 
                        those weekends.

                                 RHIANNON
                        The whole weekend?

                                 OLIVE
                        Yeah.

           Rhiannon suddenly stops and twirls Olive to face her.

                                 RHIANNON
                        Wait a minute.  You didn't...

                                 OLIVE
                        No, of course not.

                                 RHIANNON
                        You fucking liar!  You totally lost 
                        your V-card to him!

           Students stop in their tracks and stare.

                                 OLIVE
                        I did not.

                                 RHIANNON
                        Yes you did!  You lying fucking whore!

           Olive grabs her and drags her forward, interrupting the show.

                                 RHIANNON
                        Tell me everything and spare me the 
                        coquettish "just-the-tip" bullshit.  I 
                        know you did it!  I know you let him 
                        put it inside you, so just tell me!
                                 OLIVE
                        I'm not that kind of girl.

                                 RHIANNON
                        The kind that does it or the kind that 
                        does it like a fucking porn star and 
                        then doesn't have the lady balls to 
                        tell her best friend.

           Rhi drags her into the bathroom.

           INT. GIRLS' ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           She aggressively gets up in Olive's face.

                                 RHIANNON
                        I want every perverted detail.  Now,

                        It's not technically a term of 
                        endearment.

                                 RHIANNON
                        I want every detail.  Now, mother 
                        fucker.

                                 OLIVE
                        Not heading in the right direction.

           Rhiannon tightens her grip.  Pressured, Olive lies.

                                 OLIVE (CONT'D)
                        Okay.  Fine.  We did it.

                                 RHIANNON

                                 RHIANNON
                        There were people walking past.  
                        Someone could've easily seen.  
                        Whatever, this isn't about me.  It's 
                        about you.  What did you let him do?

                                 OLIVE (V.O.)
                        I started piling on lie after lie.  It 
                        was like setting up Jenga.   
                                 OLIVE
                        It was... normal.  Nothing freaky.  It 
                        was sweet.  He was sweet.  Okay, 
                        that's enough.

           The toilet flushes and Marianne Bryant (18) an Aryanesque, 
           cardigan-wearing Christian-girl exits from a stall and walks to 
           the sink, where she vigorously washes her hands.  All the while 
           staring at Rhi and Olive with disgust.

                                 RHIANNON
                        What the fuck are you looking at,

                                 MARIANNE
                        Just a couple of admitted whores.

           Marianne wipes her hands and exits.  Olive's stomach revolves at 
           her now-turned-public admission.

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - LAST YEAR - DAY

           Marianne and her lackey, Nina (18) who's just as awful as she 
           is, pass out flyers to students.  They've set up a tent like all 
           religious groups do.

                                 OLIVE (V.O.)
                        Last year's cause cel√©bre was the 
                        changing of the school mascot, which 
                        she spearheaded.

           Marianne aggressively shoves her literature into passing 
           students faces.

           INT. GYM - LAST YEAR - DAY

           The school's mascot (17) a shirtless muscular kid painted blue 
           and costumed as a devil, bursts into the auditorium and begins 
           to rile up students by thrusting his pitchfork in the air.

           The crowd goes wild.

           Marianne, standing in front of another religious tent, 
           melodramatically grabs a passing student by the arm as she 
           passes out flyers.

                        How can we exhibit school pride when 
                        we're conveyed to others as Satan 
                        worshippers?

           The scared student takes her pamphlet and runs away.

           The mascot, unenthusiastic and feeling ridiculous, walks into 
           the gym dressed as a--

                                 MASCOT
                        Woodchucks!  Go Woodchucks!

           The school band starts playing "Knock on Wood" by Wilson 
           Pickett.  He picks up a foam piece of wood and pantomimes 
           gnawing it a la a woodchuck.  Then he blows "sawdust" out of his 
           hand and confetti goes flying.  He can't seem to get himself or 
           the student body as excited - with the exception of Marianne and 
           Nina, in the stands applauding proudly.  Across the gym, Olive 
           sits with Rhiannon.

                                 RHIANNON
                        How much wood could a woodchuck chuck 
                        if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

                        just take a moment to applaud the  
                        Marching Band for their very ambitious 
                        effort to learn every song with the

                        liked Todd much better when he was

                        Yeah.  That's it.  The decline of 21st 
                        century adolescence can be defined in

           They both get lost in thought.  Olive pops out of her trance and 
           shakes herself off.  She jumps up and yells in an ironically 
           huge sign of school spirit--

                        best-friend in the ladies room would 
                        come back to bite me on the ass.  
                        However, even I, who my fourth grade 
                        teacher stated on my report card "has 
                        an imagination that should be quickly

                        The Accelerated Velocity of 
                        Terminological Inexactitude.

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

           Olive looks up and sees a few kids whispering and looking at 
           her.  Then one of them peels off and tells another group 
           something as one girl in the first group gets out her cellphone 
           and starts texting away.  The CAMERA goes into HYPERDRIVE and 
           zooms around the hallway at the speed of rumor.  Every one stays 
           in real time as the camera goes in FAST MOTION and delivers the 
           gossip, darting down the hallway, up the stairs, down another 
           hallway, out a window, down to the parking lot, across to the 
           football field, through the locker rooms, out another door, 
           around the back of the school, through the cafeteria, into a few 
           classrooms, down the stairs, and back through the hallway.  It 
           lands back on a perfectly still Olive.  We RESUME real motion.  
           Marianne and Nina walk over to Olive.

                                 MARIANNE
                        Maybe next time a certain someone will 
                        be a little more careful what she says 
                        in the water closet.

                                 OLIVE
                        Listen, about that.  It's not what you 
                        think.  Can I speak to you alone?

           Nina gives Marianne an "is it okay?"  Look.  Marianne responds 
           with "it's fine."  Then Nina pats her heart and kisses her hand.  
           Marianne returns the super queer gesture.  She turns back to 
           Olive who looks confused by this display of queerness.

           Olive looks over and sees that Nina is talking to a group of 
           guys, who are looking at Olive, intrigued.  Olive is not happy 
           about this.

           She shakes off her attempt and continues on her way, walking 
           past the guys who smile at her.  This alarms her.

           INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

           12-14 year-old kids are lounging around everywhere.  One group 
           plays pass-the-orange-under-your-neck.  Another plays spin-the-
           bottle.

                        I did get my first kiss back then, 
                        however.  It was gross and kind of 
                        turned me off to the whole my-tongue-
                        in-other-people's-mouths thing.  Not 
                        to mention the even-worse other-
                        people's-tongues-in-my-mouth thing.  
                        Seriously, who invented kissing and 
                        why do people want to do it so much?  
                        It's not like that's how we procreate.  
                        Back then I didn't know that of 
                        course.

           WE PUSH through some kids assembled outside a closet, giggling.  
           We push past them and through the keyhole to--

           INT. CLOSET - CONTINUOUS

           In almost complete darkness, a very nervous eighth grade Olive 
           sits with a scared shitless eighth grade kid.  You can hear 
           other kids snickering and whispering outside the door.

                                 EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE
                        I think this is the part where you're 
                        supposed to stick your tongue in my 
                        mouth.  It's just what I've heard.

                                 EIGHTH GRADE KID
                        Just give me a second, okay?

           Olive presses a button and her watch illuminates.

                                 EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE
                        According to my watch, you have 382 of 
                        them.

                                 EIGHTH GRADE KID
                        How do you do that?

                                 EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE
                        What?

                                 EIGHTH GRADE KID
                        Add so fast.  And you also talk like a 
                        grown up.

                                 EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE
                        Don't worry.  I'm not nearly as smart 
                        as I think I am.
           The kid giggles.  He feels a little more at ease.

                                 EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE
                        I think it's just practice.  For when 
                        I do grow up.  Plus, don't sweat it.  
                        Girls mature faster than boys.

                                 EIGHTH GRADE KID
                        That's what they say.

                                 EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE
                        And it's probably the reason I'm ready 
                        to do this and you're not.

                                 EIGHTH GRADE KID
                        Is it that obvious?

                                 EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE
                        Painfully so.

                                 EIGHTH GRADE KID
                        So, if we didn't do anything, would 
                        you tell everybody?

                                 EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE
                        Absolutely.  I will tell everyone you 
                        pussed out and the whole school will 
                        make fun of you and you'll most likely 
                        spend the rest of your teen years as a 
                        joke.  No, even worse: a cautionary 
                        tale.

           They both laugh.

                                 EIGHTH GRADE KID
                        The Kid Who Opted Not To Kiss The 
                        Girl.

                                 EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE
                        They'll tell it for years.  It'll be a 
                        suburban legend.

           The kid smiles warmly and gratefully at her.

                                 EIGHTH GRADE KID
                        Thanks, Olive.

                                 EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE
                        Don't mention it.

                                 EIGHTH GRADE KID
                        No.  You don't mention it.

           She extends her pinky to him.  They link pinkies and they swear 
           on it.
                                 EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE
                        We still have five minutes and thirty 
                        six seconds.

           There's a long silence.

                                 EIGHTH GRADE KID
                        I'm really interested in politics.

                                 EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE
                        Oh yeah?

                                 EIGHTH GRADE KID
                        Totally.

                                 EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE
                        What do you think about Alberto 
                        Gonzales as the new Attorney General?  
                        I have my doubts, but anything's 
                        better than that bible-banger 
                        Ashcroft, right?

                                 EIGHTH GRADE KID
                             (thrown)
                        I'm more into, uh, school politics.  
                        Like, uh, trying to get the cafeteria 
                        to bring back Klondike Bar-Fridays.

                                 EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE
                        Oh.  Cool.  That's also important.

           There's another long silence.  Then--

                                 PRETEEN KID (O.S.)
                        Ew!  Hunter Nesbitt just puked on the 
                        piano!

           The kid looks through the keyhole and sees everyone scurry away.

                                 EIGHTH GRADE KID
                        Thank God.

                                 EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE
                        Hey, we're in junior high.  Vomit-
                        viewing always trumps spit-swapping.

           The kid opens the door but Olive stops him.

                                 EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE
                        Real fast, and you can tell me the 
                        truth, It's not because I'm--

                                 EIGHTH GRADE KID
                             (smiles)
                        No.  You're very pretty.
                                 EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE
                        I was going to say "eccentric," but 
                        I'll take it.

           He kisses her on the cheek and darts from the closet.  Olive 
           sits there for a moment, contemplating what just happened, 
           wondering if he was telling the truth.  Then she opens the door.  
           Just then a boy runs past holding out a cell phone--

                                 BOY
                        Hunter Nesbitt booted on the piano!  
                        I'm gonna get it up on YouTube!

           Olive aggressively grabs him and pulls him into the closet.  She 
           thrusts her tongue into his mouth and they make out.

           INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY - DAY

           Olive seems lost in thought.  She snaps back to reality and the 
           task at hand.

                        If I'd known Woodchuck Todd was going 
                        to turn out so hot, I probably would 
                        have cherished the moment more.  I 
                        suppose the fact that I'm sitting here 
                        reminiscing about it means that it 
                        must have meant something.
                             (beat)
                        So anyway: kissing's not really my 
                        thing.  That's what I learned in the 
                        closet at the forever to be called 
                        Hunter-Nesbitt-Puked-on-the-Piano 
                        Party.  It's up on YouTube if you have 
                        any interest.  I digress...

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Olive half-listens in class, while her English teacher Mr. 
           Griffin lectures on Nathaniel Hawthorne.  The blackboard is 
           filled with everything "The Scarlet Letter."  The other kids are 
           more interested in staring at Olive.  Some even pass her notes.  
           Which she demurely accepts.

                                 OLIVE (V.O.)
                        So, I'm feeling like the cat's ass 
                        'cause everyone thinks I've been 
                        deflowered.  I was surprised at how 
                        empowered I felt by this lie.  I 
                        wondered if I would feel this 
                        invigorated if I'd actually let some 
                        college kid defile me in his cockroach-
                        infested dorm room?  Probably not.
                                 MR. GRIFFIN
                        If Nathaniel Hawthorne were alive 
                        today I bet he'd be a white rapper:  
                        Stealing trends and ideas from other 
                        more talented but less legitimate 
                        people, then putting it forth in a non-
                        threatening more established package--  
                             (raps)
                        Adultery, vengeance, forbidden actions 
                        of passion.  Society judging don't 
                        never go out of fashion.  Put an 'A' 
                        on your sweater 'cause you're a 
                        married-man go-getter!  
                             (beat boxes)

                                 OLIVE (V.O.)
                        Ironically, as you can see by Mr. 
                        Griffin's misguided attempt to 
                        "relate," we were studying "The 
                        Scarlet Letter."  Isn't that always 
                        the way with these teenage tales?  The 
                        books you read in class always seems 
                        to have a strong connection with 
                        whatever angsty adolescent drama is 
                        going on.  I consider this.  Then I 
                        think: Except for "Huckleberry Finn."  
                        I don't know any teenage boys who've 
                        ever run away with a big, hulking 
                        black guy.

                        Maybe it's because we were reading 
                        this book that I did what I did.  
                        Thank God we weren't reading "The 
                        Crucible."  I might've gotten involved 
                        in witchcraft and been stoned by my 
                        classmates.  Anyway, for those of you 
                        who haven't read "The Scarlet Letter" 
                        and those of you who said you have but 
                        really didn't, here's all you need to

                        This girl named Hester Prynne has an

                        and made to wear a red 'A' for 
                        adulterer.  But then the town realizes 
                        she was too harshly judged, that she's 
                        a really good person, and she dies a

                        Alright, so thoughts on the chapter 
                        you read last night?

           Nothing.  Mr. Griffin notices someone texting in class.  He 
           takes the cell phone and turns it off.

                        Do you know what George Bernard Shaw

                                 MR. GRIFFIN
                        If you have an apple and I have an 
                        apple and we exchange these apples 
                        then you and I will still each have 
                        one apple.  But if you have an idea 
                        and I have an idea and we exchange 
                        these ideas, then each of us will have 
                        two ideas.
                                 TEXTING STUDENT
                        Uh... Okay?

           He turns the phone off and hands it back to the student.

                                 MR. GRIFFIN
                        Keep your apples, man.  Let's exchange 
                        ideas.  Semi colon closed parenthesis.

           Nina raises her hand.  Mr. Griffin points to her.

                                 NINA
                        I think Hester Prynne was, excuse my 
                        language, a whore.

                                 MR. GRIFFIN
                        You don't see her as a victim?

                                 NINA
                        Why should I?  She brought it on 
                        herself.

           Nina whips around and gives Olive a look, surprising her.

                                 OLIVE
                        Excuse me?

                                 NINA
                        Perhaps you should embroider a red A 
                        on your wardrobe?

                                 OLIVE
                        Perhaps you should get a wardrobe, you 
                        twat!

           The class bursts into laughter.  Even Mr. Griffin tries hard to 
           suppress a congratulatory glance in her direction.

                                 OLIVE
                        Admittedly, not my best line.  But it 
                        was provocative enough to land me in 
                        the principal's office.

           Mr. Griffin, begrudgingly, calls her to his desk.  He starts 
           writing something on a piece of paper.

           INT. FRONT OFFICE - HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Olive sits with her arms crossed outside of the principal's 
           office.  She clenches a note in her fist.  Marianne, who's an 
           office aid, has a smirk on her face as she watches Olive squirm.  
           She slams her fist down on the stapler, repetitively.
                                 MARIANNE
                        Seems as if someone's on a downward 
                        spiral.

                                 OLIVE
                        Seems as if someone's practicing the 
                        mundane activities she'll be saddled 
                        with the rest of her pathetic life.

                                 MARIANNE
                        You have a chip on your shoulder the 
                        size of Canaan.

                                 OLIVE
                        Is that big...or small?  I'm sorry, I 
                        don't watch cartoons.

                                 MARIANNE
                        You're going to hell.

                                 OLIVE
                        As long as you won't be there...

                                 MARIANNE
                        Oh, I can assure you I won't.

           Neither says anything for a few moments.

                                 MARIANNE
                        I hope you at least had the good sense 
                        to use protection.

                                 OLIVE
                        Why?  Your parents didn't.

                                 MARIANNE
                        You know, you're just like--

           The principal's door opens and Marianne quickly shuts up and 
           continues her work.  Two kids emerge.  One, obviously, a bully; 
           the other, obviously, the bullied.  The bullied kid is holding a 
           bloody tissue up to his nose.  He and Olive exchange meaningful 
           glances.  Principal Gibbons, a colossal prick disguised as a 
           man, gestures for her to come in.  Olive gets up and throws one 
           of Marianne and Nina's queer touching-your-heart gestures at 
           Marianne.  Marianne scowls.

           INT. PRINCIPAL GIBBONS'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Olive is seated across from Principal Gibbons.  He holds his 
           hand out and she gives him the note Mr. Griffin's note.  Gibbons 
           studies it.

                                 PRINCIPAL GIBBONS
                        I don't know you.
           She thrusts her hand out.

                                 OLIVE
                        Olive Penderghast. Twelfth grade.  
                        Cholesterol 185.  But most of it's the 
                        good kind.

           He eyes her hand, not amused.  She withdraws it in a hip-hop 
           snake move segueing into a robot.

                                 PRINCIPAL GIBBONS
                        Why are we just now meeting?  Using 
                        language like this should have 
                        warranted a visit to me years ago.

                                 OLIVE
                        Well, to be perfectly honest, I've 
                        never used an epithet like this in an 
                        educational arena before.  Sir.

                                 PRINCIPAL GIBBONS
                        This is foul.

                                 OLIVE
                        In my defense, I think I meant to say 
                        'twit.'  It just came out more - 
                        what's the word I'm looking for?  
                        Veracious.

                                 PRINCIPAL GIBBONS
                        Someone with such an extensive 
                        vocabulary shouldn't be stooping to 
                        such vituperations.

                                 OLIVE
                             (smiling)
                        Touch√©.

                                 PRINCIPAL GIBBONS
                        Wipe that smile off your face.  I 
                        don't tolerate this kind of language.  
                        If I find out you've used a word like 
                        this in my school again, it will be 
                        your last.  This isn't one of those 
                        creative-hippy schools where teachers 
                        are called by their first names and 
                        parents "help out in the classroom" 
                        and students are "partners in 
                        learning."  You get sent here once 
                        more and you're out on your ass.  Get 
                        me?

           She starts to say something--
                                 PRINCIPAL GIBBONS (CONT'D)
                        Think very carefully before you speak.

           She relents, but stares him squarely in the eyes.

                                 OLIVE
                        I always do.  Can I go?

           He gestures to the door.

                                 PRINCIPAL GIBBONS
                        Detention tomorrow after school.  I 
                        don't want to see you again.

                                 OLIVE
                        Not even in a more positive capacity?  
                        Maybe I'll win a ribbon or a medal or 
                        a Presidential Physical Fitness Award.  
                        Do they still give those?  Judging 
                        from the deal you made with Jack in 
                        the Box to pay for the new scoreboard 
                        in the football stadium, I'm guessing 
                        not.  So what if kids get imprinted 
                        and start eating a high-fat diet at a 
                        young age, the important thing is we 
                        all know how much time is left in the 
                        fourth quarter and what yard line the 
                        ball is on.  Can I get a what-what?

                                 PRINCIPAL GIBBONS
                        Get out of my office.

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Olive sulks down the hall.  She turns the corner and finds 
           herself stride for stride with Woodchuck Todd.  He's wearing his 
           woodchuck suit, but without the head.

                                 WOODCHUCK TODD
                        Hey, Olive.

                             (re: his costume)
                        The illusion is shattered.  This is 
                        exactly why they put you in the gas 
                        chamber if you take your head off at 
                        Disneyworld.

                                 WOODCHUCK TODD
                        Actually I think they just fire you.  
                        You're thinking of Disneyland.  
                        Disneyworld is much more liberal.
                                 OLIVE
                        Oh, yeah.  That's right.  Disneyworld 
                        went blue in the last election.  

                                 WOODCHUCK TODD
                        Are you going to Melanie Bostic's 
                        party?

                                 OLIVE
                        I hadn't planned on it.

                                 WOODCHUCK TODD
                        Me neither.  My cousin's getting 
                        married.  Rehearsal dinner.

           They've reached the end of the hall.  Todd peels off.

                                 WOODCHUCK TODD
                        See ya.  Stay excellent.

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY

           Olive opens the doors to find Rhiannon waiting for her.  Rhi 
           runs up the stairs to her.

                                 RHIANNON

                        suspended for calling Nina Howell a 
                        cunt and then punching her in the left 
                        tit.

                        turned into such a bad ass?  I think 
                        I'm in love with you.  Please tell me 
                        you at least left a mark on that 
                        scrunched-up face of hers.  Pow!

           The scene looks the same.  Olive sits with her family, having 
           family dinner.

                        But we're reading a book that I, 
                        personally, deem wildly inappropriate 
                        for my age group, so I felt that it 
                        was actually quite apropos.

                        What did you say?

           Olive looks to her little sister and thinks better of saying the 
           word out loud.

                                 OLIVE
                        Let's just say it was an inappropriate 
                        word.

                        What did it start with?

                                 OLIVE
                        A snide comment from a snotty girl in 
                        my class.

                                 DILL
                        I meant what letter did it start with.

                        Also heard he gave you crabs.

                                 OLIVE
                        Ewwww.  People suck.

                                 BRANDON
                        Tell me about it.
                             (then)
                        I didn't even think crabs existed any 
                        more.  I thought it was like rickets 
                        or scurvy.

                                 OLIVE
                        Oh, it still exists.  Nothing can wipe 
                        out crabs.  It's like the Cadillac of 
                        sexually transmitted diseases.  You 
                        know, before the American automobile 
                        industry went bust.

                                 BRANDON
                             (laughs)
                        You speak in tongues, you know that?

                                 OLIVE
                        I'm just trying to make it through the 
                        day.

           INT. BOYS BATHROOM - A LITTLE LATER

           Olive and Brandon are in adjoining stalls sitting on the 
           toilets, scrubbing away graffiti.

                                 OLIVE
                        He's not real.  The guy I slept with.  
                        I made him up.

                                 BRANDON
                        Wait.  You started the rumor?

                                 OLIVE
                        Indirectly.  Sort of.  Well, not 
                        really.  No.  No, I didn't.
                                 BRANDON
                        But you're perpetuating it.  That's so 
                        fucked up.

                                 OLIVE
                        Excuse me?

                                 BRANDON
                        You're not even a real slut, you just 
                        want people to think you are.  
                        Pathetic.

                                 OLIVE
                        No offense, Brando, but maybe you 
                        could learn something from me.  

                                 BRANDON
                        You're saying I should act straight, 
                        so people will like me?  You mean in 
                        high school people pretend to be  
                        something they're not so they can fit 
                        in?  Ground breaking!  You should 
                        teach a course at the Learning Annex.  
                        "The Painfully Obvious with Olive 
                        Penderghast, the fake school slut."

           Olive emerges from the stall with a bucket of paint and a brush.  
           She goes to the sink and dumps it, checking herself out in the 
           mirror as she does.

                                 OLIVE
                        I'm just suggesting that maybe these 
                        kids we call peers have got the right 
                        idea.  Maybe Bridget Schumacher isn't 
                        as hippy-dippy as she pretends to be.  
                        Maybe that's just the label she's put 
                        on herself to avoid having to shave 
                        everywhere society deems normal.  Or 
                        take Marianne Bryant.  Maybe the whole 
                        stuck-up Jesus-freak thing is an act.  
                        Maybe she was sick of being just 
                        another faceless entity in a place and 
                        a time that reveres people for 
                        extremity?

           Brandon emerges from his stall.

                                 BRANDON
                        Nah, I think she's just a stuck-up 
                        Jesus-freak.

                                 OLIVE
                        Yeah, me too.  But do you think she 
                        cares that that's the way she's 
                        perceived?  No.
                                 BRANDON
                        There are some of us who just want to 
                        blend in to the crowd.

                                 OLIVE
                        Then you either gotta go to that 
                        extreme or make the steadfast decision 
                        not to care.  Even better, do both.

                                 BRANDON
                        I can't decide if you're a genius or a 
                        lunatic.

                                 OLIVE
                        Don't they sort of go hand-in-hand?

           They both look at themselves and each other in the mirror.  
           Brandon picks a piece of lint off Olive's lowcut top.

                                 OLIVE
                        How am I doing?  Do I look like a 
                        whore?

                                 BRANDON
                        For a virgin, pretty damn good.

           He pulls down her t-shirt, exposing more cleavage.

                                 BRANDON
                        How about me?  Could I pass as 
                        straight?

                                 OLIVE
                        Not bad.  For a fag.

           She untucks his shirt and musses up his hair.

                        You know, if we really wanted to shock 
                        the world, we'd blow off detention.  
                        Just leave now.

                                 BRANDON
                        But you know we would never do that.

                        question as to which guy you actually 
                        lost it to first.  It'd be like a he-

                        Do you wanna go out with me?

                        Say again now?

                        I mean, like, do you want to be my 
                        girlfriend?

                                 OLIVE
                        Brandon, just a few hours ago you told 
                        me you were Kinsey Six gay. 

                                 BRANDON
                        True.  But you said I should pretend 
                        to be straight.

                                 OLIVE
                        I didn't mean with me.  You're a sweet 
                        guy and all, but you're not really my 
                        type.

                                 BRANDON
                        You're not really my type either.

                                 OLIVE
                        I know.  I have that V where you'd 
                        rather see a P.

                                 BRANDON
                        Do you wanna have sex with me or not?

                        Oh my God.  You totally missed my 
                        point.  All I was saying was that--

                                 BRANDON
                        I know what you were saying.  I should 
                        play it straight until I get out of 
                        this hellhole and then I can be 
                        whoever I want to be.  No, I got that.
                                 OLIVE
                        Brandon, I told you, I didn't really
                        have sex with a college guy.  I just 
                        told people I did.
                             (then)
                        Well, actually, I just told one person 
                        and, well, you know how these things 
                        work.  Wildfire.

                        So, you're saying I shouldn't really 
                        have sex?  I should just say I had sex 
                        with someone?  A girl?

           with this and instantly gets defensive.

                        All it would take is one good

                        know I really like being thought of as 
                        a floozy?

                        of.

                        Come on, it wouldn't have to be a 
                        bonk.  It could be an imaginary nutter 
                        or a lemon squeeze or a cowbell...

                        just think: you'll officially be a

                        just have to go with it?  I don't

                        that high school is like I'm being 
                        suffocated.  And we can fantasize all 
                        we want about how things are going to 
                        be different one day, but this is 
                        today.  And it sucks.  And there's 
                        only one way out and you were smart 
                        enough to think of it.  Please.  Help 
                        me.  I can't take another day of this.  
                        I don't know what the fuck I'll do.

           She sees tears forming in his eyes.  She turns away and is 
           silent for a long beat.
                                 OLIVE

                        It'll have to be a public event.  
                        Melanie Bostic is having a party 
                        tomorrow night.  All of your 
                        tormentors will be there.  You and I 
                        are going together.  You have to do 
                        everything I say and you have to tell 
                        people that I was sensational.

           Brandon wipes his tears away and is the happiest gay you've ever 
           seen.  He throws his arms around her and won't let go.

                                 BRANDON

           EXT. BACK OF A MELANIE BOSTIC'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Kids are partying everywhere.  On the grass, by the pool, some 
           are even in the pool.  We TRACK through the partiers and go 
           inside the open back doors--

           INT. MELANIE BOSTIC'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           More kids, more debauchery.  Then Olive parts the sea like 
           Moses, looking like a million bucks.  Brandon is on her arm, 
           looking pretty snazzy himself.  They appear drunk and are 
           falling all over each other.  People stare in complete amazement 
           at a) their appearance and b) that they're even together in the 
           first place.  You'd never guess that this was anything less than 
           an A-list teen couple.  Olive falls against Brandon laughing.  
           He hoists her up as their host, Melanie Bostic (18) approaches.
                                 MELANIE

                        And Brandon.

                        party cocktails before the cocktail 
                        party with cocktails started to

                        was in the middle of telling me this 
                        funny thing.  Is there a quiet room we 
                        can go to where he can finish telling 
                        me about his thing... that's funny...

           She gives her a drunken punch on the shoulder.  Then lifts up 
           her shirt and kisses her stomach.  Then she spins around to the 
           entire party--

           She grabs Brandon and they stumble down the hallway.  The bully 
           who emerged from Gibbons's office with Brandon goes up to 
           Melanie.

           They, with a big group, race down the hall where Brandon and 
           Olive have just retreated to.

           Olive locks the door and drops the drunk act.  She's completely 
           sober and so is Brandon.

           Brandon runs over and pulls the blinds down.  Olive takes her 
           panties under her skirt.

           She drapes the panties over the doorknob, just so anyone looking 
           through the keyhole will see nothing but panties.  Then she 
           plops down on the bed and stretches out.

                        I'm gonna have to do all the work 
                        myself.  Hey, this is like real sex.

                                 BRANDON
                        How would you know? 

           She slaps him across the face.  He lets out a yelp and she 
           quickly covers his mouth, turning it into a perfect grunt.  She 
           gives him a thumbs-up.  Then she moans.

           Sure enough, it seems as if most of the party is listening at 
           the door, falling all over each other to hear.  Nearest to the 
           door is the bully, who is pleasantly surprised by the noise 
           inside.  He tries to look through the keyhole.  All he can see 
           are panties.

           INT. GUEST ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Olive continues to make sex noises.  Brandon throws some grunts 
           in here and there.  She gives him direction with her hands a la 
           a conductor as she continues moaning.  They're actually having a 
           bit of fun.  Then she reaches into her  bag and pulls out her 
           copy of "The Scarlet Letter."  Brandon looks perplexed.  Then 
           Olive smacks his butt with it.  He lets out another real yelp.

                                 OLIVE
                        There we go.  Now you're getting it.

                                 BRANDON
                        You don't have to be so aggressive 
                        about it.

                                 OLIVE

                        Oh, you don't like that?

                                 BRANDON
                             (loud whisper)
                        No!

                        How about that?  You like that?

                                 BRANDON
                        A little better.
                                 OLIVE
                        Yeah, you like that!  Yeah you like 
                        that!

                        Oh!  I get it.  Nice.

           Then she jumps up on the bed and does jumping jacks.  She 
           motions for him to join her.  They moan and grunt together as 
           they jump up and down.  Olive starts aerobicizing and Brandon 
           follows.  This is actually really fun.

                                 BRANDON
                        How long do we have to do this?

                        do you wanna be a stud?

           He moans in his deepest voice.  She follows.  Then she bangs her 
           hand against the wall over and over.

                                 OLIVE

                        going to have sex with you from the

           Olive rolls her eyes.

                                 OLIVE
                        C'mon.  Make it nasty.  Follow my

                        smell us?

           She hits him hard on the arm.

           They continue to make moaning noises.

           He gives her a quizzical look.  But before he knows what's about 
           to happen, she punches him hard in the stomach and he lets out a 
           really loud and painful moan.
                                 OLIVE

                        Thanks, Olive.

           He kisses her on the cheek and she smiles.  He gingerly removes 
           her panties from the doorknob and tosses them to her.  Then he 
           exits the room.

           The crowd scurries like cockroaches when the door opens.  The 
           bully hands Brandon a beer and throws his arm around him.

           He leads him drunkenly down the hallway, with a crew of guys 
           after the dirty details.  Olive looks at this and smiles, 
           satisfied.  Then she looks up and sees a whole slew of girls 
           looking at her completely differently.  They avoid her eye 
           contact, as one would ward off Medusa.  She walks out to find 
           Melanie pretending not to be interested in her.

           She begins her walk of shame down the corridor.  Guys look at 
           her like she's a god, girls like she's a whore.  She turns a 
           corner into the--

           throwing sex gestures to Todd re: Olive.  She spins around and 
           they instantly pretend to not be paying attention.  She glares 
           at them.

                        want to date a gay boy, your father 
                        and I are totally supportive.  We love 
                        you no matter what the sexual 
                        orientation of your opposite-sex sex 
                        partner.

           She kisses Olive on the cheek.

                        And don't feel bad that you won't make 
                        us grandparents.  We still have 
                        Ginger, and from the signs I'm picking 
                        up, she'll be preggo before the PSATs.  
                        Which is actually great 'cause then we 
                        can get another shot at raising kids.  
                        Really do it right this time.

                        I dated a homosexual once.  For a long 
                        time actually.  A long time.

                        No!  No.  Your father is as straight 
                        as they come.  A little too straight 
                        if you know what I mean.

                        I don't.  Close the door, thanks?
           Rosemary laughs again and exits.  Olive looks at the gift on the 
           floor and then opens it.  It's a photo of the bully holding 
           Brandon's legs as he does a keg stand.  Olive smiles.  Then she 
           looks into the box and sees something that makes her gasp.  It's 
           an envelope with a $200 Target Gift Card.

                        a--

           Confused, she pulls out a massive pink dildo.

                        shop at Target.  Then you can go fuck 
                        yourself."

           Olive breaks out into riotous laughter.  She's genuinely touched 
           by this gift.  The phone rings with the theme from the "Brady 
           Bunch" ringtone. Thinking it's Brandon, Olive snatches it up.

           EXT. MAIN STREET SHOPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

           Rhiannon, clutching an enormous Tab, walks with an intensity 
           reserved for girls who just found out their best friend had her 
           sophomore sexual exploit and didn't bother to tell them.

                                 RHIANNON
                        I have many questions, obviously.

                                 OLIVE
                        Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.  
                        No, I do not know the way to San Jose.  
                        And contrary to popular belief, Panama 
                        hats are not from Panama at all.  
                        They're from Ecuador.

                                 RHIANNON
                        Now is not the time to be cute.
                                 OLIVE
                        You're putting me in a precarious 
                        position, because according to last 
                        month's Cosmo, we should always look 
                        cute.  Even when we're doing mundane 
                        activities like choosing vegetables 
                        from the produce section or going to 
                        the DMV.

                                 RHIANNON
                        Olive, stop it.  This is serious.  Did 
                        you really bang Brandon last night at 
                        Melanie Dipshit's party?  A party that 
                        you told me you weren't going to go 
                        to, so I didn't go and instead stayed 
                        home with Mr. and Mrs. Kahlua and 
                        Cream?

           Olive sighs as she slumps into her pillows.

                                 OLIVE
                        Is that what someone said happened?

                        That's what everyone said happened.

                                 OLIVE
                        Then I guess it's true.

                                 RHIANNON
                        Does this mean you guys are dating?

                                 OLIVE
                        God no.

           Rhiannon screams in frustration, attracting the attention of 
           passing shoppers.

                        Just because you lost your virginity 
                        doesn't mean you can go around 
                        throwing your cat at everybody!

                        of pissing me off.

                        I'm sorry if I think a best friend's 
                        duty is to let her know that everyone, 
                        and I do mean everyone, is calling her 
                        a cum dumpster.

                        Look, baby, I call a spade a spade.

                        First off, that's racist or at the 
                        very least not clever.  Second, how 
                        dare you?  I was Laura Ingalls to your 
                        Lady Chatterly and, now all of a 
                        sudden, you feel the need to warn me

                        guess it's true.  You're a fucktart.

                        Oh yeah.  I totally want to lose my 
                        virginity to one of your dumb 
                        brother's dumb friends and then be the 
                        first for a fairy, while everyone 
                        listens outside!  What is wrong with 
                        you?  Does sex mean anything to you?

                        Yes!  It's a period of time, however 
                        short, that I don't have to talk to 
                        you!

           She slams the phone shut and seethes.

           Olive, visibly upset, is cutting something, meticulously, out of 
           red fabric.  In fact, she has yards of red fabric draped across 
           her lap.  When she finishes the shape, she tosses it behind her 
           and begins another one.

           she finishes one piece, as before, she tosses it behind her and 
           grabs another item from the crumpled wardrobe on her floor.  In 
           the middle of this the door opens.  It's Dill.

           Olive looks up at her dad.  It's a real moment.  He really

           Clad in sunglasses, do-me-boots and looking like a bona fide 
           porn star, Olive struts down the halls of her school.  Sewn 
           across her larger and pushed up breasts is a fiery red "A."  
           Erections are popping up all along the halls, as well as looks 
           of total disbelief from the girls.  She stops at one average-
           looking kid who stares into her eyes.  She points to her chest--

                        Hey, pal.  My boobs are down here.

           She moves the stunned kid.  Up ahead, Rhiannon is yakking with a 
           semi-attractive guy named Anson (17).  She catches sight of 
           Olive and her jaw drops.  Olive sidles up to Anson, much to 
           Rhiannon's chagrin.

           Olive emerges from the girl's locker room building, dressed for

                        Who doesn't remember their first

           Olive stands there, smitten.  Just then a terrified fat kid 
           named Evan nervously approaches.

                                 EVAN
                        Hey, Olive.

                        Can I talk to you for a second?

           He gestures for her to jog up the stairs with him, as the other 
           kids are doing.  She does so.

                                 EVAN (CONT'D)
                        Don't get mad, but Brandon told me 
                        what you did for him.

                                 OLIVE

           She's pissed.  She silently seethes.

                        And I was just hoping that maybe you 
                        could do the same for me?

                                 OLIVE

                        I mean at the rate you're going, I'm

           He sits down and wipes his forehead, already sweating from the 
           few steps climbed.

           Again, the camera goes into HYPERDRIVE. But even faster than 
           before.  As everyone stays in real time the camera zooms past 
           Evan to a group of boys in the middle of the field.  One boy 
           gets out his cellphone and starts texting away.  The camera 
           drives into the locker room, out the back, across the parking 
           lot, into the school, down the halls, through the library, up 
           onto the roof, down onto the front steps, and back across the 
           football field to Olive who has just reached the top of the 
           steps.  She turns for her descent to see everyone looking at 
           her.

                        open for business.  And I had a lot of 
                        customers.  None of whom I'd text home 
                        about.  I know I was a fake prostitute 
                        and all, but people suck.  Not fake

                        Movie Passes.

           Over the following Olive orders a ticket to a movie, but the box 
           office attendant points to a sign that says "NO PASSES."

                        always ends up great and hopeful and

                        Assumed Trollop To an Actual Home-
                        Wrecker.

           INT. CLASSROOM - ANOTHER DAY

           Mr. Griffin is grading papers.  Olive pokes her head in.

                                 OLIVE
                        You wanted to see me?

                                 MR. GRIFFIN
                        Yeah, Olive.  Come squat a pop.
           She takes a seat opposite his desk.  He points to the red "A" on 
           her chest.

                                 MR. GRIFFIN
                        What are you doing?

                                 OLIVE
                        Accessorizing?

                                 MR. GRIFFIN
                        Come on, Olive.  Don't you think maybe 
                        you're reading a little too much into 
                        this assignment?

                                 OLIVE
                        Well, I'm really hoping to get an A.
                             (re: her chest)
                        Get it?  Get it?

                                 MR. GRIFFEN
                        I got it.  
                             (then)
                        I'm hearing things, Olive.

                                 OLIVE
                             (deep breath)
                        The rumors are true.  I am, in fact, 
                        considering becoming an 
                        existentialist.

                                 MR. GRIFFIN
                        You know what I'm talking about.

                                 OLIVE
                        Geez, since when did teachers become 
                        privy to idle, adolescent gossip?

                                 MR. GRIFFEN
                        Since everyone puts everything up on 
                        Facebook for the world to see.  What's 
                        with this need your generation has to 
                        document every single thought that 
                        ever enters your head?  They're not 
                        all gems, you know.  "Roman is having 
                        an okay day and hopes the ice cream 
                        store still has rocky road." Who gives 
                        a rat's ass?

                                 OLIVE
                        Great social commentary.  Really heady 
                        stuff.  Is that why you called me in?  
                        You practicing to go on Carson?
                                 MR. GRIFFIN
                        I guess it wouldn't matter so much if 
                        I didn't like you.  You're a great 
                        girl and I happen to think that all 
                        of... this is just an act.  I'm just 
                        curious why you're doing it.

           Olive drops her defenses and gets real.

                                 OLIVE
                        Have you ever decided just to play 
                        along?  Because it's maybe easier than 
                        fighting tooth-and-nail to defend it?

                                 MR. GRIFFIN
                        I just don't want to see this... 
                        damage you.

                                 OLIVE
                        You know, I think you should give me 
                        extra credit for going the extra mile.  
                        I'm really attempting to understand 
                        this puritanical ostracism  Hawthorne 
                        wrote about.

                                 MR. GRIFFEN
                        You're one of the few who've actually 
                        read the book.  If I get one more 
                        paper talking about how Hester always 
                        took baths and spoke with a terrible 
                        British accent...

                                 OLIVE
                        Why don't people just Wikipedia it 
                        like I did?

                                 MR. GRIFFIN
                        You didn't Wikipedia it.  I know you 
                        read it.

                                 OLIVE
                             (caught)
                        I did.

                                 MR. GRIFFIN
                             (smiles)
                        I'm really sorry I had to send you to 
                        the principal.  If you tell anybody, 
                        I'll deny it, but I really wanted to 
                        cheer with the rest of the class.

                                 OLIVE
                             (smiles)
                        You know I won't tell.
           She gets up to leave and passes a beautiful woman in the 
           doorway.  This is Mrs. Griffin (early 30s).  

                                 OLIVE
                        Hey, Mrs. Griffin.

                                 MRS. GRIFFIN
                             (no idea who she is)
                        Hi... you!  How are you?

                                 OLIVE
                             (re her 'A')
                        A is for Awesome.

           Olive disappears into the empty halls.

                                 MRS. GRIFFIN
                        I've never seen that girl before in my 
                        life.

                                 MR. GRIFFIN
                        That doesn't surprise me.

                                 MRS. GRIFFIN
                        I'm the guidance counselor.  I should 
                        know all of the students.  Especially 
                        the ones dressed like whores.

           He kisses her.  It's a real kiss.  He starts to grab her butt.  
           She stops him.

                                 MRS. GRIFFIN (CONT'D)
                        Not in school.  You know the rule.

                                 MR. GRIFFIN
                        She's just going through a phase.
                             (then)
                        Hey, do you think you could talk to 
                        her?  Maybe get her to, I don't know--

                                 MRS. GRIFFIN
                        Sure.  Yeah, whatever.  Oh wait, 
                        That's not the girl everyone's talking 
                        about, is it?

                                 MR. GRIFFIN
                        Yeah.

                                 MRS. GRIFFIN
                        Oh, this'll be good.  That snotty 
                        Jesus-freak office aid has been 
                        bitching about her incessantly.
                                 MR. GRIFFIN
                        It's all lies.  Talk to her.  Maybe 
                        that's all she needs.

                                 MRS. GRIFFIN
                        What are you making for dinner 
                        tonight?

                                 MR. GRIFFIN
                        Is it my turn?

                                 MRS. GRIFFIN
                        Sure is.  I'm meeting up with the 
                        girls at happy hour.

                                 MR. GRIFFIN
                        Don't have too much fun.

                                 MRS. GRIFFIN
                        I never do.

           He kisses her and tries to go in for the butt again.  No dice.

           INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE SCHOOL GYM - THE NEXT MORNING

           A piece of paper is taped to the double doors: "RESERVED: CROSS 
           YOUR HEART CLUB."

           INT. SCHOOL GYM - THE NEXT MORNING

           Light streams through the windows.  It's very biblical.  A group 
           of well-dressed Christian kids sit in a semi-circle near the 
           light.  Marianne is the leader, Nina by her side.

                                 MARIANNE
                        Heavenly Father, watch over us with 
                        Your all-encompassing love.  Keep us 
                        on the path toward Your righteousness 
                        and eternal salvation.

           They all smile, say "Amen," and open their eyes.

                                 MARIANNE
                        Guys.  We have a problem.

                                 NINA
                        Amen to that.

                                 MARIANNE
                        Olive Penderghast.  We need to pray 
                        for her, but we also need to get her 
                        the hell out of here.

           Everyone "Amens."
                                 MARIANNE
                        I'm sure, by now, you've all heard 
                        about what happened at Melanie 
                        Bostic's party.

                                 CHRISTIAN KID #1
                        I was there.  I heard the whole thing.

                                 MARIANNE
                        That's not something you need to 
                        advertise, Kurt.

                                 KURT
                             (sheepishly)
                        Sorry.

                                 MARIANNE
                        See, herein lies the problem: She's 
                        doing these tasteless, immoral acts in 
                        plain view of the entire student body.  
                        She's in direct opposition to 
                        everything we're trying to do for this 
                        school, which is make it a wholesome 
                        learning environment and a place where 
                        our children will one day flourish the 
                        way we are.

           Everyone "Amens."

                                 MARIANNE
                        She was sent to the principal's office 
                        last week--

                                 NINA
                             (interrupting)
                        She called me a really hurtful name.

                                 MARIANNE
                        --and I tried to witness to her, but 
                        she's defiant to any sort of help.
                             (tears up)
                        I don't know what to do, but something 
                        has to be done.

           Her boyfriend, Micah (19) takes her hand and holds it.  She 
           leans against his shoulder, wiping away tears.  Nina begins 
           rubbing her shoulder, sympathetically.

                                 MARIANNE
                        Does anybody here think they can talk 
                        to her in a way that might get her to 
                        see what she's doing is wrong?

           She suddenly bursts into sobs.  And these aren't crocodile 
           tears.  She is flooded with emotion.
                                 MARIANNE
                        I'm sorry.  This is so stupid.

                                 MICAH
                        No, it's not, Marianne.  It's real.

                                 MARIANNE
                        Jesus tells us to love everyone.  Even 
                        the whores and the homosexuals, but 
                        it's so hard.

           Everyone "Amens."

                                 MARIANNE
                        It's so hard, because they just keep 
                        doing 'it' over and over again.

           She takes Micah and Nina's hands, the rest of the group follows 
           suit.

                                 MARIANNE
                        Make me a promise.  Make God a promise 
                        right here and now that we will remain 
                        pure and chaste until marriage.
                             (looking to Micah)
                        Until our love is proven holy in His 
                        eyes.

                                 EVERYONE
                        We promise.

                                 MARIANNE
                        Awww, I love you guys.  God loves you 
                        guys.  Now let's change lives today.  
                        Micah, hit it.

           Micah picks up a guitar and starts playing "Alive" by P.O.D.  
           They break out in song--

                                 EVERYONE
                        I feel so alive.  For the very first 
                        time.  I can't deny you I feel so 
                        alive.  I feel so alive for the very 
                        first time.  And I think I can fly!  

           INT. FRONT OFFICE - NEXT DAY

           Olive is sitting in the office, dressed just as slutty as the 
           day before with a red 'A' sewn onto her top.  Marianne is behind 
           the desk, sharpening pencils.  After each one, she observes the 
           point with a scary satisfaction.  They exchange a few hateful 
           glances at each other.  Mrs. Griffin pokes her head out of her 
           office.
                                 MRS. GRIFFIN
                        Hey,  Olive.  Wanna come in?

           Olive, in no mood for this, drags herself up dramatically.  She 
           turns back to Marianne and, for her benefit, hikes up her skirt 
           and pulls down her cleavage.

           INT. GUIDANCE OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Olive sits across from Mrs. Griffin.

                                 MRS. GRIFFIN
                        The reason I called you down here is 
                        just so that we could, sort of, you 
                        know, chat about what's going on.

                                 OLIVE
                        I love me some chatting.

                                 MRS. GRIFFIN
                        There's been some concern from faculty 
                        members.

                        Your husband.

           Mrs. Griffin shifts uncomfortably in her chair.  There's 
           something a little unnerving about this kid's awareness.

                                 MRS. GRIFFIN
                        Olive, you're attempting to make a 
                        statement.  We get that.  I'm just 
                        confused as to what exactly it is.

                        fingertips.

                                 MRS. GRIFFIN
                        You're not in trouble.  I just wanted 
                        you to know that if there was 
                        something you maybe needed to talk 
                        about, that you could trust me.

                        If I open up to you, do you promise 
                        this stays in confidence?

                                 MRS. GRIFFIN
                        Yes.

                        ironically.

           Mrs. Griffin rolls her eyes.

                        Don't you, though?

           Olive assesses this statement from her.

                                 OLIVE

                        considering meth addiction, just so I 
                        can come back and we can jawbone some

                        No.  No Juno for me, thanks.

           Mrs. Griffin pulls out a handful of condoms from her purse.

           Olive sees that Mrs. Griffin is genuinely concerned.

                        I really don't need those.

           She puts them in Olive's hand and clenches it closed.  Olive 
           looks at them.  Then back at Mrs. Griffin.

                                 OLIVE

                        you are, Godspeed.  Just make sure you 
                        have an exit strategy.

           Shit.  She really cares.  And she's making sense.

                                 OLIVE
                        The thing is, Mrs. Griffin, I don't 
                        really need this because--

                        Enough!  Just take them!

           Olive's confession thwarted yet again, she slowly puts them in 
           her pocket.

                                 OLIVE

           Marianne is talking to Micah, who seems distressed.  He rubs his 
           eyes, like he's been crying.

                        his help when they're finally ready to

           just cries on her shoulder.

                        not your fault.

           She looks around as if to say "why the hell am I doing this?"

           Olive didn't expect this embrace to last this long.

                                 OLIVE
                        How long do these embraces usually

                        she's going to help Micah through this 
                        time and everything's going to be

                        Why are you being so nice to me?

                        I did it!  I got through to you!

           This triggers even more wails from Marianne, who grabs Olive and 
           squeezes her tightly.

                        friends.  Please be my friend.

           Olive is really confused by this display.  She's about to say 
           something snide, but thinks better of it--

                                 OLIVE

           Marianne pulls away again and manages to smile at her, warmly.

                        good friends.  But I just went with 
                        it.  And I was really starting to 
                        think things were going to turn 
                        around.

           Marianne, angry as hell, stomps through the hall with hatred 
           burning in her eyes and coursing through her veins.

                        boyfriend a venereal disease...

           Marianne stops in front of Olive and slaps her so hard that 
           people in the hallways stop, dead in their tracks.

           INT. GUIDANCE OFFICE - DAY

           Olive bursts into Mrs. Griffin's office.  Tear-streaked, Mrs. 
           Griffin is packing her things into a cardboard box.  It's as if 
           her world has just collapsed.

           Olive starts to say something, but Mrs. Griffin can't even look 
           at her.

           The Cross Your Heart Club is assembled outside of the school, 
           waving signs on wooden stakes.  "EXPEL OLIVE," "EXODUS 20:14," 
           "SCHOOLS ARE FOR LEARNING, NOT FOR WHORING," "OLIVE PENDERGHAST

           spinning it like those guys on the corner.  What's most 
           shocking, however, is that Rhi is among the throng, as riled up 
           as any.

                        something I knew wasn't true, my best 
                        friend included, I couldn't help but 
                        think how I could have come up with 
                        better signs.  No one even bothered to 
                        use alliteration or, God forbid, 
                        irony.  Not even a single acronym and 
                        that seems a lot more unforgivable 
                        than my sins.  Although you gotta love 
                        the Quiznos guy.  That's the one thing 
                        that trumps religion: capitalism.

           Olive descends into her lion's den and grabs Rhi.

                                 OLIVE
                        Why are you doing this?

                                 RHIANNON
                        I'm trying to make this school a  
                        better place.

                                 OLIVE
                        Can't we just start a petition to get 
                        the Drama kids to sell Mike&Ikes 
                        instead of M&Ms?

                                 RHIANNON
                        You're going down, Olive Penderghast.

                                 OLIVE
                        Why are you being so mean to me?  
                        You're supposed to be my best friend!

                                 RHIANNON
                        I was.  But you dumped me.

                                 OLIVE
                        Dumped you?  We're not dating.  And 
                        you don't even know what Exodus 20:14 
                        means.

           Poking her hard in the chest--

                                 RHIANNON
                        No.  You don't know what Exodus 20:14 
                        means.

                                 THE QUIZNOS GUY
                        Oooo!  Slam-buca, served cold!
                                 OLIVE
                        Piss off, Quiznos dude.  
                             (to Rhiannon)
                        If this is because I'm more popular 
                        than you, then I really think--

                                 RHIANNON
                        Let's not mistake popularity for 
                        infamy.

           The protesters begin shouting at Olive.  She turns and heads 
           off.  And bumps smack-dab into... Woodchuck Todd.

                                 OLIVE
                        Sorry.

           She puts her head down and starts off but he takes her arm.

                                 WOODCHUCK TODD
                        You okay?

                                 OLIVE
                        I'm awesome.

           He looks deep into her eyes.

                                 WOODCHUCK TODD
                        Fuck all these people.

                                 OLIVE
                        Haven't you heard?  I already did.

           She hustles off.

           INT. BOOKSTORE - DAY

           Olive finds the Religion section.  She scans the shelves until 
           she finds a King James Bible.  She thumbs through until she 
           finds Exodus 20:14.  "Thou shall not commit adultery."  She 
           gasps and slams the book shut.

           EXT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - DAY

           Olive walks up and opens the big doors.

           INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

           It's empty.  A few candles are burning.  She makes a beeline for 
           the confessional booth, takes a deep breath and enters.

           INT. CONFESSIONAL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           She sits down and begins to talk to the screen.
                                 OLIVE
                        Forgive me, father, for I have sinned.  
                        I think that's how you're supposed to 
                        start these things.  I'm only going on 
                        what I've seen in the movies.  Then I 
                        think I'm supposed to tell you how 
                        long it's been since my last 
                        confession.  But that's kind of my 
                        first confession.  I'm not Catholic.  
                        I really don't know what I'm supposed 
                        to do, except sit here and tell you 
                        what I've done wrong.  So here goes.
                             (then)
                        I've been pretending to be a-- how 
                        would one phrase it in Catholic words?  
                        A harlot.  It's not like I've actually 
                        been doing the things that people are 
                        saying I'm doing, but then again, I'm 
                        not denying them, so I've just been 
                        wondering: is that wrong?  There's a 
                        lot of bad stuff going down at my 
                        school which may or may not be 
                        indirectly because of this masquerade.
                             (then)
                        I'm lying.  You caught me.  I may have 
                        caused the end of a marriage.  In my 
                        own perverse way, I thought I could 
                        help it.  In my defense, I might talk 
                        like an adult but I am merely an 
                        adolescent.  I should never have even 
                        been propositioned in the way I was 
                        propositioned by an adult.  But then 
                        again, I should never have consented.  
                        It was just that a lot of people had 
                        been asking me to do things and I 
                        thought it was okay, because it wasn't 
                        real.  It was make-believe and no one 
                        was getting hurt.  But a lot of people 
                        hate me now.  I kind of hate me, too.

           There's a long silence.  Olive tears up and wipes them away.

                                 OLIVE (CONT'D)
                        I could be wrong, but aren't you 
                        supposed to say something or ask me 
                        questions?  Tell me to say ten Hail 
                        Marys, pay a fine, advance token to 
                        nearest Railroad?  Hello?

           She peers through the screen.  There's no one there.

                                 OLIVE
                        Oh, fuck me!

           She throws the curtain to the booth open and stomps out.
           EXT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - DAY

           Olive, upset at herself, storms out and starts running down the 
           sidewalk.  She's never felt more alone and lost.  Olive runs for 
           a little while longer and then turns a corner.  Where she comes 
           across a Presbyterian Church.

           INT. CHURCH OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Olive enters to find a sweet, portly Receptionist, 50s who is 
           searching through religious clip-art on her computer The lady 
           smiles, acknowledging Olive.

                                 OLIVE
                        Hi.  I was wondering if the minister 
                        was around?

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                             (super enthusiastic)
                        Pastor McGreevey is on vacation this 
                        week.  But our associate pastor is in.  
                        Would you like to speak to him?

                                 OLIVE
                             (matches her enthusiasm)
                        Actually, that would be fantastic!

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Can I tell him what this is regarding?

                                 OLIVE
                        I'm looking for a church to join and I 
                        thought he might be able to sell me on 
                        this fine establishment.

           The receptionist joyfully snatches up the phone.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Donald, there's a young lady here who 
                        would like to speak with you about 
                        joining.  Uh-huh...  Okey-dokey.
                             (points to an office)
                        You can go right in!

                                 OLIVE
                        If everyone here is as friendly as 
                        you, I think we might be in business.

           She winks at the receptionist and crosses off.

           INT. ASSOCIATE PASTOR'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Associate Pastor Donald is a gangly, borderline creepy man.
                                 ASSOCIATE PASTOR DONALD
                        Hello, young lady.  My name is 
                        Associate Pastor Donald.  How can I 
                        help you today?

           He extends his hand and she shakes it.

                                 OLIVE
                        Well, I'm new to the area, Associate 
                        Pastor Donald.  And I'm looking for a 
                        church.  Hopefully something with a 
                        strong fellowship, a firm foot in the 
                        soil of... divinity.  And was 
                        wondering what your church's stance on 
                        lying and adultery was?

           Don seems taken aback by the question.

                                 ASSOCIATE PASTOR DONALD
                        Well.  It's not a good thing.

                                 OLIVE
                        Oh, I agree.  Wholeheartedly.  But 
                        tell me: assuming there is a hell--

                                 ASSOCIATE PASTOR DONALD
                        The Presbyterian Church recognizes the 
                        existence of hell.

                                 OLIVE
                        Okay, fine.  Let's say hell exists.  
                        Which is worse: lying or adultery?  Or 
                        is lying about adultery like a double 
                        whammy?

                                 ASSOCIATE PASTOR DONALD
                        I'm sorry, young lady, I-- what did 
                        you say your name was?

           At that moment, Olive looks at his desk and sees a framed family 
           photo.  Smiling big are Associate Pastor Donald, his wife, a 
           woman with a smile the size of Montana, and his lovely 
           daughter... Marianne Bryant!  Olive jumps from up from her chair 
           and knocks it over by accident.  She goes to catch it and knocks 
           some books off his desk, one of them the Bible.

                                 OLIVE
                        You know what?  I think I'm just going 
                        to go and check out Judaism.
                             (backs up to the door)
                        The Jews and I have a lot in common.  
                        Fashion-wise.  And Florida.  I love 
                        the heat.  Thank you for your time.

           She bolts from his office.
           INT. PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Olive bursts past the receptionist and out the door.

           EXT. PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

           Olive takes off running down the sidewalk.

                                 OLIVE (V.O.)
                        Yes.  I had unwittingly sought advice 
                        from the father of the leader of my 
                        lynch mob.  What other complete and 
                        total idiot can say that's happened to 
                        them?

           INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY

                                 OLIVE
                             (into webcam)
                        As much as I want to say I hate 
                        Marianne.  I don't.  I get her.  Well, 
                        I get certain things about her.  She's 
                        passionate.  Like myself.  She always 
                        thinks she's right.  Like myself.  
                        And, yeah, I can kind of understand 
                        why she slapped me that day.  Here's 
                        what happened...

           INT.  HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY

           Marianne, excitedly, runs over to Olive who is just getting to 
           school and throws her arms around her.

                                 OLIVE (V.O.)
                        Remember how I said we were BFFs for, 
                        like, a day.  Well, that's true.  It 
                        was like we were sisters all of a 
                        sudden.

           Marianne can't seem to break the embrace and Olive just goes 
           with it.  Rhiannon watches this and couldn't be more pissed.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Olive sits in class.  Marianne texts her.

                                 OLIVE (V.O.)
                        She texted me in first period.

           Olive reads it.  "HEY GIRLIE! HANG AFTR SKL 2DAY?  XOXOX"  
           Marianne looks back and Olive gives her the thumbs up.  Across 
           the room, Rhi sees this exchange and sneers.
           INT. CHEMISTRY LAB - LATER

           Marianne is working with her partner, Evan.

                                 OLIVE (V.O.)
                        By second period, we apparently had 
                        private jokes.

           Marianne turns to Olive behind them and makes a gagging signal 
           behind his back and laughs.  Olive, unaware of how to respond, 
           matches her laugh and gives another thumbs up.

           INT. HOME EC CLASSROOM - LATER

           The students are all making a five layer parfait.  Marianne 
           ruses in, tear-streaked.  She runs over to Olive and again 
           throws her arms around her.

                                 OLIVE (V.O.)
                        Tragedy struck in third period.

                                 MARIANNE
                        Micah's in the hospital.  He's in so 
                        much pain!  The nurse didn't know what 
                        was wrong.

           Olive just holds her new friend, as she had the day before.

                                 OLIVE
                        He'll be okay.  There there.

                                 MARIANNE
                             (tears in her eyes)
                        Really?

           Olive guides Marianne's head back to her shoulder.  She tastes 
           some parfait with her free hand.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Marianne's boyfriend Micah writhes in pain on a hospital bed, 
           clutching his crotch.  His worried mother is beside him.

                                 MICAH
                        It hurts so bad, Mommy.

           A doctor enters, with a satisfied smile and a diagnosis.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Well, it's what I thought.  Chlamydia.

           Micah and his mother both look up in shock.  His mother takes 
           both of her hands and begins slapping him, uncontrollably.
                                 MICAH'S MOTHER
                        How did you get chlamydia?  Who have 
                        you been screwing?!  Tell me!  Tell me 
                        now, or I'll kill you right here!

           Micah, in pain from the burning sensation and his mother's hands 
           flying at astonishing speed shouts out--

                                 MICAH
                        Olive!  Olive Penderghast!

           INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

           Micah's mother is on her cell phone.

                                 MICAH'S MOTHER
                             (angrily)
                        Olive Penderghast.

           INT. PERFECTLY APPOINTED KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           The woman on the other end of the phone is a woman with a smile 
           the size of Montana: Marianne's mother.  She hangs up.  With a 
           grimace the size of Montana.

                                 MARIANNE'S MOTHER
                        Goddamn it!

           She picks up the phone and dials a number.  She talks and 
           gestures animatedly as Olive narrates--

                                 OLIVE (V.O.)
                        Fourth period was when Marianne had 
                        office duty.  Her duties included 
                        typing, stapling, filing and...

           INT. FRONT OFFICE - DAY

           Marianne is on the phone, listening, with mouth agape.  She's 
           just heard from her mother that her boyfriend has chlamydia.

                                 OLIVE (V.O.)
                        ...answering the phones.

                                 MARIANNE
                             (screams)
                        Chlamydia!

           Birds fly off the windowsill.  Mrs. Griffin comes out of her 
           office, a panicked expression on her face.
           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

                                 MARIANNE'S MOTHER
                             (seething)
                        Olive Penderghast.

           She hears static on the phone.

           INT. FRONT OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Marianne jams the phone in the cradle.

                                 MRS. GRIFFIN
                        Are you okay, hon?

           Like a teapot about to start expelling steam, Marianne quivers 
           in rage.  Finally, at boiling point, she shouts--

                                 MARIANNE
                        That--

           But her long string of profanities is muffled by the long 
           ringing of the school bell.  The bell ends.

                                 MARIANNE
                        --'cking hell!

           She turns and tears out of the office.

           INT.  HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           As we saw before, Marianne stomps through the hall with hatred 
           burning in her eyes and coursing through her veins.

                                 OLIVE (V.O.)
                        Okay, I exaggerated.  We were just 
                        BFFs for, like, a half-a-day.

           Marianne stops in front of Olive and slaps her so hard that 
           people in the hallways stop, dead in their tracks.

                                 OLIVE
                             (clutching her face)
                        Motherfucker!

           Rhi, who was loading books in her locker, sees this and happily 
           slams her locker shut.  Breezing past her--

                                 RHIANNON
                        My sentiments exactly.

           On Olive.
           EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT - DAY

           Micah's on his cell phone, smoking a cigarette.  He checks every 
           few seconds to see if his mother is on her way out.

                                 MICAH
                        I didn't know what to say!  I 
                        panicked!  I said I got it from Olive 
                        Penderghast...  I know, but what was I 
                        supposed to say?!  And then my mom 
                        called her mom...  No, not Olive's, 
                        Marianne's!...  I tried to blame it on 
                        their divorce, but my mom's not buying 
                        it.  I have to tell them...  Okay.  
                        But I don't care if you gave me 
                        chlamydia.  I love you and I want to 
                        be with you and no one can stop us.  
                        Not my mother, not Marianne, not the 
                        school board--

           INT. GUIDANCE OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Mrs. Griffin slams the phone shut on her teenage lover and 
           begins freaking out.  She grabs a box and starts throwing stuff 
           in it.  Just then Olive bursts in.  And as we saw before--

                                 MRS. GRIFFIN
                             (snaps)
                        What?!  What do you want?

           Olive starts to say something, but Mrs. Griffin can't even look 
           at her.

                                 MRS. GRIFFIN
                        Just go!

           She throws a framed photo of her and Mr. Griffin into the box.  
           It shatters.  Mrs. Griffin falls apart.

                                 MRS. GRIFFIN
                        That's perfect.  Just perfect.

           Olive is stunned.

                                 OLIVE
                        I'm sorry, I was just looking for 
                        Marianne.  Did she say something about 
                        being mad at me?  She just smacked the 
                        b'Jesus out of me.

           This makes Mrs. Griffin cry even harder.
                                 MRS. GRIFFIN
                        It's my fault.  I'm so sorry, Olive.  
                        I fucked up.  I fucking fucked up so 
                        fucking bad.  I'm a fucking.... Fuck.

                                 OLIVE
                        Don't get me wrong, I love it.  But I 
                        don't think you're supposed to use 
                        that language around a student.

                                 MRS. GRIFFIN
                        Yeah, well, you're not supposed to 
                        fuck them either.  But that didn't 
                        stop me.

           Olive puts two and two together in her head.  She gasps a little 
           louder than she planned.

                                 OLIVE
                        You and-- Oh my God.  I'm not judging 
                        you or anything, but oh my God.
                             (then)
                        Wait.  What does that have to do with 
                        me?

           Mrs. Griffin walks over and locks her office door.  She fights 
           back more tears, as she tries to explain to Olive.

                                 OLIVE (V.O.)
                        My guidance counselor, who had only 
                        days before armed me with a latex 
                        bulletproof vest, told me that she had 
                        chlamydia and that she had been 
                        screwing around with her office aide's 
                        boyfriend under the guise of divorce 
                        counseling.  She confided in me that 
                        she and her husband, my favorite 
                        teacher, were having marital problems, 
                        that they hadn't slept together in 
                        months.  She assured me she had never 
                        meant for anything to happen with 
                        Micah, but he was of legal age so they 
                        didn't technically, legally do 
                        anything wrong.  And that after Micah 
                        found about the aforementioned 
                        chlamydia he panicked and used me as a 
                        scapegoat, to save her job and her 
                        marriage.  She promised me she would 
                        make sure everyone knew the truth and 
                        apologized.  But in much saltier 
                        language.

           Mrs. Griffin stops talking and waits for Olive to speak.
                                 OLIVE (V.O.)
                        And I bought it.  Why?  I don't really 
                        know.  I just did.

           Olive gives her a reassuring smile, and offers up a solution.

                                 OLIVE
                        I could have chlamydia.  And I could 
                        easily have given it to Micah.  Who 
                        knows?  Often times women don't have 
                        symptoms and the whole world knows I 
                        have been whoring around...

                                 MRS. GRIFFIN
                        No, you haven't.

           Olive looks at her, puzzled by her knowledge.

                                 MRS. GRIFFIN
                        Because a real whore can't admit it to 
                        herself, let alone others.  Trust me.

           She begins to weep.  Olive puts her hand on her shoulder.

                                 OLIVE
                        Call Micah.  Tell him I said he's an 
                        ass and that he owes me so big for 
                        this and also the time I pretended not 
                        to see him during that third grade 
                        game of hide and seek.  Tell him I 
                        still remember that.  But tell him I 
                        confessed to giving him chlamydia.

           Mrs. Griffin grabs Olive and cries on her.

                                 OLIVE (CONT'D)
                        And it's not really my place to say 
                        this, but I figure after the 
                        conversation we just had, I can speak 
                        candidly.  Your husband is one USDA
                        Grade A great dude.  If I were you, 
                        I'd go home and seduce him and pretend 
                        this never happened.

           Olive strokes her guidance counselor's hair.

                                 MRS. GRIFFIN
                             (sniveling)
                        Do you want some more condoms?

                                 OLIVE
                             (maternally)
                        No, you keep them.  And make sure you 
                        use them tonight.
           INT. PENDERGHAST LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The Penderghasts are assembled for family movie night in front 
           of their TV.  Rosemary and Ginger are under a blanket and Dill 
           is digging through the DVDs.  Olive seems distracted.

                                 DILL
                        Okay, so I've narrowed it down to The 
                        Other Boleyn Girl or The Bucket List.

                                 GINGER
                        Why can't we watch a movie for kids?  
                        You always get to pick.

                                 DILL
                        That's because it's up to the "Family 
                        Member of the Week" to pick the movie.

                                 GINGER
                        But he gets "Family Member of the 
                        Week" every week.

                                 ROSEMARY
                        And there's a reason for that.

                                 GINGER
                        Yeah, you decide who gets "Family 
                        Member of the Week."

                                 ROSEMARY
                        Are you accusing me of nepotism?

                                 DILL
                        The Bucket List it is.  
                             (to Rosemary)
                        Make sure after we watch it you cross 
                        "watching The Bucket List" off our 
                        bucket list.

                                 OLIVE
                        Hey, listen.  Just a heads up.  If you 
                        hear around town that I have 
                        chlamydia, I just want you to know 
                        it's totally false.

           INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY

                             (into webcam)
                        To say this whole thing had taken over 
                        my life would be a colossal 
                        understatement.  I actually reread 
                        "The Scarlet Letter" to see how Hester 
                        dealt with it.  Turns out she bore her 
                        punishment in "humble silence" -- two 
                        concepts I am not comfortable with.  
                        But back to my contemporary yarn.  How 
                        could I be angry at Marianne?  If some 
                        bimbo gave my boyfriend an STD, I'd 
                        have swung, but I'd have balled my 
                        fist.

                        With all the mythical play I was 
                        getting, I still hadn't actually been 
                        asked out on a real date.  Guys were 
                        jumping up and down to say they'd 
                        slept with me -- chlamydia be 
                        damned -- but no one bothered really 
                        trying to sleep with me.  I was 
                        starting to think I did have a gnome 
                        down there.  Until finally...

           EXT. PLAYGROUND - YEARS BEFORE

           Seven year-old Olive and Rhiannon chase a boy all over the 
           playground, desperate to kiss him.

                                 OLIVE (V.O.)
                        It was really Rhiannon who had a crush 
                        on him.  She has since we were little 
                        kids.

           Rhiannon finally catches him and kisses him on the cheek.  
           Repulsed, he wipes his face.  Rhiannon and Olive high five.

           INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

           Olive eats her lunch by herself.  Rhiannon sits at a different 
           table, mostly comprised of girls, and glares at her from across 
           the room.  Anson, the boy we saw earlier with Rhiannon,  
           approaches Olive.

                                 ANSON
                        Hey, Olive.

                                 OLIVE
                        Anson.  What's good?

                                 ANSON
                        I was wondering if you were busy 
                        tonight.  Maybe wanna go out or 
                        something?

                                 OLIVE
                        What'd you have in mind?

                                 ANSON
                        I don't know.  I was thinking about 
                        getting a hot air balloon, taking 
                        along some champagne and melon, and 
                        then trying to impress you by reading 
                        some Sylvia Plath.  

                                 OLIVE
                        Or we could just go to Red Lobster?  
                                 ANSON
                        I love Red Lobster!  Should I still 
                        bring the Sylvia Plath?

                                 OLIVE
                        Nah. We could always just stick our 
                        heads in the oven if we run out of 
                        things to talk about.

                                 ANSON
                        Cool. 

           Olive smiles like she's never smiled before.

           INT. RED LOBSTER - NIGHT

           Olive and Anson sit in a dimly-lit booth.  Olive looks 
           beautiful.  The 'A' on her shirt is sequined.

                                 OLIVE
                        I can't think of anything better than 
                        getting to select your dinner and have 
                        nice conversation while they boil it 
                        alive in the back.

                        lobster being an aphrodisiac?

                                 ANSON
                             (lying out his ass)
                        I didn't know it was.

                        You know, medical science has not 
                        substantiated claims that any 
                        particular food increases sexual 
                        desire or performance.  Yet guys spend 
                        and spend to ply women with food they 
                        think is gonna get them lucky.  I 
                        mean, what's really sexy about 
                        slurping back oysters?  Some people 
                        even eat ground up rhinoceros horn 
                        because it's thought to enlarge the 
                        male sex organ.  It's all bullshit.  
                        And Spanish fly?  It's actually 
                        pulverized blister beetle.  And it's 
                        illegal in the US because if you take 
                        just a bit too much, it causes painful 
                        urination, fever and bloody discharge.

           Anson gags.  A server appears with their lobster.
                                 SERVER

           Olive digs in.  Anson is nauseous and can't touch his.  From 
           across the restaurant, a parade of servers enters from the back, 
           enthusiastically clapping and holding a cupcake.  Leading the 
           brigade is Woodchuck Todd, who's wearing a red foam hat.  With 
           as much spirit, as he has as a Woodchuck--

           at a table in the next room.

           She hands it to the waitress, who leaves.

                                 ANSON
                        But I asked you out.

                                 OLIVE
                        And I ruined it so let me bear the 
                        financial brunt.
                             (beat)
                        I'm so sorry about this.  But she 
                        really likes you.
                                 ANSON
                        But Rhi and I just don't have that 
                        much in common.

                                 OLIVE
                        And you and I do?

                                 ANSON
                        Yeah.

                                 OLIVE
                        Like what?

                                 ANSON
                        I hate Marianne Bryant, too.

                                 OLIVE
                        Yeah well, if that's our magical 
                        connection, I should date the entire 
                        school.

                                 ANSON
                        Haven't you?

           Olive suddenly becomes self-conscious and a little bit pissed.

                                 OLIVE
                        Yeah, about that--

           The server reappears with the check.

                                 SERVER
                        You have a remaining balance of 
                        fourteen dollars and thirty six cents.

                                 OLIVE
                        Keep it.  Tip.

                                 SERVER
                        Thank you!  And thanks for making Red 
                        Lobster your choice for seafood 
                        tonight.  

           The sever smiles and leaves them again.

                                 OLIVE
                        Let's get out of here.

           They duck out of the booth trying to keep their heads down, but 
           Olive can't resist the urge to look up and see if Rhiannon sees 
           them.  She does.  Olive and Rhiannon make eye contact.  Whereas 
           Olive looks remorseful, Rhiannon looks like she's just been 
           stabbed in the back, which she has.  The Abernathys also see her 
           and wave, drunkenly -- knocking over glasses as they do.  Olive 
           just waves sheepishly and leaves with Anson.
           EXT. RED LOBSTER PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Olive and Anson sit in Anson's car.  Olive's face is painted 
           with guilt.  She feels like shit, but doesn't want to 
           externalize it.  Anson puts his hand on her knee.

                                 ANSON
                        I have something for you.

           Olive manages a smile.  He reaches into his pocket and pulls out 
           a gift card and hands it to her.

                                 ANSON (CONT'D)
                        $500 to the Home Depot.

                                 OLIVE
                        Oh.  I didn't realize that this was--

                                 ANSON
                        I know it sounds lame, but they've got 
                        awesome stuff.  I bought my air 
                        compressor there.

           Olive is disappointed, but tries not to show it.

                                 OLIVE
                        So, what did we 'do' on this date?

                                 ANSON
                        Whatever $500 gets me.

           He leans over and kisses her.  She pushes him off.

                                 OLIVE
                        Wait.  This isn't how it works.  I 
                        don't actually--

           But he's kissing her again, a little too forcibly.  She pushes 
           him off again.

                                 OLIVE (CONT'D)
                        You don't get it.  I'm not technically 
                        having sex with people for money.  You 
                        know that, right?  Besides, even if I 
                        was, we're in the parking lot of a Red 
                        Lobster.

                                 ANSON
                        We can go wherever you want.  But I 
                        think it'd be kind of hot here.

           He takes off his shirt.

                                 OLIVE
                        I gotta go.  It's been... sad.
           She gets out of the car.  He rolls down the window.

                                 ANSON
                        What are you doing?  I paid you!

           Olive throws the gift in the window.

                                 OLIVE
                        Now you didn't.

                                 ANSON
                        Come on, dude!  I'm popping some 
                        serious wood over here.

           Olive just shakes her head and walks off.  Tears form in her 
           eyes.  She starts to run through the parking lot.  Anson peels 
           out and drives off in the background.  Olive has never felt more 
           depressed.  She's now truly a prostitute.  At full speed she 
           tries to rip her 'A' off her chest, but it's sewed on too 
           tightly.  Just then Woodchuck Todd appears out nowhere, coming 
           out the back exit of Red Lobster.

                                 WOODCHUCK TODD
                        Hey, Olive!

           Olive stops in her tracks.

                                 OLIVE
                        Todd!

           Olive wipes the tears away.

                                 OLIVE
                        I got something in my eye.  Like a 
                        twig or a branch or a contact.

                                 WOODCHUCK TODD
                        I didn't know you wore contacts.

                                 OLIVE
                        I don't.  That's why I'm tearing up.

                                 WOODCHUCK TODD
                        What are you doing here?

                                 OLIVE
                        Oh, I'm just hanging out in the 
                        parking lot.  I do that sometimes.  
                        Not necessarily just here.  The one 
                        outside of Applebee's is fun, too.

                                 WOODCHUCK TODD
                             (laughs)
                        You want a ride somewhere?
                                 OLIVE
                        Nah. I'm fine.

                                 WOODCHUCK TODD
                        Your friend Rhi's inside.  It's her 
                        Mom's birthday.

           Tears begin to reappear in Olive's eyes.

                                 OLIVE
                        She's not my friend anymore.

                                 WOODCHUCK TODD
                        Let me drive you home.

           Todd puts his arm around her and leads her to his car.

           INT./EXT. WOODCHUCK TODD'S CAR - NIGHT

           Natasha Bedingfield's "Pocketful of Sunshine" plays on the 
           radio.  Olive is trying to pull herself together but she can't 
           stop crying as Todd drives her home.

                                 WOODCHUCK TODD
                        You wanna talk about it?

                                 OLIVE
                        What's to say?  I'm a horrible person.  
                        Everyone thinks I'm a whore and, for 
                        the first time, I'm starting to 
                        believe it.

                                 WOODCHUCK TODD
                        Huh?

                                 OLIVE
                        Oh, don't act like you don't know what 
                        people are saying about me.

                                 WOODCHUCK TODD
                        I know what people are saying.  
                        Doesn't mean I believe them.

                                 OLIVE
                        Why not?

                                 WOODCHUCK TODD
                        Contrary to my primatial gyrations on 
                        the gym floor, I'm not an idiot.  I 
                        know exactly what's going on and I 
                        know exactly what you're doing.

                                 OLIVE
                        Who told you?
                                 WOODCHUCK TODD
                        No one had to tell me.  All I know is 
                        once upon a time, there was a scared 
                        little kid in a closet at a party who 
                        wasn't ready for his first kiss and 
                        there was this amazing little girl who 
                        lied for him.

           She smiles through her tears.

                                 OLIVE
                        I still can't believe you remember 
                        that.

                                 WOODCHUCK TODD
                        I also remember that after I ran out 
                        you pulled Brandon in.  Yeah, I know 
                        about that, by the way.

                                 OLIVE
                        And look how he turned out.

                                 WOODCHUCK TODD
                        Sometimes I pretend you were my first 
                        real kiss.

                                 OLIVE
                             (laughs)
                        Yeah?  Who was?

                                 WOODCHUCK TODD
                        Rhiannon.  You know that.  She must've 
                        told you.  You guys are thick as car 
                        thieves.

                                 OLIVE
                        What?!

                                 WOODCHUCK TODD
                        Yeah.  About a year later.  It sucked.

                                 OLIVE
                        That bitch!  She knew how I felt about 
                        you!

                        feeling sooo bad and... that bitch!

                                 WOODCHUCK TODD

                        Felt.  I said felt.

                                 WOODCHUCK TODD
                        Oh.

           He stops the car.  They're at her house.

                                 OLIVE

                        We used to carpool.

                        Yeah, in second grade.  Are you like a 
                        savant for people's addresses?

                                 WOODCHUCK TODD
                        Just people who I think are cool.

                                 OLIVE
                        You think I'm cool?

                        I do.  And pretty.  And smart.

                                 OLIVE
                        And did you form this opinion prior to 
                        my little transformation...

                        Way prior.

                                 OLIVE
                        Wow.

                                 WOODCHUCK TODD
                        Yeah.

                                 WOODCHUCK TODD
                        I like to keep my business to myself.  
                        Notoriety, for whatever reason, never 
                        seems to benefit the noted, only the 
                        notees.

                                 OLIVE
                             (laughs)
                        Where were you two weeks ago?

           There's an awkward moment between them.
                                 WOODCHUCK TODD
                        Olive.  If I promise not to tell 
                        anyone, could I kiss you?

           Despite the fact that this is positively the most romantic 
           moment of her young life, Olive looks down.

                                 OLIVE
                        No.

                                 WOODCHUCK TODD
                        Oh.  Okay.  I'm sorry.

                                 OLIVE
                        No.  Just not tonight.  I don't want 
                        you to kiss me with mascara running 
                        down my cheek and some horndog just 
                        having forced his tongue down my 
                        throat.  I've wanted to kiss you since 
                        the eighth grade, but I want it to be 
                        perfect.  And right now, my life's a 
                        mess.  I need to get my "business" 
                        under control before I drag you into 
                        it.

                                 WOODCHUCK TODD
                        What if I told you I wanted to be 
                        dragged into it?  Maybe I could help.

           He holds out his hand and she takes it.

                                 OLIVE
                        No, this is all on me.  Rain check?

                                 WOODCHUCK TODD
                        Of course.

           He smiles his goofy grin and she embraces him.  She hops out of 
           the car and turns back--

                                 OLIVE
                        Why now?  Why are you suddenly into me 
                        now?

                                 WOODCHUCK TODD
                        I don't know.  I haven't over analyzed 
                        it.  Like you're about to.

           He smiles.  She smiles back and walks to her house.

                        there -- and stone cold foxy to boot -- 
                        I had a reason for things to go back 
                        to the way they were.  Telling lies 
                        was easy, telling the truth...  Not so 
                        much.  But I had to do it. And I knew 
                        I had to go to the one person I could 
                        count on to set the story straight.  
                        Brandon.  I'd helped him and, even 
                        though it would destroy his new 
                        reputation for being a straight stud, 
                        I knew he'd help me.

           INT.  HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           A gossipy girl in braces fill the frame--

                        ran away from home?  Yeah.  Totally.  
                        He left his parents a note that said:  
                        "F you, I'm gay."  Then he skipped 
                        town with a big, hulking black guy.

           We spin around to see Olive's stunned reaction.

                        It gets worse.  Due to his "condition" 
                        Micah was sent on an extended visit to 
                        his grandparents in Palatka, Florida.  
                        Palatka is Timucuan Indian for "real

                        diseased sexual partners.

           Olive waits for Mrs. Griffin's response.  There's a long moment 
           of contemplation on Mrs. Griffin's part.  Then--
                                 MRS. GRIFFIN
                        Olive, life is full of choices.  I 
                        made a bad one.  But then, so did you.  
                        We both acted unwisely, but I don't 
                        see any other alternative than to live 
                        with the guilt.  My guilt stems from 
                        my indiscretion, yours for lying.  
                        We've made our choices.  Now, we have 
                        to ride them out.

                                 OLIVE

                        let's play the "who do you believe" 
                        game.  Ask yourself, if you were an 
                        adult, who would you believe?

                                 OLIVE
                        With all due respect, Mrs. Griffin, go 
                        fuck yourself.  And use one of your 
                        condoms-- you wouldn't want to catch 
                        something nasty from yourself.

                                 MRS. GRIFFIN
                        Because you helped me once, I'm not 
                        going to report you to Principal 
                        Gibbons.  Now we're even.

           They're locked in a Mexican standoff.

                                 MRS. GRIFFIN
                        You can go now.

           Olive storms out.

           INT. MR. GRIFFIN'S CLASSROOM - DAY

           Mr. Griffin is erasing the blackboard, when Olive storms into 
           the room.

                                 OLIVE
                        Your wife has chlamydia and she's been 
                        sleeping with a student and she gave 
                        it to him and now she's trying to 
                        blame me.

           Shocked, Mr. Griffin drops the eraser.

                                 MR. GRIFFIN
                        What?
           The gravity of what she's just done sinks in and she stumbles.

                                 OLIVE
                        I-I-I'm sorry.  I--

                        Looking back, that's the thing I 
                        regret the most.  That's the thing 
                        that sent me to the church...es.  And 
                        that's the thing that made me realize 
                        how profoundly I'd screwed up.  And 
                        that's something I'll have to live 
                        with for the rest of my life.  With my 
                        words, even though they were true, I 
                        ended a marriage.  No kid should have 
                        to be burdened with that.  Although I 
                        don't really classify myself as a kid 
                        any more after all this.  God, 
                        adulthood's overrated.  Why are we all 
                        in such a fucking hurry?

           INT. MR. GRIFFIN'S CLASSROOM - DAY

           Olive sits and plays Jenga with Mr. Griffin, at his desk.  Both 
           are looking beaten down and very depressed and their minds are 
           on everything but the game.

                                 MR. GRIFFIN
                        It's not your fault.

           Olive gets a tear in her eyes.  She puts a block on the top and 
           it all topples.

                                 OLIVE
                        That's imagery for you.

           Mr. Griffin rakes the blocks into his own cardboard box, full of 
           his things.  She starts to well with tears.

                                 OLIVE
                        I'm so sorry.

                                 MR. GRIFFIN
                        No.  It's not your fault.  You wanted 
                        to right the wrongs.  Even if they 
                        weren't your wrongs to right. 

           He grasps her shoulders and looks her in the eyes.

                        when confronted with a problem:

                                 OLIVE
                        Montel Williams also said that.

                        that.  In that way.  At all.  I

           the school to see the demonstration.  Her jaw drops.  Things 
           have gotten way to out of hand.

                        I had a horrible reputation and people 
                        said awful things about me.

                        Because I was a slut.  A big old slut.  
                        I slept with a whole bunch of people.  
                        A slew.  A heap.  A peck.  Mostly

                        contortionist back then.  Plus let's 
                        not forget I had the boobs of a porn

                        that maybe the reason that Bryant girl

           INT.  HIGH SCHOOL GYM - DAY

           It's a big pep rally.  The dance team is dancing away attempting 
           to rile up the school with a wildly mediocre routine set to 
           "Umbrella" by Rihanna. They all hold umbrellas and open and 
           close them to the beat.  Almost.  In the stands, Rhi sits with 
           Marianne and Nina.

                                 MARIANNE
                        Olive wasn't at school today.

           She extends her palms to Nina and Rhi, who both slap them.  
           Marianne puts her arm around Rhi.

                                 MARIANNE
                        I'm so glad you're with us now.

                        Just say "effing" instead.

                                 RHIANNON
                        But isn't that just implying the same 
                        word?

                        teach you about Christianity.  It's 
                        okay to imply things.
                                 NINA
                        And even do things.

                        It's all about presentation.

           Rhiannon looks at her new best friends, who just smile at her.  
           The dance team ends their routine and the marching band starts a 
           drum roll.  Woodchuck Todd bounces out in costume pushing a 
           dumpster.  The band begins to a jazzy version of "Knock on 
           Wood."  Woodchuck Todd opens the lid of the dumpster and Olive 
           pops out.  She's dressed in a glittery and slinky red dress, 
           with a boa draped around her bare shoulder.  She sings into a 
           hand held mic:

                                 OLIVE
                        I don't want to lose you, this good

                        will surely, surely lose a lot.  
                        'Cause your love is better than any 
                        love I know.

           Todd lifts Olive out of the dumpster as she sings her ass off.  
           And she's actually really good.

                                 OLIVE (CONT'D)

                        better knock, on wood, baby.

           In the bleachers--

                        I'd better knock, on wood, baby.

           She rubs her hands seductively over Woodchuck Todd's furry 
           costume, eventually unzipping it and taking off the head to 
           reveal: Blue Devil Todd. The crowd goes wild.

           She walks up the stairs to Rhi and kisses her on the cheek, 
           leaving a big, red mark.

           She sees that Gibbons is not amused, but that doesn't stop her.  
           She walks over to a couple of horn players, and runs her fingers 
           seductively over their (uh) instruments.  The crowd goes wild - 
           some appalled, but most enthused.  Olive sashays through the 
           crowd as the guys scream and stuff money down her bodice.

                        the closet door for me to kiss Todd,

                        with Brandon, paying me to lie for

                        in school a whore.  It was just like

                        That's one thing the movie and

                        it feels to be the outcast.  Warranted 
                        or not.

           INTERCUT:

           Music: "Laid" by James.

           Todd is riding a lawn mower (a la Patrick Dempsey) and holding 
           up a boombox (a la John Cusack).  Olive bursts into laughter, 
           but it couldn't be more romantic.  She shouts down--

                        really in love with him.  And I am 
                        going to lose my virginity to him.  
                        I'm not sure when.  It could happen 
                        five minutes from now or tonight or 
                        six months from now or maybe on our 
                        wedding night.  But the really amazing 
                        thing is that it's nobody's goddamn
                        business.
                             (as an afterthought)
                        Like, totally?

           The screen goes dark.  Back to our camera: the room is empty.  
           Olive is gone.  After a beat, out the window WE SEE Olive 
           running across the grass.  She jumps on Todd and tackles him off 
           the mower, kissing him the whole way.  In broad daylight, for 
           the world to see.

           OVER CREDITS:

           INT. GYM - NIGHT

           The basketball game is going on to an almost empty gymnasium.  
           Maybe ten kids in the stands.  One of whom is staring intently 
           at his laptop.  It's Olive's webcam page.  And she's not in the 
           room.

                                 KID
                        What happened?  Where'd she go?

           MONTAGE

           We see, from the perspective of their computer screens, various 
           reactions to Olive's webcast--

           -- A proud Brandon watches from a hotel room.  A muscular black 
           guy comes up behind him and puts his arm around him.

           -- Mrs. Griffin watches with the face of a person who's been 
           found out and who's days are numbered.  They are.

           -- Rhi seems contemplative.  Maybe it's because she's been in 
           love with Olive since grade school.  Duh.
           -- Evan, the fat kid, is doing jumping jacks while eating 
           chocolate cake.

           -- Melanie Bostic watches with a group of girls.

                                 MELANIE
                        Told you guys.  Pay up.

           -- Marianne feels regret.  But a little bit impressed.

           -- Mr. Griffin is proud of her.

           -- Micah watches in his dark bedroom.

                                 MICAH'S GRANDMOTHER
                        Micah?  What are you doing in there?
                             (sternly)
                        You had better not be on the sin-
                        ternet.

           -- Rosemary and Dill are too busy making out to watch.  Ginger 
           is across the room holding a "King Fu Panda" DVD.

           -- Zia is on his bed with a bottle of moisturizing lotion and a 
           box of tissues.

                                 ZIA
                             (disappointed)
                        I thought she was going to take her 
                        clothes off.

           EXT. THE PENDERGHAST HOUSE - SAME

           Olive and Todd ride off on the lawnmower together.  They raise 
           their fists a la Judd Nelson in The Breakfast Club.

                                 OLIVE
                        Don't you forget about me.
