           INT. UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN GYM - EARLY MORNING

           Darkness.  One by one, the mercury vapor lights on the gym 
           ceiling are switched on.  As they begin to glow --

           INT. UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN GYM - EARLY MORNING

           MARK SCHULTZ (27 years old, muscular, 180 lbs., cauliflower 
           ears), tears a length of double-sided tape.  He re-tapes the 
           bottom of one of four huge wrestling mats to the gym floor.  
           The gym is large but rundown.  

           INT. UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN GYM - EARLY MORNING

           Mark carries a human-sized leather WRESTLING DUMMY over his 
           shoulder while dragging another onto the mats.  He drops the 
           dummy next to several others.  The slap of the leather on the 
           mat echoes in the empty gym.  

           INT. UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN WEIGHT ROOM - LATER

           QUICK CUTS: Mark stands in front of the wall mirror, CURLING 
           two 50-pound dumbbells -- one arm, then the other, one arm, 
           then the other.  Mark LEG PRESSES an enormous amount of 
           weight, lets it down, lifts it again.  Mark RIDES the 
           stationary bike on a high setting, fast, sweating profusely.

           I/E. BARABOO SCHOOL/PARKING LOT - LATE MORNING

           Mark pulls his Ford station wagon into a space in the parking 
           lot of this nondescript, sprawling, 1960s-era suburban brick-
           facade school.  He’s freshly showered, wears a short-sleeve 
           dress shirt, tie and slacks.  He reaches behind the front 
           seat and pulls out a battered BROWN VINYL BRIEFCASE.   

           INT. BARABOO SCHOOL/PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE WAITING ROOM - DAY

           Mark waits alone in a chair he’s much too big for, his brown 
           vinyl briefcase on his lap.  A portrait of President Reagan 
           hangs on the painted cinder block wall.  A clock ticks.

           INT. BARABOO SCHOOL/AUDITORIUM - DAY

           Mark’s on stage, talking to an audience of fourth, fifth and 
           sixth graders.
                                 MARK
                        Why do I do it?  Why do I wake up 
                        every morning and make the 
                        commitment?  Why do I work harder 
                        than I’ve ever worked in my life?  
                        Why push myself to my limits - of 
                        pain, of exhaustion - every day?  
                        Why do I do it?

           The rows of students are open-mouthed -- they have no idea 
           what to make of him.

           Mark’s not being willfully over-the-top with these kids.  
           This is just what’s on his mind.  All the time.

                                 MARK
                        In 13 months I hope to be going to 
                        Seoul -- which is a city in Korea.  
                        Does anyone know why?  Because 
                        that’s where the Olympic games are.

           Mark reaches into the briefcase at his feet and pulls out a 
           RIBBON with a MEDAL dangling from it.  

                                 MARK
                        Does anyone know what this is?

           As a couple of kids start to raise their hands -- 

                                 MARK
                        Olympic gold medal.  I won it three 
                        years ago at the ‘84 Games in L.A.  
                        My older brother, Dave Schultz, won 
                        one too, just minutes before I did. 
                        That’s unprecedented - two brothers 
                        winning at the same Olympics. 
                            (then)
                        Would you like me to win another 
                        one?  Would you like me to win 
                        another gold medal - for us, for 
                        America?  Would you like to see me 
                        and my brother both win gold 
                        medals?  Who here wants to see the 
                        two brothers win again?

           Silence.  A couple of the kids tentatively raise their hands.  
           The rest are completely frozen.  If Mark realizes that he’s 
           taken it a bit too far, he doesn’t show it.

                                 MARK
                        Well we’re going to give it 
                        absolutely everything we’ve got.
           INT. BARABOO SCHOOL/PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE WAITING ROOM - DAY

           A SCHOOL SECRETARY writes out a check as Mark stands in front 
           of the desk, placing his medal back in his briefcase.

                                 SCHOOL SECRETARY
                        Twenty... and... no one-hundreds...

           She tears off the check and hands it to Mark.  He takes the 
           check, and holds out to her a SIGNED 8x10 PHOTO of himself 
           with his arms raised, in a USA WRESTLING SINGLET just after 
           winning his Olympic gold.  

                                 MARK
                        And this is for the trophy case.

                                 SCHOOL SECRETARY
                        I’m sorry?... For what?

                                 MARK
                        The trophy case.  
                            (beat)
                        With the trophies.

                                 SCHOOL SECRETARY
                            (after a moment)
                        It’s an elementary school.

           As Mark holds out the photo, WE HEAR:

                                 FAST FOOD KID (V.O.)
                        Can I take your order? 

           INT. ARBY’S - DAY

           A long-haired, greasy KID with the very beginnings of a 
           mustache - he looks like he spends an awful lot of his free 
           time listening to Def Leopard - takes Mark’s order.  Mark 
           looks up at the menu sign.

                                 MARK
                        I’ll have a # 4.

                                 FAST FOOD KID
                        # 4. Anything to drink?

                                 MARK
                        No.  Can I get extra meat on that? 

                                 FAST FOOD KID
                        65 cents.
                                 MARK
                        What are you talking about?

                                 FAST FOOD KID
                        Extra meat costs extra.

                                 MARK
                            (looking around)
                        Where’s it say that?

                                 FAST FOOD KID
                        I don’t know.  I just know I’m 
                        supposed to charge extra for extra 
                        meat.

                                 MARK
                        I always get extra meat.  Every 
                        time I come here.

                                 FAST FOOD KID
                        Holmes.  It’s extra for extra meat.  
                        They told me.  65 cents.

           I/E. MARK’S FORD STATION WAGON/ ARBY’S PARKING LOT - DAY

           Mark sits in his car, eating his sandwich -- no enjoyment, 
           just fueling himself.  His RADIO plays a commercial.

           INT. UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN LOCKER ROOM - AFTERNOON

           Mark heads straight toward his locker, not acknowledging 
           anyone.  The few college athletes who are in the locker room 
           may glance over at him, but they quickly look away.  

           Mark turns the combination on his locker.

           INT. UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN GYM - AFTERNOON

           DAVE SCHULTZ (31, bearded, intelligent, 163 lbs., strong but 
           calm), the Head Coach of U of W wrestling, stands on the 
           WRESTLING MAT in front of the team of 20 or so wrestlers, who 
           sit or kneel.  We can sense immediately the reverence and 
           deep respect Dave commands as both one of the country’s top 
           wrestlers and one of its great coaches - by virtue of his 
           patience, his drive, his encyclopedic knowledge of the sport.  

           Mark stands nearby, watching his brother - he’s Dave’s 
           assistant coach.  One of the WRESTLERS is with Dave on the 
           mat - a demonstration partner.
                                 DAVE
                        Lack of flexibility in attack is 
                        what got one or two of you - Frank, 
                        Mick - in trouble Thursday.  I need 
                        you more adaptive.  As we’re 
                        grappling for position here --

           Dave and the wrestler turn toward each other, crouching 
           slightly and circling.  When Dave demonstrates each move in 
           succession, it’s with speed, strength and laser precision -- 

                                 DAVE
                        --you’re grabbing his arm.  You 
                        drag him forward.  If he comes - 
                        depending how far - you’ve got a 
                        front headlock for a pull-down, a 
                        run-around, an ankle pick; or you 
                        got an arm spin; a hip pull.  But --

           They’re back circling --  Dave grabs the wrestler’s arm --

                        -- if he doesn’t come with you, if 
                        he pulls back, even slightly -- 
                            (the wrestler does)
                        then there’s your window -- you 
                        shoot in for a double-leg, a single-
                        leg, a body-lock with an inside 
                        crotch.  There are ever-expanding 
                        branches of opportunity -- if he 
                        does this, then this, this, this, 
                        or this -- if he does that, then 
                        that, that, that, or that. It’s 
                        about forcing him to create 
                        opportunities for you.  It’s about 
                        knowing how to exploit the 
                        opportunities.
                            (he glances over at Mark 
                             and smiles slightly)
                        This is of course for us mortals.  
                        If you’re wrestling Mark Schultz, 
                        it’s not gonna matter what you do.    

           The assembled wrestlers glance over at Mark, who’s impassive.  
           They know exactly what Dave’s talking about.

           INT. UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN GYM/HARPER’S OFFICE - SAME TIME

           From the WINDOW in his office wall that looks out onto the 
           gym floor, U of W Athletic Director CRAIG HARPER is watching 
           the wrestling practice.  Then he moves back to his desk.
           INT. UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN GYM - LATER

           The wrestlers are in pairs, spread out on the mats, drilling 
           some moves.  Dave and Mark walk among them, observing and 
           correcting.  Dave stops TWO HEAVYWEIGHT WRESTLERS -- 

                                 DAVE
                        Hang on.  Steve - you got to pivot 
                        on your elbow.  Don’t roll him over 
                        the top of you and expose your-
                            (calls to his brother)
                        Hey, Mark -- you mind demonstrating 
                        this on Terry?
                            (to wrestler)
                        Steve, hop up.

           Mark walks slowly over.  He gets in a seated position under 
           TERRY, who’s well over 230 POUNDS.  (Mark wrestles at 180.)

                                 DAVE
                        You see how he’s up on his elbow?  
                        As he lifts and turns him, he’s 
                        gonna stay propped up, on his side, 
                        not rolling onto his back.  Okay, 
                        Mark, whenever you’re --

           And Mark, quick as a flash, LIFTS the huge wrestler ass over 
           teakettle, legs in the air, and SLAMS him mercilessly down on 
           the mat.  All we hear is a small “Uuuugh” from Terry.

           Mark swiftly pins him.  Dave turns to Steve --   

                                 DAVE
                        Got it?

           INT. UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN GYM/HARPER’S OFFICE - LATER

           Harper’s at his desk on the phone - we hear the tail end of a 
           conversation.

                                 HARPER (ON PHONE)
                        ...not if his grades --
                            (beat)
                        I know we did it for Mikowski, but 
                        he was worth it.

           Mark enters.  Behind him, through the plate glass we can see 
           Dave putting the wrestling team through shuttle runs.  (Dave 
           will glance over occasionally during this scene to see what’s 
           going on.)  Harper motions for Mark to sit.  Mark does.
                                 HARPER (ON PHONE)
                        I gotta --
                            (beat)
                        I know.  I gotta go.

           He hangs up, looks at Mark.  He comes around the desk.

                                 HARPER
                        Thanks for coming in.
                            (sits on edge of desk)
                        Mark.
                            (slight pause)
                        I’m just gonna tell it to you 
                        straight.  I’m not going to be able 
                        to keep paying your salary.

                                 MARK
                            (after a  moment)
                        What are you talking about?

                                 HARPER
                        They told me to make cuts across 
                        the board - well, except for the 
                        moneymakers - football, basketball--

                                 MARK
                        You’re only paying me five thousand 
                        dollars --

                                 HARPER
                        -- I know -- 

                                 MARK
                        -- a year --

                                 HARPER
                        -- I’m sorry.  Can’t afford it.

                                 MARK
                        What about Dave?

                                 HARPER
                        Dave’s Head Coach.  He’s got 
                        seniority.  He brought you in.

           Mark is silent.

                                 HARPER
                        And listen, I know you’ve got the 
                        Worlds coming up in a couple months 
                        --- Seoul Olympics in a year.  
                        Dave’s your training partner.

                                 HARPER (cont'd)
                        If you continue to help out with 
                        the team, you’re more than welcome 
                        to train here.  More than welcome.  
                        I just can’t pay you.

           A moment, then Mark stands up and walks toward the door.

                                 HARPER
                        Oh, and Mark.  I’m gonna need the 
                        car back.

           INT. HALLWAY JANITOR’S CLOSET - DAY

           Mark digs through the closet, pulls out a GARBAGE BAG.

           EXT. UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN PARKING LOT - DAY

           Mark, still in his workout clothes, has the hatch open on the 
           station wagon.  He’s grabbing his things - dirty clothes, 
           papers, his briefcase - and stuffing them in the garbage bag.

           Dave comes out the gym door and walks toward him.

                                 DAVE
                        Hey.  What’s going on?

                                 MARK
                        Ask Harper.

                                 DAVE
                        Why?

                                 MARK
                        He fired me.

                                 DAVE
                        He...?  Crap.
                            (no response from Mark)
                        I’ll talk to him.

                                 MARK
                        Don’t.

                                 DAVE
                        Of course I’ll --

                                 MARK
                        Don’t.

           Mark slams the hatch door.  He puts the bag over his shoulder 
           and starts to walk away.
                                 DAVE
                        Mark.  Come back inside.  Stick 
                        around till after practice and I’ll 
                        drive you home.

           Mark’s still walking away.  Without turning around --

                                 MARK
                        Keys are in the door. 

           They are, dangling from the hatchback.  On Dave, watching his 
           brother walk away.

           INT. MARK’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           A cheaply built 70s-era structure, where Mark inhabits a “one-
           bedroom” -- basically two small rooms with a cheap 
           kitchenette built into the wall of one of them.  A small, 
           particle-board BOOKCASE houses a little SHRINE of Mark’s 
           medals -- and PHOTOS of him and Dave.  

           Mark retrieves his briefcase from inside the garbage bag, and 
           extracts his GOLD MEDAL.  He replaces it in the PLASTIC 
           DISPLAY CASE on the top shelf, next to the photo of him and 
           Dave smiling with their gold medals around their necks.  

           INT. MARK’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Mark dumps a package of TOP RAMEN NOODLES into boiling water.  
           And another package.  And another.

           INT. MARK’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Mark sits on his one metal FOLDING CHAIR, at his table, 
           eating his bowl of noodles.  Moths tap against the window.

           INT. MARK’S APARTMENT/BEDROOM - LATER/NIGHT

           Mark, in just boxer shorts, crosses off another day on his 
           wall calendar.  427 days to Seoul.  He looks around, then 
           drops to the floor and starts a monstrous number of push-ups-- 

           EXT. INDUSTRIAL ROAD - EARLY MORNING

           Mark runs hard past warehouses and auto repair outlets.
           EXT. FIELD AND HILL NEXT TO CAR DEMOLITION YARD - MORNING

           Mark runs through knee-high weeds dragging a CAR TIRE 
           attached to a rope behind him.  He reaches a hill and heads 
           straight up it, dragging the tire all the way --

                                 MARK (V.O.)
                        Hello?  Coach Teller?  This is Mark 
                        Schultz ...

           INT. MARK’S APARTMENT - DAY

           An ink-stained directory of Northern California Public 
           Schools lies open on the kitchen table.

                                 MARK (ON PHONE)
                        I won a gold medal at the ‘84 
                        Olympics in freestyle wrestling.  
                        I’m arranging a clinic in your area 
                        next weekend, and I wanted to 
                        invite you and some of your 
                        wrestlers to join me...

           Mark, the phone tucked against his shoulder, slips a BLANK 
           TAPE into a cheap VCR.  He slides a HAND-LABELED TAPE into a 
           second VCR, wired to the first.  We can read the label: “THE 
           MARK SCHULTZ WRESTLING CLINIC.”  He starts making a copy.

                                 MARK (ON PHONE)
                        That’s right, Mark Schultz.  I 
                        wrestle at 180.

           On the screen is a montage of highlights from Mark’s career: 
           take downs, gut wrenches, pins.  He’s an animal - powerful, 
           fast, aggressive.  

                                 MARK (ON PHONE)
                        Dave’s my brother ... No, he won’t 
                        be there.  Just me. 

                                                                CUT TO:

                        Schultz...

                            (beat)
                        Yes.  There’s a small fee.

                                                                CUT TO:

           On the screen, Mark wrestles a Turk, Resit Karabajak, in his 
           first round match at the ‘84 Olympics.

                                 MARK (ON PHONE)
                        A unique, character-building 
                        opportunity for young wrestlers... 
                        Yes, a small fee... 

           Mark throws Karabajak to the mat.  Pins him.  Walks away, 
           arms raised.  Crowd cheers.  Karabajak’s on the mat, hurt.

                                 MARK (ON PHONE)
                        Dave’s my brother ...

           On screen, Mark does a back flip.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Mark does a back flip.

           Mark’s holds the phone on his lap, just watching himself on 
           the screen, wrestling... winning... match after match...

           EXT. MARK’S APARTMENT/OUTSIDE WALKWAY  - EVENING

           Mark’s outside at the second floor railing of this two-story 
           stucco building, looking out over the bleak landscape: a 7-11 
           across the parking lot, an Auto-Zone.

           He watches a CAR pull into the lot below.  Dave gets out, 
           looks up toward him.

                                 DAVE
                        Where were you today?

           Mark doesn’t respond. 
           INT. MARK’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           As Dave fills two mismatched glasses with tap water from the 
           faucet, he notices the Public Schools Directory on the table.  
           Mark’s on the tattered couch.  

                                 DAVE
                        You setting up clinics?

                                 MARK
                        Talked to some coaches.

           Dave comes toward Mark, handing off a water glass, dragging 
           the folding chair over to sit across from him.  

                                 DAVE
                        I hope you don’t have anything 
                        booked for Saturday.

                                 MARK
                        Why not?

                                  DAVE
                        I need a favor.  I arranged this 
                        gig months ago but now I can’t do 
                        it.  Nancy’s got this thing all day 
                        so I’ve gotta watch the kids. 

           A moment as Mark just looks at him.

                                 DAVE
                        You free?

                                 MARK
                        I’ll check.

           He goes into the bedroom, looks at the calendar.  There’s 
           NOTHING WRITTEN DOWN for any of the days.

                                 MARK
                        You said Saturday or Sunday?

                                 DAVE
                        Saturday.

                                 MARK
                        Saturday could work.

           He comes back in.

                                 DAVE
                        Good.  Thank you.
           Dave looks at the BACK OF HIS HAND, where he’s written down a 
           name and phone number in MARKER.  He grabs one of Mark’s VHS 
           labels and a pen and writes the information.   

                                 DAVE
                        Coach Vinson, Radnor High.  I’ll 
                        let him know you’ll call tomorrow.

           He peels off the label and slaps it on Mark’s leg.  

                                 DAVE
                        And Mark.  Please come back to the 
                        gym.  You don’t have to do anything 
                        with the team.  Just train with me.

           Mark’s just looking at him, not willing to give in yet.

                                 DAVE
                        Stay focused on what’s important.  
                        For both of us.  Seoul’s the goal.

           A long beat.

                                 MARK
                        Seoul’s the goal.

           As they look at each other,

           INT. RADNOR HIGH SCHOOL GYM - DAY

           Seven HIGH SCHOOL BOYS plus a couple of PRE-TEENS, all in 
           wrestling gear, sit or kneel on the mat in front of Mark.

                                 MARK
                        Wrestling’s not something I do.  
                        It’s something I am.  The minute 
                        you step on the mat, you express 
                        exactly who you are.  You can’t 
                        hide.  You can’t pretend you’ve 
                        trained harder than you did, you 
                        want it more than you do.  I care 
                        about this more than I care about 
                        anything.  My brother Dave and me 
                        both do.  If you’re serious about 
                        winning, then you’re going to have 
                        to sacrifice.  The difference 
                        between the number one guy in the 
                        world and the number four guy is 
                        paper thin.

                        The guy who’s gonna win is the guy 
                        who wants it more, who’s willing to 
                        sacrifice, who makes it the only 
                        goal, who can take the pain.

           He gestures to a table set up near the door, on which is his 
           EMPTY BRIEFCASE, and next to it, a stack of TAPES.

                                 MARK
                        I talk about all this in my 
                        instructional videotape -- which 
                        you can purchase at the end of the 
                        day for a nominal fee.

           INT. RADNOR HIGH SCHOOL GYM - LATER

           The young wrestlers are on the mats in pairs, wrestling.  
           Mark patrols among them, watching --

                        Switch.

           They switch which wrestler’s on top, wrestle again.

                        Switch.

           I/E. BUS - AFTERNOON

           It’s raining.  Mark rides the bus, his BRIEFCASE on his lap, 
           bulging with VIDEOTAPES.  He didn’t sell any.

           EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET/MADISON - LATER

           It’s stopped raining.  Mark walks down a street of modest 
           homes.  He turns up the walkway of one of them, mounts the 
           steps and rings the bell.  No answer.  He rings again.

           A CAR pulls into the driveway.  (We may notice that THIS IS 
           THE CAR that Mark gave up.)  NANCY SCHULTZ (30, thin, 
           attractive, tough - Dave’s wife) gets out of the car.               

           Nancy sees her brother-in-law standing at the front door, 
           watching her.

                                 NANCY
                        Hey, Mark.  What’s up?

           She SHRUGS.  She opens the back door and unbuckles her 
           daughter, DANIELLE (3 years old).  She lifts her out.

                                 NANCY
                        Dani, can you say hi to Uncle Mark?

                                 MARK
                        I thought you had a thing today.  
                        An all day thing.

                                 NANCY
                        No --

           She shuts the door and comes toward the house.

                                 NANCY
                        -- What’re you talking about?

                                 MARK
                            (a beat, then)
                        Where’d you get the car?

                                 NANCY
                        They gave it to Dave.  We needed a 
                        second car.

           He comes down the steps, passing her and heading out toward 
           the sidewalk.

                                 NANCY
                        You need a lift home?

                                 MARK
                            (without stopping)
                        No.  I’m good.

           INT. MARK’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           Mark enters, puts down his briefcase, presses play on his 
           ANSWERING MACHINE, goes over to the sink and begins to fill a 
           pot with water to make his dinner.

           As Mark stands at the sink, the answering machine plays a 
           series of, not messages, but HANG-UPS -- clicks and DIAL 
           TONES.  Mark puts the pot on the stove.
           INT. UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN GYM - DAY

           Mark exits the locker room in his wrestling gear, passing 
           Craig Harper who’s coming the other way.  

                                 HARPER
                        How you doing, Mark?

           Mark doesn’t acknowledge him, continues toward the MATS.  
           Dave’s in his wrestling gear, on the far side of the gym, 
           talking with TWO MIDDLE-AGED MEN in blazers.  Mark walks onto 
           the mat, waits for him.  

           Dave and the two men see Mark, WAVE to him - but Mark 
           pretends not to notice, busying himself loosening his hands, 
           wrists, neck.     

           Dave walks over toward him.

                                 DAVE
                        You remember Fred Cole from USA 
                        Wrestling.

                                 MARK
                        You been calling me and hanging up?

                                 DAVE
                        No.
                            (adjusts his knee brace)
                        What do you mean?

           Mark doesn’t answer, just stands looking at him.  For several 
           seconds, they look at each other.  Then, slowly at first:

           They start to wrestle.  We sense immediately their 
           differences.  Dave’s hunched and not very muscular physique 
           belie his quickness and enormous strength.  Mark’s defining 
           characteristic is brute force.  He’s a weight class heavier 
           than Dave, but can NEVER SEEM TO BEAT HIS OLDER BROTHER. 

           The wrestling becomes intense and violent -- Mark’s head 
           slamming into Dave’s nose, drawing a flow of BLOOD.  This 
           only seems to energize Dave, who’s able to slam Mark down to 
           the mat -- dripping blood on him through it all.  

           VARIOUS SHOTS of the increasingly brutal match, ending with:

           Dave rides Mark -- who’s on his stomach, flattened and 
           splayed -- grappling for a hold.  Mark glances up to SEE:

           Craig Harper WATCHING from his office window.
           Mark looks away, gritting his teeth, but Dave’s gotten his 
           hold.  As he TURNS the bigger Mark --

           EXT. DAVE’S CAR/OUTSIDE MARK’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           The passenger door opens and Mark gets out.  Dave calls to 
           him from inside the car:

                                 DAVE
                        You sure you won’t have dinner at 
                        the house with me and Nance?

                                 MARK
                        Nah.

                                 DAVE
                        Same time tomorrow?

                                 MARK
                        Sorry about your nose.

                                 DAVE
                        No you’re not.

           He smiles and drives off.

           INT. MARK’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           Mark presses PLAY on his answering machine.  Hang-ups and 
           DIAL TONES. 

           INT. MARK’S APARTMENT/BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Mark examines his bruised face in the mirror, wiping away 
           blood -- some of it his, some his brother’s.

           INT. MARK’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Mark’s at the refrigerator, cracking ice cube trays into a 
           plastic 7-11 shopping bag.  The PHONE RINGS.  He picks up --

                                 MARK (ON PHONE)
                        Yah.

           A woman’s voice is heard -- it sounds like long distance.

                                 JOSEPHINE (ON PHONE)
                        May I please speak with Mr. Mark 
                        Schultz?
                                 MARK (ON PHONE)
                        It’s Mark.

                                 JOSEPHINE (ON PHONE)
                        I’m sorry to call you at night, but 
                        Mr. du Pont was anxious that I get 
                        in touch with you.

           Beat.  

                                 MARK (ON PHONE)
                        Okay...

                                 JOSEPHINE (ON PHONE)
                        He asked that you please consider 
                        taking a day or two off from your 
                        training to come out to Foxcatcher 
                        Farms so you men can meet face to 
                        face.

                                 MARK (ON PHONE)
                        Who do you work for again?

                                 JOSEPHINE
                        John E. du Pont of the du Pont 
                        family of Newtown Square, 
                        Pennsylvania.  
                            (beat)
                        You may also know of him in 
                        connection with his support of the 
                        Villanova wrestling program.  

                                 MARK (ON PHONE)
                        What does he want to talk about?

                                 JOSEPHINE
                        Mr. Du Pont has asked me to contact 
                        you to set up a meeting.  He would 
                        like you to come to Pennsylvania.  

                                 MARK
                        Uh-huh...?

                                 JOSEPHINE
                        If I may I’d like to make travel 
                        arrangements for you, Mr. Schultz.

           Mark’s still holding the ice cube tray, standing alone in his 
           dingy kitchen.
           INT. JETWAY/AIRPLANE - MORNING

           Mark walks down the jetway into the airplane.  He holds up 
           his ticket to show the stewardess as he turns to the right.  
           The stewardess touches his arm, stopping him --

                                 STEWARDESS
                        Excuse me...
                            (looking at his ticket)
                        Mr. Schultz.  Your seat is this 
                        way, sir.

           She holds her arm out toward the FRONT of the plane.  

           INT. AIRPLANE/FIRST CLASS - LATER

           After take-off.  A stewardess offers Mark a glass of 
           champagne.  He shakes his head.  The businessman next to him 
           takes a glass.  Mark watches as he drinks it down.

           INT. PHL AIRPORT/ARRIVAL GATE - DAY

           Mark looks around to see if someone’s waiting for him.  No 
           one seems to be.  After several moments, a young man (BRANDON 
           - 20s, post-prep school, jacket and tie) appears next to him.

                                 BRANDON
                        Mr. Schultz, I’m Brandon.  Welcome 
                        to Philadelphia.

           INT. HELICOPTER (AIRBORNE) - DAY

           Mark watches out the clear Plexi as the Pennsylvania 
           countryside spreads out below him.  He and Brandon and the 
           pilot (LARRY - 50s, aviator glasses, Air Cavalry patch on his 
           jacket) all wear RADIO MIC HEADSETS.

                                 BRANDON (ON RADIO MIC)
                        Mr. du Pont would have flown you 
                        himself, but he was asked at the 
                        last minute for tactical assistance 
                        by the Newtown Square Police 
                        Department.

           Mark has no idea what that means, but nods his head.

                                 BRANDON (ON RADIO MIC)
                        He should be back at the estate by 
                        the time we get there.
           Larry BANKS the plane steeply on Mark’s side so Mark has an 
           unobstructed view of the ground. 

                                 LARRY (ON RADIO MIC)
                        Valley Forge below you.

           They speed over the historic site -- wide fields, the 
           memorial arch, wood fences, the old stone house.

                                 LARRY (ON RADIO MIC)
                        The du Pont family’s supplied 
                        American armed forces with 
                        gunpowder since the beginning.
                            (he rights the chopper, 
                             heads southeast)
                        Foxcatcher in three minutes.

           I/E. HELICOPTER (AIRBORNE)/FOXCATCHER ESTATE - MINUTES LATER

           A MARE and FOAL run away as the helicopter descends toward 
           the Big House -- a huge Georgian brick home in the middle of 
           800 acres of fields and woods and outbuildings.

           INT. HALLWAY/BIG HOUSE - DAY

           Brandon leads Mark down a carpeted hallway.

           INT. LIBRARY/BIG HOUSE - DAY

           They enter the library - at once grandly elegant and musty. 

                                 BRANDON
                        Feel free to look around.  Mr. du 
                        Pont will be up shortly.

           He shuts the door behind him.  Mark’s never been in a room 
           like this: oil paintings of du Pont ancestors for the last 
           200 years, as well as foxhounds, horses, fox hunts.  Rows and 
           rows of leather-bound books share wall space with framed maps 
           and many antique (and not so antique) pistols.  There are 
           framed PHOTOS of the same man (JOHN DU PONT - 50, tall, thin, 
           beak-nosed, blond-grey hair) with Presidents Ford, Nixon, 
           Reagan... Henry Kissinger. 

           Mark’s still standing, holding his carry-on bag, gazing at 
           the photos, when the door opens and JOHN DU PONT strides in.  
           A police-issue HOLSTER dangles from one hand.  He stops and 
           regards Mark.
                                 DU PONT
                        You’re actually here!  In my study.

                                 MARK
                        Oh..... yes sir.
                            (no idea what to say)
                        They told me it was the library.

                                 DU PONT
                        It is!

           He tosses the holster onto a chair and comes toward Mark, 
           shaking his hand warmly.

                                 DU PONT
                        John du Pont.

                                 MARK
                        Mark Schultz --

                                 DU PONT
                        - I know who you are - I’ve watched 
                        your Olympic victory enough times 
                        to know exactly who you are, every 
                        inch of you -- please, put your bag 
                        down, make yourself comfortable, 
                        sit, make yourself at home --

           (We’ll realize about du Pont that he can be voluble and 
           charming -- but the more time you spend with him, the more 
           you see what an effort this is for him -- how essentially 
           uncomfortable he is in his own skin....  Also, he just might 
           have snorted a tiny bit of coke before he came in.)

           Du Pont continues as they sit --

                                 DU PONT
                        -- After you broke the Turk’s arm 
                        and they disqualified you, handed 
                        you the loss - after they put an 
                        extra official on you - after all 
                        that you rack up seven straight 
                        wins to take the gold medal.  
                        Thrilling.  Thrilling!  Inspiring.

                                 MARK
                        Thank you, sir.  I’m proud of that 
                        day.

                                 DU PONT
                        You should be.
                            (he laughs)
                        Hell, I’m proud of you.
           Mark smiles.

                                 DU PONT
                        Your parents must be enormously 
                        proud.

           Beat.  It’s a tough subject for Mark.

                                 MARK
                        To be perfectly honest, sir, we 
                        don’t often talk.

           Du Pont nods, taking this in.

                                 DU PONT
                        I want to tell you how much I 
                        appreciate your coming out here.  I 
                        know it cuts into your training 
                        schedule.  I imagine that’s every 
                        day for you? 

                                 MARK
                        Yes sir, it is.

                                 DU PONT
                        Training hard?

                                 MARK
                        Yes sir.

                                 DU PONT
                        And where does that take place?

                                 MARK
                        University of Wisconsin.

                                 DU PONT
                        And they provide everything you 
                        need?

           Beat.  Beat.  Then, quietly -

                                 MARK
                        Pretty much.

           A moment as du Pont watches Mark.

                                 DU PONT
                        I’d like to see you win this 
                        upcoming tournament.

                                 MARK
                        Thank you.
                                 DU PONT
                        It’s a big one, yes?

                                 MARK
                        It’s the world championship.

                                 DU PONT
                        Tell me a little bit about your 
                        regimen -- how you train every day. 

                                 MARK
                        Well, I take the mornings on my own 
                        - strength training, endurance - 
                        then I meet up with my brother - 
                        you know Dave Schultz --

                                 DU PONT
                        -- Of course --

                                 MARK
                        -- I meet up with him at the 
                        University gym, we work out 
                        whatever free time we can grab in 
                        between team practice.

           Du Pont nods.

                                 DU PONT
                        A lot of other responsibilities.

                                 MARK
                        At times.  Yes, sir.

           After a moment --

                                 DU PONT
                        Why do you do it, Mark?

                                 MARK
                        Do what, sir?

                                 DU PONT
                        All of it.  Why do you do it?

           Mark looks at him directly.

                                 MARK
                        I want to be the best in the world.

           Silence, then:

                                 DU PONT
                        May I speak frankly?
           Mark nods.

                                 DU PONT
                        I’m concerned.  
                            (beat)
                        I’m concerned by what I see in this 
                        country.  Athletes labor to bring 
                        honor to America, and we’re failing 
                        to honor that effort.  Failing to 
                        honor and support it.

           Mark’s staring at du Pont intently, touched by this, but not 
           yet ready to reveal to much.  Du Pont speaks carefully --

                                 DU PONT
                        Am I right to say that you may know 
                        something of what I’m talking 
                        about?

           On Mark.

           EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - DAY

           Du Pont walks with Mark across an expanse of grass toward a 
           FIELD HOUSE in the last stages of a renovation.

                                 DU PONT
                        No matter how many times I’ve 
                        argued our case, the U.S.O.C. 
                        refuses to recognize that training 
                        for international competition’s a 
                        full time job.  Why is that?  Why 
                        is that?

           He points to a nearby building as they approach the field 
           house door --

                                 DU PONT
                        The pool’s not quite ready.  But
                        I’ve renovated the old field house 
                        so Olympic wrestlers won’t have to 
                        scrounge up work just to be able to 
                        find a place to train. 

           He opens the door, and they walk into a beautifully 
           renovated, gleaming GYM.
           INT. FOXCATCHER GYM - CONTINUOUS

           Four pristine WRESTLING MATS are spread out on the floor.  
           Through a doorway on the far end we can glimpse a WEIGHT ROOM 
           with new nautilus and stationary bikes and free weights.

           Several moments as Mark GAPES at his surroundings.

                                 DU PONT
                            (quietly)
                        I want you all to have a home.

           Mark is speechless.  Silence.

                                 DU PONT
                        Tell me what you’re thinking.

                                 MARK
                        Honestly, sir?

                                 DU PONT
                        Of course.

                                 MARK
                        Remember in the semis in LA when I 
                        got Tamoka in a standing headlock, 
                        spun him to a hip pull and flipped 
                        him over my head for a takedown?  

                                 DU PONT
                        Five points -- it put the match in 
                        your hands.

                                 MARK
                        If I’d done it here his feet would 
                        have smacked the rafters.

           Du Pont’s confused.  Mark nods toward the ceiling.

                                 MARK
                        Roof’s a little low.

           Du Pont looks immediately at the ceiling, then, after a 
           moment, back at Mark.  He SMILES.

                                 DU PONT
                        I’ll raise it.
                            (then)
                        Come, I want to show you something.

           He opens the door for Mark and shows him out, putting his arm 
           on his shoulder as they walk outside.
           EXT. VALLEY FORGE - LATE AFTERNOON

           VARIOUS SHOTS of the historic site -- the monuments and 
           fences and stone house headquarters.  The last shot is of 
           Mark and du Pont standing on a ridge over the vast CEMETERY 
           field.  Du Pont’s black Ford Mercury is parked nearby.  

                                 DU PONT
                        I wish every American could come 
                        here and see this for themselves.  
                        See the price of freedom.  It’s not 
                        free at all.  I’m gratified my 
                        family could play a small part in 
                        the history here.  
                            (beat)
                        The sacrifices of the troops that 
                        first long winter remind me of what 
                        you athletes go through.  

           Silence as they look out over the national park.  

           Then, Du Pont turns to him --

                                 DU PONT
                        Would you consider telling me the 
                        reason you’re not in touch with 
                        your parents?

                                 MARK
                            (shrugs)
                        I guess I think we have to orphan 
                        ourselves to do anything 
                        worthwhile.
                            (beat)
                        Find our own way.  Decide what we 
                        believe.

           Long beat as du Pont looks at Mark.  

                                 DU PONT
                        When did you win your first match?

                                 MARK
                        I started kind of late -- high 
                        school sophomore.  I was... well... 
                        truthfully, I was... completely 
                        lost -- and I got into it ‘cause my 
                        brother was wrestling.  Dave 
                        convinced me to give it a try.  I 
                        never told him this, but I was 
                        scared of losing in front of him.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARK (cont'd)
                        So of course my first match I get 
                        put up against a kid two years 
                        older.  Dave was helping coach from 
                        my corner....  And at the end, when 
                        the ref raised my hand, there was 
                        my brother, running towards me -- 
                        screaming --
                            (his face getting flushed)
                        -- laughing -- he lifted me up --

           Mark stops talking -- trying to stop himself from getting 
           CHOKED UP.  After a few moments, he speaks, quietly:

                                 MARK
                        It’s always been his sport.  He let 
                        me inside.  I’m lucky to be very 
                        very good at it.

           Du Pont’s watching this young man who’s just opened up to 
           him.  We can sense his admiration... and, possibly, a bit of 
           his envy -- for Mark’s abilities, and for his powerful 
           relationship with his brother.

                                                              FADE OUT.

           INT. GUEST ROOM/BIG HOUSE - NIGHT

           Mark’s alone in his room, dialing the phone.  It rings and we 
           hear Dave answer --

                                 DAVE (ON PHONE)
                        Hello.
                            (Mark doesn’t respond)
                        Hello.

           Mark HANGS UP.

           INT. GUEST ROOM/BIG HOUSE - MORNING

           Mark wakes up in his huge four-poster bed.  (He sleeps ONLY 
           ON HIS STOMACH -- we’ll find out why later.)  This is clearly 
           the most beautiful, clean, peaceful room he’s ever slept in.

           EXT. DOG KENNEL/FOXCATCHER - MORNING

           Mark, carrying his bag, walks toward the fenced yard outside 
           the dog kennels.  Du Pont stand next to a pile of MEAT, in 
           front of FIFTY BARKING BLOODHOUNDS.  His arm is in the air, 
           and the dogs are barking and pushing each other for position, 
           but they don’t dare come to the meat.  
           Then, du Pont steps back and LOWERS HIS ARM.  The dogs 
           immediately jump at the pile of meat, devouring it.

           Du Pont notices Mark watching at the fence.  He strides over.

                                 MARK
                        That’s a lot of dogs.  They listen 
                        to you.

                                 DU PONT
                        They have to.  I pay for their 
                        food.  How’d you sleep?

                                 MARK
                        Really good.

                                 DU PONT
                        I hope you’re considering joining 
                        me here.  I can’t think of anyone 
                        I’d rather do this with.

                                 MARK
                        Thank you.

                                 DU PONT
                            (looking him in the eye)
                        Mark.  You name your price.

           EXT. PHL AIRPORT - ESTABLISHING/DAY

           A plane takes off on the runway.

           INT. PHL AIRPORT/BATHROOM - DAY

           CLOSE UP on Mark’s face, looking at himself in the mirror.  
           Studying his own face.  Then he erupts in a PRIMAL SCREAM.  
           Pure joy.  Affirmation.

           EXT. PINE TREE - DAY

           HIGH-ANGLE CLOSE UP on the face of a SIX-YEAR OLD BOY, CRYING 
           -- terrified.  It’s ALEXANDER, Dave’s son.  He’s mid-way up a 
           tall pine tree and scared to go any higher.  Dave is a couple 
           of branches above him.  He looks down at Alexander, patiently 
           waiting for the boy to stop crying.  Finally, ALEX stops.

                                 DAVE
                        You ready?

           Beat.  The boy nods.  They climb higher.
           I/E. TAXI/MADISON/DAVE’S STREET - DAY

           Mark rides in the back of a cab toward Dave’s house.  As he 
           nears, we SEE Nancy tapping a beer keg in the side yard.  
           Things are set up for a BBQ which hasn’t started yet.  Dave 
           and Alex sit in the TOP OF THE TREE, watching Mark arrive.  

           EXT. DAVE’S HOUSE - LATER/AFTERNOON

           BBQ in progress.  Lots of U of W wrestlers and coaches and 
           wives and girlfriends and kids.  Dave’s at the BBQ, carving a 
           huge roast on a spit with a long CARVING KNIFE.  Mark’s 
           talking intently, passionately, to his brother.

                                 MARK
                        Twenty-five thousand a year.  He 
                        said name your price and I named 
                        the highest price that came into my 
                        head - I probably coulda gone 
                        higher, but what the hell - I mean 
                        we’d get to hand-pick our own team -
                        wrestlers we want to work with --  

                                 DAVE
                        Who’re you gonna train with?  

                                 MARK
                        -- No... I mean... When I say we, I 
                        mean... you and me... could choose 
                        a team.  Together.  I thought...

                                 DAVE
                        What does du Pont get out of it?

                                 MARK
                        What are you talking about?  He 
                        gets America winning.  He gets U.S. 
                        wrestlers on a level field with the 
                        Russians.  He’s looking for a way 
                        to help us win.

                                 DAVE
                            (unconvinced)
                        Really.
                                 MARK
                        Dave - this is it.  This is what 
                        we’ve wanted our whole lives - just 
                        to train - you and me - not to have 
                        to deal with USA Wrestling, or 
                        Harper and his corrupt University 
                        athletics - not to have to think 
                        about anybody else.   

           Dave looks at him.

                                 DAVE
                        I’ve got a contract here, Mark.  I 
                        got a good thing going.  Nancy’s 
                        happy, Danielle’s happy - Alex 
                        likes his school --

           The reality starts to hit Mark for the first time that he may 
           be doing this alone, without his older brother.

                                 DAVE
                        -- The Worlds are sixty days away.  
                        Who’re you gonna train with?

           Beat.  Mark is shell-shocked.

                                 MARK
                        Du Pont’s taking his money out of 
                        the Villanova program.  They’ll 
                        pull the plug on that.  So.  Dan 
                        Bane could come.
                            (he shrugs)
                        I guess Dan Bane. 

           Dave can see how disappointed Mark is.  So he gives him 
           something --  

                                 DAVE
                        It sounds like a good opportunity.  
                        I think you could really make 
                        something out of it.

                                 MARK
                        Do you?

                                 DAVE
                            (nods)
                        I do.  I think you should take it.

                                 MARK
                        Really.
                                 DAVE
                        I’m proud of you.

           Mark nods.

                                 MARK
                        And, look.  A spot’s always open 
                        for you if you decide to come.

                                 DAVE
                            (smiles)
                        All right.

           Long beat.  Nancy watches the brothers from across the yard.

           Opening chords of Mellancamp’s “PINK HOUSES” starts to PLAY.

           I/E. MARK’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           “PINK HOUSES” plays.  Mark packs his apartment - trashing 
           just about everything, tossing it in the dumpster - stuffing 
           the few essentials in his new USED CAR - an AMC GREMLIN.

           EXT. DRIVING - DAY

           “PINK HOUSES” plays.  Mark drives across Ohio.

           EXT. FILLING STATION - DAY

           “PINK HOUSES” plays.  Mark gets gas.  The attendant - clearly 
           a HIGH SCHOOL WRESTLER - is thrilled to shake his hand.

           EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - DAY

           “PINK HOUSES” plays.  Mark pulls onto the estate grounds.  

           EXT. FRONT DOOR/BIG HOUSE - DAY

           Music ENDS.  Mark rings the doorbell.  No answer.  He goes to 
           ring it again and the door is opened by a UNIFORMED MAID.

                                 MARK
                        Hi.  I’m Mark Schultz.

           Silence.  That means nothing to her...

                                 MARK
                        I’m here to see John du Pont?
                                 UNIFORMED MAID
                        Is Mr. du Pont expecting you?

                                 MARK
                        Yeah. Well, no - not today exactly, 
                        but, yes.  This week.  Sometime.

                                 UNIFORMED MAID
                        Just a moment, please.

                                 MARK
                        In the meantime can I use the --
                            (she SHUTS the door, 
                             leaving him outside)
                        -- bathroom.

           He turns and looks out over the VAST LAWN of the estate.  Far 
           off, it’s being mowed by a gardener.  The maid OPENS the door-

                                 UNIFORMED MAID
                        Please.

           INT. BIG HOUSE/FOXCATCHER - CONTINUOUS

           They walk just a few feet and she gestures toward a door.

                                 MARK
                            (confused)
                        Is he?  He’s in there?

                                 UNIFORMED MAID
                        The washroom.

           INT. ROCOCO WASHROOM/BIG HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Floral wallpaper, gold fixtures and faucet.  Mark pisses - 
           mouth open, eyes half shut.  He flushes.

           He looks at the dish holding a bunch of little pastel 
           horseshoes.  Soap?  He picks one up, smells it.  He washes 
           his hands - monstrous with the tiny soap.  He wipes his hands 
           on his pants, avoiding the neatly hung towelettes.

           As he opens the door he discovers the Maid waiting for him.

                                 UNIFORMED MAID
                        Mr. Beck will see you now.

                                 MARK
                        Mr. Beck?
           INT. STAN BECK’S OFFICE/BIG HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

           Mark is led into a large third floor office with a big desk, 
           wood filing cabinets, LAW BOOKS lining the bookshelves.  STAN 
           BECK (mid-forties, no-nonsense, suit and tie) rises from 
           behind the desk as Mark enters. 

                                 STAN BECK
                        Come on in, sit down.

                                 MARK
                        Thank you.

                                 STAN BECK
                        Thank you, Rosie.

                                 UNIFORMED MAID
                        You’re welcome, Mr. Beck.

           She exits, closing the door behind her.

                                 STAN BECK
                        Okay.  Okay.  So Mark -- it’s Mark 
                        Schultz, correct?

                                 MARK
                        Yes.

                                 STAN BECK
                            (opens a folder, writing)
                        S-C-H-U-L-T-Z?

                                 MARK
                        That’s right.

                                 STAN BECK
                        Mark -- I manage affairs for Mr. du 
                        Pont.  Look after his interests.  
                        If you have a problem, you come to 
                        me.  If Mr. Du Pont has a problem, 
                        I’ll come to you.  Okay?

                                 MARK
                        Yes sir.

                                 STAN BECK
                        Let’s talk about what you’re doing 
                        here.  I’d like to make sure we all 
                        understand each other.  Does that 
                        sound like a good policy to you?
                                 MARK
                        Absolutely.

                                 STAN BECK
                        Good.  Me too.  First thing I can 
                        tell you is that Mr. du Pont is 
                        very happy he can help you with 
                        your goals.

           Mark nods.

                                 STAN BECK
                        But I want to make sure you’re 
                        aware of what’s expected.  It’s not 
                        a free ride.  In exchange for the 
                        guest house, the more than 
                        substantial salary, the privilege 
                        of training Foxcatcher Farms, Mr. 
                        du Pont expects results.  
                        Understood?

                                 MARK
                        Of course.

                                 STAN BECK
                        I’m sure you can appreciate that.

                                 MARK
                        Of course.

                                 STAN BECK
                        That goes for every wrestler.

                                 MARK
                        I’ve actually got suggestions for 
                        about half the roster.

                                 STAN BECK
                        What about the other half?

           Beat.  Beat.

                                 MARK
                        I’ve been making phone calls.

           Beat.

                                 STAN BECK
                        All right.  Now.

           Stan takes out a form, writes in it as Mark answers.
                                 STAN BECK
                        Your age?

                                 MARK
                        Twenty-seven.

                                 STAN BECK
                        Education?

                                 MARK
                        Oklahoma University.

                                 STAN BECK
                        Undergraduate?

                                 MARK
                        Yes.

                                 STAN BECK
                        You graduated?

                                 MARK
                        Yes.

                                 STAN BECK
                        Do you own any property?

                                 MARK
                        No.

                                 STAN BECK
                        Are your parents still married?

                                 MARK
                            (sore subject)
                        No.

                                 STAN BECK
                        How old were you when they 
                        separated?

                                 MARK
                        Two.

                                 STAN BECK
                        Have you ever been involved in a 
                        lawsuit?

                                 MARK
                        No.

           The DOOR OPENS and John du Pont pokes his head in.  
           Mark STANDS, relieved to see him finally --

                                 MARK
                        Mr. Du Pont.

           Du Pont stays in the doorway.  He waves slightly.

                                 DU PONT
                        They told me you’d arrived. 

                                 MARK
                        Yes sir, I drove straight down.

           It’s a little odd that du Pont doesn’t enter -- he seems 
           almost nervous.

                                 DU PONT
                        They’re going to set you up in a 
                        guest house.  

                                 MARK
                        Yes sir.

           Silence for several moments.

                                 DU PONT
                        All right.

                                 MARK
                        All right.  Thank you, sir.

           And du Pont’s gone, closing the door behind him.  Beat.

                                 STAN BECK
                        Shall we finish this?

           Beck gestures to the chair.  Mark sits.

                                 STAN BECK
                        Have you ever been accused of a 
                        crime?

           EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - AFTERNOON

           Brandon walks silently with Mark.  They’ve come far, across 
           the huge side yard - the Big House looks small behind them.  
           Some distance away, we can see HORSE STABLES that let out 
           onto a huge fenced track with a grass infield.  Stable hands 
           are putting several horses through their paces.
                                 BRANDON
                            (re the horses)
                        -- They’re Mrs. du Pont’s.  Many 
                        are worth over a million dollars.  
                        We all just keep our distance.

           They enter the WOODS.  Just inside the trees is THE CHALET -- 
           a European style wooden guest house that is now Mark’s home.

                                 MARK
                        I didn’t realize he was married.

                                 STAN BECK
                        Mr. du Pont?  He’s not.  Mrs. du 
                        Pont’s his mother.

           INT. THE CHALET - AFTERNOON

           Brandon lets Mark in the door, turns on the lights in the 
           living room, in the kitchen, goes to the bedroom.  It’s a 
           lovely guest house, decorated like a ski chalet.  

           Brandon walks back from the bedroom, holding KEYS out to Mark-

                                 BRANDON
                        Utilities are paid for - gas, 
                        electric, water - all paid.  The 
                        refrigerator’s stocked for now, but 
                        in the future you’re responsible 
                        for feeding yourself.  Unless of 
                        course you get invited to the Big 
                        House for dinner.

           Mark, still standing in the entry-way, accepts the keys.

                                 BRANDON
                        Someone will bring your car around.  
                        Anything else you need?

                                 MARK
                        I don’t think so.

           Brandon leaves.  Mark stands still, looking at his new home.

           INT. THE CHALET - NIGHT

           Mark (in shorts and a tank top) finishes unpacking his things 
           and taping up the PHOTOS of himself and Dave.  For several 
           moments, he surveys the place.  He notices some of its 
           oddities -- like the POLAR BEAR SKIN RUG (with the HEAD ON) 
           which is draped over the sofa.   
           He’s STARTLED by a KNOCK on the living room window.  It’s 
           John du Pont, who points toward the front door.

           EXT. PORCH/THE CHALET - CONTINUOUS/NIGHT

           Mark opens the door to John - standing on the little porch, 
           looking far more relaxed than he did this afternoon.  He’s 
           wearing a sweatsuit, is holding a BOOK and a SMALL BOX.  
           Mark’s greatly relieved to see him.

                                 MARK
                        Mr. du Pont, thanks for stopping -

           Du Pont holds up a finger.  Then, quietly -

                                 DU PONT
                        You hear that?

           Mark listens, shakes his head.  Du Pont holds up his finger 
           again -- and then we HEAR it: a faint HOOTING from the woods. 

                                 DU PONT
                        Barred owl --

           He hands Mark the small box he’s holding.  Inside is a very 
           small set of BINOCULARS.  

                                 DU PONT
                        When you spot one, you’ll see with 
                        each hoot there’s a white flash in 
                        his collar.  His throat swells, and 
                        he reveals to you the lighter 
                        feathers he normally keeps hidden 
                        underneath.

           He hands Mark the BOOK: “South Pacific Birds” by John 
           Eleuthere du Pont.

                                 DU PONT
                        It’s from about ten years back, but 
                        I thought you might find it 
                        interesting.

                                 MARK
                        You wrote this?

                                 DU PONT
                        I did.

           Mark seems genuinely touched and impressed.
                                 MARK
                        Thank you.  Do you want to come in?

                                 DU PONT
                        No no --

                                 MARK
                        -- The fridge is full - you 
                        probably know better than I do 
                        what’s in there --

                                 DU PONT
                        -- No.  You need your rest. 

           Du Pont hold up his own set of binoculars.

                                 DU PONT
                        -- I had a wonderful night a few 
                        years back when I spotted all eight 
                        Northeast species.  Right here on 
                        the farm.
                            (then)
                        You need to get started bright and 
                        early.  What do we have - two 
                        months to the Worlds?

                                 MARK
                        54 days.

                                 DU PONT
                        54 days.

                                 MARK
                            (he nods)
                        I’ve got a lot to do.

           Du Pont reaches out and puts his hand on Mark’s shoulder.

                                 DU PONT
                        You’ll do it.
                            (beat)
                        We’ll do it.

           On the two men standing in the porch light.  PRELAP the sound 
           of POUNDING FEET, getting louder and louder --

           INT. FOXCATCHER GYM - DAY

           CLOSE ON: Wrestling shoes running FAST in place on the gym 
           mat.  There are SIX SETS of feet in a wide circle -- 
           (Several weeks have passed.... TEAM FOXCATCHER is beginning 
           to come together.  ALSO: we may notice  -- the gym ceiling is 
           actually higher.)

                                 MARK
                        Drop!

           All six wrestlers, Mark included, drop to the mats for ten 
           fast push-ups and sit-ups.

           The wrestlers are: ROBERTO GARCIA, aka “GECKO” (21 years old, 
           105 pounds, Latino, as fast a talker as he is a wrestler); 
           JIM ZEREGA - “JIMMY Z” (24, 114 lbs., blond Midwesterner); 
           MATT POPPER (24, 149 lbs., East coast working class); BRUCE 
           SPRINGER (27, also 149 lbs., half Asian); MARK SCHULTZ (180 
           lbs.); and DAN BANE (30, 198 lbs., strong and low-key, 
           intelligent, from the West, like Mark.)

           The wrestlers jump up  -- run in place incredibly fast.

                                 MARK
                        Drop --

                                                           JUMP CUT TO:

           Garcia and Zerega are sprinting to the end of the mats and 
           back.  They’re doing relay shuttles, each pair racing each 
           other, then the next pair.

           Popper and Springer have just run (probably for the twentieth 
           time) - they’re BENT OVER, sucking wind by the wall.

           At some point during this DU PONT WALKS IN.  He wears a 
           sweatsuit, has a whistle around his neck.  He hovers a slight 
           distance away, observing, seeming to want to be noticed.

           Mark and Dan take off, racing, as Garcia BEATS Zerega --

                                 GARCIA
                        Latino Sandanista!  Once again!
                            (turns to Zerega)
                        Get used to it, my honky Contra...

            As Dan and Mark race back, Dan does notice du Pont --

                                 DAN
                        Hey Coach.

           Du Pont becomes at once an odd combination of a kid invited 
           to join in and the actual boss and benefactor of this team.

                                 DU PONT
                        Dan Bane.  How’s that hamstring?
                                 DAN
                        Coming back.  It’s coming back.

                                 DU PONT
                        Good.  Good to hear.

           A couple of the other wrestlers call out greetings to du 
           Pont.  He edges closer.  Mark walks up to him.

                                 MARK
                        You need me for something?

                                 DU PONT
                        No no.  Later.  Please.  Continue.

           Mark nods and turns back.

                                 MARK
                        Pair up.  On the mat.  Up and down.  
                        Popper, Springer, let’s go.

           Springer’s dragging a bit, clearly wiped out.

                                 GARCIA
                        Spring Roll - you gotta lay off the 
                        pork flied lice.

                                 SPRINGER
                            (exhausted)
                        Suck me, Gecko.
                            (then, as he comes onto 
                             the mat)
                        And I’m fucking Filipino, dickhead.

           The six wrestlers are paired and spread out on the mats - 
           each pair in the up-down position.

                                 MARK
                        Go!

           They all go to it -- the top wrestler trying to get a hold 
           secure enough to turn the other -- and the down wrestler 
           splayed on the mat, fending him off. 

           Du Pont hovers nearby, watching intently.  We can sense his 
           fascination - his admiration for these wrestlers.  His 
           entrancement.  Also, his jealousy - how desperately he’d love 
           to be part of this brotherhood of athletes. 

           He CLAPS, like a coach would.  He SAYS - awkwardly, and not 
           loudly enough:
                                 DU PONT
                        Good.
                            (claps again)
                        Good.

           EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - LATE AFTERNOON

           Mark, freshly showered, walks across the yard from the gym to 
           the Big House.  There are SEVERAL WORKMEN hammering in place 
           new siding under the field house eaves to cover the gap where 
           the roof was raised. 

           INT. DU PONT’S OFFICE/BIG HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

           Du Pont’s pouring himself a scotch and soda at the built-in 
           wall bar.  Mark’s in the SITTING AREA of this large office, 
           which gives the unmistakable impression of having been 
           inspired by the Oval Office.  (We should sense that this is 
           not the first of these meetings.)    

                                 DU PONT
                        I can’t get you anything at all?

                                 MARK
                        No, thank you.  I’m good.

                                 DU PONT
                        In training.  Excellent.

           He comes over and sits.  He’s immediately hushed and serious.

                                 DU PONT
                        Talk to me about Roberto Garcia.

           Beat.

                                 MARK
                        Gecko?  Great wrestler.  What do 
                        you want to know?

           Du Pont sits there nodding.  He’s mulling something.

                                 DU PONT
                        Just a sense. Keep your eye on him.  
                        Let me know of anything suspicious.

                                 MARK
                            (no idea what that means)
                        All right.
                                 DU PONT
                        Anything at all.

                                 MARK
                        I will.

           Du Pont stands and goes over to a carved WOODEN EAGLE on top 
           of one of the desk. 

                                 DU PONT
                        You see the artistry, the care, the 
                        craftsmanship that went into making 
                        this great American symbol?  You 
                        see the face hidden among the 
                        feathers?

           Mark looks.

                                 DU PONT
                        Right here.

           Mark looks.  He doesn’t see it.  But he NODS anyway.

                                 DU PONT
                        I want to exert the same care in 
                        crafting a world-class wrestling 
                        team here at Foxcatcher.

           Mark nods.

                                 DU PONT
                        How we doing with Dave Schultz?

                                 MARK
                        How do you mean?

                                 DU PONT
                        You were going to speak to him 
                        again.  When’s he coming? 

                                 MARK
                            (he never called Dave)
                        Right.  Look.  Dave’s... he’s got a 
                        good situation going up in Madison.  
                        He’s... he doesn’t want to uproot.  
                        The family.  Just at the moment. 
                            (beat)
                        At the present time. 

                                 DU PONT
                        He is a world class competitor - a 
                        world class coach - we are building 
                        a world class team.

                                 DU PONT (cont'd)
                        He belongs here.  Tell me what I 
                        have to offer him.

                                 MARK
                        John.  Dave can’t be bought.

           Silence.  Du Pont’s clearly not happy with this answer.  He 
           seems to make a decision to shift gears -- his tone turns 
           bright and positive- 

                                 DU PONT
                        Let me ask your opinion --

           He goes to the desk, where there are several large DRAWINGS 
           of a proposed Foxcatcher logo: a RED FOX running.  In some, 
           the fox runs one way, in some the other.  Mark approaches. 

                                 DU PONT
                        What do you think?  Right to left, 
                        or left to right?

           Silence as Mark examines the designs intently.  Then, finally-

                                 MARK
                        Right to left.

           Du Pont looks at him, then back at the drawings.  On the two 
           of them -- studying, contemplating...

           EXT. WOODS/FOXCATCHER - EARLY MORNING

           Mark RUNS hard through the woods - pushing himself - jumping 
           fallen branches, sprinting up hills.  He reaches the edge of 
           the woods and stops, bent over, breathing heavily.  

           He HEARS something:  Across the field, PRIZE HORSES are being 
           led out of the stables onto the grounds of the estate.  He 
           WATCHES, catching his breath. 

           A few wrestlers (Zerega, Popper and Dan Bane) emerge from the 
           woods behind Mark, running:  “Hey” “Wassup”, etc. between 
           them.  Then Dan Bane leaves the other two.   

                                 DAN
                        I’ll catch up with you all later.

           Zerega and Popper jog off.  Dan comes to stand next to Mark, 
           who has taken his little pair of BINOCULARS from the pocket 
           of his sweats and is looking through them.  After a moment, 
           he hands Dan the binoculars.  Dan looks through them.
                                 MARK
                        I’m pretty sure that’s John’s 
                        mother.

           BINOCULARS POV:  A VERY OLD WOMAN stands in front of her 
           wheelchair, with the help of an attendant.  When the horses 
           reach her, she TOUCHES THEM LOVINGLY, tenderly stroking their 
           faces, feeding them treats from her hands.  She’s completely 
           at home with these animals, as they are with her.

           INT. MARK’S OFFICE/FOXCATCHER GYM - LATE AFTERNOON

           Mark’s the only one in the gym.  He’s in his office, opening 
           several cardboard boxes which have been delivered.  Inside 
           are TEAM FOXCATCHER uniforms and sweats with the new LOGO on 
           them.  Brandon knocks on the open door, enters. 

                                 BRANDON
                        Want to make sure you’re all set 
                        for tonight --

                                 MARK
                        I’m good --

                                 BRANDON
                        You’ve got the right clothes, 
                        everything you need --

                                 MARK
                        I’m good.

                                 BRANDON
                        Okay then.
                            (starts to leave, then:)
                        And Mark.  He loves it when you 
                        call him coach.

           EXT. SHERATON PARK RIDGE HOTEL AND CONFERENCE CENTER - NIGHT

           A suburban corporate resort hotel.  A large banner over the 
           entrance reads: FIRST ANNUAL CITIZENS-POLICE LEAGUE BANQUET. 

                                 POLICE CHIEF DESOTA (V.O.)
                        ... We had no idea the kind of 
                        support we were set to receive when 
                        he founded CPL a year ago...
           INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS

           An odd mix of local police in dress uniforms and detectives 
           in cheap dark suits - all with their wives, decked out in 
           ball gowns and fake diamonds... and some wealthy local 
           businessmen with their bored spouses.  They’ve been mixed 
           together at 20 or 30 round dining tables.

           On the dais: a long table facing the audience with the 10 or 
           15 members of the CPL board - police chiefs, a business man 
           or two, and John du Pont, next to his guest, Mark Schultz.   

           Both John and Mark wear dark suits and ties.  Mark also wears 
           his Olympic GOLD MEDAL around his neck.

           Newtown Square Police Chief Desota is at the microphone -

                                 POLICE CHIEF DESOTA (CONT’D)
                        ... Now we’ve got the gear we need - 
                        bulletproof vests, night-vision 
                        goggles - all that kinda outfit.  
                        He also built a sweetheart of a 
                        firing range out at his estate.  If 
                        any of you been out there to see 
                        it, you probably also noticed he 
                        happens to be a damn good shot...

           Some knowing chuckles from the cops in the audience.  Du Pont 
           beams, loving it.  Desota holds up a PLAQUE -- 

                                 POLICE CHIEF DESOTA
                        ... John E. du Pont, the Citizens-
                        Police League is proud to give you 
                        our first annual Golden Pistol 
                        Award, and present you with your 
                        Honorary Newtown Police Badge.  
                        Welcome to the force. 

           Du Pont comes to the podium, shaking Chief Desota’s hand, 
           smiling broadly.  He turns to the crowd, speaks into the mic -

                                 DU PONT
                        I’m so honored to be given this... 
                        in particular, this badge.  To be 
                        considered one of you brave men is 
                        thrilling.  I humbly accept.  I’ve 
                        devoted my life to facilitating the 
                        achievement of the best in our 
                        country.  Most recently, I founded 
                        Team Foxcatcher to train a 
                        neglected class of patriot-
                        athletes: our Olympic wrestlers.

                                 DU PONT (cont'd)
                        I’m proud to coach men like gold 
                        medalist Mark Schultz -- Mark would 
                        you please stand --

           Mark stands uncomfortably, receives scattered APPLAUSE.  He 
           leans over to the microphone, speaks into it -

                                 MARK
                        Thank you, Coach.

           Du Pont beams, puts his arm around Mark.

           Mark leans in again toward the microphone --

                                 MARK
                        Seriously... He’s been like a 
                        father to me these past couple 
                        months.

           Du Pont could not be more gratified --

                                 DU PONT
                        The Olympic gold medal Mark wears 
                        around his neck is tarnished.  
                        Tarnished by the unpatriotic acts 
                        of the Carter administration, which 
                        caused the entire Eastern Bloc to 
                        boycott the ‘84 Games in Los 
                        Angeles.  Mark will have an 
                        opportunity in a few weeks to shine 
                        up that medal.  To prove his worth 
                        in front of the entire world.  I’ll 
                        be there in France with him.  
                        Gentlemen of law enforcement, you 
                        are our true heroes.  You and 
                        patriot-athletes like Mark Schultz.  
                        I salute you.

           He SALUTES.  As the applause starts --

           INT. WRESTLING ARENA/CLERMONT-FERRAND, FRANCE - DAY

           Dave Schultz SLAMS his opponent to the mat.  He’s in TEAM USA 
           uniform, and he’s dominating.

           Mark’s off to the side, watching his brother wrestle.  But 
           whether he’s fascinated, jealous, rooting -- we can’t tell.
           INT. WRESTLING ARENA/CLERMONT-FERRAND - LATER/DAY

           Mark wrestles like an animal - aggressive, forceful and fast.  
           Dave’s in Mark’s corner, coaching - focussed and intense, 
           shouting instruction and encouragement.

           On John du Pont, watching from the stands,

                                 FRENCH OFFICIAL (V.O.)
                        Soixante-quatorze kilos.

           INT. WEIGH-IN ROOM - DAY

                                 FRENCH OFFICIAL 
                        Seventy-four kilos.

           A Russian, ADLAN VARAEV, steps onto a low balance scale.  
           Several OFFICIALS check the beam, which dances a moment, then 
           hovers in equilibrium.

                                 FRENCH OFFICIAL
                        Bon.

           Varaev steps off.  Dave steps on.  The official holds the 
           beam, lets it go.  The pointer hovers in the middle.

                                 FRENCH OFFICIAL
                        Bon.

           Dave steps off, makes a joke in Russian.  Varaev smiles.  
           They walk away together speaking Russian and laughing.

                                 FRENCH OFFICIAL
                        Quatre-vingt-deux kilos.  Eighty-
                        two kilos.

           ALEXANDER NANEV, a Bulgarian, steps on the scale.  The 
           official adjusts the slider weight, lets the beam go.  It 
           hangs in equilibrium.  

                                 FRENCH OFFICIAL
                        Bon.

           Nanev steps off.  Mark steps on, face somber.  The official 
           lets the beam go.  The Bulgarian watches.

                                 FRENCH OFFICIAL
                        C’est bon.

           Mark steps off, glaring at Nanev, then walks away.
           INT. DAVE’S HOTEL ROOM - EVENING

           Loud.  The TV is on.  A few Team USA WRESTLERS watch the 
           French Sports TV wrap-up of the day’s matches.  Danielle 
           JUMPS on the bed near the window, with Nancy watching her.

                                 DANIELLE
                        One... twois... quatro!

           Nancy laughs.  Dave wrestles with Alexander on the other bed -

                                 DAVE
                        ...Fireman’s carry... to a half-
                        nelson... to a chicken wing... 
                        Wait!  A chicken wing? 

           He starts to gobble up Alex’s arm, who SHRIEKS in delight. 

           INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE DAVE’S ROOM - SAME TIME

           Du Pont and Mark are outside the door.  Mark holds a 
           VIDEOTAPE.  He KNOCKS.  Knocks again.  We HEAR Nancy’s voice 
           yell from inside: “It’s open!”  Mark opens the door.

           INT. DAVE’S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           It’s noisy and chaotic.  The wrestlers glance over, offer 
           cursory greetings: “Hey, Mark,” “What’s up”...

           Mark’s focussed on Dave, who wrestles with Alex - 

                                 MARK
                        Dave.

                                 DAVE
                        -- a scrambled-egg!... a feather-
                        pluck!...

           Dave’s plucking Alex and Alex is cracking up.

                                 MARK
                        Dave.

                                 DAVE
                        Oh, hey, Mark --

                                 MARK
                        Come meet Mr. du Pont.
           Dave sweeps up Alex and throws him over his shoulder, 
           carrying him to the door.  He SHAKES du Pont’s HAND.

                                 DAVE
                        Hi.  Dave Schultz.

                                 DU PONT
                        John du Pont.  It’s a pleasure to 
                        meet you in person finally.

                                 DAVE
                        This is Alex, that’s my wife, 
                        Nancy, our daughter Danielle.
                            (to Nancy)
                        Hey, Nance.  John du Pont.

           Nancy waves from over near the window -

                                 NANCY
                        Hey.

                                 DU PONT
                        Hello.

                                 DAVE
                        Come on in.  Can I get you a drink -

                                 DU PONT
                        No no.

                                 DAVE
                        You sure -- ?

                                 DU PONT
                        Thank you.  No.  I need to be 
                        getting back.  I’ll see you both 
                        tomorrow. 

           And he’s GONE.  Dave shrugs.  

                                 DAVE
                        Well, I know what I need.

                                 MARK
                        What?

                                 DAVE
                        Chicken drumstick!

           Alex SQUEALS.  He throws Alex on the bed and jumps on him.  
           Mark heads for the TV across the room.  Pops in his tape.  
                                 MARK
                        Dave, check out this tape I have on 
                        Nanev --  

                                 DAVE
                            (still wrestling)
                        Yeah --

                                 MARK
                        I want to show you this ankle pick--

                                 DAVE
                        Cue it up.

           As the tape cues up, Mark glances at Nancy.

                                 MARK
                        Too difficult to come say hello to 
                        Mr. du Pont?

                                 NANCY
                        I said hello.

           Mark just shakes his head.  She lights a CIGARETTE.

                                 NANCY
                        I’m watching my kid.

                                 MARK
                        Can you not do that in here?

                                 NANCY
                        Do what?

                                 MARK
                        Smoking.

                                 NANCY
                        Smoke?

                                 MARK
                        I wrestle tomorrow.

                                 NANCY
                        It’s my room, Mark.  You don’t have 
                        to be here.

                                 MARK
                        I’m trying to get some advice from 
                        my brother, get ready for the 
                        finals -- you start smoking?
                                 NANCY
                        So get out.  Go to your own room.

                                 MARK
                        Your kids are in here --

           She BLOWS SMOKE at him.

                                 MARK
                        What the hell is that?

                                 DAVE
                        Mark.  Calm down.

                                 MARK
                        I’m not the one frigging smoking.

                                 DAVE
                        The window’s open.  Relax.  Show me 
                        what you want me to look at.  

           Mark looks around the room.  At Alexander giggling on the 
           bed, at Danielle bouncing, Nancy smoking.  It’s all too much.  
           He pulls out the videotape and WALKS OUT the door.

           INT. ARENA/CLERMONT-FERRAND - DAY

           VARIOUS SHOTS: Final matches in progress, intense and brutal.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - SAME TIME

           Mark sits, alone, head in his hands.

           INT. ARENA/CLERMONT-FERRAND - SAME TIME

           Faces in the crowd watching; strained faces of the wrestlers.

           Mark Schultz and Alexander Nanev’s names are put up on the 
           board.  FINALS à 82 KILOS...

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - SAME TIME

           Du Pont enters.  Mark’s alone on a corner bench, frozen, head 
           in his hands.  Silence.

                                 DU PONT
                            (gently)
                        I think you’re up.
           Silence.  Mark doesn’t move.  Du Pont goes over to him, lays 
           his hand on his shoulder.  

                                 DU PONT 
                        Mark.

           Mark’s body starts to shake.  Du Pont speaks quietly, gently -

                                 DU PONT
                        Mark.  I’ve watched you these past 
                        two months.  You could not have 
                        trained harder.  You could not have 
                        prepared yourself more thoroughly.  
                        It’s going to be hard, but you 
                        could not be more ready for this 
                        day.

                                 MARK
                        I don’t want to let you down.

           This is surely the first time anyone has said anything like 
           this to John.  

                                 DU PONT
                        You couldn’t possibly.

           INT. ARENA/CLERMONT-FERRAND - MOMENTS LATER

           THE CAMERA’S TIGHT ON Mark, leading him, as he exits the 
           locker room into the arena.  Mark walks directly onto the 
           mat, straight to the center, faces off with Nanev.  THE 
           CAMERA stays tight on Mark looking directly at Nanev, as the 
           ref checks each of them.      

           WHISTLE.  The match begins.  Intense and rough.  Neither able 
           to gain an edge.  Dave coaches from Mark’s corner.

                                                                CUT TO:

           In between periods.  Mark sits as Dave FANS him with a towel, 
           shouting strategy - instructing - focussed.  Du Pont watches 
           this from the stands.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Mark and Nanev wrestle the final seconds -- Mark ahead by a 
           point.  Nanev tries desperately to turn Mark, to gain any 
           advantage.  The whistle blows. 

           The ref takes each of their hands.  He RAISES Mark’s.  He 
           turns them around, raises Mark’s hand again.
           Mark does a BACK FLIP.  He trots over to the opposing coach, 
           shakes his hand.  He trots to his corner where Dave - 
           beaming, his arms open wide - embraces him.  Mark hugs his 
           brother quickly, then turns to LOOK OUT into the stands.  

           He SPOTS du Pont, who’s coming down the steps toward the 
           platform.  Mark walks toward him.  The enormity of what he’s 
           just accomplished STARTS TO HIT Mark.  His face is red.  He 
           reaches du Pont, and from a step below him, THROWS HIS ARMS 
           around him, clings to him.  Mark starts to SOB. 

           Du Pont holds him as he looks out toward the wrestling mat, 
           where Dave watches. 

           INT. ARENA/CLERMONT-FERRAND - LATER

           The “Star-Spangled” Banner plays as the US flag is raised.  
           Du Pont watches Mark receive his GOLD MEDAL.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. TROPHY ROOM/BIG HOUSE - NIGHT

           The beginning “AAAAAH’s” of David Bowie’s “LET’S DANCE” blast 
           from the stereo.  Team Foxcatcher wrestlers are huddled in a 
           circle in the Trophy Room -- shouting the “AAAAAAAH’s” along 
           with the thin white duke.  Each one holds a BOTTLE OF 
           CHAMPAGNE and is shaking it up as they sing. 

           When the chords kick in, they POP THEIR CORKS -- SPRAYING 
           champagne on each other, shouting and laughing wildly.  Then 
           they all CHUG the rest of their bottles.  Du Pont is dancing 
           around outside the circle, doing his best Euro-electronica 
           moves, and drinking from his bottle (and it’s not his first).  
           The wrestlers DANCE.  When du Pont finishes his bottle --

                                 DU PONT
                        Let’s clear it out!

           He gestures toward the OPEN center section of the enormous 
           TROPHY CASE -- the entirety of which is filled with horse-
           jumping and fox-hunting medals, ribbons and plaques.

           Some of the wrestlers start taking down what’s in there.  A 
           few of the others open more liquor...

                                 DU PONT
                        Oh, yes!

                                 SPRINGER
                        You sure about this?
                                 DU PONT
                        Mother’s idea of sport is riding a 
                        horse that’s chasing a dog that’s 
                        chasing a fox.  I don’t share her 
                        affection for horseflesh --

           The center case is cleared out.

                                 DU PONT
                        Put ‘em up, boys!

           They hang their wrestling medals, place in wrestling trophies 
           and other awards -- leaving the TOP FEW HOOKS EMPTY. 

                                 WRESTLERS
                            (chanting together)
                        Mark!  Mark!  Mark!  Mark!...

           Mark hangs his OLYMPIC and WORLD CUP GOLDS on the top hooks. 

                                 WRESTLERS
                        U.S.A!  U.S.A!  U.S.A!...

           Du Pont raises his bottle to Mark --

                                 DU PONT
                        You’ve brought honor to Team 
                        Foxcatcher.

           He starts to walk toward him.

                                 DU PONT
                        You’ve brought honor to --

           He SLIPS on the wet floor and his feet fly up in front of 
           him, landing him FLAT ON HIS BACK.  

           SILENCE.  Du Pont’s lying there, shaking -- is he crying?  No 
           one knows what exactly to do.  Dan Bane approaches him.

                                 DAN
                        You all right, Coach?

           Du Pont starts LAUGHING out loud.  Hugely relieved, Dan holds 
           his hand out to him to help him up.  

           Du Pont takes Dan’s hand and promptly pulls him to the 
           ground... and... JUMPS on his back -- WRESTLING with him.  
           The wrestlers, including Mark, go crazy, CHEERING him on.

           Dan lets du Pont get the best of him... lets du Pont PIN him.  
           The wrestlers are cheering madly as du Pont stands with his 
           arms raised.  He makes as if he’s about to do a back flip 
           (like Mark), then sits and does a clumsy backwards 
           somersault.  Wild cheers.  

                                 DU PONT
                        More drinks!

           He’s on his knees, fists in the air, head thrown back -- 
           TOTALLY EXULTANT... 

           PRELAP sound of a GUNSHOT -

           EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - NEXT MORNING

           VARIOUS SHOTS: The AMERICAN FLAG is being raised; the horses 
           tended to; a hawk soars above the trees.

           CAMERA picks up three wrestlers running off their hangovers -- 
           Zerega, Popper and Springer.  They pick up speed as the 
           camera stays with them.  WE HEAR more gunshots as they run 
           through the grounds -- the SHOTS get louder and louder. 

           The wrestlers run somewhat near the FIRING RANGE, where 
           several members of the NEWTOWN POLICE DEPARTMENT, in uniform, 
           are SHOOTING target practice with DU PONT. 

           Du Pont wears a “Team Foxcatcher” zip SWEATJACKET - with his 
           honorary POLICE BADGE pinned to one breast.  On the other 
           breast are sewn the words: “Head Coach”, and JOHN “EAGLE” DU 
           PONT.   He’s about to SHOOT when the wrestlers pass by --

                                 WRESTLERS
                        Duuuuupont!  Johnny D!  Bossman!...

           Du Pont, still holding his pistol, turns to watch them run 
           past.  His expression seems oddly, entirely blank.

           INT. FOXCATCHER GYM/WEIGHT ROOM - DAY

           A few wrestlers lift weights -- the others are hanging out, 
           resting, talking.  Du Pont wanders in, his target practice 
           PISTOL dangling from the crook of his arm.  A few guys notice 
           him, greet him CASUALLY, go back to what they were doing. 

                                 DU PONT
                        321 days to Seoul, gentlemen.  321 
                        days.  Let’s get to work.

           He gestures for Mark to join him.
                                 DU PONT
                        Champ.  Come walk with me.

           EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - DAY

           CLOSE ON: a CHECK for $10,000.00 made out to Mark Schultz.  

                                 MARK (O.S.)
                        You don’t have to do this.

           PULL BACK to see Mark and John, still cradling the pistol, 
           walking across the huge lawn.  Mark is holding the check.

                                 DU PONT
                        Consider it a guarantee that you 
                        don’t need to concern yourself with 
                        anything but winning at the 
                        Olympics.  You deserve it.

                                 MARK
                            (quietly, genuine)
                        Thank you, sir.

                                 DU PONT
                        Please.  Call me John.  I think we 
                        know each other well enough.  Or 
                        Coach.  Whichever you prefer.  
                        Coach.  Or John.  Coach is good.

           Mark nods, folds the check, puts it in his shorts pocket.  Du 
           Pont puts his hand on Mark’s shoulder.

                                 DU PONT
                        I want to start involving you in 
                        more of the marketing around here.  
                        Of Team Foxcatcher.  Of the 
                        Foxcatcher name.

                                 MARK
                            (flattered)
                        Of course.

                                 DU PONT
                        We’ve got to sell this thing.
                            (silence as they walk)
                        So how’re we doing with Dave?
                            (no response)
                        You spoke to him again at the 
                        Worlds --
                                 MARK
                        I know.  Yes.  I did.  
                            (beat)
                        It’s not gonna happen.  He’s been 
                        offered a contract extension at 
                        Wisconsin, Team USA wants him to 
                        train Olympic wrestlers next 
                        summer...  He... it’s not gonna 
                        happen.

           Du Pont’s not pleased with this answer.  They walk in SILENCE 
           for several moments.

                                 DU PONT
                        It’s probably best.  Dave 
                        intimidates you.  You don’t believe 
                        you can ever do better than your 
                        older brother.  A glass ceiling.  
                        Impossible for you to break 
                        through.  

           Du Pont quickens his pace and changes the subject.

                                 DU PONT
                        So, what do you know about Masters 
                        League wrestling tournaments?

                                 MARK
                        Uh... well... not all that mu --

                                 DU PONT
                        -- Because I’m thinking of entering 
                        one.

           Mark jogs after him to catch up...

                                 MARK
                        Okay...

                                                                CUT TO:

           CLOSE ON:  VIDEOTAPE image of Mark at the 1984 Olympics, his 
           hand being raised by the ref... Mark raises both hands in the 
           air, glances slightly down, then out at the crowd... 

           The image FREEZES, is rewound, plays again.  At the moment 
           Mark raises his arms and GLANCES DOWN, the image FREEZES.

           INT. DINING ROOM/BIG HOUSE - CONTINUOUS/DAY

           The furniture has been pushed to the walls in the huge formal 
           dining room, and a large WHITE SCRIM has been erected at one 
           end.  A FASHION PHOTOGRAPHER who could double as a member of 
           the band Devo, stands at a video monitor with du Pont.  

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        He vears de singlet viz de name of 
                        de Foxcatcher -

                                 DU PONT
                        - and the gold medal -

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        - and, of course, de golden medal.  
                        And much oil.

           Mark emerges from a dressing area wearing his FOXCATCHER 
           SINGLET and Olympic gold.  He walks to his spot in front of 
           the scrim.

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Much of de oil.  Please.  Much oil.  
                        It is defining de musculature.

           Two assistants slather baby oil on Mark’s arms and chest and 
           legs as the photographer SHOWS Mark the pose on the monitor. 

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        You are vinning de golden medal.  
                        You are raising de arms for de 
                        triumph, yet are also having 
                        humility.

           Du Pont is hanging back, but staring intensely at Mark.  Mark 
           looks over to him.

                                 MARK
                        You good with this?

                                 DU PONT
                        It’s wonderful.  It’s exactly what 
                        I needed from you.

           The photographer takes his place behind the camera as the 
           assistants finish with the baby oil and clear away. 

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Goot!  Now.  Mark Schultz.  You are 
                        vinning de golden medal!
           Mark raises his arms and glances down.  FLASH.  FLASH.

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Goot!  And again!

           MONTAGE:  LIFE AT FOXCATCHER -- SEVERAL MONTHS PASS

           VARIOUS SCENES: of wrestling practice; a team dinner - the 
           finished, FRAMED POSTER OF MARK, oiled up in the Foxcatcher 
           singlet, hangs on the wall; Mark and John walking the grounds 
           talking intensely - John’s arm around Mark’s shoulders; 
           horses being groomed.

           The montage ends with: a HELICOPTER descends past BARREN, 
           LATE FALL TREES toward the Foxcatcher lawn. 

           EXT. FOXCATCHER LAWN - TWILIGHT

           Mark and John, wearing TUXEDOS, board the helicopter.  It’s 
           cold out.

           INT. HELICOPTER (AIRBORNE) - EVENING

           Mark and John are flown southwest toward Washington DC by 
           Larry the pilot.  Mark’s looking at the darkening landscape.     

                                 DU PONT
                        Beautiful country isn’t it?  We 
                        have a lot to be grateful for.

           Mark smiles.  Du Pont removes a folded piece of paper from 
           his jacket pocket, hands it to Mark.

                                 DU PONT
                        Brandon prepared some remarks.

           Mark takes the paper and reads it over.  He looks NERVOUS.

                                 DU PONT
                        Don’t be nervous.  You’ll do great.

           Mark’s not so sure.  Then he HEARS a SNIFF.  He looks over at 
           du Pont: he’s got what looks like a COCAINE BULLET in one 
           nostril.  Du Pont inhales, then OFFERS the bullet to Mark.  
           Mark’s frozen--

                                 DU PONT
                        You’ve never done this?
                            (Mark shakes his head)
                                 (MORE)
                                 DU PONT (cont'd)
                        It helps put everything in 
                        perspective.  Trust me. 
                            (then)
                        This event is going to be a lot 
                        more tolerable with a little 
                        assistance.  
                            (beat)
                        Mark.  Trust me.

           Mark takes the coke bullet, examines it for several moments, 
           then holds it to one nostril.  He INHALES.

                                 DU PONT
                        You brought the medals?

           Mark nods.

                                 DU PONT
                        Good.

           EXT. HELICOPTER (AIRBORNE) - NIGHT/ESTABLISHING

           The helicopter nears the LIT UP city of WASHINGTON D.C.

           INT. HILTON HOTEL, DC/COCKTAIL AREA - NIGHT

           LARGE SIGN on an EASEL by the entrance reads: “CITIZENS’ 
           DEFENSE OF PATRIOTS FUND - 1st ANNUAL GALA AND AUCTION”.

           Loads of tuxedoed Republicans and their wives or mistresses 
           mill about.  Small talk, hearty laughter, awarding of defense 
           contracts, gallons of martinis. 

           John du Pont is being chatted up by a couple of GOP 
           Congressman - hopeful he’ll kick in for their re-election 
           funds.  Du Pont is vibrant and engaged.  Mark stands next to 
           him, ram-rod straight and frozen -- except for incessantly 
           CHEWING the inside of his lip and RUNNING HIS TONGUE over his 
           gums.  He wears both his Olympic and World Cup GOLD MEDALS.

                                 GOP CONGRESSMAN #1
                            (looks an awful lot like a 
                             younger Dick Cheney)
                        Admiral Poindexter wishes he could 
                        have been here, but sincerely 
                        thanks you for sponsoring this 
                        evening.

                                 DU PONT
                        Oh, I just want to help.  I see 
                        myself as an aide to ignored 
                        patriots.
                                 GOP CONGRESSMAN #2
                            (bears a startling 
                             resemblance to Tom Ridge)
                        Hopefully not just ignored ones.  
                        Hopefully elected ones too!

           They all LAUGH.  Except Mark, who’s too busy chewing his lip.

           INT. HILTON HOTEL, DC/COCKTAIL AREA - LATER/NIGHT

           Du Pont’s talking to several blue-haired women.  Mark stands 
           at attention by his side.

                                 DU PONT
                        ... Lately I’ve been helping 
                        patriots like this young man - gold 
                        medal wrestler, Mark Schultz.  

           He puts his hand on Mark’s shoulder, who just stands there, 
           bug-eyed.  Pause.

                                 BLUE HAIRED WOMAN
                        Is that different from the boxing?

           INT. HILTON HOTEL, DC/COCKTAIL AREA - LATER/NIGHT

           A few middle-aged MEN stand with Du Pont and Mark.  One of 
           them is examining Mark’s Olympic Gold.

                                 MIDDLE-AGED MAN
                        Yup - that’s the one the commies 
                        didn’t come to.

           INT. HILTON HOTEL, DC/HALLWAY - LATER

           Du Pont and Mark huddle in a nook of an empty hallway.  We 
           can HEAR the party.  Each SNORTS another bump.

                                 DU PONT
                        How you holding up?

                                 MARK
                        Great sir.  I feel great.

                                 DU PONT
                        Good.  You’re going to do great.
                                 MARK
                        Do you think it would be okay if I 
                        had a beer?  I think it would calm 
                        me down for the speech.

                                 DU PONT
                            (taking another bump)
                        Yeah.

                                 MARK (V.O.)
                        ... respected ornithologist, 
                        philatelist, conchologist --

           INT. HILTON HOTEL, DC/BANQUET HALL - NIGHT

           Mark’s on stage, at the podium, READING from his Brandon-
           prepared remarks with - shall we say - some vigor...

                                 MARK
                        -- world explorer, author, 
                        philanthropist, and former 
                        pentathlete.  And I’m proud to 
                        announce that he’ll make his return 
                        to competitive sports in the over-
                        50 category at the Masters’ League  
                        du Pont Wrestling Invitational in 
                        Phoenix this March.  

           Scattered applause, though no one has any idea what he’s 
           talking about.  Du Pont watches approvingly from the wings.

                                 MARK
                        It is with great honor that I 
                        introduce my mentor, my coach, my 
                        friend - the Golden, uh...
                        Eagle of America - John du Pont...

           Applause as du Pont strides onstage.

           INT. THE CHALET - LATE MORNING

           Mark wakes up, face down on his bed, opens his eyes.  He 
           squints from the bright sunlight, from his pounding headache.

           EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - LATE MORNING

           Mark walks, bleary-eyed, toward the gym.  He opens the door.
           INT. FOXCATCHER GYM - CONTINUOUS

           Mark enters.  There’s no one inside though someone has left a 
           boombox playing FOREIGNER.  The place is in DISARRAY - free 
           weights not replaced, sweaty towels on the floor.  He surveys 
           the mess for a moment, then walks out.

           INT. FOXCATCHER POOL HOUSE - SAME TIME

           CAMERA pans over the TILED MOSAIC WALL of the newly finished 
           pool house, which depicts John du Pont in each of the five 
           pentathlon sports: fencing, running, shooting, swimming and 
           horse-jumping.

           As the camera reaches the horse-jumping panel, we SEE Garcia 
           is drawing an ENORMOUS PENIS onto the horse with a magic 
           marker.  Zerega, Popper and Springer are cracking up.

                                 GARCIA
                            (imitating du Pont)
                        In certain ways I do share my 
                        mother’s affection for horseflesh.

           The guys fall all over each other.  We see that Mark has 
           entered at the far end.

                                 MARK
                        What the hell is going on?

           They stop immediately and turn to him.

                                 GARCIA
                        Oh.  Hey.  Mark.  We’re just 
                        screwing around.  
                            (re: the magic marker)
                        It comes off.  

                                 MARK
                        So take it off.

           Garcia looks around for something to wipe it off with.

                                 MARK
                        Now.

           Garcia takes off his shirt, dips it in the pool, and starts 
           wiping the wall clean.  

                                 MARK
                        Then go clean up the goddamn gym.
           Mark walks out.

           EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - ESTABLISHING/LATE AFTERNOON

           Some time has passed.  Lights are on in the windows of the 
           Field House Gym.  

           INT. FOXCATCHER GYM - LATE AFTERNOON

           On the mat, Dan Bane has Mark in a hold from behind.  He and 
           Mark are demonstrating a move for du Pont.  Du Pont stands 
           next to them as Mark narrates his escape and reversal.

           Bane stands up and du Pont gets on the mat with Mark.  Mark 
           holds him from behind.

                                 MARK
                        Ready?  Go.

           Du Pont clumsily attempts the escape.  Mark is incredibly 
           gentle with him, even tender, easing him through the moves.  

                                 MARK
                        Okay.  Let’s try it again.

           The other guys are finished for the day - hang out, stretch.  
           We should get the sense that THIS IS NOT THE FIRST OF THESE 
           LESSONS - they’re used to it and don’t pay it much attention.

           INT. THE CHALET - NIGHT

           Mark’s in shorts - no shirt - on the phone.  He’s sipping a 
           beer, walking around the living room --

                                 MARK (ON PHONE)
                        Yeah.  I’m good.  Yeah.

           He listens.  We don’t yet hear the person on the other end.

                                 MARK (ON PHONE)
                        Yeah.  All good.

           INTERCUT with Dave in the U. of W. gym office, looking out 
           over a wrestling team night practice.

                                 DAVE (ON PHONE)
                        You working hard?
                                 MARK (ON PHONE)
                        That’s the whole point, bro.  We 
                        rake in the big bucks and we don’t 
                        have to work hard --

                                 DAVE (ON PHONE)
                        I meant your training.

           Beat.

                                 MARK (ON PHONE)
                        Oh.  Yeah.  No - I’m kind of giving 
                        myself a bit of a break right now.  
                        I’ll ramp up again as the trials 
                        come closer. 

                                 DAVE (ON PHONE)
                            (a moment, then:)
                        All right.

           There a KNOCK on Mark’s window.  Mark looks over and sees du 
           Pont standing outside, an eager look on his face.  He beckons 
           to Mark and moves TWO FINGERS as if cutting his own hair.  

                                 DAVE (ON PHONE)
                        How close?

                                 MARK
                            (to du Pont)
                        Just a sec...

                                 DAVE (ON PHONE)
                        What’s that?

                                 MARK (ON PHONE)
                        No - I wasn’t... Listen, I gotta 
                        run...

                                 DAVE (ON PHONE)
                        What’re you doing?

                                 MARK (ON PHONE)
                        I gotta run.

           Beat.

                                 DAVE (ON PHONE)
                        All right.  Call me soon --

                                 MARK (ON PHONE)
                        -- I will --
                                 DAVE (ON PHONE)
                        -- You’re a tough man to track 
                        down.  Call me --

                                 MARK (ON PHONE)
                        -- I will -- I gotta roll.

           As Mark HANGS UP, Bowie’s “China Girl” starts to PLAY.

           EXT. VERANDA/BIG HOUSE - NIGHT

           Mark crops du Pont’s hair with an ELECTRIC CLIPPER.  “China 
           Girl” PLAYS through outdoor speakers.  Du Pont’s drunk enough 
           that his defenses are down.

           It’s unseasonably warm out and Mark’s in shorts and flip 
           flops.  A vanity table is on the veranda with a mirror.  
           There’s a bowl of WHITE POWDER on the table.  Both men are 
           drinking from bottles of champagne.   

                                 MARK
                        Looking good --

           No reply.  Du Pont appears melancholic.

                                 MARK
                        -- Looking tough.

           Mark finishes buzzing and he’s looking at du Pont’s crew cut 
           in the mirror.  

                                 MARK
                        I think you’re ready.
                            (beat)
                        We just need some more talc. 

           They both reach over to the bowl of “talc”, rub some on their 
           gums -- then they each then snort a line.

                                 MARK
                        Yah!  I think you’re ready.    

                                 DU PONT
                        I appreciate this...

                                 MARK
                        You’ve done the training, you 
                        learned the moves.  You’re ready to 
                        rumble.

                                 DU PONT
                        No.  Mark.  I appreciate this.
           A moment, then:

                                 MARK
                        It’s nothing.

                                 DU PONT
                        When I was fourteen, my best friend 
                        was Clifford Holt, our gardener’s 
                        son.  Then I found out Mother had 
                        been paying him for years to look 
                        out for me.  

           Mark doesn’t know what to say -- though he does sense that du 
           Pont is opening up to him.

                                 MARK
                        We all have our demons.

                                 DU PONT
                            (totally sincere)
                        It’s good to know you and I have 
                        come to this without any of that 
                        nonsense.  Financial nonsense.

           Beat.  Mark is actually touched.  He opens up himself.

                                 MARK
                        When I’m flying to a tournament I’m 
                        so goddamn scared I actually hope 
                        the plane goes down.  I know I’m 
                        gonna push myself harder than I 
                        ever have - I know it’s gonna be 
                        more painful - and I’m sitting 
                        there just wishing the plane 
                        crashes.  I swear.  
                            (then)
                        But that’s what it’s about: conquer 
                        your demons.  You gotta conquer 
                        your demons.

           Du Pont stands up. Expressionless, he disappears through the 
           sliding glass doors into the house.  After a moment, Mark 
           turns to LOOK OUT over the dark grounds of Foxcatcher.  
           Peaceful.  

           Then Mark practically jumps out of his skin as a MACHINE GUN 
           FIRES several rounds behind him.  When he turns around, 
           there’s du Pont, a determined look on his face, pointing a 
           semi-automatic MACHINE GUN out into the rolling landscape. 

                                 DU PONT
                        Got to conquer your demons.
           He FIRES again, a short burst of bullets into the dark.

                                 MARK
                        Yah!  Conquer your demons, baby!  
                        Kill them!

           Du Pont fires again.

                                 MARK
                        Yeahhhhh!!!!

           Du Pont ceases fire and looks out.  He begins lowering the 
           gun when it accidentally goes off, firing a few bullets into 
           the wood deck -- though he doesn’t seem to notice.

                                 DU PONT
                        They’re all dead.

           INT. LEAR JET - DAY

           SILENCE, save for the steady HUM of flight inside the cabin. 

           Du Pont’s gazing out the window of this private jet; he’s got 
           his game face on, but he’s clearly terrified of the upcoming 
           match.  Mark sits next to him, on the aisle.  Mark WATCHES 
           the FLIGHT ATTENDANT bend over in the galley, reaching for 
           something.  She stands, then glances back at Mark, SMILES.   

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Mark’s fucking the flight attendant on the hotel bed, 
           pounding away.  They’ve clearly been going like this for a 
           while.  After several more thrusts, she stops him.

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        Lemme climb on top, baby.
                            (Mark just looks at her)
                        Switch with me.  Lie back.  Lemme 
                        do the work.

                                 MARK
                        I never lie on my back.

           Beat.

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        What?  Why?
                                 MARK
                        Too much like getting pinned.  I 
                        don’t want to get used to it.  I 
                        don’t lie on my back.

           They just look at each other.  LONG BEAT.  Then Mark starts 
           to THRUST away again --

           INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - MORNING

           Mark’s waiting for his eggs.  A few other people are 
           scattered around the restaurant.  Mark watches a middle-aged, 
           STRINGY-HAIRED MAN get his food delivered to him.  The waiter 
           walks away and the MAN just looks at his food.  Then, the man 
           SQUAWKS, very much like a bird.  Mark’s looking at him, not 
           sure how to react.  The man starts to eat.

           INT. PHOENIX ARENA - DAY

           In between periods at the du Pont Masters Open.  Very few 
           people watch from the bleachers.  Mark FANS an exhausted du 
           Pont with a white towel.  Du Pont’s in his Foxcatcher 
           singlet, SLUMPED in his chair.  Large posters of the oiled-up 
           Mark are on the walls.  

                                 MARK
                        When he gives you the slightest 
                        opening, you gotta shoot in on him.  
                        Shoot!  Be aggressive.  Show him 
                        who’s boss.

           Du Pont nods wearily.  He can barely move.  The REF whistles 
           the start of the third period.

                                                                CUT TO:

           The final minute of the match.  It’s CLEARLY RIGGED.  The 
           OTHER WRESTLER is trying to let the exhausted du Pont get the 
           best of him.  Mark watches. 

           The REF blows the end of match whistle.  The wrestlers stand, 
           du Pont struggling to his feet.  The ref takes each of their 
           hands, and raises.... du Pont’s.  He’s “won”.  

           Du Pont limps off the mat.  It’s clear he knows that Mark 
           understands the pathetic absurdity of this match.  But he 
           raises his eyebrows at Mark, puts on a proud face -

                                 DU PONT
                        Not bad for an old man.
           Mark nods, conjures up a smile.

           EXT. FOXCACHER LAWN - EVENING/ESTABLISHING

           The helicopter is on the lawn, its blades slowing, shutting 
           down.  

                                 DU PONT (V.O.)
                        I’ve rearranged some of the horse 
                        ribbons, Mother...

           INT. JEAN DU PONT’S ROOMS/FOXCATCHER - EVENING

           Du Pont is seated in front of his mother, Jean du Pont, next 
           to a third floor window in her room.  She’s in a wheelchair, 
           oxygen tubes in her nose, but ALERT, IMPERIOUS.

                                 DU PONT
                        ... Some of the older prizes in the 
                        trophy case.  To make room for Team 
                        Foxcatcher medals.  
                            (beat)
                        For wrestling awards.

           Silence.  Jean just looks at her son, not reacting.

                                 DU PONT
                        Including this, Mother.  Ha.  Which 
                        I’ve actually just won.

           He takes his WINNER’S PLAQUE out of a duffel bag, trying to 
           be casual, but seeming all the more like an eager 9 year-old.  
           He holds it out for her.  She doesn’t take it, but leans 
           forward slightly to read what’s inscribed on it: “FIRST 
           PLACE, OVER-50, DU PONT MASTER’S INVITATIONAL:  JOHN ‘EAGLE’ 
           DU PONT.”  She sits back. 

                                 JEAN
                        Which ribbons?

                                 DU PONT
                        I’m sorry?

                                 JEAN
                        Which ribbons did you move?

                                 DU PONT
                        Just some of the older ones.  From 
                        the case.  
                            (silence)
                        From one of the cases.
           Silence.

                                 JEAN
                        I’ll have a look later to see 
                        exactly what you’ve done.

           EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - NEXT MORNING/ESTABLISHING

           On the vast lawn, the gardener drives his mower. 

           INT. FOXCATCHER GYM - LATE MORNING

           Du Pont, in Foxcatcher sweats, walks in.  The gym is EMPTY.

           INT. GARCIA AND ZEREGA’S BUNGALOW/FOXCATCHER - LATE MORNING

           Mark and the team are watching a VIDEOTAPE Garcia has gotten 
           of an early ULTIMATE FIGHTING MATCH.  It’s an American street 
           fighter versus a huge Brazilian Jujutsu expert.  The match is 
           brutal and bloody and the wrestlers watching are CLEARLY INTO 
           IT.  Mark is lying on the couch - attentive, but quiet.

           There’s KNOCKING at the door, but the guys don’t notice it.  
           Much LOUDER KNOCKING.  Garcia opens the door.  It’s du Pont. 

                                 GARCIA
                        Hey!  Coach D! -- what’s going on 
                        with --

                                 DU PONT
                        -- Where’s Mark --?

                                 GARCIA
                        -- He’s --

                                 DU PONT
                        -- I want to see him.

           Du Pont STRIDES in past Garcia - Mark RISES to greet him - 
           and Dan has the presence of mind to PAUSE the video. 

                                 MARK
                        Hi, John --

                                 DU PONT
                        -- I go by the gym - it’s 11 a.m. - 
                        and no one’s in there.  No one’s in 
                        there.  In the gym.
                                 MARK
                        Yeah, no, exactly -- We’ve got an 
                        intense workout scheduled this 
                        afternoon.  A real intense one.  So 
                        we’re taking the morning to --

                                 DU PONT
                        -- Who exactly is in charge around 
                        here?

                                 MARK
                        ... Well, I mean, I --

                                 DU PONT
                        -- Where do we stand on Dave?

           Beat.

                                 MARK
                        On what?

                                 DU PONT
                        David Schultz.  He’s your brother.  
                        When is he coming to Foxcatcher?

           Beat.  Then, Mark LAUGHS, glancing briefly at the other guys. 

                                 MARK
                        Listen, John, seriously, I don’t 
                        know how many times I have to tell--

           Du Pont SLAPS Mark.  HARD.  VERY HARD, across the face.

           SILENCE.  NO ONE MOVES.

           Mark could destroy du Pont.  He doesn’t seem to even consider 
           it.  He just stands there, like a chastened schoolboy, his 
           face reddening.  Du Pont WALKS OUT.  No one speaks.  Then: 

                                 GARCIA
                        You got bitch-slapped.

           Mark turns to Garcia.

                                 GARCIA
                        Oh shit.

           Garcia runs into the other room.  

           Mark heads out the door, onto the porch.  He sees du Pont 
           pulling away in his black Ford Mercury, down the dirt road, 
           under the trees.  
           INT. BATHROOM/THE CHALET - DAY

           Mark stands at the sink STARING at his reflection as the 
           mirror fogs over from the RUNNING SHOWER.  One side of Mark’s 
           face is red where du Pont slapped him.

                                                           JUMP CUT TO:

           Mark’s in the shower, aggressively washing.

                                                           JUMP CUT TO:

           Mark SHAVES.

                                                           JUMP CUT TO:

           INT. BEDROOM/THE CHALET - DAY

           Mark sits on the edge of his bed.  He’s neatly dressed, his 
           wet hair brushed.  He doesn’t move.

           EXT. FOXCACHER LAWN - DAY

           Mark walks across the vast lawn toward the Big House.

           INT. OFFICE ENTRANCE/BIG HOUSE - DAY

           Mark enters the Big House through the rear office entrance.  
           He walks toward the SECRETARY’S desk.  

                                 MARK
                        I need to see Mr. Du Pont.

                                 SECRETARY
                        Hi, Mark.  How are you today?

           Mark nods, not really responding.  As she speaks to him, she 
           discretely PRESSES A BUTTON on the underside of the desk.

                                 SECRETARY
                        That’s good.  I’m sorry to say that 
                        you may have to wait on your 
                        request though, since--

                                 MARK
                        Yah.  I can’t do that --

           Stan Beck comes down the stairs from the suite of offices.
                                 STAN BECK
                        Hi, Mark.  How are things?

                                 MARK
                        They’re fine.  I need to talk to 
                        John.

                                 STAN BECK
                        Mr. Du Pont’s not available right 
                        now.

                                 MARK
                        Stan, listen... Something happened - 
                        there was a... misunderstanding - I 
                        need to talk to him. 

                                 STAN BECK
                        I get that.  But Mr. du Pont’s away 
                        for the afternoon on business.  
                        I’ll tell him you came by.
                            (Beat.  Mark doesn’t move)
                        You’re going to have to do this 
                        later.

           Mark’s frozen still, not knowing what to do, where to go.

                                 STAN BECK
                        And, Mark.  Don’t forget -- 
                            (Mark looks at him)
                        You’re one of the guests at dinner 
                        tomorrow night.

           Stan walks away.  On Mark.  PRELAP of a PHONE RINGING.

           INT. KITCHEN/THE CHALET - NEXT EVENING

           Mark’s tying his tie in the reflection of the microwave door.  
           Phone is RINGING.  He picks it up, keeps tying the tie. 

                                 MARK (ON PHONE)
                        Yah.

                                 DAVE’S VOICE (OVER PHONE)
                        You psyched to see me?

           Mark’s got no idea what he’s talking about, but plays along.

                                 MARK (ON PHONE)
                        Always.

           INTERCUT with Dave in his kitchen at home.  Nancy’s feeding 
           the kids, lots of activity and noise.
                                 DAVE (ON PHONE)
                        ‘Cause I’m psyched to see you, bro.

           Mark’s slides the tie knot up to his collar.

                                 MARK (ON PHONE)
                        You plan early.

                                 DAVE (ON PHONE)
                        So, shoot me - I’m excited.  It’s 
                        only a week from now, anyway.

                                 MARK (ON PHONE)
                        Dave, trials aren’t till June.  I 
                        don’t know what you’re smoking 
                        lately -- 

                                 DAVE (ON PHONE)
                        I’m coming out next week.

                                 MARK (ON PHONE)
                            (confused)
                        Coming where?

                                 DAVE (ON PHONE)
                        To Foxcatcher.

           In their kitchen, Nancy looks over at Dave, confused.

                                 DAVE (ON PHONE)
                        To coach.  Didn’t John tell you? 

           In his kitchen, Mark’s mind is racing.

                                 MARK (ON PHONE)
                        Right, no, yeah... he mentioned 
                        something... I’ve been so busy, 
                        training and... and whatnot...

           He fades out.

                                 DAVE (ON PHONE)
                        He finally made me an offer I 
                        couldn’t refuse.

           Mark’s not able to speak.  Not moving a muscle.

                                 DAVE (ON PHONE)
                        So get your ass in shape, my 
                        brother.  ‘Cause next weekend I’m 
                        coming to kick it.   
           INT. PARLOR ROOM/BIG HOUSE - NIGHT

           A FINGER jabs at a military photograph of an M-113 ARMORED 
           PERSONNEL CARRIER (APC).

                                 DU PONT (O.C.)
                        That’s the one!  That’s the one I 
                        need!

           We’re in a small library with a WET BAR, just off the main 
           DINING ROOM.  Du Pont stands with STEVE GRAHAM (40, chubby 
           GOP fundraiser), looking at a set of PHOTOS.  

           Mark stands alone by the bar, wearing his GOLD MEDAL.  He 
           sips a DIET COKE, looking for a chance to speak privately 
           with du Pont.

                                 STEVE
                        In that case, the Grand Old Party 
                        wants to help find you one.

           Graham calls over to the 3-star GENERAL in full dress uniform 
           who’s chewing on a cigar and drinking gin with Stan Beck.      

                                 STEVE
                        General, any of these models 
                        available? 

                                 GENERAL
                        Which?  We might have a couple of 
                        those left on the lot.
                            (to du Pont)
                        You gonna need financing? 

           Everyone laughs.  Du Pont smiles.

                                 DU PONT
                        What I need is the gun turret.  
                        Don’t send me one without that .50 
                        caliber mounted on top.

           The BUTLER enters from the dining room.

                                 GENERAL
                        I don’t know there, John. Civilians 
                        don’t usually get machine guns.

                                 STEVE
                        General - sir - John du Pont is 
                        hardly your usual civilian.
                                 BUTLER
                        Mr. du Pont, sir.  Dinner is 
                        served.

           They all start moving toward the DINING ROOM.

                                 GENERAL
                            (grumbling)
                        Well... I’ll see what I can do.

           Mark sidles up next to du Pont, speaks in a LOW VOICE -

                                 MARK
                        May I have a quick word with you, 
                        sir?

                                 DU PONT
                        Dinnertime, Mark.  Dinnertime.  

           Stan Beck swoops in, puts his arm around Mark, leading him to 
           the far side of the table.

                                 STAN BECK
                        Come sit next to me.

           INT. DINING ROOM/BIG HOUSE - LATER/NIGHT

           The waiters are clearing the dinner plates.  A lot of wine 
           has been drunk, not least of all by Du Pont. 

                                 DU PONT
                        Operation Urgent Fury sent a 
                        message loud and clear: America’s 
                        back.  Not just in Grenada, not 
                        just in Central America.  

                                 GENERAL
                        You got that right, my friend.  
                        Vietnam’s behind us.  No more 
                        slinking around with our tail 
                        between our legs, apologizing for 
                        being who we are.

                                 STEVE 
                        I’ll bet it made old Fidel sit up 
                        and take notice.

                                 GENERAL
                        You’re darn right it did.

           Mark’s hardly eaten any of his food.
                                 WAITER
                        Have you finished, sir?

                                 MARK
                        Oh, yes.  It was good.  I’m just 
                        trying to cut weight.

                                 DU PONT
                            (re. Mark)
                        He’s got to replace that worthless 
                        hunk of medal around his neck with 
                        some real gold.  
                            (beat)
                        He and his brother.

           Everyone’s a bit embarrassed by this unprovoked remark.  

                                 DU PONT
                        When the best wrestlers in the 
                        world aren’t even there to fight 
                        you for it - what’s it mean to win?

           Steve tries to change the subject -

                                 STEVE
                        How’s your mother, John?
                            (to the General)
                        Have you met Mrs. du Pont, General?  
                        A lovely woman.

                                 DU PONT
                            (to Steve)
                        Sorry to disappoint, but she’s 
                        still hanging in there.  No cash 
                        from the will to grab onto just yet-

                                 STEVE
                        -- I wasn’t --

                                 DU PONT
                        -- Speaking of cash, do you all 
                        realize I had to shell out 75,000 
                        greenbacks to get Dave Schultz to 
                        come coach this program?  But it’s 
                        worth it.  It’s worth it.  I was 
                        calling him for months before I 
                        even spoke to this one. 
                            (gestures to Mark)
                        Dave’s the one who gave me his 
                        phone number.

           ABSOLUTE SILENCE.  Finally broken by --
                                 WAITER
                        Would anyone like some coffee?

           INT. BEDROOM/THE CHALET - THAT NIGHT/LATE

           Mark awakens with a start to the sound of someone KNOCKING at 
           the front door.  He looks at the clock.  It’s 3 a.m.

           I/E. FRONT DOOR/THE CHALET - NIGHT

           Mark opens the door to find du Pont standing there, in his 
           SWEATS.  He clearly hasn’t been to bed.  And it’s clearly an 
           artificial stimulant that’s been keeping him awake.

                                 DU PONT
                        New moves.  Wrestling moves.  To 
                        try out.  Need to try them out.

                                 MARK
                        Oh, uh --

                                 DU PONT
                        In the gym.

           Beat.  Mark forces the cobwebs from his head.

                                 MARK
                        Yeah, of course.  Just... just give 
                        me a minute.

           INT. FOXCATCHER GYM - NIGHT

           Mark and du Pont are down on the wrestling mat.  Du Pont on 
           top.  He’s both weirdly aggressive with Mark - trying to get 
           him in various holds - and also, in the bizarre way he’s 
           pressing against Mark, quasi-sexual.  Mark is BLANK-FACED.  
           Just waiting for it to end.  

                                                              FADE OUT.

           EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - DAY

           WIDE SHOT of the Foxcatcher estate.  In the sky, off in the 
           distance, a HELICOPTER begins to come into view.  

           We start to HEAR the rotors, getting louder and louder.
           EXT. FOXCATCHER LAWN - DAY

           The helicopter has LANDED, the rotors still WHIRRING LOUDLY.  
           (Because of the sound of the helicopter, we won’t hear 
           dialogue in the following sequence.)

           DAVE and NANCY and the kids descend from the helicopter,  
           GREETED warmly by the wrestling team.  MARK IS ABSENT.   

           Du Pont emerges from the Big House, trailed by Brandon.  WE 
           SEE du Pont notice what a warm reception Dave gets from the 
           team.  He comes down the steps, greets Dave and the family.  

           Brandon and the team escort Nancy and the kids toward their 
           new home.  Du Pont and Dave ascend the Big House steps 
           together.  Du Pont puts his arm around Dave’s shoulder.   

           CLOSE ON: Mark, who’s at the very far end of the lawn, just 
           inside the ring of trees, WATCHING du Pont and Dave walk 
           together into the Big House.  

           MARK’S POV:  Far away, the Big House front door CLOSES.    

           I/E. FRONT DOOR/THE CHALET - EARLY EVENING

           The door OPENS.  Mark has opened it from the inside, and he’s 
           looking out at... Dave, on his porch.  Long beat.

                                 DAVE
                        Hey.

                                 MARK
                        Hey, Dave.

           Beat.

                                 DAVE
                        How you doing?

                                 MARK
                        Good.  I’m good.

                                 DAVE
                        I hadn’t seen you yet.  I just 
                        wanted to make sure everything’s 
                        okay.

                                 MARK
                        Yeah.  I’m just concentrating.  
                        Trials are in 80 days.
                                 DAVE
                            (after a moment)
                        Okay, man.  You know, Nancy and the 
                        kids are here. 

                                 MARK
                        How they doing?

                                 DAVE
                        Good.  You should stop in, say hi.

                                 MARK
                        I will.  
                            (beat)
                        I will.

           As the brothers stand in the doorway looking at each other,

           PRELAP: the sound of a GUNSHOT.

           EXT. FOXCATCHER WOODS - DAY

           A deer STAGGERS.  It’s been hit by a rifle shot.  It 
           stumbles, starts to move away.

           REVERSE onto Dave, holding his RIFLE.  He’s hunting with Bane 
           and TWO WRESTLERS we don’t recognize (recruited by him in the 
           few weeks he’s been there.)  Dave FIRES his rifle again.

           EXT. BACKYARD/DAVE AND NANCY’S HOUSE/FOXCATCHER - DAY

           The deer CARCASS hangs from a large tree.  Dave is SKINNING 
           it with a long knife.  His son, Alexander, sits on the picnic 
           table next to him, watching.  A BOOMBOX plays TOM WAITS’ “All 
           the Right Bullets”.  

           EXT. BACKYARD/DAVE AND NANCY’S HOUSE - EVENING

           Kids are running around, the (now dozen or so) wrestlers and 
           their families are gathered around the picnic table, the keg, 
           the roasting deer on the SPIT over the fire.

           Du Pont is there, at the picnic table.  Mark is there, but 
           stays very much ON THE PERIPHERY of the group.  Dave’s 
           holding court at the picnic table - in front of a huge 
           platter of venison steaks --  

                                 DAVE
                        There’s this big match between an 
                        American and a Russian.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 DAVE (cont'd)
                        The Russian is a monster, never 
                        lost, kills everybody with this 
                        hold he calls The Pretzel.  So the 
                        American coach tells his wrestler, 
                        “Listen, whatever you do don’t let 
                        this guy get you in The Pretzel or 
                        you’re dead.”  Well... sure enough, 
                        first thing, the Russian gets him 
                        in The Pretzel. 

           There are smiles and some laughs around the table.

                                 DAVE
                        The coach buries his head in his 
                        hands because he know’s it’s all 
                        over.  Suddenly, he hears a scream. 
                        The crowd roars.  When he looks up 
                        the Russian is flying through the 
                        air - he lands on his back, the 
                        American jumps on him.  Pins him.  
                        Boom.  The match is over.

           Du Pont is studying Dave intently, fascinated by the hold he 
           has on people - the attention he gets.

                                 DAVE
                        “Nobody’s ever gotten out of The 
                        Pretzel,” the coach says afterward,   
                        “How’d you do it?”  “Well, Coach, I 
                        was just about to give up when I 
                        opened my eyes and there was this 
                        big hairy pair of balls right in 
                        front of my face.  I had nothing to 
                        lose, so with my last ounce of 
                        strength I craned my neck out and 
                        bit those babies as hard as I 
                        could.”
                            (laughter)
                        The coach says, “And that did the 
                        trick?”  
                            (a whisper)
                        “Coach, you’d be surprised how 
                        motivated you get when you bite 
                        your own balls.”

           Everyone CRACKS UP.  Du Pont smiles widely.  He STANDS and 
           RAISES his beer cup.    

                                 DU PONT
                        To Dave Schultz.  Dave, you’ve 
                        expanded our team - you’re 
                        expanding our minds - but, at the 
                        same time, you’ve brought us all 
                        together.
           Everyone raises their cups: “To Dave” “Cheers, Dave”, etc.  
           Dave looks at du Pont.

                                 DAVE
                        Well, thank you Coach.  I believe 
                        in what you’re doing here.  

           And du Pont does love it when you call him coach.

           INT. FOXCATCHER GYM - DAY

           The dozen wrestlers are spread out on the mats in pairs, 
           wrestling.  Dave walks among them, calling out instruction. 

           Mark’s off against the wall, putting on weightlifting gloves.

           Du Pont, in sweats and a whistle, shadows Dave.

                                 DAVE
                        Drive with your legs.  Drive!

           Du Pont calls out --

                                 DU PONT
                        No mercy!

           Dave looks at him and laughs, puts his arm around him.

                                 DAVE
                            (to the wrestlers)
                        You heard the Coach.  No mercy!  
                        Give it to him, Gecko!

           Du Pont is thrilled to be validated.  Mark walks off into the 
           weight room.

           INT. WEIGHT ROOM/FOXCATCHER GYM - CONTINUOUS

           Mark sits on the LEG-PRESS, proceeds to press an enormous 
           amount of weight, repeatedly -- straining, pushing himself. 

           Du Pont wanders into the weight room.  Mark tries to ignore 
           him, continues to press the huge stack of weights.  Du Pont 
           stands watching, until Mark’s finished his set.  Mark stares 
           straight ahead, catching his breath.

                                 DU PONT
                        You’ve got more in you than that.
           Mark turns his gaze to du Pont.  Stares.  Unmoving.  SILENCE.  
           Du Pont walks over to him, leans in close, puts his hand on 
           his shoulder.  

                                 DU PONT
                        I may need another haircut pretty 
                        soon there, Mark.  

           He PATS Mark’s shoulder, straightens up.

                                 DU PONT
                        You’re doing great there, Mark.  
                        Doing great.  Conquer your demons --

           Du Pont walks out, back into the wrestling room, where we can 
           HEAR him clapping, calling out encouragement.  

           On Mark, barely breathing, staring straight ahead.

                                 FRED COLE(V.O.)
                        We’d been trying for some time to 
                        get Dave Schultz to come out to 
                        Colorado Springs, coach for USA 
                        Wrestling...

           INT. DU PONT’S OFFICE/BIG HOUSE - DAY

           FRED COLE, USA Wrestling’s President, accompanied by TWO 
           OTHER OFFICIALS (FRANK MORSE and BILL DUVA - Co-Executive 
           Directors) are in the sitting area of du Pont’s office, on 
           wing-backed chairs, facing the couch.  They wear business 
           suits.  A PHOTOGRAPHER stands off to the side, waiting.

                                 FRED COLE
                        ...Instead, he ended up here.

           WE NOW SEE du Pont: he SITS, slumped in one corner of the 
           couch, wearing sweats.  A PISTOL is in the crook of one arm, 
           a DRINK is on the side table.  Stan Beck stands nearby.

                                 FRED COLE
                        Having now seen your facility, your 
                        beautiful estate.... I’m thinking 
                        of moving here too.

           Laughs all around.  Du Pont smiles.

                                 FRED COLE
                        Mr. du Pont, we’re so thankful for 
                        the financial support you’re giving 
                        us.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 FRED COLE (cont'd)
                        But I’m also here to ask if we 
                        could find some way to work out an 
                        arrangement where we could borrow 
                        Dave from time to time as the 
                        Olympics approach.  To come to 
                        Colorado, run some practices with 
                        the rest of our team.

           Du Pont sips his scotch.

                                 DU PONT
                        We represent two fronts in the war 
                        against Soviet aggression.  You in 
                        the west, and us here in the east.  
                        But we need to commit to being one 
                        army.  One leadership.  Then, 
                        sharing one of my top generals may 
                        helps us win that war.

           The USA officials are a bit baffled by this speech.

                                 STAN BECK
                        If I may - I think Mr. Du Pont is 
                        expressing an important point.  
                        He’s willing to commit significant 
                        financial resources to USA 
                        Wrestling - in addition to the 
                        services of his top coach.  
                            (then)
                        I’d like to suggest that Mr. du 
                        Pont has earned the right to be 
                        named to the official roster of 
                        Olympic wrestling coaches at Seoul.

           The USA officials glance at each other.

                                 STAN BECK
                        I’d also like to make a personal 
                        suggestion?

                                 FRED COLE
                        Please.

                                 STAN BECK
                        That you seriously consider Mr. du 
                        Pont for your “Man of the Year” 
                        awards banquet this summer.    

           Silence.  Before the officials can respond.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. DU PONT’S OFFICE/BIG HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

           Du Pont, Cole, Morse and Duva are all posed holding a LARGE 
           CARDBOARD CHECK in the amount of $400,000 made out to USA 
           WRESTLING and signed by du Pont.  

           The Photographer snaps photos.  FLASH.  FLASH.

           In the moments after, they’re all standing around a bit 
           uncomfortably.  Stan Beck comes forward and to hand over the 
           ACTUAL CHECK

                                 FRED COLE, MORSE AND DUVA
                        Thank you so much.... This is 
                        wonderful... Incredibly generous.

           EXT. FOXCATCHER WOODS - DAY

           Mark RUNS - alone, pushing himself, sprinting - through the 
           woods, jumping rocks and fallen tree trunks.

           INT. FOXCATCHER GYM - SAME TIME

           The wrestlers train on the mats.  Du Pont patrols the 
           perimeter, REPEATEDLY LOOKING TOWARD the doorway. 

           Du Pont SEES someone entering and immediately begins acting 
           coach-like, SHOUTING instruction, CLAPPING encouragement.

           WE NOW SEE who has entered: Mrs. Jean du Pont.  She’s WHEELED 
           in by an attendant; another wheels the oxygen tank to which 
           she’s attached.  They park themselves by the wall. 

           INTERCUT: Mark SPRINTS through the woods, breathing hard.

           BACK IN THE GYM: The wrestlers start to notice Jean, begin to 
           stop their activity.  Du Pont BLOWS HIS WHISTLE too loudly -     

                                 DU PONT
                        And.... break!  Gentlemen, well 
                        done!  Listen up, team.  Listen up.

           Several wrestlers GLANCE toward Dave to check his reaction to 
           this coaching moment by du Pont.  Dave NODS his head in du 
           Pont’s direction.  They give him their attention.

                                 DU PONT
                        A number of you will be travelling - 
                        with me - to the Olympic Trials in 
                        Pensacola next week.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 DU PONT (cont'd)
                        From the moment you leave these 
                        hallowed training grounds, you will 
                        be in competition.  There's no 
                        lying in a fight.  Who you think 
                        you are in the moments leading up 
                        to a fight, and who you are when 
                        the fight begins - the truth will 
                        become abundantly clear. 

           Jean du Pont watches her son, the truth of this situation 
           abundantly clear to her.

                                 DU PONT
                        Raul Garcia, come up here for a 
                        moment.

           No one moves.  He gestures at Garcia.

                                 DU PONT
                        Raul.  Gecko.  Come.  

           As Garcia gets to his feet, he mumbles to  Springer -- 

                                 GARCIA
                        My fucking name is Roberto.

           Springer smiles.  Garcia stands.  He’s clearly the SMALLEST 
           WRESTLER in the room.  He approaches du Pont.

           INTERCUT:  Mark sprinting through the woods.

           BACK IN THE GYM:

                                 DU PONT
                        Muchas gracias, compadre.
                            (gestures to the mat)
                        Por favor.

           Garcia gets in the down position.  Du Pont kneels next to 
           him, his arms hovering over him, not yet grabbing on.

                                 DU PONT
                        The period begins before the 
                        whistle blows, when the other 
                        wrestler feels you above him, feels 
                        your purpose.

           Jean watches her son, not betraying any emotion.

                                 DU PONT
                        Then... the whistle blows!

           Du Pont grabs onto Garcia.  
           Immediately, Garcia FLIPS du Pont over, SLAMS him onto the 
           mat, and PINS him.

           Garcia lets go.  TOTAL SILENCE.  Most of the wrestlers are 
           too STUNNED to know what to do.  Du Pont slowly rises to his 
           feet, clearly hurt, but not wanting to show it.

                                 DU PONT
                        Excellent work, young man.  
                        Excellent.

           He hobbles slowly out the door.

           ON: his mother, stoic -- sadly watching her son go,

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. WRESTLING ARENA/PENSACOLA - DAY

           Dave wrestles.  He’s having trouble with a younger wrestler.

           Mark paces on the perimeter of the EIGHT MATS, trying to 
           concentrate on his upcoming match.  He keeps glancing over at 
           his struggling brother.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Du Pont clumsily FANS Dave with a towel in between periods, 
           “coaching him”, giving him “advice”.  Mark notices that du 
           Pont IS BEING FILMED BY A CAMERA CREW.

                                                                CUT TO:

           End of Dave’s match.  Mark watches the ref raise the other 
           wrestlers hand.  Mark’s stunned, devastated.  

                                 ANNOUNCER (OVER P.A.)
                        That’s the second - and final - 
                        loss for David Schultz.   

           Dave graciously HUGS the other wrestler.  ON MARK, watching,

           INT. WRESTLING ARENA/PENSACOLA - LATER/DAY

           Mark’s on the mat, battling a college wrestler, Rico 
           Chipparelli.  Mark’s struggling.  We see a vulnerability we 
           haven't seen before - something lost or disoriented.  Dave 
           shouts from the corner.

                                 DAVE
                        Get after him, Mark!  Shoot low!...
           It’s not working.

           Du Pont, BEING FILMED, claps, calls out instruction -

                                 DU PONT
                        Need to get after him, there, Mark.

                                                                CUT TO:

           In between periods, Mark sits in the chair in his corner 
           while Dave gets in his face, coaching.  But all Mark can pay 
           attention to is du Pont clumsily FANNING him with a towel.

                                 DAVE
                        He’s vulnerable to the left.  He 
                        leaves his entire left side open.  
                        You gotta get after that fucker!  
                        Now or never...

                                                                CUT TO:

           Mark’s back out on the mat.  It’s not working.  Mark gets 
           PINNED.  The wrestlers stand.  The ref holds both of their 
           hands, RAISES Chipparelli’s arm.  He turns them around, 
           raises Chipparelli’s arm again.

           Mark walks off the mat.  Dave tries to console him.  

                                 DAVE
                        Double elimination, buddy.  You’ll 
                        get it back.

           Du Pont calls out, conscious of his camera crew -

                                 DU PONT
                        Next time, Mark.  A good effort.

           Mark walks right past them, right off the mats.  We TRAIL 
           him, staying with him as he walks right out the arena door.

           EXT. PARKING LOT/WRESTLING ARENA - CONTINUOUS

           Mark walks out the door and along the side of the building.  
           He turns down a side entrance ramp for delivery trucks 
           leading down to an underground garage.  

           I/E. DELIVERY TUNNEL/WRESTLING ARENA - CONTINUOUS

           Mark’s alone here.  He starts to CRY.  He BANGS his head 
           against the cement wall, smashing it repeatedly, crying, 
           screaming.  He punches himself.  Punishment for losing.    
           INT. MARK’S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

           Mark, still in his wrestling clothes, sits on the edge of his 
           bed in front of a ROOM SERVICE CART loaded with food.  He 
           gorges himself on fried chicken, sandwiches, french fries.

           INT. MARK’S HOTEL ROOM - LATER

           Mark’s on his knees in front of the room MINI-BAR, having 
           discovered the chocolates - Kit-Kat’s, M&Ms.  TV’s on, the 
           place is a wreck.  A KNOCK at the door.  LOUDER KNOCKING.  
           Mark goes to the door, looks through the peephole.  His POV:

                                 DAVE
                        Mark.  Open up - I know you’re in 
                        there.

           Mark walks away from the door.

                                 DAVE
                        Mark!

           Dave POUNDS - hard - seriously rattling the doorframe.

                                 DAVE
                        I’m gonna kick it in if you don’t 
                        open it.  Mark!

           Mark doesn’t move.  Dave starts to KICK IN the door - once, 
           twice - it might break.  Mark goes to the door and opens it.  
           SILENCE as the brothers stand there looking at each other.

                                 DAVE
                        What’s going on with you?  You’ve 
                        got a match in a few hours.
                            (beat)
                        What happened to your face?

           Mark walks away, sits on the bed.  Dave comes in, surveys the 
           room - dishes on the room-service cart, open mini-bar.

                                 DAVE
                        Jesus, Mark, tell me you didn’t eat 
                        all this.  
                            (no answer)
                        What’re you doing?  You got to 
                        weigh in before every match.

           Mark shrugs.
                                 MARK
                        I’m done.

                                 DAVE
                        What are you talking about?

                                 MARK
                        It’s over.  I’m done.  You lost.  I 
                        lost.  It’s over.

           Dave walks over to Mark, and CUFFS him, hard, on the side of 
           the head. 

                                 DAVE
                        Look at me.  Look at me!  You have 
                        a chance to do what no wrestler’s 
                        done since 1904.  Not one.  If you 
                        think I’m gonna let you throw away 
                        a chance to win back-to-back 
                        Olympic golds you’re fucking crazy. 

           Dave CUFFS him again, harder.

                                 DAVE
                        Do you know what I’d give to have 
                        the extra years you’ve got?  Do 
                        you?!  To not have to move toward 
                        coaching full time?  To have one 
                        more shot?

           He CUFFS him again.

                                 DAVE
                        I’m done, Mark.  I’ve lost a step.  
                        You haven’t.  I will kick the shit 
                        out of you, and I will personally 
                        throw you out on that mat to make 
                        sure you take what’s yours -- what 
                        we’ve been training for since high 
                        school.  And I will be on your ass 
                        every day from here to South Korea.      

           Mark is silent, his face reddening.  Staring straight ahead.

                                 DAVE
                            (quiet now)
                        I’m with you, Mark.  You’re not in 
                        this alone. 

           Silence.  Then, Mark stands and the CAMERA follows him into 
           the bathroom.  As he sticks his fingers down his throat and 
           leans over the toilet bowl to throw up,
           INT. WEIGH-IN ROOM - DAY

           Mark steps on the scale.  Dave watches.  The balance shoots 
           up, making a metallic clank.  

                                 DAVE
                            (under his breath)
                        Shit.

           The official MOVES the slide weight up from 82 KILOS to... 

                                 OFFICAL
                        87 kilos.

                                 DAVE
                        How long does he have to make 
                        weight?

           The offical looks up at a clock on the wall.

                                 OFFICAL
                        Weigh-in period ends at 3:30.

           Dave nods.  Grabs Mark.

                                 DAVE
                        C’mon, fat boy, you got 90 minutes 
                        to cut 12 pounds.

           INT. WORK-OUT ROOM - DAY

           Mark PEDALS furiously on a STATIONARY BIKE, wearing five 
           layers of sweats and fleeces with PLASTICS on top.  We can 
           see how much Mark is perspiring by the POOLS OF SWEAT which 
           are collecting up his arms.  

           Dave eggs him on as he shoves TINY PIECES of ICE up Mark’s 
           nose to keep him from overheating.

           Du Pont walks in the far side, clapping, calling out -

                                 DU PONT
                        Here you are.  I’ve been looking 
                        all over for you --

           Dave immediately trots over to du Pont, heading him off.  

           We SEE their conversation from Mark’s POV (we won’t hear it): 
           Dave explaining something to him.  
           Du Pont resists at first, but Dave is very gentle with him, 
           clearly laying the burden of this on fragile Mark and making 
           du Pont feel like a hero if he agrees.  Finally, du Pont NODS 
           and WALKS OUT. 

           Dave turns back toward Mark and Mark puts his head down and 
           PEDALS even harder. 

           INT. WEIGH IN ROOM - DAY

           C/U on the CLOCK: 3:29PM.

           The weigh-in official CLOSES his log book.  Dave and Mark 
           BURST into the room.

                                 DAVE
                        Wait!  Wait!  We’re here...
                            (to Mark)
                        Get ’em off.

           The official looks at them, OPENS his log book.  Dave helps 
           Mark peel off his sweats.  Soaked, they hit the floor with a 
           smack.  Mark, in his singlet, gets on the scale.  

           He’s 30 GRAMS OVERWEIGHT (5 ounces).  He steps off, and Dave 
           helps PEEL his singlet off.  He gets back on the scale naked.  
           The official slides the weight bar...

           3 GRAMS OVER.  Dave grabs Mark.  

                                 DAVE
                        Come here.

           He grabs his wallet from his sweats pocket and pulls out a 
           CREDIT CARD, dropping the wallet on the floor.  Dave 
           SQUEEGEES the sweat off Mark’s naked body with the card.  
           Scraping him down.  

           He helps Mark back on the scale.  The pointer bobs, finally 
           reaches equilibrium.  

                                 OFFICIAL
                        82 kilos.

                                 DAVE
                        Thank god.

           Dave breaths huge sigh of relief.  Mark looks practically 
           COMATOSE.  Dave helps him off the scale, walks him over to a 
           bench, sits him down.  He grabs a GATORADE from nearby table 
           and hold it out to Mark, who looks like he might pass out.
                                 DAVE
                        Mark.  Drink.  

           Mark just sits there.  Not taking the drink immediately.

                                 DAVE
                        Mark...

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. WRESTLING ARENA/PENSACOLA - DAY

           Mark SLAMS his opponent, Mike Sheets, to the mat.  He’s like 
           an animal, dominating, aggressive.  

           Dave coaches from Mark’s corner.

           Du Pont watches FROM THE STANDS, being filmed by his crew.

           INT. WRESTLING ARENA/PENSACOLA - DAY

           A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS OF MARK’S MATCHES: Mark dominating, 
           turning his opponents, taking them down... 

           THEN: The END WHISTLE of Mark’s final match.  The wrestlers 
           stand and the referee RAISES MARK’S ARM...

                                 DAVE
                        YAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!

           Dave’s EXULTANT - leaping and screaming onto the mat - he 
           grabs his brother in a BEAR HUG and LIFTS him off the mat.  
           Pure joy.

           Du Pont watches from the stands, raises his fist in victory, 
           putting on a good show for the camera crew.  But he’s clearly 
           SHUT OUT from the vision of Dave joyfully carrying his 
           exhausted, victorious brother around the mat.

           EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE/THE CHALET - AFTERNOON

           Dismal, grey, drizzling.  Dave’s Subaru station wagon pulls 
           up outside Mark’s house.  Nancy’s driving, with Dave next to 
           her.  Mark gets out of the back seat with his duffel bag.

                                 MARK
                        Thanks, guys.

           Dave rolls down his window.
                                 DAVE
                        Dinner’s around 6:30, but come over 
                        anytime before then.

                                 MARK
                        I will.

           They drive off, and Mark walks into the house.

           INT. THE CHALET - CONTINUOUS

           Mark enters.  There are THREE MEMBERS of the wrestling team 
           (Springer and two new guys) lounging around the living room, 
           watching TV, very much at home.  They look over and see Mark -

                                 SPRINGER
                        Hey, Mark.  Congrats, buddy...

           Mark’s a little baffled as to why they’re in his house.

                                 MARK
                        Hey.  What’s... what’s going on?

           Springer’s immediately sheepish.

                                 SPRINGER
                        They didn’t tell you?

                                 MARK
                        Tell me what?

                                 SPRINGER
                        They’ve been switching some of us 
                        around.  Sam and Paul here are new - 
                        we got moved in here, and they put 
                        you in... uh, what’s it called...?

                                 OTHER WRESTLER
                        ... Dairy House.

                                 SPRINGER
                        ... Right... The Dairy House.

                                 MARK
                        Where’s the hell is that?

           Springer and the other guys all shrug.  They have no idea.

                                 MARK
                        Where’s my stuff?
                                 SPRINGER
                        They moved it.  I think probably to 
                        the Dairy House.

           INT. BIG HOUSE/FOXCATCHER - AFTERNOON

           Mark walks in the back entrance.

                                 SECRETARY
                        Hello, Mark Schultz.  Congrat --

           He walks right by her and up the stairs.

                                 SECRETARY
                        Mark.  Mark.  Stan!

           INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE STAN’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Stan Beck comes out of his office and greets Mark at the top 
           of the stairs.

                                 STAN BECK
                        Mark.  Welcome home.

                                 MARK
                        He just kicked me out of my house.

                                 STAN BECK
                        Calm down --

                                 MARK
                        Where is he?

                                 STAN BECK
                        -- You’ve been given a nice quiet 
                        place to live.  We’re expanding the 
                        team and we needed the space --

                                 MARK
                        Where is he?

                                 STAN BECK
                        And you can use the peace and quiet 
                        to decide how serious you are about 
                        being here - how comfortable you 
                        are being coached by Mr. du Pont.

           Brandon comes out of his office to stand behind Stan.

                                 MARK
                        Who’s this coming from?
                                 STAN BECK
                        This is the decision.  It’s done.

                                 MARK
                        I want to talk to John.

                                 STAN BECK
                        John’s mother died this morning.
                            (beat)
                        Now’s not a good time.

           Silence.  Then -

                                 STAN BECK
                        Brandon can take you out to your 
                        new place.

           I/E. BRANDON’S CAR - LATE AFTERNOON

           C/U on Mark being driven in Brandon’s car to the new house.

           EXT. DAIRY HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

           Brandon is unlocking the front door.  Mark asks quietly:

                                 MARK
                        How did she die?

                                 BRANDON
                        They said her heart just stopped 
                        working.

           INT. DAIRY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS/LATE AFTERNOON

           They enter.  It’s modest, small, gloomy.  Mark’s belongings 
           are piled up in the living room.  He stands there in silence.

                                 BRANDON
                        It’s just a couple months till 
                        Seoul.

           Bob Dylan’s “All the Tired Horses” STARTS TO PLAY. 

           EXT. FOXCATCHER STABLES - LATE AFTERNOON

           The doors to the stables are wide open.
           INT. STABLES - LATE AFTERNOON

           “All the Tired Horses” PLAYS.  There is no other sound.  With 
           the exception of the song the scene is MOS.

           Du Pont goes from stall to stall, throwing open the gates.  
           The horses peer out, spooked, confused, wild-eyed.  He waves 
           them out, slapping them as they go.  John follows, waving his 
           arms, shouting, forcing the horses outside.

           EXT. STABLES - LATE AFTERNOON

           “All the Tired Horses” PLAYS.  The horses CHARGE OUT of the 
           stables and onto the estate.  John follows them out, waving 
           at them drunkenly, falling, getting up, falling again.

                                                              FADE OUT.

           INT. FOXCATCHER GYM - MORNING

           It’s several days later.  A dozen wrestlers work out in PAIRS 
           on the mats.  Dave and Mark work out together, intensely - 
           doing TAKE-DOWN DRILLS.  Mark executes, they stand, Dave 
           murmurs instruction to him, he does the drill again.  

           Stan Beck walks in the door, accompanied by THREE SECURITY 
           AGENTS (former Secret Service men who now work for a private 
           security firm.)  They stand near the entrance talking 
           quietly, Stan Beck pointing out individual wrestlers.  One of 
           the AGENTS takes notes.

           Mark is DISTRACTED.  He can’t help but look over at them.

                                 DAVE
                        Mark.  Focus.  Look at me.
                            (Mark looks at him)
                        Focus on me.

           Mark nods.

                                 STAN BECK
                        Dave.  Would you come here for a 
                        minute?  

           Dave walks over to them.  We WATCH the ensuing conversation 
           from MARK’S POV (we can’t hear what they’re saying):  Stan 
           asks Dave several questions to which Dave seems to be 
           answering “Yes.”
           EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - SEVERAL DAYS LATER/MORNING

           An ARMED SECURITY DETAIL patrols the roof of the Big House, 
           as if it’s a foreign consulate.

           Several HORSES roam the grounds freely, feeding on shrubs, 
           the flower garden, walking into the woods.

           EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE/WOODS - MORNING

           Dave and Mark RUN hard along a path through the woods, racing 
           each other, neck and neck.  All of a sudden, they’re brought 
           up short as a plainclothes SECURITY GUARD comes toward them 
           out of the woods, his hands up -- 

                                 PLAINCLOTHES SECURITY GUARD
                        Gentlemen!  Gentlemen.  Please turn 
                        around and go back the way you 
                        came.  

                                 MARK
                        What’s going on?

                                 PLAINCLOTHES SECURITY GUARD
                        Please turn around and go back the 
                        way you came.

           Behind the guard, they can see a SECURITY DETAIL fanned out 
           in the woods, combing the ground with metal detectors. 

                                 PLAINCLOTHES SECURITY GUARD
                        We’ll let you know when this area 
                        is open.  Please turn around and go 
                        back the way you came.

                                 DAVE
                        Mark, come.

           Dave and Mark turn around and walk back up the path. 

                                 MARK
                        What the hell was that?

                                 DAVE
                        What difference does it make?

                                 MARK
                        Are you kidding me?  What do they 
                        expect to find?  Who’s gonna go 
                        after this guy?
                                 DAVE
                        Mark.  He’s an insecure man.  He 
                        feels a need for security.

                                 MARK
                        Who’s he afraid of?

                                 DAVE
                        Why does he bother you so much?  
                        What happened between you two?

                                 MARK
                        What are you talking about?  
                        Nothing happened.  What are you 
                        talking about?  I’m trying to train 
                        here, trying to concentrate, 
                        there’s all these distractions, 
                        you’re going away for week --

                                 DAVE
                        -- Five days --

                                 MARK
                        -- I’m trying to train here.

           They come out of the woods just outside Dave’s house.  

                                 DAVE
                        I give the speech, I coach a couple 
                        wrestlers at the training center, 
                        two or three days, then I’m back.

           Through the windows we can SEE the kids running around.

                                 DAVE
                        You’re gonna be fine.  Just keep 
                        you’re head down, do your work.

                                 MARK
                            (re the family)
                        They going with you?

           The kids spill out onto the porch, shouting for their Dad. 

                                 DAVE
                        Yup.

           They jump all over Dave.  Nancy comes out onto the porch.

                                 NANCY
                        Hey, Mark, how’s it going?
                                 MARK
                            (barely acknowledging her)
                        Nance.

           Alex and Danielle drag Dave toward the house --

                                 ALEX AND DANIELLE
                        Come, Daddy... Come!...

                                 DAVE
                            (as he goes)
                        Head down, little brother.  Focus.  
                        Seoul is the goal.

           As Mark watches him go inside.  We HEAR:

                                 DAVE (V.O.)
                        ... this man has single-handedly 
                        saved amateur wrestling in America.

           INT. CROWNE PLAZA HOTEL BALLROOM/COLORADO SPRINGS - NIGHT

           USA Wrestling’s “Man of the Year” award banquet.  Dave is at 
           the podium, introducing du Pont, speaking without notes, and 
           doing a good job of it.  Dave is loved by this crowd.  

           The CAMERA stays mostly with du Pont, who watches from the 
           wings, flanked by the THREE SECURITY AGENTS.  Du Pont seems 
           ill-at-ease, as if something in him has shifted.

           Dave’s speech is being FILMED by du Pont’s documentary crew.

                                 DAVE
                        He’s had an enormous impact on the 
                        band of wrestlers he brought to his 
                        farm in Pennsylvania...
                            (smiles slyly)
                        He’s had somewhat less of an 
                        enormous impact on those he’s 
                        actually wrestled...

           LAUGHS from the audience.  Du Pont takes his cue from the 
           audience reaction and chuckles as well.  Dave looks over at 
           him and smiles from the stage.

                                 DAVE
                        But that’s not his job.  His job is 
                        leader of this band of brothers.  
                        Head Coach of Team Foxcatcher.

                        My brother Mark has been known to 
                        say that you have to orphan 
                        yourself to accomplish greatness.  
                        I think what he means is that you 
                        have to determine for yourself what 
                        your goals are, what your beliefs 
                        are, and go after them.  What I’m 
                        certain of is that we’re hugely 
                        lucky John du Pont’s personal 
                        belief system includes the value of 
                        amateur athletics.  This orphan 
                        sport of wrestling has found a home 
                        at Foxcatcher Farms.  Ladies and 
                        gentlemen, USA Wrestling’s Man of 
                        the Year, John “The Golden Eagle of 
                        America” du Pont. 

           Du Pont walks out on stage to big applause from the assembled 
           guests and a BEAR HUG from Dave Schultz.  Du Pont speaks into 
           the microphone:

                                 DU PONT
                        Thank you USA Wrestling.  Thank you 
                        Dave Schultz.  It’s an honor to 
                        coach Team Foxcatcher.  We’re on 
                        the road to victory at Seoul and 
                        for years to come...

           FOXCATCHER ESTATE - DAY/ESTABLISHING

           VARIOUS SHOTS:  Security teams patrol the grounds; patrol the 
           Big House roof; workers construct a GUARD BOOTH at the 
           driveway entrance; a CHAIN LINK FENCE is being erected around 
           the entire perimeter of the estate.

                                 DOCUMENTARY DIRECTOR (V.O.)
                        We’re rolling...

           FOXCATCHER GYM - DAY

           The camera crew is shooting du Pont giving “instruction” to 
           wrestlers in the gym.  Du Pont, in Foxcatcher sweats, stands 
           with Mark on one of the mats, looking at the DOCUMENTARY 
           DIRECTOR for his cue.

                                 DU PONT
                        Good...?

                                 DOCUMENTARY DIRECTOR
                        Yes, we’re good.  We’re rolling.

           Du Pont turns to face Mark, who’s barely keeping calm.
                                 DU PONT
                        We need to work on the lateral drop 
                        - the side throw.  Mark, if your 
                        opponent allows you enough space 
                        for an under hook, this creates a 
                        big opportunity for you to exploit.

           He starts to clumsily demonstrate on Mark, who grits his 
           teeth, just wanting to get this over as soon as possible.

                                 DU PONT
                        From the under hook, pivot sideways 
                        while pulling down on his arm.  
                        Kneel between his legs and take him 
                        to the mat.

           Mark lets him take him down.  As they stand up -

                                 DU PONT
                        If you’re going to wrestle like 
                        that then you better hope your 
                        plane crashes on the way to Seoul!

           He LAUGHS.  No one else gets it.  Mark just stares at him. 

                                 DOCUMENTARY DIRECTOR
                        Sir, uh... we’re going to need to 
                        take that again.  Um --

                                 DU PONT
                        -- When I demonstrate a new move 
                        you damn well better be ready to 
                        record it!  What in hell am I 
                        paying you for?   

                                 DOCUMENTARY DIRECTOR
                        Yes, no... you’re absolutely right, 
                        sir... it’s just...

           He point toward du Pont’s stomach, where a PISTOL protrudes 
           rather obviously from his WAISTBAND. 

                                 DU PONT
                        Ah.  Hold this, please.

           He hands the pistol to the ASSISTANT CAMERAMAN, then turns to 
           Mark, beginning the instruction again --

                                 DU PONT
                        We need to work on the lateral 
                        drop.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 DU PONT (cont'd)
                        Mark, if your opponent allows you 
                        enough space for an under hook, 
                        this creates a big opportunity for 
                        you to exploit.

           INT. DU PONT’S OFFICE/BIG HOUSE - DAY

           Du Pont is speaking directly into the CAMERA.  He wears his 
           Foxcatcher sweat jacket with HEAD COACH and JOHN ‘Eagle’ du 
           PONT” stitched onto it. 

                                 DU PONT
                        Our challenge... as coaches... and 
                        leaders... of athletes everywhere --

           From a WIDER ANGLE, we see that he’s being FILMED for the 
           documentary.  He speaks haltingly, with effort, trying to 
           seem authoritative.

                                 DU PONT
                        ... indeed our obligation.  And 
                        responsibility.  Is first - and 
                        foremost, to build winners in life.  
                        To build men who will - be prepared 
                        for life... Who will understand -  
                        and exemplify the character traits -  
                        of good citizenship on - and off - 
                        the field of competition.

           He’s finished.  Silence.

           EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - DAY

           A DELIVERY CORPORAL directs the off-loading of an M-113 APC, 
           an armored personnel carrier, from the back of a wide-load 
           army trailer.  Du Pont watches.

                                 CORPORAL
                        There you go, sir.  Five tons of 
                        fun.

           The CORPORAL stands beside him, then watches du Pont climb 
           atop the APC. 

                                 DU PONT 
                        Where’s the machine gun?

                                 CORPORAL
                        I’m sorry?  
                                 DU PONT
                        The .50 caliber machine gun that’s 
                        supposed to be mounted up here.

           The Corporal pages through the sheets of his delivery order.

                                 CORPORAL
                        I don’t know, Mr. Du Pont.  Uh...

                                 DU PONT
                        It goes right here.  Right here.

                                 CORPORAL
                        Let me make a note, and I’ll look 
                        into it.  I’ll see what I can do.

           INT. HALLWAY/BIG HOUSE - NIGHT

           C/U on Mark.  He stands alone in a hallway of the Big House.  
           CAMERA stays on him for several seconds. Then --

           Brandon emerges from du Pont’s office.

                                 BRANDON
                        You can come in, Mark.

           Mark walks into the office.  Brandon remains in the hallway.

           INT. DU PONT’S OFFICE/BIG HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Mark enters.  A plainclothes SECURITY GUARD shuts the door 
           behind him, then stands like a sentry by the doorway.  

           Across the long office, at his desk, is John du Pont, writing 
           something in a large book, signing his name.  A half-drunk 
           tumbler of SCOTCH sits on the desk next to him. 

                                 MARK
                        It’s a wonder they didn’t frisk me 
                        on the way in.

           Du Pont raises his eyes to look at Mark.  He TEARS the CHECK 
           he was writing from the book, slides it across the desk.  
           Mark take the long walk over to the other side of the desk, 
           REACHES for the check.  It’s for TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS.  He 
           picks it up.

                                 DU PONT
                        You and I are more similar than you 
                        think.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 DU PONT (cont'd)
                        Your brother wrestles because he 
                        loves it, and he wrestles to win.  
                        You wrestle to be seen as a winner. 

           He takes a sip of his drink.

                                 DU PONT
                        So we’ll go to Korea and you’ll 
                        make us both winners.  

           Mark turns and walks out. 

           EXT. BACKYARD/DAVE’S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

           Mark sits with Dave at the backyard picnic table.  Throughout 
           the scene, Dave PACKS GUNPOWDER into bullets for his hunting 
           rifle.  (No comment is made about this, it’s just something 
           he’s doing.)  On Dave’s forehead, in MAGIC MARKER, is written 
           the word “KIDS”.

                                 MARK
                        Let’s just leave.  With me on the 
                        Olympic team we could get a 
                        coaching gig together in a second.

                                 DAVE
                        Mark --

                                 MARK
                        -- He corrupts everything.  He 
                        attaches himself to other people’s 
                        glory, he doesn’t do anything 
                        himself, doesn’t believe anything --
                            (then)
                        He’s weakening me.

                                 DAVE
                        You let him weaken you.

                                 MARK
                        Really.  You get fingerprinted 
                        today?

           Dave shrugs.

                                 DAVE
                        He doesn’t bother me the way he 
                        bothers you.  It’s your choice to 
                        make him powerful.

           Mark looks away, incredibly disappointed by Dave’s reaction.
                                 DAVE
                        Just stick it out through Seoul.  
                        I’ll make sure you’re taken care of 
                        after that.  I’ll talk to him.  
                        I’ll talk to Stan.  Whether you 
                        decide to stay or go, you’ll be 
                        taken care of.

           Beat.

                                 MARK
                        You’re not actually thinking of 
                        staying after this summer?

                                 DAVE
                        The schools are great, the kids 
                        have eight hundred acres to run 
                        around in... he’s paying me a ton 
                        of money.  It’s not so bad.  

           Mark’s at a loss for words.  Just when he’d reconnected with 
           his brother, it seems they’re destined to be separated again.

                                 DAVE
                        Focus on what’s important...

                                 MARK
                        Don’t say it.

           Silence.  Dave packs his bullets.

                                 MARK
                        What’s on your forehead?

                                 DAVE
                        What?

                                 MARK
                        It says kids.

                                 DAVE
                        It’s to remind me to pick up the 
                        kids from school.

                                 MARK
                        What does that mean?  When will you 
                        see your own forehead? 

                                 DAVE
                        I don’t have to.  You just told me.

           Drizzling.  Du Pont sits in the M-113 APC, his torso sticks 
           out the top.  He TURNS IT ON, the engine roaring to life. 

           INT. FOXCATCHER GYM - SAME TIME

           Dave is being interviewed for the documentary.  He stands in 
           the gym, in his workout clothes, in front of the camera crew.  
           Some of the wrestlers work out behind him.

                                 DAVE
                        My name's Dave Schultz.  I've been 
                        named Main Coach and head of 
                        recruiting here at Foxcatcher under 
                        Head Coach John Dupont.  Coach 
                        Dupont wants excellence, he expects 
                        excellence, and we intend to give 
                        it to him...

           EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - SAME TIME

           Du Pont drives the APC over a little ridge and starts down a 
           long slope toward the POND.

           INT. FOXCATCHER GYM - SAME TIME

                                 DAVE
                        John’s commitment to this sport is 
                        complete.  His work ethic...

           And now, Dave, who’s been so good at playing along, takes it 
           too far even for himself.  As he says the next bit, he 
           stumbles over his words, looks down, obviously uncomfortable -

                                 DAVE
                        - We... we consider John one of us.  
                        One of - uh - the athletes. 

           EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - SAME TIME

           Du Pont drives the APC down the slope, into the POND.  He 
           continues driving as the tank goes lower and lower in the 
           water -- the water covers the entire vehicle, then his torso, 
           his neck, his head.  And he’s gone.  Completely submerged.  

           Beat.  Beat.  The surface of the water is still.  Beat.
           Du Pont BREAKS the surface, taking a breath.  He looks 
           around, then swims slowly to shore.  The tank remains on the 
           bottom of the pond.  

           INT. STAN BECK’S OFFICE/BIG HOUSE - DAY

           Dave and Mark sit across a conference table from Stan and du 
           Pont.  Dave is firm and clear, but entirely diplomatic.  Du 
           Pont looks dishevelled, he won’t meet anyone’s gaze.  

                                 DAVE
                        I will commit to remaining at 
                        Foxcatcher so long as John wants me 
                        here, but only if my brother is 
                        taken care of.

                                 STAN BECK
                        What does that mean?

                                 DAVE
                        So long as I’m here, Mark will 
                        continue to be paid.

                                 STAN BECK
                        Paid what?

                                 DAVE
                        His full salary.

                                 STAN BECK
                        You want him paid even if he leaves 
                        the farm?  What if he quits?  

                                 DAVE
                        Whether or not he chooses to stay.  
                        That’s right.

           Stan’s incredulous.  He glances over at du Pont, but his boss 
           doesn’t make eye contact.  Stan turns back to Dave. 

                                 STAN BECK
                        You’re making quite an assumption 
                        about the high value of your 
                        presence here.

                                 DAVE
                        You’re welcome to test the theory.  
                        We can see how many wrestlers stay 
                        if I decide to go.

           Beat.  Stan turns to Mark.
                                 STAN BECK
                        You’re that determined to leave? 

                                 DAVE
                        He’d like the option.

           Stan leans over to du Pont and WHISPERS in his ear.  It goes 
           on for several seconds.  Finally, du Pont nods very slightly.  

                                 STAN BECK
                        Mr. Du Pont would be prepared to 
                        accept the terms of this proposal, 
                        but only in the event that you 
                        accept the following stipulation.

                                 DAVE
                        What’s that?

                                 STAN BECK
                        That John du Pont, Head Coach of 
                        Team Foxcatcher, be seated in 
                        Mark’s corner throughout the 
                        Olympic Games.

           Long beat.  Dave turns to look at Mark.

           INT. MARK’S BEDROOM/DAIRY HOUSE - NIGHT

           Mark sleeps on his stomach, on top of the covers, wearing 
           pajama pants, no shirt.  Moonlight streams through the 
           window.  He OPENS his eyes.  He stands up, WALKS out of the 
           room and out the front door.

           EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - NIGHT

           VARIOUS SHOTS of Mark walking, wearing just his pajama pants, 
           through the woods, along the dirt road, across the field near 
           DAVE’S HOUSE.

           INT. DAVE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           C/U SHOTS of: a PHOTO of Dave and Alexander; Alexander’s TOYS 
           on the shelves of his room; Alexander SLEEPING in his bed. 

           I/E. DAVE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           CAMERA FOLLOWS Mark as he walks in the unlocked front door, 
           up the stairs, down the hall toward Alexander’s room. 
           INT. ALEXANDER’S ROOM/DAVE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Mark walks into the room and toward Alexander’s bed.  Alex 
           WAKES UP with a start - confused, and then terrified to see 
           his uncle walking toward his bed.

                                 ALEX  
                        Uncle Mark...?!  Uncle Mark...?!

           Alex scrambles from the bed as Mark comes toward him and then 
           climbs into the bed, settling under the covers.  Alex runs, 
           terrified, from the room.  Mark CLOSES his eyes and sleeps.  

           CAMERA stays on Mark, sleeping, as WE HEAR Alex waking up his 
           Mom and Dad, and then their footsteps coming down the hall.

           Dave enters holding Alex in his arms, with Nancy behind him. 

                                 DAVE
                        Mark.
                            (beat)
                        Mark.

           Mark doesn’t stir.  Dave hands Alex to Nancy and goes over to 
           his brother, asleep in his son’s bed.  He touches him gently.

                                 DAVE
                        Mark, wake up, buddy.

           Mark opens his eyes and looks at Dave.  He’s utterly 
           disoriented.

                                 MARK
                        Dave...?

           Mark looks over at Nancy holding Alex.  LONG BEAT, then:

                                 MARK
                        Where am I?

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA - ESTABLISHING/DAY

           A SERIES of QUICK SHOTS of the Seoul MARKETPLACE; COMMUTERS 
           spilling off the subway; Korean SIGNS, FLAGS, BANNERS...  

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:
           INT. OLYMPIC STADIUM/HALLWAY/SEOUL - DAY

           C/U on Mark, in his wrestling gear, looking disoriented, 
           unfocused.  He’s in the hall right outside the locker room, 
           just steps away from the WRESTLING ARENA. Dave’s in his face - 
           talking to him INTENSELY over the sounds of the crowd inside -

                                 DAVE
                        This is your moment to prove 
                        yourself - your moment to step out 
                        alone, away from everyone, into the 
                        spotlight.  This has nothing to do 
                        with me, nothing to do with John...

           Du Pont hovers a few feet behind Dave, being filmed by his 
           CAMERA CREW.  Mark’s eyes keep glancing over at him.  

                                 DAVE
                        ... nothing to do with anyone but 
                        you.  This is you, Mark.  It’s you.  
                        Focus and take what’s yours!

           INT. OLYMPIC STADIUM/SEOUL - MINUTES LATER

           Mark stands in his corner on the edge of the mat, flanked by 
           Dave and du Pont.  

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        From the United States of America, 
                        at 82 kilos... Mark Schultz.

           Mark walks onto the mat.  LOUD CHANTS of “U.S.A... U.S.A... 
           U.S.A...” spill from the sizeable American contingent in the 
           stands... waving flags and shouting.   

           Mark faces his Bulgarian opponent in the center of the mat as 
           each are checked by the REFEREE.  As Mark is patted down, he 
           glances over at his corner: du Pont is talking into Dave’s 
           ear, and Dave HAS HIS ARM AROUND du Pont’s shoulders, 
           listening.  The camera crew films them.

                                 REFEREE
                        Wrestle!

           Mark’s immediately taken down.

           INT. OLYMPIC STADIUM - MINUTES LATER

           Mark is GASPING for air, sitting in his chair in the corner.  
           Dave rubs his muscles while yelling at him, in his face --
                                 DAVE
                        This is now, Mark!  Now or never!  
                        This is what we trained for for 
                        fifteen years!

           But Mark can only focus on du Pont, clumsily fanning him with 
           the white towel -- not actually cooling him down, even 
           accidentally hitting him with it.  The camera crew films.

           INT. OLYMPIC STADIUM - MINUTES LATER

           Mark wrestles, struggling -- eyes lost, mouth open, gasping.  
           The drive, the poetry, it’s all gone.

           REFEREE blows the whistle.  The match is over.  The wrestlers 
           stand.  The Referee RAISES THE BULGARIAN’S hand.  Mark looks 
           at du Pont, STARING at him.  Dave hangs his head.

           The Ref turns the wrestlers around and raises the Bulgarian’s 
           hand, again.  Du Pont watches the small Bulgarian contingent 
           in the crowd going wild - cheering, dancing, waving the 
           Bulgarian flag.

           I/E. DRIVING - DAY

           C/U on Mark.  He’s driving.  We don’t know where he his, 
           where he’s driving.  CAMERA stays close on him for some time.  
           He signals to make a right turn.

           EXT. DRIVEWAY/FOXCATCHER ESTATE - CONTINUOUS

           Mark turns a RYDER VAN onto the Foxcatcher estate.  He stops 
           at the GUARDHOUSE, in front of the mechanical arm which 
           blocks his way.  The guard slides open the guardhouse window.

                                 GUARD
                        Name?

           On Mark, looking at him.

           EXT. DAIRY HOUSE/FOXCATCHER - DAY

           Mark throws his stuff through the open back doors of the van.  
           He walks inside the house, past a pile of stuff he’s leaving 
           in a heap on the porch.  CAMERA stays outside.  He comes out 
           with another armful, throws it in the van, slams the doors.
           EXT. DIRT ROAD/FOXCATCHER - DAY

           Mark drives toward the Big House.  A LONG-HAIRED HORSE 
           watches from the trees as the van drives past.

           EXT. BIG HOUSE/FOXCATCHER - DAY

           Mark walks up the front steps, two at a time.  He’s left the 
           van RUNNING at the foot of the steps, the driver’s door open.

           He knocks on the front door.  The maid opens it.

                                 MAID
                        Hello, Mr. Schultz --

           Mark WALKS RIGHT PAST her and heads for the staircase. 

                                 MAID
                        Mr. Schultz... Mr. Schultz, 
                        please...  Mr. Beck!

           INT. BIG HOUSE/FOXCATCHER - CONTINUOUS

           Mark heads up the stairs and down the long second floor hall 
           toward the trophy room.  Stan Beck emerges at the far end of 
           the hallway, from the back of the house. 

                                 STAN BECK
                        Mark.  Mark, stop, there’s nothing 
                        for you here.

           Mark, without a word, shoves him out of the way, heads into 
           the trophy room --

           INT. TROPHY ROOM/BIG HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Mark heads for the CENTER SECTION of the trophy case, with 
           all the wrestling trophies and medals.  He KICKS IN THE 
           GLASS, shattering it.  He grabs his medals -- his Olympic and 
           World Cup golds. 

           He heads back out the way he came, then stops.  He turns to 
           the FRAMED POSTER of himself, oiled up, in the Foxcatcher 
           singlet.  He had signed this poster: “To John ‘Eagle’ du 
           Pont, my coach and mentor, now and forever - Mark Schultz.”

           He walks over to it and PUNCHES IT, several times, smashing 
           the glass and tearing the poster.
           INT. HALLWAY/BIG HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Mark’s coming back down the hallway, toward the staircase.  
           As he gets to the top of the stairs, he sees THREE 
           PLAINCLOTHES SECURITY GUARDS running up the steps their hands 
           inside their jackets on their holstered GUNS. 

                                 SECURITY #1
                        Don’t move!  Mark, don’t move!

           They stop in the middle of the staircase.  Mark’s stopped at 
           the top. 

                                 MARK
                        Back the fuck off.  

           He holds out his medals in his bleeding hand.

                                 MARK
                        I just took what’s mine.
                            (beat)
                        Back off.

           EXT. BIG HOUSE/FOXCATCHER - MINUTES LATER

           POV from THIRD FLOOR WINDOW OF THE BIG HOUSE:  Mark gets in 
           his van and pulls away.  THREE BLACK SECURITY SEDANS follow.  

           REVERSE SHOT: We see who’s POV this is: John du Pont, 
           watching from his third floor window.

           DU PONT’S POV:  Mark’s Ryder van, followed by the security 
           sedans, drives toward DAVE’S HOUSE, on the very far side of 
           the vast front lawn.

           DU PONT’S POV:  Far off, Mark’s van arrives at his brother’s 
           house.  Mark gets out of van.  The security cars form a semi-
           circle between his van and the Big House, and the Guards get 
           of their cars and stand next to them.  Dave comes out on the 
           porch and walks toward Mark.

           EXT. DAVE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           CAMERA is in the scene now, as Dave and Mark approach, 
           stopping a few feet away from each other.  Long beat.  

           Dave gestures at Mark’s bloody hand.

                                 DAVE
                        Who’d you kill?
                                 MARK
                        Nobody.  Just myself.

           Dave smiles.

                                 DAVE
                        Everything’s gonna be fine.

           Mark’s just looking at him.  He doesn’t believe it.

                                 DAVE
                        I’ve got you taken care of.  As 
                        long as I’m here.

                                 MARK
                        You should be leaving with me.

                                 DAVE
                            (shrugs and smiles)
                        I may never leave.

           Nancy comes onto the porch.

                                 NANCY
                        Hey, Mark. 
                            (nods toward the guards)
                        Got your friends with you?

                                 MARK
                            (very quietly)
                        Hi, Nance.

           The kids, Danielle and Alex, come out onto the porch.

                                 NANCY
                        Dani, Alex, can you say goodbye to 
                        Uncle Mark.

           The kids wave.

                                 ALEXANDER
                        Bye, Uncle Mark.

           Mark nods.  Goes to his van, gets in.  Dave follows -- talks 
           to him through the open passenger window.

                                 DAVE
                        I’ll always be here for you.  Call 
                        whenever you need me.

           Mark starts the ignition.
                                 DAVE
                        Drive safe, buddy.  Let us know 
                        when you get there.

           EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - CONTINUOUS

           DU PONT’S POV: Far off, Mark drives toward the front gate, 
           followed by the three security sedans.  The sedans stop at 
           the guard house as Mark drives past it... and off the estate. 

           REVERSE: Du Pont, in the window, closes the curtains.

                                                              FADE OUT.

           EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - DAY

           Birds sit in the BARE BRANCHES of an oak tree; THREE HORSES, 
           long-haired and un-groomed, paw at the snowy ground, looking 
           for grass to eat; the American FLAG hangs limply on the 
           flagpole.    

           INT. BIG HOUSE/FOXCATCHER - DAY

           A SERIES OF SHOTS: The EMPTY ROOMS of the Foxcatcher Big 
           House.  Former grandeur, now devoid of life, dusty. 

           OVER the last of these shots, WE START TO HEAR a DEEP, OVERLY 
           DRAMATIC VOICE coming from a TV:  

                                 VIDEO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        ... He’s coached national and world 
                        champions with his unique 
                        combination of inspiration and 
                        patience...

           C/U of a TV SCREEN:

           On it, a SERIES OF IMAGES: Mark Schultz winning matches (one 
           of the images is the one that became the Foxcatcher poster); 
           Dave winning; Dan Bane winning..... 

           THEN, on screen, is the scene of du Pont “teaching” Mark a 
           wrestling move:

                                 DU PONT
                        From the under hook, pivot sideways 
                        while pulling down on his arm.  
                        Kneel between his legs and take him 
                        to the mat.
           Mark lets du Pont take him down, though it’s abundantly 
           apparent how much Mark is gritting his teeth through this.

           INT. LARGE EMPTY ROOM/BIG HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           We SEE where we are: a huge empty room - probably once used 
           for grand dances.  In one corner: du Pont and the Documentary 
           Director sit on two chairs in front of a TV hooked up to a 
           VCR.  The Director is screening “The John du Pont Story” for 
           his boss.  

           Du Pont has a PISTOL once again tucked in his waistband.

           ON THE VIDEO: 

           A SHOT OF: Dave presenting the “Man of the Year” award:

                                 DAVE
                        My brother Mark has been known to 
                        say that you have to orphan 
                        yourself to accomplish 
                        greatness.... This orphan sport of 
                        wrestling has found a home at 
                        Foxcatcher Farms.

           A SHOT OF: Mark winning the Olympic Trials and Dave HUGGING 
           and LIFTING his brother into the air.

           A SHOT OF: du Pont watching this from the stands and raising 
           his fist in the air.

           A SHOT OF: Dave talking to the camera in the Foxcatcher gym: 

                                 DAVE
                        John’s commitment to this sport is 
                        complete.  His work ethic...

           And now, Dave, who’s been so good at playing along, takes it 
           too far even for himself.  As he says the next bit, he 
           stumbles over his words, looks down, obviously uncomfortable -

                                 DAVE
                        - We... we consider John one of us.  
                        One of - uh - the athletes. 

           A SHOT OF: du Pont talking to the camera, haltingly - trying 
           so hard to be authoritative, inspirational:

                                 DU PONT
                        Our challenge... as coaches... and 
                        leaders... of athletes 
                        everywhere... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DU PONT (cont'd)
                        indeed our obligation.  And 
                        responsibility.  Is first - and 
                        foremost to build winners in life.  
                        To build men who will - be prepared 
                        for life.

           A SHOT of a GOLDEN EAGLE sitting on a tree branch, then 
           flying away.

                                 VIDEO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        The symbol of America is the Golden 
                        Eagle... 

           A SHOT of du Pont climbing into the pilot seat of his 
           helicopter.  He puts on his headset.

                                 VIDEO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        John du Pont is that Golden Eagle.

           Du Pont takes off in the helicopter and flies away.  Over 
           this shot, the end title comes up:                              
           “THE GOLDEN EAGLE OF AMERICA - THE JOHN DU PONT STORY.”

           THE TAPE ENDS.  The TV screen goes to static snow.

           SILENCE as du Pont sits there, the Director next to him.  

           Finally, du Pont stands and starts for the door.

                                 DU PONT
                        Good.

           The Director follows him.

                                 DOCUMENTARY DIRECTOR
                        We’ve bought several time slots 
                        next week on local station WPHI --

                                 DU PONT
                            (still moving)
                        Good.

                                 DOCUMENTARY DIRECTOR
                            (still following)
                        -- several late night slots, of 
                        course, but there was also an open 
                        afternoon half-hour, directly after 
                        “The Edge of Night.”  That should 
                        be a good one. 

           Du Pont continues right out the door, down the hallway, not 
           even turning to face him.
                                 DU PONT
                        Excellent.

           The Director stops at the door.  He calls out to du Pont --

                                 DOCUMENTARY DIRECTOR
                        I’ll let you know what the 
                        viewership numbers are as soon as I 
                        have them.

           EXT. BIG HOUSE - DAY

           Du Pont walks out a SIDE DOOR of the Big House, followed by a 
           PLAINCLOTHES SECURITY GUARD.  As he walks toward the front of 
           the house, he calls out to some WORKMEN who are up on ladders 
           cleaning the roof gutters. 

                                 DU PONT
                            (pointing)
                        I think that one’s particularly 
                        clogged.

           The head WORKMAN looks down at him and waves.

                                 WORKMAN
                        We’re heading that way, Mr. du 
                        Pont.

                                 DU PONT
                        Excellent.

           He continues toward his car - the BLACK MERCURY - goes to the 
           driver’s side.  Then, something catches his eye in a nearby 
           tree -- he points it out the Security Guard:

                                 DU PONT
                        Northern Cardinal.  Look at that.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Yes, sir.

                                 DU PONT
                        They never leave home, no matter 
                        how cold it gets.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Yes, sir.

           They get in the car and du Pont turns on the ignition.  
           Before he shifts into gear, he removes the PISTOL from his 
           waistband and places it on the middle seat.  He pulls out.
           I/E. DU PONT’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Du Pont drives on the dirt road that edges the trees which 
           ring the enormous front lawn.  The trees are bare, a bit 
           snowy.  It’s peaceful and very pretty.  The car is 
           approaching Dave’s House.

           EXT. DAVE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Du Pont’s car pulls up outside Dave’s House.  Dave’s Subaru 
           is parked in the yard out front, and Dave lies half-in-half-
           out the driver's side door, working on the FUSE BOX under the 
           steering column.

           Dave rises out of the car to see who’s pulled up.  The word 
           “KIDS” is written on his forehead, and as we see when he 
           WAVES to du Pont, also on the PALM of his hand.

                                 DAVE
                        Hey, Coach.

           Dave takes a step toward du Pont’s car.  Du Pont just looks 
           at him through his open driver’s window.

                                 DAVE
                        What’s up, John?

           Du Pont picks up his PISTOL from the seat.  

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Whoa, whoa, whoa.... 

           Du Pont POINTS the pistol at Dave.

                                 DU PONT
                        You got a problem with me?

                                 DAVE
                        John --

           Dave holds out his hand --

           Du Pont SHOOTS Dave.  The bullet goes through Dave’s hand, 
           smashing into his chest, throwing him to the ground.  

           The Security Guard scrambles out the car door and ducks 
           behind the passenger side fender.

           Dave tries to crawl away.  Du Pont gets out of his car and 
           walks toward him.
                                 NANCY
                        Dave!.... David!...

           Nancy has run out onto the porch and is screaming for her 
           husband.  Du Pont POINTS the pistol at her.  She RUNS inside.

           Du Pont walks over to Dave, still crawling away.  He SHOOTS 
           Dave in the back.  Then he SHOOTS him in the back of the 
           head.

           He stands over Dave, watching him bleed out onto the snowy 
           ground.

                                                              FADE OUT.

           INT. UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN FIELD HOUSE ARENA - DAY

           Open on a large projected video montage of images of Dave's 
           life; Dave smiling broadly; playing with his kids; wrestling; 
           Dave with Nancy.... Included are MANY IMAGES of Mark and 
           Dave, from childhood on.  The video ends.  

           We’re in the old U. of W. Sports arena.  Three thousand 
           people pack the stands.  

           PHILIP SCHULTZ, Mark and Dave’s father, is at the podium, on 
           stage, the huge screen behind him. 

                                 PHILIP
                        I’d like to introduce my second 
                        son, David’s younger brother, Mark 
                        Schultz. 

           Mark’s in the front row of the audience.  He somehow manages 
           to get to his feet and walk toward the stage.  He carries a 
           single SHEET OF PAPER.

           On stage, Mark and Philip briefly, uncomfortably, hug.  Mark 
           puts his piece of paper on the podium and faces the crowd.  
           Silence.  He’s doing his best to keep it together.  He takes 
           a deep breath.  Satisfied that he can speak, he begins -- 

                                 MARK
                        Dave was my brother --

           He starts to sob.  It’s open and uncontrolled and innocent 
           and child-like.

                                 MARK
                        He never hurt me with a lie.
                            (long pause as he cries)
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARK (cont'd)
                        He was my best friend, my teacher, 
                        my coach.  His words were so 
                        powerful he could cut to the heart 
                        of the truth in all things.  Dave 
                        became strong by working to 
                        overcome the weakness he suffered 
                        as a child.  He taught me how to 
                        fight, how to be honest, how stand 
                        up for myself and be a man.
                            (sobs, then)
                        He was the most honest person I’ll 
                        ever know.

                                                              FADE OUT.

           INT. MAKESHIFT LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

           Mark, his HEAD SHAVED, sits in a chair too small for him.  
           He’s in front of a painted cinder block wall.  He wears only 
           shorts, no shirt.  A CLOCK ticks on the wall behind him.

           After several moments, we START TO HEAR crowd-pumping MUSIC 
           in the background.  LOUDER.  LOUDER...

           INT. ULTIMATE FIGHTING CHAMPIONSHIP ARENA - NIGHT

           Mark walks out of the tunnel into the ARENA.  HUGE SOUND - 
           loud, crowd-pumping music.  Strobe lights.  Mark’s bare-
           chested - no shirt.  He looks straight ahead as he walks.  
           There’s something missing behind his eyes. 

           INT. THE CAGE/UFC ARENA - NIGHT

           Mark fights a Japanese martial artist.  Mark’s destroying him 
           in a brutal, uninhibited display of aggression.  He’s gotten 
           his opponent on the mat and he’s on top of him, pounding his 
           bloody face repeatedly.

           The REF stops the fight.  Mark stands.  

           He’s completely still, except for his heavy breathing.  The 
           other man’s blood is on him.  The crowd goes wild, CHANTING, 
           SCREAMING --  “U.S.A.... U.S.A.... U.S.A.... U.S.A....”

                                                   SCREEN GOES BLACK.
