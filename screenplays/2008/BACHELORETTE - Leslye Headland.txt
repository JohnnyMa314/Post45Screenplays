           INT.  LOS ANGELES STUDIO APARTMENT. DAY.

           SFX.  Cell phone ringing.  Ring tone: “Smack My Bitch Up.”

           Buried in bedsheets, GENA MYERS (29) grabs her cell phone; 
           checks caller ID.  GENA is a sexy blonde with a dry and dark 
           sense of humor.  Her eyes are smeared with last night’s 
           makeup and desperate for sleep.  She is equipped to solve any 
           crisis but rarely successful at solving one she created.  
           She’s a Playboy Bunny stuck with Larry David’s brain.  Gena 
           answers the call.

                                 GENA
                        Suicide hot-line.

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        Gena?  What are you doing right 
                        now?

           Gena sees beside her a RUMPLED GUY (20s), musician probably.

                                 GENA
                        I was sleeping.  Now I’m trying to 
                        piece together my shattered well-
                        being.

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        How can you sleep?  The world is 
                        ending!

                                 GENA
                        Katie, if the apocalypse is upon 
                        us, it’ll hit LA in three hours.

           Getting out of bed, Gena steps into an ashtray and knocks 
           over several empty beer bottles.  Her place is too small to 
           contain her level of debauchery.  She puts on the nearest 
           piece of clothing: the RUMPLED GUY’s T-shirt. 

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        Did you get this invitation?

                                 GENA
                        I didn’t get an invitation to jack.

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        When was the last time you checked 
                        your mail?

                                 GENA
                        I don’t share a mailbox with my  
                        parents on Long Island.
                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        Living with my parents beats over-
                        paying for a shitty studio.

           Gena notices her reflection.  Her T-shirt reads “JACK 
           JOHNSON”.  She lets out a groan.

                                 GENA
                        Ugh!

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        Are you reading the invite?

                                 GENA
                        No.  I just realized the guy I 
                        slept with sucks.

           EXT.  LOS ANGELES STUDIO APARTMENT.  DAY - CONTINUOUS

           CLOSE ON.  Unopened bills.  Second Notice.  Final Notice.  
           Junk Mail.  Chinese Food Flyers.  An egg-white envelope.  
           Gold calligraphy: GENA MYERS.

           Gena, still in the Jack Johnson T-shirt, stands at the rows 
           of mailboxes for her apartment building.  Juggling her 
           unopened mail and her cell phone, she rips open the invite 
           and reads its contents.  It’s a invitation to the wedding of 
           Rebecca Archer to Cal Douglas.

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        Who the fuck is Rebecca Archer?

                                 GENA
                        Holy hell.  We went to high school 
                        with her.  Remember?  She and I 
                        used to be really close.  

           A REALLY OLD GUY tries to open the heavy front door of the 
           building.  Arms full, Gena gets the door for him and props it 
           open with her leg.  REALLY OLD GUY gets a nice look at her 
           hot pink underwear.

                                 GENA (CONT’D)
                        Isn’t Cal Douglas that guy who just 
                        became the Editor-in-Chief of the 
                        New York Star.

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        And the richest guy in Manhattan 
                        under 30.  Gena, we did not go to 
                        high school with anyone named 
                        Rebecca Archer.
                                 GENA
                        Becky.  She was kind of overweight.

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        PIGFACE BECKY?

                                 GENA
                        Yeah.  Pigface.  Fuck.  This is 
                        gonna be prom with better skin.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT.  LONG ISLAND HOME.  GARAGE.  DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Old children’s bikes and toys mingle with exercise equipment.  
           KATIE NEUBERG (29) is running on a treadmill.  Her face is 
           covered in a green deep-cleansing mask.  She is wearing a 
           pink blue-tooth earpiece.  Katie is a pretty and thin 
           brunette; Charlotte York with a drinking problem that’s 
           slowed her down to a ditsy-ness she is still trying to pass 
           off as naivete.

                                 KATIE
                        I’m de-clogging my pores and doing 
                        some cardio. 

                                 GENA (V.O.)
                        The wedding isn’t for another two 
                        months.

                                 KATIE
                        Exactly.  We can’t fuck around.

           KATIE’S POV.  Plastered to the garage wall is a shrine of 
           photos.  All from Katie’s high school years.  She is all 
           smiles.  She was the prom queen.  

           BACK ON.  Katie, on the treadmill, looking like an out-of-
           breath Gremlin after midnight.

           INT.  LOS ANGELES STUDIO APARTMENT.  KITCHEN.  DAY - 
           CONTINUOUS

           Filthy.  Dirty dishes piled up in the sink.  Flies.  An 
           ancient coffee-maker is brewing.  Gena is cleaning a mug with 
           the Jack Johnson T-shirt.

                                 GENA
                        I can’t even remember the last time 
                        I talked to Becky Archer.  And out 
                        of the blue we’re invited to her 
                        wedding?  
                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        This stinks of Regan.

                                 GENA
                        I’m conferencing her in.

           She takes the phone from her ear and starts pressing buttons.

           INT.  MANHATTAN BRIDAL SHOP. DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Aggressively white.  A window lined with headless mannequins 
           in bridal gowns.  A redhead, REGAN GALLAGHER (29), is 
           examining a Vera Wang gown.  Regan is naturally beautiful but 
           a Stepford Wife in progress.  Her crisp haircut, J. Crew 
           dress and sculpted figure seem severe instead of demure.  She 
           is your best friend or your worst enemy.  At the moment, she 
           is on her cell phone.

                                 REGAN
                        I can’t really talk.  I’m helping 
                        Pigface pick out her wedding dress.

           THREE-WAY SPLIT SCREEN.  Gena is sipping coffee and chain-
           smoking in her kitchen in LA.  Katie, still in her parents’ 
           garage on Long Island, is now doing crunches.  Regan is 
           examining her flawless manicure in the Manhattan Bridal Shop.  

                                 KATIE
                        Is this your good deed for the 
                        year, Regan?  

                                 REGAN
                        I’m her Maid of Honor.

                                 REGAN
                        Actually she asked me and I 
                        nominated you two.  Surprise!

                                 KATIE
                        What are you on!?

                                 REGAN
                        Today?  Two prozacs and an adderol.  
                        Everything is unicorns shitting out 
                        rainbows.

                        Regan, being a bridesmaid is my 
                        personal definition of hell.

                                 REGAN
                        When was the last time all three of 
                        us were in the same state?  This 
                        wedding is a chance to see some old 
                        friends and be the cool girls.

                                 GENA
                        But we aren’t the cool girls 
                        anymore.  We’re almost thirty, 
                        single, white females with 
                        disposable incomes.

                                 REGAN
                        Who’s single?

                                 KATIE
                        Who said my income’s disposable?  
                        Like, I need it.

                                 REGAN
                        You make it sound like we’re 
                        lepers, Gena.  This is the twenty-
                        first century.  Men are bachelors 
                        and we’re...

                                 KATIE
                        Bachelorettes!

                        I think I prefer “leper”.

                        If we’re bridesmaids does that mean 
                        we get a bachelorette party?!

                        Guys, are we so dissatisfied with 
                        our own lives that we have to 
                        parade around a bunch of people we 
                        used to know in order to validate 
                        our lifestyle choices?

                                 GENA
                        I will.  After I get under him.

           SALESGIRL approaches Regan and clears her throat.  

                                 REGAN
                        I gotta run.  If either of you 
                        flake on bridesmaid duty, I’ll cut 
                        your tits off.

           She hangs up.  Salesgirl is a little nervous.  Regan points 
           to the Vera Wang.

                                 REGAN (CONT’D)
                        Can I see this one?

                        What size do you need?  A 2?

                                 REGAN
                        I need this in a size 12ish.

                                 SALESGIRL
                        Oh, I assumed you were the Bride.

           Regan flips her off with her ring finger which is ringless.

                                 REGAN
                        What does it look like?

           INT.  LOS ANGELES APARTMENT.  DAY.

           The day before the wedding.  A thoroughly hung-over and 
           frazzled Gena is indiscriminately packing.  Throwing 
           everything in sight into an overnight bag.  Dirty laundry.  A 
           coffee mug.  A vibrator.  A fancy butter yellow dress in a 
           dry cleaning bag.  She grabs a bag of cocaine.

           INT. LOS ANGELES APARTMENT.  BATHROOM.  DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Gena opens the medicine cabinet and dumps its entire contents 
           into the bag.  Face wash.  Deodorant.  Tampons.  Old 
           toothbrushes.  She grabs a baby powder bottle.  Empties it 
           into the toilet.  Her cell phone rings.  She answers it.

                                 REGAN (V.O.)
                        DON’T YOU DARE MISS YOUR FLIGHT!

           She pours the entire bag of cocaine into the empty baby 
           powder bottle.

           INT. CENTRAL PARK HOTEL.  KITCHEN.  DAY.

           Shower of powdered sugar.  A CHEF is sifting it on top of an 
           exotic desert as the finishing touch.  Regan inspects it, 
           giving off the vibe of an over-caffeinated Jackie Kennedy.  

                                  REGAN
                        Easy on the sugar.  Have you seen 
                        the bride?

           She walks the length of the shiny, bustling kitchen.  The 
           CONCIERGE hands her a butter yellow dress.  Regan addresses 
           him like a drill sergeant.

           INT.  LONG ISLAND MALL.  CLUB MONACO.  AFTERNOON - CONTINUOUS

           CLOSE ON.  Butter yellow dress.  Being steamed.

           A Club Monaco.  Dead white mannequins in colorful outfits.  
           Katie steams her bridesmaid dress with her cell cradled 
           between her shoulder and chin.  Katie is in a slinky party 
           dress with high heels that look impossible to walk in.  

                                 KATIE
                        Gena, we’re gonna get wasted 
                        tonight and look hot and we don’t 
                        even care what that stupid Clyde or 
                        Pigface thinks.

           A DUMPY-LOOKING GIRL pops out of a dressing room, wearing a 
           dress that is way too small for her.  Katie conceals her 
           phone.

                                 DUMPY-LOOKING GIRL
                        You sure I can pull this off?

           DUMPY-LOOKING GIRL exits.  Katie rolls her eyes.

           EXT.  LOS ANGELES.  405 FREEWAY.  DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Gena is speeding down the highway in a ‘89 Acura.  She’s in 
           an American Apparel dress and peep-toe platform pumps.  She 
           winds through traffic and shouts at the car in front of her.

           CLOSE ON.  Regan with a big fake smile.  FLASH!

           We pull back to reveal Regan standing under a rose-lined 
           trellis.  People buzz around her setting up a floral paradise 
           for the ceremony.  A PHOTOGRAPHER shows Regan her photo he 
           just took on the display screen of his digital camera.

           INT.  PLANE.  DAY.

           Plane is jostling mid-takeoff.  Gena braiding her hair 
           nervously.  A BARELY ATTRACTIVE GUY (20s) is next to her, 
           gripping the arms of his seat.

           INT.  LONG ISLAND MALL.  CLUB MONACO.  EARLY EVENING.

           Cash registers.  Kylie Minogue thumping.  MANUEL (mid-30s), a 
           fantastic and gay Club Monaco manager, is ringing up a 
           customer while dancing to the music.  Katie rushes past him, 
           teetering atop her heels.

                                 KATIE
                        There’s only so much Kylie Minogue 
                        a girl can listen to, Manuel.

                                 MANUEL
                        Keeps you on your toes, diva!  
                        Where do you think you’re going?

                        I’ve got to make the next train to 
                        the city.  I’m going to a 
                        bachelorette party!

                                 MANUEL
                        Girl, why didn’t you invite Manuel 
                        the cream machine?! 

           His dancing becomes wilder with some air-humping and 
           thrusting his crotch at her.  This almost sets Katie off-
           balance.  She giggles as she exits.

                                 KATIE
                        The next one!  I promise!

           INT.  PLANE.  EARLY EVENING.

           Steady flight.  There are little airplane bottles of liquor 
           in front of Gena and the Barely Attractive Guy.  They’re 
           wasted.

                        of my throat as much as the next 
                        guy.  But girls can’t go all out on 
                        a regular basis.

                        Why not?  If you enjoy it--

                                 GENA
                        Look.  On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 is 
                        blowing it kisses and 10 is I’m 
                        choking on vomit and semen.  I 
                        gotta start off with 4s and 5s.  
                        I’m just good enough that you feel 
                        like I know what I’m doing but no 
                        enthusiasm.  So you'll think “Fine.  
                        I'll just fuck her.”  I start with 
                        a 10.  I got nowhere to go!  Why 
                        are you gonna spend any time 
                        fucking me when you just came all 
                        over my face?  So I start off 
                        small.  Then I build it up.  Give 
                        you a 6 after a fight.  An 8 when 
                        you spend a lot of money on me.  
                        Then I go back to 4s and 5s when I 
                        want you to do something for me.  
                        And your dick alarm will go off.

                        justify you giving a 10?

                        You gotta save them for the right

                        you’re about to go to the wedding 
                        of your ex-best friend.  She

                        guy your mom is gonna torture you 
                        to marry until the day you die.  
                        And your ex-boyfriend, who ruined 
                        your life, is gonna be there.  And 
                        you’re stuck on a plane.  With 
                        nothing but pent-up frustration.  
                        Next to a guy you’re never gonna 
                        see again.
           She downs the rest of her little bottle of liquor.  The guy 
           is hopeful.  She looks at him like “What were we talking 
           about?”

           Baggage claim.  A limo driver is holding a sign: GINA MYERS.  
           Gena walks into the shot, already smoking a cigarette and 
           downing a little airplane bottle of liquor.

           Tosses the tiny liquor bottle defiantly to the ground.

           INT.  CENTRAL PARK HOTEL.  FOYER.  NIGHT.

           The lobby of the hotel is plush and gold.  A large carpeted 
           foyer scattered with vintage furniture.  Dark wooden desks 
           house concierge and reception areas.  Regan stands waiting, 
           checks the wall clock, goes to bite her nails but stops 
           herself when she sees Katie and Gena.  They ambush her with 
           hugs and girly sounds of joy.

           They turn around to see BECKY (29), the Bride.  She’s very 
           pretty and rosy-cheeked.  She’s overweight but only compared 
           to these skinny bitches.  Becky stares at Gena in disbelief.
                                 BECKY
                        You look... like a completely

                        way.  On getting married.  Not for 
                        looking the same.

           Awkward.  Gena feels like an asshole.  Which she is.

                        Regan said you both were expecting 
                        some sort of blow-out.  We’re 
                        having ice cream sundaes and a 
                        champagne toast in my suite later.

                        your last night of freedom?

                                 BECKY
                        Maybe we could have had a wild

                        Thanks for picking out these 
                        wonderful bridesmaids, Regan.  We 
                        need to go into dinner. Where’s

           Gena eyes both of them suspiciously.  She and Katie whisper 
           to each other.

                        You?  She didn’t even say hello to 
                        me.  I bet she’s still mad about 
                        that time I poured maple syrup all 
                        over her clothes while she showered 
                        after gym class.  Which is fucked 
                        up because I totally apologized for

                        sucked.

           INT.  CENTRAL PARK HOTEL.  BANQUET HALL.  NIGHT.

           Cream.  It’s all cream-colored tablecloths, walls, napkins, 
           with the hazy glow of candlelight.  The rehearsal dinner is 
           about to begin.  Guests mingle.  Open bar.  String quartet.

           CLOSE ON.  Regan chatting and flirting with JEFF (30), the 
           Best Man.  Jeff looks like he graduated magna cum laude, has 
           a very successful job, and has definitely fucked hookers.

           CLOSE ON.  Gena and Katie camped out at the open bar.  Kate’s 
           drinking a Cosmo.  Gena’s drinking Maker’s on the rocks.

                        Leave it to Regan to sit next to 
                        the only hot rich guy here.

                        I need to get a guy at this 
                        wedding, Gena.  A guy with a job.  
                        The last date I went on was at the 
                        Olive Garden.

                        This is my last chance.  If I’m not 
                        married by 30, I’ll fucking kill 
                        myself.  I’ll be like a bunion on 
                        the foot of humanity.

           JOE (29), a nerdy stoner, walks up to them.  Buddy Holly 
           glasses.  Not a lot of game but definitely has that hot “I 
           speak the language of the machines” thing going on.  

                                 JOE

                        We... went to high school together.

                        That’s Cal?!

           CLOSE ON.  CAL (29), who is Robert Redford circa 1975.  
           Handsome and WASPy.  He’s laughing uproariously with CLYDE 
           (29), Gena’s high school sweetheart.  If John Cusack and 
           Vince Vaughn made love the product would be CLYDE.  Good-
           looking, eternally boyish with an idiotic sense of humor.

           Gena walks away from them.  Katie is pissed she was just

           by swaying to the music.

                        over the newspaper we didn’t get a 
                        chance to go to Vegas.  So, he 
                        doesn’t know it yet, but we’re

                        lagging behind cause he had to ride 
                        the Freefall last minute.  He’s 
                        about to get on the bus, carrying 
                        this huge cup of soda, and he just

                        So he and I are sitting in the back 
                        of the bus.  Cal in wet shorts and 
                        I get a whiff of gnarly.  It’s the 
                        distinct smell of urine.  And I 
                        turn to him and say, “It would be 
                        pretty funny if you pissed your 
                        pants on the Freefall and then 
                        tried to cover it up by spilling 
                        Coke all over yourself.”  And Cal 
                        says “Yes but it would also be kind 
                        of genius.”

           Guests laugh and applaud.  Becky and Cal look lovingly at 
           each other.  Gena leans over to see Clyde, still flirting

           Later that night.  The suite is enormous.  Everything is soft 
           pinks, deep reds and blinding whites.  Rose petals litter the 
           furniture.  Floor to ceiling windows over-looking a leafy but 
           dark Central Park.  Lights from buildings hang over the view 
           like stars.  Becky’s Mother, DENISE, and Cal’s Mother, MARIE, 
           are dishing out ice cream sundaes to Becky’s friends.

           We follow a pretty TALL GIRL down a long hallway into...

           NIGHT.

           A marble sanctum.  Two sinks.  Two entrances.  Wall to wall 
           mirror.  A never-been-used toilet.  A glass-walled shower.  
           And an old-fashioned tub with shower head.

           In the tub are about fifteen bottles of Cristal chilling in a 
           bed of ice.  TALL GIRL pops open a bottle and pours herself a 
           glass.  A few feet away, Katie and Gena are sipping champagne 
           from glasses and speaking in hushed tones.

                        It’s really tacky.  Clyde’s always 
                        been tacky.  She’s not even twenty.

           TALL GIRL walks out the alternate entrance to the bathroom 
           into...

           INT.  CENTRAL PARK HOTEL.  PENTHOUSE SUITE.  MASTER BEDROOM.  
           NIGHT.

           Large fluffy bed surrounded by a myriad of floral 
           arrangements.  TALL GIRL walks past Regan, who is talking to 
           an ANOREXIC FRIEND and a GEEKY FRIEND.  Regan inspects her 
           manicure.

                                 ANOREXIC FRIEND
                        I’ve been with Chris for a year and 
                        I think he’d rather drink Nair than 
                        marry me.

                                 REGAN
                        Have you ever thought about getting

                                 REGAN
                        Is there a form of Russian roulette 
                        that doesn’t involve risking human 
                        life?

           INT.  CENTRAL PARK HOTEL.  PENTHOUSE SUITE.  NIGHT.

           All the women are gathered around toasting Becky.  Denise and 
           Marie are elated with their glasses raised high.

                                 DENISE

           Applause.  Sipping.  Gena, rebraiding her hair, speaks under 
           her breath to Katie.  Regan approaches them.

                        What do you mean?  What did you do?

           SFX.  Knock at the door.

           Becky opens it.  Standing there is a POLICE OFFICER (MANUEL).

                                 MANUEL
                        Ma’am, do you realize guests have 
                        been complaining about the noise?

                                 BECKY
                        I’m so sorry!  We will keep it 
                        down.  It’s just that I’m getting 
                        married tomorrow.

                                 MANUEL
                        Then I’m afraid I’m going to have 
                        to search you.

                                 BECKY
                        What?  Why?

           Manuel throws Becky’s arms into the air and pats her down.  
           Marie and Denise gasp.  Katie and Gena are trying very hard 
           not to laugh.  Regan is trying to look as disapproving as 
           possible.  Manuel starts grabbing Becky’s breasts.  

                                 DENISE
                        That’s enough.

                                 MARIE
                        What’s the meaning of this!?

           Manuel stops and picks up a boombox that sits just outside 
           the door of the suite.

                                 MANUEL
                        Alright, diva!  

           He presses play on the boombox.  Some awful Tom Jones song 
           comes on.  He rips off his uniform to reveal a sexy, 
           perfectly waxed body covered only by a polka dot thong.  He 
           starts his air-humping moves around Becky.  Some of the girls 
           look like they are enjoying the ridiculousness of it.  Most 
           of them think it’s completely inappropriate.  Marie and 
           Denise look like they might faint.  Becky is mortified.
           Manuel picks up his messenger bag, reaches in and throws 
           condoms at the girls.  He pulls out a penis hat and puts it 
           on Becky’s head.  He starts humping her in time to the music.  
           Denise runs over and shuts the boombox off.  Silence, except 
           for Katie’s cackling.  Gena and Regan look like deer in the 
           headlights.  Becky tears off the penis hat.  Manuel looks at 
           Katie, doubled over with laughter.

                        And you know what?  You are.  Now 
                        you look like a bitch AND act like

                                 BECKY 
                        A huge mistake.  I only made you 
                        two bridesmaids because I felt 
                        sorry for you.

           Silence.  Gena doesn’t know what to say.  Everyone is 
           severely uncomfortable.  The other bachelorettes start to get 
           their things together.

                                 DENISE
                        Let’s go lie down in my suite, 
                        Becky.  Tomorrow’s a big day.

           Everyone leaves.  Marie discreetly locks arms with Manuel.  
           They saunter off together.  Gena, Regan and Katie stand there 
           powerless.  Becky whirls around before exiting.

                                 BECKY
                        Don’t bother showing up tomorrow 
                        unless you’re going to act slightly

           their own bottle of Cristal.  Gena finishes sniffing a line.

                        To show off.  It’s audacity posing

                        Gena!  Regan’s using big words!

           Katie sniffs a line.  Gena re-enters.  She is wearing the

                        That’s the best idea you’ve had all 
                        night.

           Regan picks up the wedding dress.  Katie gets a lighter from 
           her purse.  Gena tries to grab it from Katie.  They wrestle 
           in a really girly way.

           Katie tosses the lighter to Regan.  Regan stands with dress 
           in one hand and lighter in the other.  Gena nervous but 
           composed.

                        I will love you forever if you do

                        She won’t.  She doesn’t have the

           Regan brings the lighter dangerously close to the dress.  
           Gena grabs the skirt to take it from Regan.  Regan pulls 
           hard.  Gena pulls hard back.  They wrestle with it.  They 
           knock over a lamp.  RIIIIIIIPPPPP!

           Whoa.  All three girls look wide-eyed at each other.  There 
           is a huge rip in the skirt from hem to waistline.  The 
           wedding dress is unwearable.  Vera Wang screams in pain 
           somewhere.  No one moves.

           The suite is smaller than the penthouse but just as 
           fantastic.  Cal, Jeff, Clyde and Joe are all sandwiched into 
           a couch facing a flat screen plasma.  Jeff and Cal are 
           drinking tumblers of scotch.  Clyde drinks straight from the 
           bottle.  Joe is smoking pot from a small bowl.  

           Simultaneously they all react with crushing disappointment!  
           Except for Cal who is triumphant.

           REVERSE ANGLE on the TV.  Basketball game.  Freak mid-court 
           shot wins the game.  Players celebrate.

                                 CAL
                        PAY UP, ASSHOLES!

                                 CLYDE
                        Jokes on you, Cal.  Cuz I don’t 
                        have any money.  AAAHH!!

                                 JEFF
                        I love you.  I just met you and I 
                        love you.  In a completely gay way.

                                 CLYDE
                        I have that effect on people.

                                 CAL
                        Alright, guys.  I’m done.  I gotta 
                        get married tomorrow.  Get out of 
                        my suite before I call security.

                                 CLYDE
                        Smoke some weed first.  Joe, if you 
                        want me to get you laid tonight, 
                        stop bogarting the fucking bowl.

                                 JOE
                             (exhaling smoke)
                        I just struck out with the girl I 
                        masturbated to for four years.  The 
                        last thing I want to do tonight is 
                        go to a strip club.

                                 CLYDE
                        Joe!  Ix-nay on the Ippers-Stray!

                                 JEFF
                        Way to ruin the surprise, Joseph.
                                 CAL
                        JEFF!  I said no strip clubs!

                                 JEFF
                        Don’t make me fight you.

           INT.  CENTRAL PARK HOTEL.  PENTHOUSE SUITE.  NIGHT.

           The girls are in a state of completely panic.  Gena is 
           holding the dress surveying the damage.

                                 GENA
                        This is un-fixable!  We are so 
                        fucked.  What possessed you to do 
                        that?!

                                 REGAN
                        You pulled it from me too fast!

                                 GENA
                        Don’t start passing the blame!  
                        What are we going to do?

                                 KATIE
                        Maybe we could hide it?  Maybe we 
                        could tell Becky that it was 
                        stolen?

                                 REGAN
                        Yes!  A homeless man broke into a 
                        five-star hotel and stole the dress 
                        to what?  Pitch a tent with it?

           Katie throws an expensive vase onto the ground and it breaks 
           into a thousand pieces.  SMASH!

                                 GENA
                        What in the fuck are you doing?!

                                 KATIE
                        We gotta trash the room and make it 
                        look like it was robbed.

           Katie grabs a champagne bottle throws it into the wall.  
           SMASH!

                                 GENA
                        STOP IT!  That is a terrible idea!  
                        We have to fix it.

                                 REGAN
                        You said it was un-fixable!
                                 GENA
                        Well, fuck!  I’ve done so much coke 
                        I probably should have died ten 
                        minutes ago.  Maybe we should get a 
                        second opinion.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT.  CENTRAL PARK HOTEL.  HOUSEKEEPING.  NIGHT.

           Housekeeping staff of the hotel are busy tonight!  Women in 
           white uniforms buzz about their pristine headquarters.  Gena 
           and Katie are standing over a sweet-looking HOUSEKEEPING 
           LADY, who is folding towels.  Gena is showing her the dress.

                                 HOUSEKEEPING LADY
                        No.  No.  It’s too damaged.  I 
                        can’t help you.

                                 GENA
                        Please you’ve got to help us.  This 
                        is an emergency.

                                 KATIE
                        I mean, what are we paying you for?

                                 GENA
                        We’re not paying her!

                                 KATIE
                        Well, someone is.  

                                 HOUSEKEEPING LADY
                             (sighing)
                        Not enough.

           We pull back to reveal Regan on her cell a few feet away.  
           Regan is biting her nails.  Chomping on her manicure.

                                 REGAN
                        What do you mean you’re not coming 
                        to the wedding?

                                 FRANK (V.O.)
                        I mean, exactly that.  I’m not 
                        coming.

                                 REGAN
                        Do you understand that shit is 
                        going down right now?  I need you 
                        here!
                                 FRANK (V.O.)
                        I got some work stuff to do so...  
                        You still there?  

                                 REGAN
                        Yes.  I am.  Frank, I need you 
                        here!

                                 FRANK (V.O.)
                        I can’t hear you.  I get terrible 
                        reception in our apartment.  I’ll 
                        call you later.

           Click.  Regan takes a moment to collect herself.  She hangs 
           up and starts texting.  Gena turns around and shouts at her.

                                 GENA
                        Regan!  We’re in the middle of a 
                        catastrophe and you’re texting!

           Regan goes over to join them.

                                 GENA (CONT’D)
                             (to Housekeeping Lady)
                        Please!  Isn’t there anything you 
                        can do?

                                 HOUSEKEEPING LADY
                        This is Housekeeping.  Not Project 
                        Runway.  You need a tailor.  And 
                        tailors don’t work in the middle of 
                        the night.  But if you bring it 
                        back first thing in the morning I 
                        can clean it for you.

                                 REGAN
                        Clean it?  It doesn’t need to be--

           Regan looks down and sees:  BLOOD STAINS on the bodice of the 
           torn dress.  She frantically looks at Gena.

                                 REGAN (CONT’D)
                        Oh my god!?  Who’s bleeding?

                                 GENA
                        Who’s bleeding?

           We pan over to reveal Katie with a bloody nose.  She brings 
           her hand to her face.

                                 KATIE
                        Fuck!  It’s me!  I’m bleeding!  
                        Bleeding over here!
           EXT.  TIMES SQUARE.  NIGHT.

           Bright lights.  Car horns.  Animated billboards.  Clyde is 
           hanging out of the sunroof of a limousine.  Arms in the air.

                                 CLYDE
                        Who wants to sex Mutombo!?!

           INT.  LIMOUSINE.  NIGHT.

           Plush leather.  Mood lighting.  Mini-bar tumblers and bottles 
           jingling.  Joe is trying to pull Clyde back into the limo. 
           Jeff is laughing at Joe and Clyde.  Cal is sulking.

                                 JOE
                        Clyde!  That is how people get 
                        their heads torn off.

           Clyde gets back into the car.  He takes a photo of Joe with 
           his digital camera.  Joe is momentarily blinded.  Clyde wags 
           his finger at Joe ala Mutombo.

                                 JEFF
                        You are such a downer, Joe.

                                 JOE
                        I’m sorry!  I don’t want break 
                        traffic safety laws on our way to a 
                        night of objectifying women.

           Jeff groans and makes a jerking off motion with his hand.

                                 CLYDE
                        What are you worried about?  
                        Getting detention from the hall 
                        monitor?

           Jeff checks his phone.  A text from REGAN.  It reads: “Nose-
           deep in pussy yet?”  He smiles and starts texting back.

                                 JOE
                        I mean this isn’t like a “movie 
                        strip club”.  Salma Hayek isn’t 
                        gonna be there.  This is Caesarian 
                        scars and gonorrhea lurking on 
                        every surface.  In every thread of 
                        furniture.

                                 CLYDE
                             (making a sad face)
                        Oh Joey!  We can huddle together 
                        for protection.  It’ll be just like 
                        high school.
                                 CAL
                        I agree with Joe, guys.  I didn’t 
                        want to do this tonight.

                                 JEFF
                        I will not let you kill fun during 
                        your bachelor party.

                                 CAL
                        This isn’t fun.  In fact, I’m 
                        having negative fun.

                                 JEFF
                        It’s not like you’re cheating.

                                 CAL
                        Yes.  It is actually.

                                 JEFF
                        How do you figure?

                                 CAL
                        You don’t get it.  When you meet 
                        the right girl, you don’t do 
                        anything that’ll screw it up.  My 
                        douchebag days are over.

                                 CLYDE
                        I met the right girl, dude.  
                        Perfect for me.  Gorgeous.  Funny.  
                        Totally insane.  And I screwed it 
                        up.  I screwed it up big time.

                                 JOE
                             (concurring)
                        Yeah.  You were pretty douche-
                        tastic to Gena.

                                 CAL
                        Well, why didn’t you do something 
                        about it?  Like apologize?

                             (enigmatic smirk)
                        Never got the chance.

           Clyde takes a photo of himself making the enigmatic smirk.  
           He looks at the photo on the display screen.

           INT.  CVS.  NIGHT.

           Florescent.  Gena and Katie are rifling through sewing 
           materials located across from the tabloids.  Katie has two 
           bits of kleenex up her bloody nose.  Gena is rebraiding her 
           hair.  The wedding dress stuffed into her overnight bag.  

                                 GENA
                        I am such a screw-up, man.  We 
                        gotta lay off the coke.  After 
                        tonight, no more fucking coke.  
                        This is one of those, like, moments 
                        of clarity.  You would tell me if I 
                        needed to lay off the coke, right?

           Katie picks out a sewing kit and shows it to Gena.

                                 KATIE
                        I think we should get the one with

                        hours and then sew for five hours.  
                        Plus I bet we could find a tailor 
                        before the ceremony.

           Katie is leafing through an US Weekly.

                        There’s a diner around the corner.

           Gena grabs several sewing kits.  All three girls make their

           Katie’s ankle gives way.  It’s one of those nasty twists you 
           see runway models suffer on ANTM.  CRACK!  She bites it.  The 
           entire store turns to see.  Regan and Gena goes to help her.  
           Katie is paralyzed with laughter and pain.

           purple velvet.  Armchairs and ashtrays.  The strippers are 
           dancing and slinking around the place.  Cal, Jeff and Clyde 
           are chilling in arm chairs.  Smoking cigars.  A BUBBLY 
           STRIPPER approaches them.

           Bubbly Stripper looks at Clyde.  He shakes his head “no.”  
           She storms off and almost knocks over Joe who joins them, 
           looking nervous.  He sits next to them.

           Another stripper, who is definitely on drugs, approaches Joe.  
           She leans over him.

                        Well, I’d rather take my chances 
                        with a psycho than a wasted 
                        stripper.

                                 CLYDE
                        Wasted strippers are a liability.  
                        Bad for business.  Good for me.

           CLOSE ON Wasted Stripper still giving Clyde the look.

           EXT.  SCORES STRIP CLUB.  NIGHT.

           Men are hanging around on the street.  Some drunk.  Some just 
           shady.  All of them are intrigued by the sight of the SCORES 
           BOUNCER, a hulking guy of 40, trying to keep Gena, Regan and 
           Katie from entering the club.  The wedding dress has been 
           stuffed into Gena’s overnight bag.

                                 SCORES BOUNCER
                        Come on, ladies.  You know the 
                        rules.

                                 KATIE
                        Rules!?  We don’t live by rules!

                        I don’t munch carpet?

                        Take it down the street.

           Brief pause.  Regan narrows her eyes.

                                 REGAN
                        Did you... did you just call us 
                        prostitutes?

                                 SCORES BOUNCER
                        Down the street.

                        I GOT A SCHOLARSHIP TO PRINCETON!

           Cal bursts out of the club and sees all three girls.  He 
           immediately turns around and tries to re-enter the club.  
           Katie saw him.
                                 KATIE
                        Cal!  Cal!  Tell this guy who we 
                        are.  Help!

           Cal reluctantly turns back around.  Gena tries to hide the 
           wedding dress by lowering her bag into the street.  The bag 
           lands in a puddle.  Cal addresses the bouncer.

                                 CAL
                        It’s okay.  They’re with me.
                             (to the girls)
                        Just don’t tell Becky I was here.

                                 REGAN
                             (flirting)
                        Secret’s safe with us.

                                 CAL
                        What happened?  Did you get in a 
                        fight?

           Katie pulls the bloody kleenex out of her nostrils and tries 
           to stand up straight.

                                 KATIE
                        We had an accident.

           Regan discreetly elbows Katie.  Cal notices Gena struggling 
           with the bag.

                                 CAL
                        Do you need help?

           Gena decides that the best thing is to rush past him into the 
           club.  She shouts at him on her way in.

                                 GENA
                        What is with the misogyny tonight?

                        also own property and vote.  Does 
                        that piss you off?

           Regan and Katie follow her into the club.  Cal looks 
           perplexed but relieved to be out of there.

           INT.  SCORES STRIP CLUB.  NIGHT.

           The three girls enter the club.  Music thumping.  Strobe 
           lights in their faces.  Tits everywhere.  Girls stare for a 
           moment.

                                 GENA
                        Kind of a let down.

                        I’m getting a distinct whiff of bar 
                        mitzvah from this place.

                                 KATIE
                        What’s with these lights?  It’s a 
                        good thing I’m not epileptic.

                        dress.  If I don’t come back in 
                        five minutes--

           Regan is already on her way over to Jeff and Joe, dragging 
           Katie with her.

                        --make sure you claim my body.

           Gena watches them go.  At the same moment, Gena sees the 
           Wasted Stripper leading Clyde into the champagne room.  Clyde 
           has a doofy smile on his face.

           CLOSE ON.  Gena is pissed.  Pulls her hair out of a braid.  A 
           small clump of hair comes out with the elastic band.  Gena 
           doesn’t notice this.

           INT.  SCORES STRIP CLUB.  CHAMPAGNE ROOM.  NIGHT.

           The champagne room is all black leather and mirrors.  
           Strippers have found their own corners with their clientele.

           In a particularly dark corner, is Clyde.  He’s making out 
           with the Wasted Stripper who is now topless.  She pulls a 
           vial of cocaine out of her panties.

                                 CLYDE
                        Where did that come from?

                        Is it Christmas?

           Wasted Stripper gets on her knees and out of the shot.  Clyde 
           stealthily pulls out his digital camera to take of photo of 
           what she’s about to do.

           INT.  SCORES STRIP CLUB.  WOMEN’S BATHROOM.  NIGHT.

           Scuffed walls.  Kicked-in stall doors.  A broken mirror.  
           Half-naked strippers check their make-up.  Pee with the door 
           open.  Sniff lines of cocaine.  

           Gena is holding the wedding dress under the hand-dryer trying 
           to dry out a wet spot caused by the street puddle.  She’s 
           frustrated and angry.  She’s making little progress and slaps 
           her hand to her forehead.

           A Cool Stripper (mid 30s), with angel wings tattooed on her 
           shoulder blades, enters.  Her hands are dirty and she goes to 
           wash them off.  She notices Gena.

           The Cool Stripper starts rinsing God-Knows-What off her

                        Believe me, honey.  He probably 
                        feels just as insecure as you do 
                        right now.  Men deal with it 
                        differently.  They want to feel 
                        powerful for a couple hours.  Women 
                        cry about it in the bathroom.

           The Smoking Hot Stripper straddles Regan with a reverse 
           cowgirl.  Regan tries to move but the Smoking Hot Stripper 
           keeps her from getting up by sitting on her lap.  She gives 
           Regan a lap dance during the following.

                        Truman inherited the presidency 
                        after Roosevelt died.  He went to 
                        Potsdam to deal with Stalin and

                        He was completely inexperienced so 
                        I can see how you could make the 
                        analogy in that sense.  

                                 JOE
                        The Geneva conferences are 
                        something else all together.

                                 REGAN
                        I switched it cuz I’m a little 
                        drunk.

                                 SMOKING HOT STRIPPER
                        Yeah but it still wouldn't make 
                        sense because Truman had a trump 
                        card at Potsdam.  He had the atomic 
                        bomb.  So he was really in control 
                        the whole time.

                                 REGAN

                             (smiling)
                        Feels great.

           Gena enters, carrying her bag stuffed with the wedding dress.

                                 GENA
                        You totally ripped Becky’s wedding 
                        dress on purpose.

           Regan, Jeff, Joe and the Smoking Hot Stripper all turn to 
           look at Gena.  Regan gets up and ushers Gena away from the 
           others.

                                 REGAN
                        Could you step into my office 
                        please?  

           We follow them as they make their way to the stage away from 
           Jeff and Joe.

                        I don’t know if you noticed but I 
                        am kind of the middle of some 
                        really intense “Bound”-type shit 
                        right now.

                        Why did you come to this wedding?  

                                 REGAN
                        Why does anyone do anything?  You 
                        came to see Clyde.  Katie came to 
                        get wasted.  

           They sit down at the edge of the stage with Katie and watch 
           the stripper perform her pole routine.

                                 GENA
                        But you specifically weaseled your 
                        way into becoming Maid of Honor 
                        when, let’s just put it out there, 
                        you were NEVER friends with Becky 
                        Archer.

                                 REGAN

                        Are you trying to ruin her wedding?

           Katie, unsuccessfully, attempts to get the stripper’s 
           attention.

                                 KATIE
                             (to the stripper)
                        What is the name of your pedicure 
                        color?  I need it in my life.

                                 REGAN
                        Give me one good reason why I would 
                        try to ruin Becky Archer’s wedding.

                        You’re an insecure, passive-

                        Character assassination.  Not 
                        really a motive.

                        You’re jealous!  If she walks down 
                        that aisle tomorrow with no dress, 
                        she’ll look like the asshole.  
                        Otherwise, you’d be the asshole who 
                        can’t get her loser boyfriend to 
                        show up let alone marry her.
           Regan is stung by this and glances down at her partially-
           chewed manicure.  Katie perks up to join the conversation.

                        First of all, Becky will have no 
                        problem looking like an asshole 
                        because she’s gross.  Secondly, if 
                        I wanted to ruin someone’s wedding, 
                        there isn’t a fucking thing you 
                        could do about it.

                                 GENA
                        I could tell Becky you wanted to 
                        burn her dress in effigy.

                                 REGAN
                        And I’ll tell her you trashed it.

                                 GENA
                        She won’t believe you.

                                 REGAN
                        Really?  Cause who’s the real 
                        friend?  Me, who planned her 
                        wedding?  Or you, the cokehead who 
                        hit her up for a ride to an 
                        abortion?

           This upsets Gena.  Obviously.

                        It’s nothing to be ashamed of.  I 
                        don’t know why you told Becky not 
                        to tell anyone.

                                 GENA
                        Maybe because I only wanted my real 
                        friend to know.
           She storms off.  Katie and Regan watch her go. 

                                 KATIE
                        I can’t believe she had an abortion 
                        without us.

           INT.  SCORES STRIP CLUB.  CHAMPAGNE ROOM.  NIGHT.

           Clyde leaning his head back.  Enjoying himself.  The song 
           ends.  Wasted Stripper pops up and is all business.

                        There’s an ATM outside.

           Wasted Stripper takes Clyde by the arm and stands him up.  
           BAM!  A door flings open and Gena bursts into the champagne 
           room with Becky’s wedding dress spilling out of her bag.  
           Everyone turns to look.

           Clyde zips up his pants and starts to leave.  Wasted Stripper 
           elbows him in the face.

           tries to lie down.

                                 REGAN
                        Alright.  Okay.  You gonna puke?
                                 JEFF
                        Jesus.

                                 REGAN
                        No sleeping, Katie!  Walk with me.

           They walk down the block away from the guys.  Jeff turns to 
           Joe sternly.

                                 JEFF
                        Why don’t you take her back to the 
                        hotel?  And you know... smoke 
                        another bowl or something.  And 
                        then slip it in there.

                                 JOE
                        Slip it in there?!  Look what 
                        happened to her after one bowl.  
                        She’s about to pass out.

                                 JEFF
                        I’ll slip it in there.  You want 
                        Regan instead?

                                 JOE
                        No.  I don’t.

                                 JEFF
                        I don’t blame you.  Katie’s hotter.

                                 JOE
                             (mystified)
                        Who are you?

                                                                CUT TO:

           Katie and Regan are around the corner.  Graffiti-ed wall and 
           dumpster overflowing with garbage.

                                 KATIE
                        What is this?  National Date Rape 
                        Day?  I am not getting in a limo 
                        with a potential serial killer.

                                 REGAN
                        He’s not a serial killer.  We went 
                        to high school with him.

                                 KATIE
                        Even more of a reason not to do it.  
                        This could be a total Trenchcoat 
                        Mafia.  The reunion tour!  Ow!
           Katie hops to stay off her ankle.

                                 REGAN
                        You shouldn’t even be on this leg.  
                        Here.

           Regan reaches into her purse and gives Katie a prescription 
           bottle of pills.  She also hands her a room key (plastic 
           card).  Katie shakes the pill bottle.

                                 KATIE
                        The Freshmaker!

                                 REGAN
                        It’ll help with the pain.  Take 
                        some and you’ll feel better.  
                        Here’s the room key.  Go back to 
                        the hotel with Joe.  And leave me 
                        alone.

                                 KATIE
                             (desperately)
                        But I want to have fun!

                                 REGAN
                        Let’s see.  What did you do 
                        tonight?  You went to a strip club.  
                        Rode in a limo.  You bled from the 
                        nose and possibly broke a major 
                        bone.  If that’s not fun, then 
                        Cyndi Lauper can bite me.

           EXT.  SPANISH HARLEM APARTMENT.  NIGHT.

           CLOSE ON Gena and Clyde staring up at something like little 
           kids.  Clyde has a decent-looking black eye developing where 
           the stripper elbowed him.

           REVERSE ANGLE on the door of an apartment.  Along with the 
           apartment number, there’s a quaint little sign that reads: 
           JESUS SAVES.

           Gena and Clyde are standing in hallway of the apartment 
           building.  Gena rebraids her hair.  Clyde cracks his 
           knuckles.

                                 CLYDE
                        Hold on to your butts.

           He rings a loud doorbell.  We hear cats meowing.
                                 CLYDE (CONT’D)
                        I can’t believe we’re going to do 
                        this.

                                 GENA
                        I can’t believe I gave all my coke 
                        to your stripper.

                                 CLYDE
                        Do me a favor and don’t mention 
                        that during the recap of the 
                        evening.

                                 GENA
                        It’s my favorite part though!

           The door to the apartment opens.  An OLDER WOMAN (mid-60s) 
           stands before them with coke-bottle glasses and a pink 
           bathrobe.  She peers at them.

                                 OLDER WOMAN
                        Clyde?

                                 CLYDE
                        Hey Mom.

           This is SHEILA, Clyde’s mother.  Tough but sweet.  

                                 SHEILA
                        I thought you were at a wedding.  
                        Is everything alright?

                                 CLYDE
                        Everything’s fine.  You remember--

                                 SHEILA
                        Gena?

                                 GENA
                        Hey Sheila.

                                 SHEILA
                        Oh my god.  I never would’ve 
                        recognized you.

                                 GENA
                        Yeah.  Nobody does.

                                 CLYDE
                        We need your help.

           Gena reaches into her overnight bag and pulls out the wedding 
           dress.  It resembles a dead body at this point.
                                 SHEILA
                        Oh my Lord.

                                 CLYDE
                        Don’t ask.  It’s too long of a 
                        story.  Without much of a pay-off.

                                 GENA
                        What do you think?

                                 SHEILA
                        I’ve seen worse.  When do you need 
                        it?  

                                 CLYDE
                        In five hours.

                                 SHEILA
                        Then it’s a miracle you need not 
                        me. 

                                 GENA
                        Please, Sheila.  You made costumes 
                        for every play we did in high 
                        school.  You made my prom dress 
                        from scratch!

                                 SHEILA
                        Mmm.  I loved that dress.

                                 GENA
                        Please.  It only has to be worn 
                        once.  Tomorrow morning.

           Sheila is skeptical.  Especially of Gena.  However, Clyde’s 
           puppy dog face makes her melt a bit.

                                 SHEILA
                        Come on in.  Clyde, can you make us 
                        some coffee and food?
                             (to Gena)
                        I’ll get you some pants.

           INT.  LIMOUSINE.  NIGHT.

           Joe is smoking a bowl with his seat belt on.  Katie lying on 
           the floor of the limo trying to drink a bottle of whatever 
           the limo-mini-bar was stocked with.  Joe is attempting to be 
           jovial.  Katie is almost incoherent.

                                 JOE
                        You’ll choke if you drink that 
                        lying down.
                                 KATIE
                        Like Jimi Hendrix!  If Jimi Hendrix 
                        meant it, he would’ve killed 
                        himself.  Not going out by 
                        accident.  I mean, put the barrel 
                        of shotgun in his mouth, looked at 
                        picture of his baby girl and BAM! 
                        Pull the trigger. 

                                 JOE
                        Kurt Cobain.

                                 KATIE
                        Jimi Hendrix wishes he was Kurt 
                        Cobain.  I loved Kurt Cobain.  When 
                        he died, I refused to go to school 
                        for weeks!

                                 JOE
                        Wow.

                                 KATIE
                        Wow what!?

                                 JOE
                        I just didn’t realize you were 
                        so... into that kind of stuff.  In 
                        high school, you always seemed so 
                        happy.

                                 KATIE
                        Let’s make a promise.  Right now.  
                        A promise to each other.

           She sticks out her pinky finger.  Joe locks his pinky with 
           hers.  He looks at her nose very closely.

                                 KATIE (CONT’D)
                        We don’t talk about who we were in 
                        high school for the rest of the 
                        night.  Ok?

                                 JOE
                        Ok.  Did you get punched in the 
                        nose?

                                 KATIE
                        Yes.  By life.  Now let’s get lit.

           Joe obliges by giving her the bowl.  She smokes it.  He grabs 
           the alcohol from her and takes a manly swig.
           INT.  SOCIALISTA.  NIGHT.

           Carol Reed/Casablanca-type Cubana aesthetic with the whirring 
           fans and the wood-shuttered windows.  Goldfrapp song 
           thumping.  Regan and Jeff are stirring and sipping cocktails.

                                 REGAN
                        Becky and I went to high school 
                        together so... You know... when 
                        you’re that age... that’s when it 
                        happens.  When you start to hate 
                        yourself.

                                 JEFF
                        You hate yourself?

                                 REGAN
                        You wouldn’t understand because 
                        you’re a guy.

                                 JEFF
                        I think you’re unhappy and you have 
                        no reason to be and that makes you 
                        hate yourself.

                                 REGAN
                        Ha!  Let me guess.  Psych major.  
                        Psych major with a lucrative 
                        advertising job.

                                 JEFF
                        That’s right.  Belittle me.  Does 
                        that work on your boyfriend?

                                 REGAN
                        Not really.

                                 JEFF
                        Girls like you bring up this whole 
                        emotional “I-hate-myself” bullshit 
                        so guys like me will tell you 
                        you’re beautiful and successful and 
                        what you’re doing with the retarded 
                        kids is awesome.

                                 REGAN
                        They have cancer.

                                 JEFF
                        But that’s not me.  I’m not gonna 
                        do that.  I like to compliment a 
                        woman because she deserves it.  Not 
                        because she needs attention.
                                 REGAN
                        I don’t need attention.  I have a 
                        boyfriend.  I get plenty of 
                        attention.

                                 JEFF
                        So why are you here?  Why aren’t 
                        you with him tonight?

                                 REGAN
                        It’s none of your business and I 
                        don’t care what you think anyway.

                                 JEFF
                        Right.  That’s why you’re so calm 
                        and unaffected by me.

           Regan sulks.  She’s genuinely hurt.  She downs the rest of 
           her cocktail.  She signals for another round to a passing 
           waiter.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Oh.  Now you’re mad.  You’re so mad 
                        you can barely restrain yourself.

                                 REGAN
                        I’m not mad!

                                 JEFF
                        Great.  I’m glad you’re in such a 
                        good mood.

           Regan starts biting her nails.

           INT.  SPANISH HARLEM APARTMENT.  KITCHEN.  NIGHT.

           Cozy kitchen.  Handmade oven-mitts.  Spice rack.  “Bless the 
           Mess” sign.  Clyde is making chocolate chip pancakes.  Gena 
           is leaning against the counter with her cell phone to her 
           ear.  She is now wearing mom pants under her dress/T-shirt.

                                 GENA
                        Are you seriously making pancakes?

                                 CLYDE
                        I am.  And yours has a sad-face 
                        made out of chocolate chips.  
                        Because you’re grumpy!  Why are you 
                        on the phone at 2 in the am?

                                 GENA
                        I’m conducting some business.
           Clyde takes a photo of the pancake.

                                 CLYDE
                        I’m tagging you in that photo on 
                        Facebook.

                                 GENA
                        Do you stalk me online?

                                 CLYDE
                        Yes I do.

                                 GENA
                        No way!  Do you Google me?

                                 CLYDE
                        Once.  Sometimes.  Probably twice a 
                        month.  Weekly.

                                 GENA
                        Pervert.

                                 CLYDE
                        At least I don’t drink and text.

                                 GENA
                        I do not drunk text you.

                                 CLYDE
                        Oh please.  Who else at 5am my time 
                        would text me: “I want your sweet 
                        sweet teenage balls in my mouth.”

                                 GENA
                        I never texted you that!

                                 CLYDE
                        Who are you trying to call?

                                 GENA
                        My friend’s dealer.  I gotta see if 
                        he can hook me up.  There’s no way 
                        I’m gonna make it through any of 
                        this without--

           Clyde grabs her cellphone and throws it out the window.  Gena 
           is shocked.

                                 GENA (CONT’D)
                        You maniac!  Why did you do that!?

                                 CLYDE
                        It’s an intervention.
                                 GENA
                        Ugh!  Ah!  I feel like someone just 
                        cut my hand off.

           Gena starts to leave to retrieve her phone.  Clyde stops her, 
           planting her back where she was standing.  He leans in close 
           to her.  He pulls the elastic band off her braid.  A small 
           amount of hair clings to it.  He shows it to her.

                                 CLYDE
                             (dead serious)
                        It’s not cute anymore, Gena.

           Gena grabs it from him, horrified.  Clyde slides her pancake 
           onto a plate.  Gena looks down at a dilapidated chocolate-
           chip frowny face.

           INT.  CENTRAL PARK HOTEL.  31ST FLOOR HALLWAY.  NIGHT.

           Deep forest greens and a brightly patterned carpet.  Exotic 
           plants.  Katie and Joe come around a corner laughing and 
           STONED.  They look at the numbers on the rooms.  He’s holding 
           her bag of peas swathed in ace bandage like it’s a purse.

                                 JOE
                        Which room number is it again?

           Katie arbitrarily picks a large door.  She fumbles with her 
           room key (plastic card) and waves it in front of an 
           electronic pad.  It clicks and the door is unlocked.  Katie 
           squeals with glee.

                                 KATIE
                        In here!  Joe!  Here!

           She grabs a distracted Joe and they both practically fall 
           into...

           INT. CENTRAL PARK HOTEL.  SWIMMING POOL. NIGHT.

           The huge swimming pool glistens eerily illuminated by 
           underwater lights.  One side of the pool is lined with lounge 
           chairs and fancy towels and bathrobes.  On the other side, an 
           entire glass wall overlooking Central Park.

           Joe momentarily forgets Katie in favor of the view.  He lets 
           go of her and wanders over to the windows.  Behind him Katie 
           is stripping off her dress.  
                                 JOE
                        It’s moments like these when I 
                        think... my parents have no idea 
                        where I am.

           Katie’s down to her bra and panties.  She dives into the 
           pool.  Joe whirls around.

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        Katie!?!

           Katie resurfaces, looking refreshed.

                                 KATIE
                        Come in the pool!

                                 JOE
                        I don’t think we’re allowed to.

                                 KATIE
                        Don’t be a pussy!!

           Katie grabs him by the ankles.  He loses his balance and 
           falls into the pool.

                                                                CUT TO:

           In the pool.  

           Joe is now in his underwear.  Katie and he are in just 
           shallow enough water that they can keep their heads above 
           water by standing on their tip-toes and pushing off the 
           bottom every once in awhile.  The pool reflects light on 
           their faces.

                                 KATIE (CONT’D)
                        What do you do again?

                                 JOE
                        I’m a programmer.  An avid Rubyist.  
                        And Ruby is... Basically I speak 
                        the language of the machines.  What 
                        do you do?

                                 KATIE
                        Nothing cool like that.  I don’t do 
                        anything with my life.

                                 JOE
                        You must do something every day.

                                 KATIE
                        I drink a lot.
                                 JOE
                        That’s cool.  I smoke a lot of pot.

                                 KATIE
                        I like it when I can’t bring the 
                        bottle to my mouth to anymore.

                                 JOE
                        I can respect that.

                                 KATIE
                        You’re just being nice.

                                 JOE
                        No, I get it.  One time I passed 
                        out on the toilet in my own shit.

                                 KATIE
                        I woke up naked next to a hamburger 
                        once.  I was like “I just fucked a 
                        hamburger!”

                                 JOE
                        I was tripping on acid and I 
                        thought I was Satan so I lit my 
                        friend’s couch on fire.

                                 KATIE
                        I tried to cut my wrists open with 
                        a broken bottle.

                                 JOE
                        Tonight?

                                 KATIE
                        No.  Like a year ago.

           She shows him some scars on her wrists.  Faint but brutal.

                                 JOE
                        Of course not tonight.

                                 KATIE
                        I’m sorry.  I shouldn’t have told 
                        you that.  Now you don’t like me.

                                 JOE
                        No!  It’s cool.  I like you.

                                 KATIE
                        Now you don’t think I’m pretty.
                                 JOE
                        Katie, you’re the most beautiful 
                        girl I’ve ever seen.

           He’s waited a long time to say that.  Katie looks so happy 
           she might burst into tears.  

           She kisses him deeply.  They make out.  The Brain and the 
           Princess.  Fuck yeah.  Anthony Michael Hall cheers somewhere.

           EXT.  SOCIALISTA.  NIGHT.

           Graffiti-ed wall.  Dumpster overflowing with garbage.  Jeff 
           and Regan are smoking cigarettes.  Regan is completely drunk 
           and attempting to dial a number on her cell phone.

                                 JEFF
                        You look beautiful right now.

                                 REGAN
                        I thought you didn’t give 
                        compliments.

                                 JEFF
                        I said I only give them when I 
                        genuinely mean them.

                                 REGAN
                        Oh.  And I suppose this-

           She gestures to Jeff’s entire persona.

                                 REGAN (CONT’D)
                        -is genuine.

                                 JEFF
                        Only strippers for you then.  Huh?

                                 REGAN
                        Give me a break.

                                 JEFF
                        I think she pinned you better than 
                        I ever could.

           Jeff leans into her so her back is against the wall.

                                 REGAN
                        You seem to be doing a fine job of 
                        pinning me.

                                 JEFF
                        You like being wrong.
                                 REGAN
                        Don’t pretend you know me just 
                        because you bought me a lap dance.

           He slides his hand between her thighs and starts to feel her.

                                 JEFF
                        You like that.

           Regan reacts subtly to what he’s doing so as not to arouse 
           the suspicions of people waiting online to get into the club.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        You want someone to tell you that 
                        you’re wrong?  That you’re not as 
                        smart as you pretend you are.  You 
                        only act like a bitch because your 
                        idiot boyfriend lets you.  You want 
                        someone to put you in your place?

                                 REGAN
                        Where’s that?

                                 JEFF
                        Where do you want it?

                                 REGAN
                             (whispering)
                        I can’t have sex with you.

                                 JEFF
                        We don’t have to have sex.  I’m not 
                        that guy.  I just want to touch 
                        you.  I want to feel that.  Right 
                        there.  

           Regan reacts verbally to his hand between her legs.  Her eyes 
           roll back in her head and she drops her cigarette.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        That’s beautiful.

           Regan pulls away from him.

                                 REGAN
                        I have to make a phone call.

           As she’s walking away, she bites most of her nail off.  Spits 
           it on the ground.
           INT.  SPANISH HARLEM APARTMENT.  CLYDE’S ROOM.  NIGHT.

           Clyde’s bedroom is a time capsule.  A teenage boy lived here 
           from 1992-1998 and it shows.  Phish poster.  Lava lamp.  Some 
           cool stuff too.  LP collection.  Turntable and tape deck.  
           Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action figures.  Rocksteady and

           CLOSE ON.  Gena’s phone among the grass and garbage.  It 
           reads: REGAN on the display.  The phone goes silent and dark.  
           It lights up and starts ringing again.  REGAN.
           INT.  CENTRAL PARK HOTEL.  SWIMMING POOL.  NIGHT.

           CLOSE ON Joe and Katie’s clothing. 

           We pan up to Katie and Joe making out hard-core on a rickety 
           pool-side chair.  What do you know... Joe actually has a nice 
           body.  He’s REALLY uncomfortable in this chair.  Katie 
           doesn’t care and puts her hand in his underwear.  He pulls 
           away from her.

                                 JOE
                        Wow.  OK.  I need to breathe.

                                 KATIE
                        What’s wrong?

                                 JOE
                        Let’s just... Would it be okay if 
                        we maybe did this another night?

                                 KATIE
                        What?  Why?

                                 JOE
                        My dick is really cold right now.

                                 KATIE
                        I’ll kiss it.

           She starts to get on her knees.  Joe stops her and pulls her 
           up.  Joe sits her squarely across from him on another chair.  
           Katie does her best to look coquette-ish.

                                 JOE
                        Let’s just go to the suite and 
                        order room service.  Or something.

                                 KATIE
                        Why don’t you want to have sex?

                                 KATIE
                        But I want it like this.

           She lunges at him and tries to kiss him again.  He pushes her 
           away more forcefully.  Katie is miffed.

                                 KATIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh come on!  What?  You want it to 
                        be all romantic and shit.  Let’s 
                        just fuck!
           She goes for him again but Joe pushes her away.  He grabs his 
           pants and starts putting them on.  Clumsily.  They are still 
           wet.

                                 KATIE (CONT’D)

                        again.

                        not every guy wants to screw a

                        You heard me.

                                 JOE
                        Without your entourage of lemmings, 
                        you’re a just pretty girl with no

                        anything!  You just stood on the

                        It’s the same shit.  But instead of 
                        French homework, it’s my dick.  

                                 KATIE
                        That’s not true.  French was 
                        actually hard.
           He doesn’t bother to put his shirt on.  He just picks it up 
           and storms out.

                                 KATIE (CONT’D)
                        Joe.  I’m sorry!

           He slams the door.  Katie sits alone as the slam echoes.

           INT. SPANISH HARLEM APARTMENT.  CLYDE’S ROOM.  NIGHT.

           Gena is staring at the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action 
           figures.  Clyde is looking through the closet which is 
           overflowing with relics from his childhood and teenage years.

           She turns around and looks at him.  Clyde is holding up a 
           cassette tape triumphantly.

                        Sit down.

           He puts the tape in the tape deck.  The tape is labeled: 
           TALENT SHOW ‘94.  Clyde sits on the bed next to Gena.  

           “500 Miles” by the Proclaimers comes on.  Both Clyde and Gena 
           react in their own small way to this song.  They have a short 
           Benjamin/Elaine type moment when each are happily reminiscent 
           at the same moment the other is depressed.

           He tries to hug her.  She pushes his hands away with violent 
           slaps.  He pins her wrists down to her sides and kisses her.

           He kisses her again.  They are entangled.  Gena is a 
           vulnerable mess of the tough chick we’ve seen thus far.  She 
           starts choking on her words with the disappointment of a 
           decade of dead-end relationships.

           She is kissing him back.  Hungrily.  They tear at each other.  
           Some amazing amazing make-up sex is about to happen here.

                                                                CUT TO:

           NIGHT.

           Into this marble sanctum wanders a depressed half-dressed 
           Katie.  She goes over to the tub full of champagne bottles.  
           She pops open a bottle.  Foam all over her.  She sits on the 
           toilet and rubs her swollen ankle.

           She reaches into her purse and pulls out the prescription 
           bottle Regan gave her.  She starts to count out some pills 
           but loses track and drunkenly swallows all of them (5 or 6 
           pills).  She washes them down with Cristal.  She catches her 
           reflection in the mirror.  Her nostrils are caked in blood.  
           She examines herself.
                                 KATIE
                        You’re still pretty.  You are still 
                        very pretty.

           She stands up.  All the blood rushes to her head.

           INT. CENTRAL PARK.  EARLY MORNING.

           The next morning.  Around 6am.  Assorted scenes of Central 
           Park.  The sun is barely up.  The sky is a canary yellow 
           behind the drab grey and battered buildings.  The lush green 
           of Central Park does its best to glisten.

           One scene focuses on the rose-lined trellis we saw at the 
           beginning of the film.  It looks promising.  People are 
           already there setting up chairs for the ceremony.

           INT.  CENTRAL PARK HOTEL.  PENTHOUSE SUITE.  MASTER BEDROOM.  
           MORNING.

           SFX.  LOUD phone ringing.

           Crumpled sheets.  A very hung-over and naked Regan pops up 
           out of the sea of comforter.  It takes her a second to 
           realize where is she and where the awful sound is coming 
           from.  She picks up the phone on the bedside table.

                                 REGAN
                        Jesus!
           She hangs up the phone.  Next to her is Jeff, in his 
           underwear.  He yawns/groans.

                                 JEFF
                        Five more minutes.

           Regan grabs the sheet and pulls hard.  This causes Jeff to 
           fall onto the floor.  She wraps the sheet around her.

                                 REGAN
                        Wedding, Jeff.  Wedding!

           Jeff gropes around looking for his clothing.  He finds some 
           pants.  Regan grabs her cell phone.  Dials.

                                 JEFF
                        Did we...

                                 REGAN
                        Did we what?  Mess around until you 
                        passed out on my clit?  Yes.  We 
                        totally did.

                                 JEFF
                        I didn’t have any condoms anyway.

                                 REGAN
                        You were gonna try to nail me 
                        without a condom?

                                 JEFF
                        Why?  Would you have done it?

                                 REGAN
                             (into her phone)
                        Gena!  It’s me!  You’ve got to call 
                        me back and let me know everything 
                        is okay with Becky’s dress.

           She runs into...

           INT.  CENTRAL PARK HOTEL.  PENTHOUSE SUITE.  MASTER BATHROOM.  
           MORNING.

           Regan stops dead in her tracks.  On the floor, is Katie.  
           Exactly how we left her.  Face down.  In a puddle of 
           champagne.  Regan stares at her in horror.

                                 REGAN
                             (into her phone)
                        Gena.  Call me back.  Code Red.

           Regan hangs up.  Jeff comes up to her from behind.
                                 JEFF
                        What happened to the dress?

           He sees Katie.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Holy Hendrix.

           INT. SPANISH HARLEM APARTMENT.  CLYDE’S ROOM.  EARLY MORNING.

           An equally hung-over Gena wakes up like Uma Thurman popping 
           up from a shot of adrenaline.  It takes her a second to 
           realize that she is naked and next to Clyde.  She looks at 
           the clock on his bedside table.  It reads: 6:15am.

                                 GENA
                        Becky.

           She climbs over Clyde and throws her clothes on.

           INT. SPANISH HARLEM APARTMENT. LIVING ROOM.  EARLY MORNING.

           There are two pin-cushion mannequins stabbed with sewing 
           needles.  There’s a separate table with just a sewing 
           machine. 

           Gena enters and runs over to the sewing machine and finds the 
           wedding dress which has been mended but isn’t perfect.  There 
           are still stains on it.  She is crestfallen.

           Clyde appears in his boxers.

                                 GENA
                        I’ve got to get this monstrosity 
                        back to the hotel.

                                 CLYDE
                        Is it fixed?

                                 GENA
                        As fixed as it’s gonna be.

                                 CLYDE
                        I’ll get dressed.

                                 GENA
                        Don’t bother.  I’ll see you there.

           She grabs the dress and bolts for the door.  Clyde gets in 
           her way.
                                 CLYDE
                        I want to do this with you.

                        You think just because we slept 
                        together now everything’s okay?  
                        You can’t just fuck things into 
                        being better.

                                 CLYDE
                        What is your problem?!  

                                 GENA
                        My PROBLEM is that I made one 
                        mistake.  A mistake that I let turn 
                        the rest of my life into a shit-
                        storm.  Today I get to take full 
                        responsibility for fucking up.  
                        It’s probably exactly what I need.

                                 CLYDE
                        Why can’t I help you with this?

                                 GENA
                        Because you were that mistake, 
                        Clyde.

           She exits the apartment.  Clyde is powerless to stop her.

           INT.  CENTRAL PARK HOTEL.  PENTHOUSE SUITE.  MASTER BATHROOM.  
           DAY.

           Regan trying to revive Katie.  She shakes her hard.

                                 REGAN
                        You stupid drunk!  Wake up!

           Regan grabs hold of Katie by her armpits and drags her 
           into...

           INT.  CENTRAL PARK HOTEL.  PENTHOUSE SUITE.  MASTER BEDROOM.  
           DAY.

           Regan tosses Katie onto the bed face up.  Katie slides off 
           the bed a little.  Regan repositions her so she’s firmly 
           planted on the bed.

           She runs into...
           INT.  CENTRAL PARK HOTEL.  PENTHOUSE SUITE.  MASTER BEDROOM 
           CLOSET.  DAY.

           Blackness.  Light switch on.  Huge walk-in closet.  Regan’s 
           pressed butter yellow dress hangs on a fabric hanger.

           Regan appears.  She grabs it off the hanger and slips it over 
           her.  Dropping the bedsheet simultaneously.  Bam.  She’s 
           dressed for the wedding.

           INT.  CENTRAL PARK HOTEL.  PENTHOUSE SUITE.  DAY.

           Sliding across the floor in heels, Regan reaches behind the 
           couch to grab Katie’s suitcase, opens it.  Inside is another 
           butter yellow dress in a plastic garment bag.

                                 REGAN
                        Thank god, you fucking JAP.

           She lifts the garment bag out of Katie’s suitcase.  The dress 
           is unwrinkled.

                                 REGAN (CONT’D)
                        How’s the coffee coming?!

           INT.  CENTRAL PARK HOTEL.  PENTHOUSE SUITE.  KITCHEN.  DAY.

           A small but sleek room of heavy metal cupboards and drawers.  
           Stove.  Oven.  Refrigerator.  It’s so monochromatic and clean 
           that it’s like being inside a silver Death Cube.

           Shirtless Jeff is holding his pants around his waist.  An 
           espresso machine is humming with purpose.  A mug is set next 
           to it.

                                 JEFF
                        Almost ready!

           SFX.  Doorbell of the suite.

           Jeff is petrified.

           INT.  CENTRAL PARK HOTEL.  PENTHOUSE SUITE.  DAY.

           Regan is equally petrified.  She musters up her courage and 
           opens the door.  It’s Joe, in his tuxedo and looking 
           miserable.

                                 JOE
                        Hey.  Is Katie here?  I just wanted 
                        to apologize for--
           Regan grabs him by the shoulders and pulls him into the room.

           INT.  TAXI.  DAY.

           Gena is sitting in the back of a speeding cab.  She is 
           furiously using Shout Wipes to get rid of the stains on the 
           wedding dress.  She looks up.

                        aneurysm?!

                                 CAB DRIVER
                        There is no need to yell, miss.

                        take 5th Avenue!

           Cab Driver takes a sharp turn to exit off the FDR tossing 
           Gena across the cab.

           INT.  CENTRAL PARK HOTEL.  PENTHOUSE SUITE.  MASTER BEDROOM.  
           DAY.

           Joe is holding Katie, who looks like a corpse.  Regan starts 
           undressing her.

                                 REGAN
                             (to Katie)
                        Come on, honey.  Get up.  Wedding!

           She gets Katie’s dress off.  Katie, once again, is in her bra 
           and panties.  Regan tries to put Katie’s dress over Katie’s 
           head.

                                 JOE
                        I’m not sure she’s breathing.  I’m 
                        gonna call 911.

                                 REGAN
                        Shut up and help me get her into 
                        her bridesmaid dress.

           Jeff enters holding a cup of coffee.  He stares at Katie’s 
           smoking hot body.

                                 REGAN (CONT’D)
                        Jeff!
                                 JEFF
                        What’s up?

                                 JOE
                        Jeff, you should call Cal.

                                 JEFF
                        Shouldn’t we give her the coffee 
                        first?

                                 REGAN
                        Becky’s gonna be here soon.  If we 
                        look ready-- Oh my god!  The 
                        wedding dress.

           Regan absentmindedly lets go of Katie to grab her cell phone.  
           Katie’s body starts to head to the floor.  Joe catches her 
           just in time.  Jeff goes to hold her as well and balances the 
           coffee cup with his other hand.

                                 JOE
                        God.  She is out!  We should get 
                        Cal.  Or call an ambulance.

           Regan’s got her cell to her ear.

                                 REGAN
                        She doesn’t need an ambulance.  
                        Katie’s always like this.  She’ll 
                        get up in a second.
                             (into her cell)
                        Gena, code red!  Code Red!  I need 
                        Becky’s dress stat!

                        Regan.

           Everyone looks up.  Joe in his tuxedo.  A half-naked, dead-
           drunk Katie in the arms of a half-naked Jeff.  Regan with her 
           cell, looking terrified.

           REVERSE ANGLE.  Becky.  In jeans.  Cheeks pink with anger.

                        Where’s my fucking dress?

           INT.  SPANISH HARLEM APARTMENT.  CLYDE’S ROOM.  DAY.

           Sun pouring into the tiny bedroom makes it feel a little less 
           nostalgic than it did last night.  More like a garage sale.  
           Unmade bed.  Clyde sits on it, moping.  He’s leafing through 
           the photo album.  Sheila enters with mugs of coffee.
                                 SHEILA
                        You’re gonna be late for the 
                        wedding.  

                                 CLYDE
                        Mom, can’t you see I’m in the 
                        middle of feeling sorry for myself?    

                                 SHEILA
                        Gena left in a hurry.  Always did 
                        though after sleep-overs.  Such a 
                        strange girl.  I did my best with 
                        the wedding gown.  Not quite her 
                        prom dress.  That was my favorite 
                        piece I ever worked on.

           A wave of inspiration washes over Clyde.  He flips feverishly 
           to a page in the photo album.  He shows a photo to Sheila.  
           We cannot see it.  

                                 CLYDE
                        Mom?  Do you still have this dress?  
                        The dress Gena wore to prom?

                                 SHEILA
                        Of course, I still have it.  Why?

           Clyde’s mouth breaks into a Cheshire grin.

           INT.  CENTRAL PARK HOTEL.  HALLWAY.  DAY.

           SFX.  Elevator Ding.

           Gena comes tearing out of the elevator.  She flies down the 
           hallway holding the wedding dress behind her like an errant 
           kite.  She arrives at the penthouse.  The door is open.

           INT.  CENTRAL PARK HOTEL.  PENTHOUSE SUITE.  DAY.

           The room is eerily still.  Broken glass crunches under Gena’s 
           heels.  She hears Jeff’s voice.

                                 JEFF (O.S.)
                        Left, right, left, right.

           Gena goes into...
           INT. CENTRAL PARK HOTEL.  PENTHOUSE SUITE.  MASTER BEDROOM.  
           DAY.

           Becky is standing there waiting for her.  Regan, arms 
           crossed, is sitting on the bed, slouching and glaring at 
           Gena.  

                                 BECKY
                        Gena, you ripped my dress?

                                 GENA
                        I fixed it.

           Gena hands Becky the mangled wedding dress.  Becky inspects 
           it for a moment.

                                 BECKY
                        I’m getting married in 45 minutes.  
                        And my wedding dress has been... 
                        stitched together with pipe 
                        cleaners?

                                 GENA
                        OK.  I know what you’re going to 
                        say so I’ll just say it.  I’m a

                        member of society.  It’s, like, 
                        I’ve spent the last decade at a 
                        concert, right?  And I’ve just been 
                        sort of awkwardly swaying back and 
                        forth.  If someone passed me 
                        something, I smoked it or drank it.  
                        Who cares, right?  But it’s, like, 
                        at some point in the last 24 hours 
                        I suddenly realized that the music 
                        at this concert sucks, right?  I 
                        don’t even like this band.  I don’t 
                        know what I’m saying.
                             (Takes a deep breath)
                        You were a really good friend to 
                        me.  When no one wanted to be my 
                        friend.  And I’ve been a really 
                        REALLY bad friend to you.

           Gena gulps down her pride ready to hear whatever it is Becky 
           has to say.  But...

                                 JEFF (O.S.)
                        Oh god!  Can we save the self-
                        actualization speech for later and 
                        get some help over here?

           Gena looks into...
           INT.  CENTRAL PARK HOTEL.  PENTHOUSE SUITE.  MASTER BATHROOM.  
           DAY.

           Katie, still in her bra and panties, is being supported by 
           Jeff and Joe.  They are trying to get her walking.  Gena goes 
           to Katie immediately.  Regan and Becky follow.  Everyone is 
           crowded into the marble sanctum.

                                 GENA
                        What the fuck is going on?  

                                 BECKY
                        I want an actual explanation, Gena.

                                 GENA
                        Join the club!

                                 JEFF
                        We were trying to get her walking.

                                 GENA
                             (barking at Jeff)
                        Get some water, toolbag!!!

                                 BECKY
                        I knew you would do something like 
                        this, Gena!  As soon as I saw you 
                        come to my rehearsal dinner looking 
                        like an extra from “Trainspotting”!

           Jeff runs to the sink and starts filling a tumbler.  Gena 
           tries to revive Katie by slapping her hard across the face. 

                                 GENA
                        Katie!  Time to get up!
                             (to Joe)
                        How long has she been like this?

                                 JOE
                        I don’t know she was fine when I 
                        was with her last night.

                                 GENA
                        REGAN!  YOU CANNOT LEAVE KATIE 
                        ALONE WITH GUYS!

                                 REGAN
                        Don’t try to avoid dealing with the 
                        fact that you just ruined Becky’s 
                        wedding.

           Jeff hands Gena the glass of water.  Gena pours it very 
           slowly onto Katie’s chest while shaking her.  Everyone stares 
           for a moment.  Katie’s lips are blue.
                                 JOE
                        Does this work usually?

                                 GENA
                        She must’ve taken something.

                                 JEFF
                        I’m gonna go get Cal.

           Jeff exits before anyone can stop him.

                                 REGAN
                        Why are we getting Cal when Katie 
                        is always like this!?  We should be 
                        on our way to the service.

                                 GENA
                             (to Joe)
                        What’d you give her?

                                 JOE
                        Nothing!  We smoked pot.  Drank.

                                 GENA
                        Regan, what did you give her?

                                 REGAN
                        Don’t blame me for your mess!  
                        Katie pulls a Sylvia Plath every 
                        six months.  

                                 BECKY
                        And she just happens to do it on 
                        the morning I’m getting married?  
                        Do you think I’m an idiot!?

                                 GENA
                        OK!  Your fucking Maid of Honor 
                        here wanted to set your dress ON 
                        FIRE!!  I tried to stop her.  And… 
                        in the process… it got a little 
                        ripped.

                                 BECKY
                        Is that true, Regan!?

                                 REGAN
                        Of course not.

           Gena storms into the bedroom.  Becky confronts Regan.

                                 BECKY
                        Regan, did you try to burn my 
                        dress?
                                 REGAN
                        I was joking around!  Gena’s the 
                        one who ripped it!

                                 GENA (O.S.)
                        Fucking call 911!

                                 JOE
                        Someone please hold her so I can!

                                 BECKY
                             (to Regan)
                        Why in the world would you do 
                        something so reckless and stupid?

           Gena’s back with Regan’s purse.  She pours all of its 
           contents onto the bathroom floor.  There are a good five to 
           six prescription pill bottles.

                                 REGAN
                        That’s my stuff, bitch!

                                 GENA
                        Which one?  Xanax.  Codine.  
                        Vicodin.  Which one did you give 
                        her?

           Regan gets on her hands and knees to pick up the pill 
           bottles.  Gena grabs Katie from Joe, who exits the bathroom.

           INT.  CENTRAL PARK HOTEL.  PENTHOUSE SUITE.  MORNING.

           Joe sprints into the living room.  He goes to a fancy rotary 
           phone but knocks it on the floor.  

                                 BECKY (O.S.)
                        Is it even legal to have all that?

                                 GENA (O.S.)
                        Cancer patients, my ass.

           He picks it up the phone, untangles the cord, gets a dial 
           tone and dials 911.  A no-nonsense operator picks up.

                                 OPERATOR (V.O.)
                        911.  What’s your emergency?

                                 JOE
                        There’s a girl.  And she’s not 
                        waking up.  I think she’s been 
                        drugged.
           INT.  CENTRAL PARK HOTEL.  PENTHOUSE SUITE.  MASTER BATHROOM.  
           MORNING.

           Regan is still trying to pick up her pills.  Regan seethes 
           with frustration.  Every last bit of perfection has been 
           drained from her persona.  She scraps at the bottles like 
           they hold the key to her unraveling self-worth.  Gena is 
           struggling to support a rag-doll Katie by herself. 

                                 BECKY
                        If she took something tell her so 
                        they can tell the medics!

                                 REGAN
                             (broken)
                        I don’t know!  Okay!?  I don’t know 
                        which one I gave her!  I was 
                        wasted!

           Becky grabs Katie from Gena and supports her.  Gena, 
           empowered by Regan’s admission of guilt, goes to get more 
           water and pours it on Katie’s chest.  

           Becky and Gena are working together again for the first time 
           in ten years.  They seem to have a similar rhythm as they try 
           to wake Katie.

                                 GENA
                        This what happens when you ask a 
                        walking pharmacy to be your Maid of 
                        Honor!

                                 BECKY
                        Please!  She’s so anal I knew she’d 
                        take care of every detail of this 
                        stupid wedding.  And besides my 
                        ideal choice wasn’t available.

                                 GENA
                        And who was ideal?!  Sarah Palin!?

                                 BECKY
                        It was you, you idiot!  You’re the 
                        one who should be there with me 
                        today!  We were best friends.  We 
                        promised to be in each other’s 
                        weddings.  Then you snorted half 
                        your body away and became a cyborg 
                        and stopped talking to me.  At 
                        least Regan answers my phone calls!

           With Becky supporting Katie alone, Gena is filled with a 
           determination that would shake the gates of hell.  
           She turns on the faucet of hot water and runs her index and 
           middle fingers under it.

                                 GENA
                        I’m not a cyborg and I didn’t call 
                        you back because--

                                 BECKY
                        Because I’M FAT!  Right?  That’s my 
                        BIG problem!  At least I don’t 
                        treat my body like a toilet.  Why 
                        would I want to look like you when 
                        you’re a shitty friend?

                                 GENA
                        I can be a good friend, Becky!

                                 BECKY
                        Then start acting like one!

           Gena grabs Katie with her non-wet hand.  Swings Katie around 
           almost knocking Becky over.

           Gena and Katie both land on their knees in front of the 
           toilet.  Gena, like a seasoned bulimic, sticks her finger 
           down Katie’s throat.  Without flinching.

           Becky and Regan cringe.  Katie starts squirming and choking.  
           She grips the toilet with her hands.

                                 GENA
                        Hold her down.

           Becky runs over and braces Katie’s body.  Katie makes an 
           awful wrenching sound.  Regan can hardly move.  She gapes at 
           Katie twitching and lurching.

           INT.  CENTRAL PARK HOTEL.  PENTHOUSE SUITE.  MORNING.

           A few minutes later.  Loud vomiting sounds.  A stunned Regan 
           exits the bathroom to see Jeff and Cal.  Joe with the phone 
           to his ear.  They heard everything.

                                 JOE
                             (into the phone)
                        She’s okay.  Yeah.  She just woke 
                        up.  Yeah.  It was touch and go--

           Joe wraps up his 911 call and hangs up.  Cal exits into the 
           bathroom.

                                 JEFF
                        She okay?
                                 REGAN
                        She’ll live.

           INT.  CENTRAL PARK HOTEL.  PENTHOUSE SUITE.  MASTER BATHROOM.  
           DAY.

           Becky is sitting on the edge of the tub, exhausted.  Gena is 
           administering sips of water to a woozy but revived Katie, who 
           resembles a sick toddler at this point.  Cal enters, looking 
           concerned.

                                 CAL
                        Becky-

                                 BECKY
                        Cal, can we get married now?

                                 CAL
                        Wait.  Remember what you asked me 
                        when I proposed?

                                 BECKY
                        I don’t want to talk about it.

                                 CAL
                        What did you ask?

                                 BECKY
                        I said:  “Why me?”

                                 CAL
                        What you said in here this morning. 
                        What you did.  That’s why you.

           Becky kisses him.  

           CLOSE ON.  Gena’s reaction.  She wants that kind of 
           relationship.  The severity melts from her face and she 
           softens watching Becky and Cal’s romantic moment.

           Katie starts vomiting into the toilet again.  Gena snaps out 
           of her dreamy stare and holds Katie’s hair back.  Becky and 
           Cal separate and start to leave for the service.

                        My dress is ruined.

                        I would marry you in a garbage bag.

                        You might have to.
           Clyde comes running into the bathroom.  He’s out of breath 
           and carrying a garment bag.

                                 CLYDE
                        BY THE POWER OF GREYSKULL!  I HAVE 
                        THE POWER!!!

           He strikes a He-Man pose.  He holds up the garment bag 
           proudly in one hand.  With his other hand, he takes a photo 
           of everyone with his digital camera.  FLASH!  Temporarily 
           blinding them.

                        Making memories!

           INT.  SPANISH HARLEM APARTMENT.  DAY.

           Sheila is cleaning up the mess of Becky’s wedding dress.  She 
           dumps it in a hamper.  The camera pushes in on Clyde’s photo 
           album resting next to the sewing machine.  It’s opened to a 
           page reading SENIOR PROM.

           CLOSE ON the photograph.  It’s Clyde and Gena’s prom photo.  
           They standing in front of the sky-blue backdrop.  Smiling 
           like idiots.  Gena is about the same size as Becky in a 
           beautiful handmade white prom dress.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT.  TENT.  DAY.

           An hour later.  Becky’s wedding.  Gorgeous weather.  Grass 
           and white canvas.  

           Becky stands in front of a stand-up full-length mirror.  
           She’s is wearing Gena’s prom dress.  She looks beautiful.  
           It’s fabulous.  The style is back in fashion and has a hint 
           of John Hughes.  There are flowers in her hair.  She looks 
           much more at ease in this dress than she ever would be in the 
           stifling Vera Wang number.  No offense, Vera.

           Gena is standing close behind her looking beautiful but 
           jittery in her butter yellow bridesmaid dress.

                                 GENA
                        Sorry your service was delayed due 
                        to a near death experience. 
                                 BECKY
                        At least we made it here.  Better 
                        late than never.

           Becky turns to the mirror to put on her veil.  Gena takes it 
           from her and helps pin it to her hair.  Becky smiles at her 
           in their reflections.

                                 BECKY (CONT’D)
                        How long have you been sober now?

                                 GENA
                        About six hours.  Which is a record 
                        for me.

           With veil in place, Becky turns to her.

                                 BECKY
                        Gena, I’m glad you showed up.

                                 GENA
                        You showed up for me awhile back.  
                        I’m glad I could finally return the 
                        favor.  Let’s go so I can throw 
                        some rice at you and get this shit 
                        over with.

           They hug.  Then they line up to exit the tent and walk down 
           the aisle.  Gena hands Becky her bouquet.

           SFX. “Here Comes the Bride” by a string quartet strikes up.

           EXT.  CENTRAL PARK.  DAY.

           Hundreds of people in folding chairs turn to look at Becky.  
           They all look happy and excited to see her.  Sea of love.  
           Most of all, Cal stands under the trellis beaming with pride.  

           Gena is walking down the aisle.  She is the Maid of Honor.  
           After a few paces, Becky follows behind her.  

           Katie and Regan,in their bridesmaids dresses, stand to the 
           right of a PREACHER.  Katie looks a little rough but, God 
           bless her, she’s got a smile on her face.  Regan has tears in 
           her eyes.

           Jeff, Clyde and Joe stand to left of Cal in tuxedos.  They 
           all look great as they watch Becky come down the aisle.  

           CLOSE ON.  Clyde smiles at Gena with his black eye.
           Gena rolls her eyes.  She takes her place next to Katie and 
           Regan.  Becky meets Cal under the trellis.  She starts to 
           cry.  So does Cal.

                                 PREACHER
                        Dearly beloved--

           INT.  CENTRAL PARK HOTEL.  BANQUET HALL.  DAY.

           A few hours later.  Creams and silvers.  Flowers bursting 
           from every crevice.  Long tables with magnificent place 
           settings.  Caterers rushing back and forth from the kitchen.  
           Reception is under way.  Big band playing.  Guests dancing.  
           Eating cake.  Drinking wine.

           CLOSE ON. Cal and Becky dancing and blissfully ignoring 
           everyone around them.

           CLOSE ON.  Joe and Katie.  Joe eating cake and Katie, who is 
           exhausted, is sipping Perrier.

                                 JOE
                        Are you sure you’re okay?  Cuz I 
                        could give you my room key and you 
                        could lie down for a little bit if 
                        you’re not feeling up to all this.

                                 KATIE
                        I really like you a lot, Joe.

                                 JOE
                        OK.

                                 KATIE
                        I don’t know what to do when I like 
                        someone a lot.  Besides sleep with 
                        them.

           Katie is staring at him hopelessly.  Joe gathers up some 
           confidence.

                                 JOE
                        You can be nice.  Be nice to me and 
                        let me be nice to you.  That’s what 
                        you do when you like someone.

                                 KATIE
                        OK.  Thanks for letting me copy 
                        your homework.

                                 JOE
                        You’re welcome.  Thanks for not 
                        dying.
           CLOSE ON.  Regan and Jeff dancing.  Jeff steps on her foot.  
           Regan winces.

                                 JEFF
                        So I was thinking.  There’s a deli 
                        across the street I could run over 
                        there, get some condoms... There 
                        are three places I’ve always wanted 
                        to have sex.  A cab, Central Park 
                        and a deli bathroom.  All of them 
                        are walking distance from here.

           Over Jeff’s shoulder, Regan sees FRANK, her boyfriend, wander 
           into the banquet hall.  He’s in a tuxedo.  Regan immediately 
           leaves Jeff and runs over to him.  Frank sees her coming and 
           starts apologizing for his tuxedo.

                                 FRANK
                        I know what you’re gonna say but 
                        the tux rental place wasn’t open so 
                        I had to go bargain basement.

           Regan throws her arms around him.  He’s shocked.  She’s 
           starts crying.  Hard.  Like a little girl.

                                 REGAN
                             (between sobs)
                        I’m so sorry, Frank.

                                 FRANK
                        Why?  Did you sleep with someone?

                                 REGAN
                        No.  But I almost did because I was 
                        mad at you and I was drunk and then 
                        I almost killed somebody.  And they 
                        wouldn’t let me be the Maid of 
                        Honor.

                                 FRANK
                        What did I say, baby?  What’d I say 
                        about weddings?

                                 REGAN
                        Lay off the sauce.  Don’t bring the 
                        meds.

                                 FRANK
                        That’s right.  This is why you need 
                        Papa Bear to come with you to these 
                        things.

                                 REGAN
                        Yes!
                                 FRANK
                        Fair enough.

           He kisses her.

                                                                CUT TO:

           The band.  Which isn’t playing at the moment.  Clyde is 
           talking to the guitarist.  He gives him some sort of fist tap 
           thing.  The drummer cracks a drum roll.  Clyde grabs the 
           microphone.  He has a drink in his hand.  A little drunk.

                                 CLYDE
                        Hey!  HELLO!  Hot mic.  OK.  Becky 
                        and Cal.  Congratulations.  
                        Seriously beautiful F-ing wedding.

           Applause.  The guitarist starts a familiar hook.

                                 CLYDE (CONT’D)
                        Cal you said something to me last 
                        night.  You said that when you meet 
                        the right girl you don’t do 
                        anything to screw it up.

           The hook is “500 Miles” by the Proclaimers. 

                                 CLYDE (CONT’D)
                        But sometimes I think you have to 
                        screw up to realize you’ve met the 
                        right girl.  The good news is it’s 
                        a shitload of fun trying to win her 
                        back.  So Gena--

           People react to this and stare at Gena, who is blushing.

                                 CLYDE (CONT’D)
                        I just want you to know... That 
                        after everything that’s happened...
                             (singing)
                        When I wake up, well, I know I’m 
                        gonna be, I’m gonna be the man who 
                        wakes up next to you.

           The entire band starts playing.  Clyde continues singing.  
           The guests are so pumped by this throwback that anyone who 
           wasn’t dancing starts.

           CLOSE ON.  Becky and Cal dancing and singing along.

           CLOSE ON.  Frank and Regan slow dancing like teenagers.

           CLOSE ON.  Katie and Joe dancing.  Katie swaying softly.  Joe 
           jumping around like a spaz.  Katie loves him.
           CLOSE ON.  Jeff flirting with Stefanie (Cal’s Younger 
           Sister).  Stefanie is into it.

           Clyde takes the mic off the stand and jumps into the crowd.  
           He finds Gena.  He does some knock-off “Benny & Joon” move.  
           He coaxes her into dancing and singing along with him.  She 
           does so.  A bit reluctantly.  Then enthusiastically.  Gena 
           and Clyde kiss and the camera pulls back.

           The entire reception is having a blast.  It sort of looks 
           like, well, a prom.  A kick-ass prom.  With better skin.

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK HOTEL.  DAY.

           Classy awnings hang over the glass revolving doors and the 
           gilded steps of the hotel.  A gigantic fountain across the 
           street.  Horse-drawn carriages wait to drive tourists through 
           Central Park.

           A crowd of unmarried female wedding guests stand on the steps 
           of the hotel ushering Becky and Cal into a limo.  Becky turns 
           to the other girls and holding her bouquet in the air.

                                 BECKY
                        Ready, girls?!

           The girls shriek with glee, jumping up and down ready to 
           catch her bouquet.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Across the street, Gena, Regan and Katie are sitting on the 
           edge of the fountain.  Gena’s smoking a cigarette and pulling 
           her hair back into a pony-tail.  Regan, teary-eyed and 
           emotional, is chewing on her decimated manicure.  Katie has 
           taken one of her heels off and is massaging her swollen 
           ankle.  They all sip Perrier from a shared bottle.

                        If you guys wanted to make a play 
                        for the bouquet, I’ve got a sock 
                        full of quarters I could take it to 
                        a bitch’s knee.

                                 KATIE
                        No thanks.  

                                 REGAN
                        Yeah.  I think we’ve had enough 
                        hair-pulling and cat-fights to last 
                        us a whole year.
           CLOSE ON.  Becky tossing her bouquet into the air.  It flies 
           into the arms of Stefanie, Cal’s younger sister.

           BACK ON.  Our girls.  Regan is now full-on crying.

                                 KATIE
                             (to Regan)

                        Considering that shit officially 
                        went down.

                                 KATIE
                        Pigface married a rich guy.  Frank 
                        showed up.

                                 REGAN
                        Joe turned out to be cool.  And you 
                        and Clyde are gonna get back 
                        together now right?

                        I don’t know.  I got a lot of stuff 
                        to work out.  And I gotta do it 
                        without any... distractions.

           There’s a pause.  All three girls let the events of the 
           previous evening play across their faces.  They are exhausted 
           and defeated.
                                 KATIE
                        We’re gonna be okay, right?

                        What do you mean?

                                 KATIE
                        I don’t think I can survive another 
                        night like that.

                                 REGAN
                        Me neither.

                                 GENA
                        As long as we get help, we’ll be 
                        fine.

                                 REGAN
                        Where do we get help?

                                 GENA
                        I don’t know.  I was gonna start by 
                        asking these two self-absorbed but 
                        really attractive bitches I know.

           Regan and Katie laugh.  Gena holds up the Perrier bottle.   
           In lieu of glasses, Regan holds up her cell phone and Katie 
           raises her high heel into the air.  

                                 GENA (CONT’D)
                        To never doing any of that ever 
                        again!

           The three girls push the bottle, cell phone and high heel 
           together like toasting champagne flutes.

                                                               FADE TO:

           TITLE CARD: ONE YEAR LATER.

           INT. NEWARK AIRPORT.  DAY.

           Passengers file out of the gate.  Announcements over the PA.  
           Among the passengers is Gena.  She looks much healthier than 
           the last time we saw her.  Her clothes, bag, sunglasses are 
           slightly more expensive.  Her hair is shorter and a much more 
           natural blonde.  She looks around.  She smiles.

           INT.  NEWARK AIRPORT.  BAGGAGE CLAIM.  DAY.

           Among the limo drivers is Regan, who looks softer and much 
           more approachable.  Her clothing is relaxed but stylish.  
           She’s holding a sign that reads: GENA MYERS.  Gena walks into 
           the shot.  

                                 REGAN
                        How was rehab?

                                 GENA
                        Kind of like Disneyland without the 
                        rides.  How’s couples therapy?

                                 REGAN
                        I’m slightly less co-dependent 
                        since you last saw me.

                                 GENA
                        You look normal now.  That’s a 
                        compliment.

                                 REGAN
                        You look good, Genny.

           They hug.  A long hug.  They walk to...

           EXT.  JFK.  DAY.

           People push past Regan and Gena with luggage.  Small children 
           run in front of them.  Suits hail cabs.

                                 REGAN
                        You ready to do this again.

                                 GENA
                        One more time from the top!

                                 REGAN
                        With feeling!  I cannot believe 
                        Katie is marrying Joe.

                                 GENA
                        She’s gonna be Mrs. The Guy Who 
                        Smoked Us Out During Free Period.

                                 REGAN
                        Don’t get me started.  I’m supposed 
                        to release all negativity into the 
                        universe.

                                 GENA
                        That sounds exhausting.  You know, 
                        I was surprised when you offered to 
                        pick me up since you don’t own a 
                        car.
                                 REGAN
                        I found someone willing to drive us 
                        to the nuptials.

           Regan points.  Gena looks up and sees Clyde leaning against 
           his car.  Gena smiles.  When she reaches the car, she puts 
           her things down.  Regan loads them into the trunk.

                                 CLYDE
                        You still want that ride?

                        I made a great “Joe Marries the 
                        Prom Queen” mix.

           They kiss.

                                 REGAN
                        Keep the sucking face to a minimum.  
                        We gotta get going.  The rehearsal 
                        dinner starts in two hours.

                                 GENA
                        Has Regan been keeping you busy?

                                 CLYDE
                        Yep.  She made me buy adult diapers 
                        so we can drive without stopping.

           The car’s loaded up and they are ready to go.  Clyde gets 
           into the driver seat.

                                 GENA
                        One quick question.  What are we 
                        doing for the bachelorette party?

           Regan makes a face at Gena.

                                 REGAN
                        Did you just fart?

                                 GENA
                        Why?  Can you smell it?

                                 REGAN
                        Get in the fucking car.

           THE END.
