           A NOTE TO THE READER:

           Two years ago, I received a phone call from a famous A-
           list movie star I’d developed a close relationship with 
           (he’s asked to remain anonymous here).  I remember the 
           call as if it was yesterday:

           “I just heard the most fucking incredible story ever,” he 
           said.  Then he swore me to secrecy and told me it.

           It was a story that had been circulating around the upper 
           echelon of Hollywood for months, spoken about only when 
           drinks were flowing at high stakes poker games amongst 
           movie stars and studio heads.  Thirty minutes later, I’d 
           been rendered silent on the other end of the line.

           “And this really happened?” I asked.

           Despite his assurances that it had, I dismissed it with a 
           laugh.  It was too far-fetched.  Too... ridiculous.  I 
           promised (as he had) never to share the story with anyone 
           and hung up.

           That night, I didn’t sleep.  Without knowing it, I’d just 
           found my next project.

           I spent the better part of the next year tracking down 
           paper thin leads and traveling to Washington D.C. and
           Europe.  Eventually, I’d managed to validate the story 
           (always off-the-record). 

           Exactly one year after that fateful phone call... I found 
           myself at breakfast with the two key players in an 
           unbelievable tale of espionage and heroism: 

           Gary Coleman and Emmanuel Lewis.

           This is the story of how, in the late summer of 2006, 
           Gary Coleman and Emmanuel Lewis saved the United States 
           of America from a devastating attack by international 
           terrorists.

           Whether you believe it or not... it is a true story.
           EXT. JINKY’S CAFE (STUDIO CITY, CA) - MORNING

           A slick BMW pulls up, parks. A pair of small, well-heeled 
           FEET drop from the car.  We pull up and REVEAL:

           EMMANUEL LEWIS.  Yes, that Emmanuel Lewis.  He of Webster
           fame. He’s got a newspaper under his arm, a smile on his 
           face, and life by the balls. 

           He really does.  Dude looks good.  Still has the sweet 
           face we remember.  Sure, he’s put on a little weight, but 
           haven’t we all?  He wears a purple dress shirt, fitted, 
           tucked into pair of tailored dress pants.  Impeccable 
           haircut.  With a skip in his step he ENTERS...

           INT. JINKY’S CAFE - CONTINUOUS

           A HOSTESS greets him.

                                 HOSTESS
                        Morning, Manny.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        What’s cookin’, good-lookin’? My table 
                        ready?

                                 HOSTESS
                        Always.

           Emmanuel WINKS at her, walks past a PATRON.

                                 PATRON
                        How’s it hangin’, Manny?

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Long and straight, Jimbo.

           Emmanuel lets out a loud, infectious LAUGH.  It’s a laugh 
           that says, “Yeah, I’m Emmanuel Lewis and I’m laughing my 
           ass off, what are you gonna do about it?”

           Emmanuel sits at his table.  A COUPLE (30’s) approach.

                                 WOMAN
                        Mr. Lewis?  Could we trouble you for a 
                        picture?

                                 MAN  
                        We both grew up watching your show.
                                 EMMANUEL
                        Of course, of course.  

           The couple scoot in, hand a WAITRESS the camera.  

                                 EMMANUEL (CONT’D)
                        Everyone say Gorgonzola!

                                 EVERYONE
                        Gorgonzola!

           Emmanuel’s infectious LAUGH rings out again.  As the 
           camera FLASHES, we...

                                                           MATCH CUT TO:

           ANOTHER FLASH OF LIGHT.  

           This time a LIGHTBULB flickering on.  We’re in...

           INT. HOTEL ROOM (LOS ANGELES) - SAME MORNING

           We pull down from the light, as a pair of SLIPPERED FEET 
           drop to the floor and trudge to the bathroom.

           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The feet enter.  We hear running water.  A toothbrush 
           doing it’s job.  We pull back to REVEAL:

           GARY COLEMAN.  Yes, that Gary Coleman.  He of Different 
           Strokes fame.  Though he became famous as a kid, you’d 
           recognize him anywhere.  But there’s something sad in his 
           eyes.  There’s no infectious laughter here.  

           He spits out his mouth-full of toothpaste and rinses.  
           His looks in the mirror, staring straight ahead.  

           His expression never changes.

           EXT. HOTEL - VALET STAND

           Gary waits for his car, head down.  PEOPLE walk by.  
           Double-takes. GIGGLES.  We hear smatterings of “That’s 
           Gary Coleman” and “What’chu talkin’ ‘bout Willis?”

           Gary keeps his head down, obviously used to it. An AGING 
           FRATBOY (late 20’s) approaches.
                                 AGING FRATBOY
                        Yo, you’re Gary Coleman!  

           Gary doesn’t look up, gives the slightest of nods.

                                 AGING FRATBOY (CONT’D)
                        This is crazy!  My boys are gonna laugh 
                        their asses off!

           The guy holds out his cell, snapping a self-portrait.  

                                 AGING FRATBOY (CONT’D)
                        Dude, you gotta do it for me: give me a 
                        “What’chu talkin’ bout, Willis!?’

           Gary looks up, speaks for the first time.

                                 GARY
                        Go fuck yourself.

           Gary walks away as his RENTAL CAR pulls up.

           EXT. THE BOBBY WHITE AGENCY - DAY

           A small office just off Ventura and Van Nuys. A simple 
           sign reads: “The Bobby White Agency.”

           INT. THE BOBBY WHITE AGENCY - CONTINUOUS

           We pan a wall of framed photographs: A SWEET-FACED WHITE 
           GUY (BOBBY WHITE, 50’s) poses in each with a famous 
           80’s/90’s childhood television star: RICKY SCHROEDER, 
           PUNKY BREWSTER, ERKLE, THE ROBOT GIRL FROM SMALL WONDER.

           Underneath the wall, Bobby sits at his computer, 
           fidgeting nervously.  Gary Coleman ENTERS.  

                                 BOBBY
                        Hey!  Thanks for stopping by.

           Gary takes a seat, silent.  There’s no small-talk in him.

                                 BOBBY WHITE
                        How’d the shoot go last night?  

                                 GARY
                        Fine. 

                                 BOBBY WHITE
                        If that ad does well who knows, they 
                        might want more.
           Gary SHRUGS.  Bobby smiles.

                                 BOBBY WHITE (CONT’D)
                        I got you something.  Work.

                                 GARY
                        How much?

                                 BOBBY WHITE
                        Don’t you want to know what it is?

                                 GARY
                        No.  How Much?

           Bobby looks him over.  He really doesn’t care.  

                                 BOBBY WHITE
                        Fifty grand.

           This gets Gary’s attention.  He straightens up.

                                 GARY
                        Seriously?

                                 BOBBY WHITE
                        Seriously.

           Then it hits Gary...

                                 GARY
                        What is it, some reality show where they 
                        make fun of me?

                                 BOBBY WHITE 
                        No--

                                 GARY
                        Screw it, I’m in.

                                 BOBBY
                        No, Gary.  Jesus.  Listen to me. I get a 
                        call, ten o’clock last night.  Woman, 
                        heavy accent.  She asks if you’re 
                        available.  Figure they want you for a 
                        high school reunion or some shit. I say, 
                        “Yeah, he’s available, for the right 
                        price. Fact he’s in Los Angeles right 
                        now, just finishing a car ad.”   
                                (then, re: ad)
                        It went well, the shoot?  Cause if they 
                        like you, it could be steady work. The 
                        director was good?
                                 GARY
                        The used car ad director?  He’s the next 
                        Scorsese.  
                                (cuing him)
                        Fifty grand...?

                                 BOBBY
                        Get this.  There’s an area in 
                        Switzerland, bit outside Zurich, you ever 
                        been to Zurich?

           Beat.

                                 GARY
                        No.

                                 BOBBY
                        Anyway, Different Strokes just went 
                        syndicated there.  You believe that?  
                        Show’s been over for twenty years.  
                        Anyhow, it’s the number one show in half 
                        of Switzerland right now.  This bigshot
                        Swiss mucky-muck, he’s hosting a weekend 
                        for other Swiss mucky-mucks, wants you 
                        there.  Guest of honor.  Friday night at 
                        a nightclub, Saturday at his mansion.  
                        They fly you out first class, two nights 
                        of bullshit, fifty grand, in your pocket.  
                        Your flight leaves in two hours.

           Gary takes this in.

                                 GARY
                        This is for real?

           Bobby pulls out an already opened Fed-Ex envelope.

                                 BOBBY
                        Check for half came this morning.  It 
                        cleared.  Didn’t want to tell you until I 
                        knew it was legit.

           Gary looks at the check.  He looks up.  He’s not smiling, 
           but almost.  There’s something grateful in his eyes.

                                 GARY
                        Wow.  Thank you, Bobby.

           Bobby nods, hesitating.  Then...

                                 BOBBY
                        One catch.  There’s another hot show 
                        there now. They don’t only want you.
                                 GARY
                        Who do they want?

           As if on cue, we hear the infectious LAUGH of Emmanuel 
           Lewis.  Gary’s face drops as the door BURSTS open.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Bobby White!  What’s up, Brother-man!?  
                        You got something for me?

           Gary turns around.  Emmanuel sees him, stops short.

                                 EMMANUEL (CONT’D)
                        Oh.  Hey.

           Gary stands, approaches Emmanuel.  There’s tension here.  

                                 EMMANUEL (CONT’D)
                        Gary.  Long time.

           Gary shakes his hand.

                                 GARY
                        Emmanuel.

           Emmanuel turns towards Bobby, confused.

                                 BOBBY
                        Hear me out.

           EXT. BOBBY WHITE AGENCY - MINUTES LATER

           Emmanuel walks briskly to his car.  Bobby gives chase.

                                 EMMANUEL
                                (ranting)
                        Wasting my time coming down here, are you 
                        out of your freakin’ mind?

                                 BOBBY
                        It’s fifty grand!  For one weekend!

           Emmanuel stops at the door of his car, turns back.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        I’m don’t need it.  I was smart with my 
                        money.  My celebrity is in tact.    

                                 BOBBY
                                (desperate)
                        But you do these engagements all the 
                        time.  You love these kind of things.
                                      (MORE)
                                      BOBBY (CONT'D)
                                (then)
                        It’s him, isn’t it?  For God’s sake, it 
                        was 1984!

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Listen, what happened in ‘84 is his 
                        thing.  I got no beef with Gary Coleman.  
                                (lowering his voice)
                        But dude’s crazy. I’m boys with Todd 
                        Bridges.  He says dude’s crazy.  Todd 
                        Bridges!  He’s the only one from that 
                        show still alive!  That’s how crazy he 
                        is.  Ain’t no way I’m travelling halfway 
                        ‘round the world with him.  No way.

                                 BOBBY
                        Manny--

                                 EMMANUEL
                        I said no, Bobby.

           Bobby puts his hand on his shoulder.

                                 BOBBY
                        He’s in debt, Manny.  Serious debt.  He’s 
                        not a bad guy.  He just got a few bad 
                        breaks.  
                                (serious)
                        He needs this, Manny.  I’ve never asked 
                        you for anything but I’m asking now.

           ON EMMANUEL: a good guy, put to the test.

           INT. AIRPORT - LATER

           Gary and Emmanuel pull luggage on a MOVING WALKWAY.

           People going in the OTHER DIRECTION practically break 
           their necks gawking at them.  Some snap pictures.

           Emmanuel smiles for the photos.  

           Gary doesn’t.

           INT. AIRPLANE - LATER

           The guys sit in FIRST CLASS SEATS facing each other, as 
           you do on first class international seats.

           As PASSENGERS head past them, Gary stares straight ahead, 
           wearing large HEADPHONES.  Emmanuel BANTERS with them...
                                 EMMANUEL
                        Hey there/how ya’ doin’/yeah, happy to 
                        sign it/who I make that out to?

           Finally, everyone is past.  Emmanuel and Gary are alone.

                                 EMANUEL
                        So, how you been, Gary?  I’m good, I’m 
                        good.  Did the Surreal Life, Pretty good 
                        experience.  Corey Feldman’s a good dude.  
                        Last time we talked was... what--

                                 GARY
                                (coldy)

           Like that, Gary adjusts his headphones, closes his eyes, 
           and leans back in his seat.  Conversation over.  

           EXT. ZURICH AIRPORT - NEXT MORNING

           A 747 makes a perfect landing.

           INT. AIRPORT - LATER

           Gary and Emmanuel walk down through the airport, not 
           speaking.  Suddenly, they stop in their tracks.

           ON BAGGAGE CLAIM:

           Pandemonium.  The place is packed to the gills, and when 
           they see Gary and Emmanuel, everyone starts SCREAMING.  
           Flashbulbs.  Paparazzi.  Reporters.

           The Beetles have landed... in the form of Gary Coleman 
           and Emmanuel Lewis.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Holy crap.

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Velcom’ to Sveetzerland, Gentlemen.

           Before them stands the most exceptional FEMALE SPECIMEN 
           you’ve ever seen... nearly six feet of blonde-haired, 
           blue-eyed Goddess. She speaks English with a heavily 
           tinged Swiss accent.  

           Note to reader: Eet can be heerd to understoond thees
           accent buut once youu leern iit, iit iss not huurd to

                                 WOMAN
                        My name is Vilhelmina Oloffson.  

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Gezundeit.

           Emmanuel CRACKS HIMSELF UP.  Gary shakes his head.  She 
           smiles, not getting it.  Emmanuel tries again.

                                 EMMANUEL (CONT’D)
                        Emmanuel Lewis.

                                 VILHELMINA
                        Yes.  

           She turns to Gary.  He doesn’t speak.

                                 EMANUEL
                        This is Gary Coleman.

                                 VILHELMINA
                        Yes.  

           Awkward.

                                 EMANUEL
                        My friends call me Manny.

           She smiles weakly, not getting it.

                                 VILHELMINA
                        My friends call me Vilhelmina Oloffson.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Yes.

           Jesus.

                                 VILHELMINA
                        On the televeesion, you are not so eld.

                                 EMANUEL
                        The shows were filmed a long time ago.

           A confused beat.

                                 VILHELMINA
                        You are quite fat now, too?

                                 EMMANUEL
                        So it seems, yes.
                                 VILHELMINA
                        But still cute, as they say, as a 
                        butteen.

                                 EMMANUEL
                                (with a giggle)
                        Black don’t crack.  And you’re not bad 
                        yourself.

           They smile at each other.  Gary has had enough.

                                 GARY
                        Should we get going?

           Vilhelmina NODS, leads them through the throng of 
           SPECTATORS. 

           People SCREAM, FAINT, HOLD SIGNS (ie ”I want to marry 
           Gary”)  Ahead of them, large BODYGUARDS clear a path.

                                 VILHELMINA
                        Mr. Johansson ees very exceeted to meet 
                        you both.  He ees, how you say, your 
                        beegest fan.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Mr. Johansson is the one who flew us out?

                                 VILHELMINA
                        Yes.  Ludvig Johansson ees the reechest
                        man een all of Sveetzerland. Tonight, 
                        you will be guest of honor at his 
                        neetclub for his beerthday. Every 
                        important person in Sveetzerland will be 
                        ateending.  

           A SWISS WOMAN burst pasts the guards and throws herself 
           at Gary Coleman’s feet.  He just stares at her, confused.

                                 SWEDISH WOMAN
                        I love you Gareeee!  What’chu talkin’
                        bout’ Willeees!

           Without missing a beat, Vilhemina tosses her away like a 
           rag doll. She turns back to the guys, smiles casually.

                                 VILHELMINA
                        Mr. Johansson aweets. Let us go to the 
                        neetclub.

           Gary and Emmanuel share a look.
                                 EMMANUEL
                        To the neetclub.

           EXT. SWEDISH ROAD - LATER

           An enormous LIMO travels the windy roads.  The landscape 
           is iconically Swiss, snow-capped and mountainous.

           INT. LIMOSINE - CONTINUOUS

           Gary and Emmanuel sit side by side, Vilhelmina faces 
           them.  She can’t stop smiling, particularly at Emmanuel.

                                 VILHELMINA
                        May I ask you a queestion?

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Sure.

                                 VILHELMINA
                        On your show on the televeesion? The 
                        Weebster?

                                 EMMANUEL
                                (correcting)
                        Webster.

                                 VILHELMINA
                        Yes, Weebster. The white mummy, she’s 
                        veery neece woman, no?

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Uh... yes.

                                 VILHELMINA
                        A wonderful theeng she does, take een
                        small black child to her home.

           Emmanuel looks at Gary, confused.  Gary SHRUGS.  

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Yes, she’s a good lady.

           Vilhelmina shakes her head, awed.

                                 VILHELMINA
                        I could not do eet.

           Silence.
                                 VILHELMINA (CONT’D)
                        We arrive!

           INT. NEETCLUB - CONTINUOUS

           A thundering bi-level NIGHTCLUB.  Beautiful WOMEN dance 
           in cages.  Club music pumps.  And then...

           The MUSIC STOPS.  All attention shifts upwards as a 
           SPOTLIGHT shines on a red-velvet curtained BALCONY (there 
           is also a large monitor playing for the crowd).

           The curtain parts REVEALING:

           A HEAVYSET MAN in an ostentatious navy blue pin-striped 
           suit and matching fedora (surely we should be able to 
           land Phillip Seymour Hoffman for this).  

           This is LUDVIG JOHANSSON (40).  He grabs a mic and 
           addresses the crowd.  His English is less-accented than 
           Vilhelmina’s, but his “Swiss-lish” often misuses phrases.

                                 JOHANSSON
                        I am the name of Ludvig Johansson!

           Polite APPLAUSE. Johansson is unhappy with the response.

                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                        I AM THE NAME OF LUDVIG JOHANSSON!

           The crowd gets it, CHEERS thunderously.  He motions to 
           his side.  A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN quickly approaches.  He 
           grabs her, plants a slovenly kiss, and pushes her away.

                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                        We have tonight here a most impressive 
                        flock of Svitzers!

           The spotlight finds luminaries in other balconies:

                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                        Henric Gustavsson is on the house!

           SPOTLIGHT ON HENRIC GUSTAVSSON. Older, effeminate, and 
           wearing a monocle.

                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                        Henric, my wisest friend, when I need a 
                        friend to count on, I count your name on 
                        my fingers!
           POLITE APPLAUSE, no one knows what the hell he’s takling
           about.  The tepid response infuriates Johansson again.

                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                        I COUNT HIS NAME ON MY FINGERS!

           Bigger applause.  Johansson smiles, continues.

                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                        Freja Karlsson is on the house!

           SPOTLIGHT ON FREJA KARLSSON. Elegant.  Uber ice queen.

                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                        Freja, you calculating bitch, you are as 
                        beautiful today as you were when I first 
                        laid you.  

           APPLAUSE.  She nods at Johansson.  Johansson beckons for 
           the beautiful girl again.  She emerges, he squeezes her 
           boobs like a squeeze toy, pushes her away.

                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                        Nicholas Magnusson is on the house!

           SPOTLIGHT ON NICHOLAS MAGNUSSON. Young, dangerous, and 
           wired with muscle.

                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                        Nicholas, my protegee, you are young, 
                        strong, and powerful.  It is like 
                        sometimes looking in a scissor. 

           As APPLAUSE rains down again, he toasts his glass at 
           Nicholas.  Nicholas nods, chugs down his drink.

                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                        Tonight we celebrate me on my 40th year 
                        since they cut me from Mummy! DRINKS ARE 
                        IN THE HOUSE!

           More applause.

                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                        And now, I introduce our guests of honor.  
                        You know them from the number one and 
                        number two shows on television.  One is a 
                        diminutive negro who white people say to   
                        live with them.  The other, a diminutive 
                        negro who white people say to live with 
                        them.  Ladies and Gentlemen, our guests 
                        of honor, two diminutive negros who I 
                        would like to live with...
           He points over to the side, CUING someone.

                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                        GARY COLEMAN AND EMMANUEL LEWIS!

           CUE: a remix rap version of the Different Strokes theme 
           (”The world don’t move to the beat of just one drum...”)

           Complete pandemonium as the SPOTLIGHT searches for Gary 
           and Emmanuel.  Finally it finds them as they ENTER.  

           Their IMAGE goes up on the monitor. Everything stops.  
           ONE SCREAM pierces through, then silence.  

                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                                (from above, shocked)
                        You are older than on the television.

                                 VILHELMINA
                        The televeesion shows were feelmed a long 
                        teem ago.

           Johansson processes this, for a long moment.

                                 JOHANSSON
                        What a wonderful surprise!  Bring to me 
                        my diminutive guests!  Drinks are in the 
                        house!  

           Everyone goes nuts. Vilhelmina breathes a sigh of relief.

           INT. JOHANSSON’S BALCONY - MOMENTS LATER

           Johansson now has all the important luminaries in his 
           booth.  Vilhelmina leads Gary and Emmanuel to him. 

                                 VILHELMINA
                        I present to you, Ludvig Johansson.

           Johannson bows.  Emmanuel bows.  Gary just stands there.  

                                 JOHANSSON
                                (greeting Emmanuel)
                        Mr. Weebster. You honor the Swiss with 
                        your presence.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        And the Swiss honor me with their cheese.

           He ERUPTS in GIGGLES. Gary rolls his eyes.  After a 
           confused beat, Johansson (and then his followers) join in 
           the LAUGHTER.  Finally, Johansson turns to Gary.
                                 JOHANSSON
                        My heart leaps.

                                 GARY
                        Hey.

                                 JOHANSSON
                        I have long awaited to this moment.

           Gary nods, uncomfortable.  Off to the side, Henric 
           (effeminate, monocle) waves at him flirtatiously. 

                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                        Can you do it for me?

                                 GARY
                        What’s that?

                                 JOHANSSON
                        Your famous quotation.  You know. 

                                 GARY
                        Yeah, I’d rather not.

           A long beat.  Johansson smiles.

                                 JOHANSSON
                                (leading him)
                        What’chu talking about, Willis!?

                                 GARY
                        Sorry, no.

           Johansson’s face drops.  This is a man not used to being 
           denied.  His dangerous protegee, Nicolas, steps forward.  
           Johansson waves him to a stop.

                                 JOHANSSON
                                (to Gary)
                        Perhaps your mind will change itself.

                                 GARY
                        I don’t think so.

                                 JOHANSSON
                        Maybe tomorrow.

                                 GARY
                        Probably not.

           Awkward.  Finally, Johansson LAUGHS big.  Everyone joins 
           in.  Johansson CLAPS.  Three gorgeous WOMEN arrive 
           instantly.
                                 JOHANSSON
                        The three most beautiful virgins in all 
                        of Switzerland.  You may do whatever you 
                        wish in them.

           He pinches Emmanuel’s cheek.

                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                        Look at him!  Weebster! Vilhelmina, I 
                        think you would fit him inside of you.

                                 VILHELMINA
                        Whatever you weesh, Mr. Johansson.

                                 JOHANSSON
                        Let us party!

           The music CRANKS, as we watch the party get into full 
           swing...

           - SWISS DANCE, as images of Different Strokes and Webster
           play in the background.

           - IN THE BALCONY, Gary and Emmanuel sit with Johansson 
           and his crew. Johansson and Emmanuel do all the talking.

           - TO THE SIDE, Nicolas keeps a close eye on Gary, who 
           refuses to humor Johansson despite the obvious attempts 
           to get him to do his catch-phrase.

           - ON THE DANCE-FLOOR, where Emmanuel leads a group 
           (including a euphoric Johansson) in the Electric Slide.  
           He and Vilhelmina dance flirtatiously, hitting it off.

           - BACK IN THE BALCONY, where Gary sips on a water as the 
           three beautiful virgins wait to be utilized.

           - OUTSIDE THE CLUB, as PATRONS exit, most carrying 
           autographed copies of Gary and Emmanuel headshots. In 
           the foreground, Johansson bids goodnight to his stars.

           - ON THE LIMO, which pulls up in front of a luxurious 
           hotel where Gary and Emmanuel are dropped off.

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - LATER

           Gary and Emmanuel stand in front their adjacent rooms, 
           readying their keys.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Weird night.
                                 GARY
                        It is what it is.  

           Gary puts the key in the door.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Listen, Gary, it was 1984, can’t we just--

                                 GARY
                        I don’t want to talk about it.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Okay fine.  Whatever.

           Gary tries getting his door to unlock.  

                                 EMMANUEL (CONT’D)
                        Can I ask you something?  Not about that.

           Gary turns around, waits.

                                 EMMANUEL (CONT’D)
                        Why don’t you do it?

                                 GARY
                        What?

                                 EMMANUEL
                        The catchphrase.  The song and dance.  
                        Why don’t you just go with it? The glass 
                        can be half-full you know?

           Gary turns to him.

                                 GARY
                        My glass broke a long time ago.

           Gary talks quietly, almost to himself.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        I wish the damn show never happened.  
                        Swear to God.  Give me a do-over, I go to 
                        high school.  Become a god damn 
                        accountant, I don’t care.  It was twenty 
                        years ago and I’ve been screwed ever 
                        since. People I trusted stealing all my 
                        money, doing crap commercials just to pay 
                        the bills, idiots on the street trying to 
                        make me say that dumbass line every 
                        single day of my life.  I mean, if you 
                        want to laugh like an idiot and pretend 
                        it’s all good--
                                 EMMANUEL
                        It is all good!  People loved our shows.  
                        We did something most people never do, we 
                        made people laugh--

                                 GARY
                        And now they laugh at us.  We’re a joke.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        I’m not a joke.  

                                 GARY
                        You are, Manny.  You’re just not in on 
                        it.  

           Gary ENTERS his room, leaving Emmanuel alone.

           EXT. JOHANSSON’S MANSION - NEXT AFTERNOON

           An unreal estate, beset on all sides by mountains.

           INT. JOHANSSON’S MANSION - CONTINUOUS

           Ostentatiously decorated.  All over the great hallway are 
           ridiculous FANTASY ART PORTRAITS of Johansson.

           DOWN BELOW, Johansson leads Gary and Emmanuel on a tour.

                                 JOHANSSON
                        And this is the ping pong room.

           He opens a door to a room...

           ON ROOM

           Huge, over 4000 square feet.  There’s nothing in it 
           except a ping pong table, dead center.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Oh, wow. Are you a big ping pong player?

                                 JOHANSSON
                        No.

           Awkward.  They move down the hall.  Pass another door.  

                                 EMMANUEL
                        And what’s this room?

           Emmanuel opens the door. 
           INSIDE THE ROOM we find those we met earlier (Nicolas, 
           the dangerous protege’, Freja, the elegant ice-queen, and 
           Henric, the effeminate monocled man).  

           They are standing in front of a huge monitor.  

           ON MONITOR

           It shows a map of THE WEST COAST OF THE U.S.  There are 
           blueprints all over the walls.  Henric holds a pointer.

           The group hears the door open and turn quickly.

                                 JOHANSSON
                                (strongly)
                        That is a room for talks of business. 

           He closes the door, quickly puts on a huge smile.

                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                        Come, dinner will be served.

           INT. DINING ROOM - LATER

           A ridiculous long wood table.  Gary and Emmanuel sit at 
           the respective heads.  Those we’ve met line the sides.

           Everyone’s attention is riveted on Emmanuel, mid-story...

                                 EMMANUEL
                        So I’m leaving the audition - you can 
                        imagine where my head’s at by now - and 
                        the casting director grabs me and says, 
                        “Congratulations, Emmanuel.  You just 
                        became Webster.”

           Everyone claps.  He smiles.

                                 JOHANSSON
                        A riveting tale of triumph!

           Johansson lifts his glass.  Everyone follows.

                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                        To our diminutive friends, who will share 
                        for us useful and informative tales.  And 
                        to my fellow Zwitsers, as we begin our 
                        new enterprise.  Soon the world will know 
                        of Switzerland more than just neutrality. 
                        We will put Switzerland back in the map!

           His Swiss comrades “here, here” and drink. 
                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                        And Mr. Gary Coleman, what tales of the 
                        Hollywood do you have to rivet us to?  

           Henric moves his chair uncomfortably close to Gary. 

                                 HENRIC
                        Your sad little eyes tell stories by 
                        themselves.

                                 NICOLAS
                        Keep it in your pants, Henric.

           Henric glares at Nicolas - there’s tension here. 

                                 GARY
                        No stories, sorry.

           Silence.  Just then...

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Father?

           Everyone turns.  There stands an adorable blonde boy (9).  

                                 JOHANSSON
                        Look who it is!  My son!  Please approach 
                        our honored guests, my Son.

           The boy approaches Gary, nervous.

                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Gary, may I present my best son.  He 
                        was given the name Bjorn but we call him 
                        by the name Willis.

           Gary looks to Johansson.  He seems to be serious. 

                                 GARY
                                (tentative)
                        Hey, Willis, how’s it going?

           Willis looks to his father.  His father NODS at him.  The 
           kid glances at a PIECE OF PAPER he has in his hand, 
           reading it, then...

                                 WILLIS
                        Sometimes I make a poop and throw it in 
                        the air and try to catch it.

           Gary looks confused.
                                 JOHANSSON
                        Why that’s an odd thing to say, Willis!  
                        Gary, perhaps you would like to ask 
                        Willis to clarify what it is he’s 
                        speaking of? 

                                 GARY
                                (confused)
                        Uh, it’s okay.

           Johansson NODS again at Willis, who once again reads...

                                 WILLIS
                        I think airplanes should look like cars 
                        and be covered in poop.

                                 JOHANSSON
                        Willis!  What has come over you!?  Gary, 
                        you should really ask my son what it is 
                        he’s talking about.
                                (beat)
                        My son, Willis.

                                 GARY
                                (catching on)
                        Really, I’m good.

                                 WILLIS
                                (off paper)
                        I eat poop.

                                 JOHANSSON
                        What is this poop talk!?  Gary, please, 
                        ask him what he’s talking about.  My son, 
                        Willis.

                                 GARY
                        I’m not saying it, Dude.

                                 JOHANSSON
                        Just ask him.

                                 GARY
                        No.

                                 JOHANSSON
                        My son, Willis.

                                 GARY
                        Please stop.

                                (frantic)
                        What’chu talking about, Willis!?  With 
                        all this poop!  Ask him!  Just ask him, 
                        God dammit!

                                 GARY
                        Okay, that’s it.  I’m outta here.

           Gary gets up, storms away from the table.  

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Excuse me a moment.

           Emmanuel chases after him.

           EXT. MANSION - CONTINUOUS

           Gary walks briskly away from the mansion, down the long 
           gated driveway.  Emmanuel chases after.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Gary, c’mon--

                                 GARY
                        I’m leaving.  You want to go back into 
                        that loony-bin, be my guest.

           He’s out to the street.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Gary, what about the money.  You need it.

                                 GARY
                        I already got half, Bobby will get the re-
                        -

           Just then, BAM! TWO MEN IN BLACK jump out of the bushes 
           and put bags around both men’s heads.  

           A BLACK VAN pulls up, they’re thrown inside, and the van 
           screeches away.

                                                                CUT TO:

           PITCH BLACK. 

           We see nothing.  Just hear loud breathing.  

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        We clear?
                                 SECOND VOICE (O.S.)
                        All clear.

           Bags come off their heads as eyes adjust.  We’re in...

           INT. BLACK VAN - CONTINUOUS

           Emmanuel and Gary look up:

           Facing them sits a tough looking AMERICAN, dressed all in 
           black.  He’s instantly intimidating and intense (surely 
           we should be able to get Ed Harris for this).

                                 AMERICAN
                        Mr. Coleman, Mr. Lewis, my name is 
                        Clifford Armstrong.  

                                 GARY
                        I don’t care who you are, let us out of--

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        I’m the deputy director of The United 
                        States’ Anti-Terror Division of the CIA.

           This stops them.  We move in slowly on Armstrong, 
           dramatic.

                                 ARMSTRONG (CONT’D)
                        I’ll cut to it: the man who’s home you 
                        were just in is named Ludvig Johansson.  
                        He is, without a doubt, the most 
                        dangerous criminal mastermind in all of 
                        Europe.  The CIA has been monitoring his 
                        movements and activities for the past 
                        seven years.  Despite our best efforts, 
                        we have not been able get inside his 
                        residence, let alone infiltrate his 
                        organization.  Our intelligence tells us 
                        that he is planning a devastating attack 
                        on the United States sometime in the next 
                        seven days.  Our time is running out, and 
                        our intelligence leads have run dry.  
                        Your arrival comes in the nick of time.  
                        We know he’s fond of you.  You are the 
                        only two with the ability to so quickly 
                        get close to him, infiltrate his 
                        organization, and figure out what he has 
                        planned so we can stop him.
                                (a beat)
                        Gentlemen, if I had time to put on a dog 
                        and pony show I would, but I don’t.  
                                      (MORE)
                                      ARMSTRONG (CONT’D)
                        The United States government is asking 
                        you to go undercover and serve your 
                        country. What do you say?

           REVEAL GARY AND EMMANUEL.  Blank-faced.  Then...

                                 GARY
                        What’chu talkin’ about mother-fucker?

           Armstrong starts to respond, Emmanuel cuts him off...

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Wait a sec, wait a sec.  The most 
                        notorious criminal mastermind in the 
                        world lives in Switzerland?

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Yes.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        I thought Switzerland was neutral.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        That’s what everyone thinks. Switzerland 
                        is Kabul with snow.

           Emmanuel takes this in, then...

                                 EMMANUEL
                                (looking around)
                        Is this some kind of hidden camera show?  
                        I told Bobby I would not do more reality--

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        I assure you Mr. Lewis, this is not a 
                        hidden camera show. 

                                 EMMANUEL
                        That’s what you’d say if it was a hidden 
                        camera show.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        It’s not a hidden camera show.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Says you.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                                (frustrated)
                        When do you ever watch a hidden camera 
                        show where the target immediately guesses 
                        it’s a hidden camera show?
                                 EMMANUEL
                        They could cut it out in editing. I know 
                        how it works.  I was in The Surreal Life, 
                        Dude.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                                (trying patience)
                        Mr. Lewis.  This is very, very real.  All 
                        we’re asking is for you to stay close to 
                        Johansson, keep your eyes and ears open.

           Gary interjects.

                                 GARY
                        How much?

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Excuse me?

                                 GARY
                        How much would we get paid?

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Gary--

                                 GARY
                        Shut up.

           Emmanuel shuts up.  Armstrong leans back, surprised.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        How much do you want?

                                 GARY
                        Hundred grand.  Each.

           Emmanuel looks at Gary, shocked by his moxy.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        I can’t authorize that kind of payment.

                                 GARY
                        Then good luck to you, Pal.  Hope America 
                        doesn’t explode.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Gary, stop it--

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Fine.  One hundred thousand a man.

                                 GARY
                        Cash.
                                 ARMSTRONG
                        You have my word.

           Armstrong holds out his hand, Gary takes it.  

                                 EMMANUEL
                                (dramatic)
                        I’m a wealthy man, Mr. Armstrong.  My 
                        country has given me enough already.  

                                 GARY
                                (annoyed)
                        George Washington Webster over here.

           Armstrong picks up a walkie-talkie, speaks into it.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        The Gary Coleman-Emmanuel Lewis Project 
                        is a go.  I repeat, The Gary Coleman-
                        Emmanuel Lewis project is a go.

           Emmanuel jumps, realizing something.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Wait!  Before dinner... that room.  They 
                        were looking at a map of the U.S.  The 
                        West Coast.  They got us out of there 
                        real quick, like they were hiding it.

           Armstrong turns to his men, excited.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Get on this, I want a list of likely 
                        possible targets on the West Coast and 
                        contingency plans for each.
                                (to Emmanuel)
                        Good work.

           Emmanuel smiles, pleased with himself.  Gary rolls his 
           eyes. 

                                 EMMANUEL
                                (re: Gary’s eye roll)
                        What?

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Gentlemen, let’s get you to headquarters.

           EXT. GERHARDSEN SKI SHOP - LATER

           A small ski shop, nestled off a small road. 
           The Black Van pulls up front, parks.  Emmanuel, Gary, 
           Armstrong, and the Men in Black get out and ENTER...

           INT. GERHARDSEN SKI SHOP - CONTINUOUS

           Just what you’d expect.  Ski equipment everywhere.  A 
           small front desk.  One SLAVIC MAN behind the desk. 

           The group ENTERS.  The man nods at Armstrong, Armstrong
           nods back, and leads the group through a door.

           As they pass the desk, Emmanuel and Gary look behind it.  
           The underside of the desk is lined with MACHINE GUNS.

           Gary and Emmanuel share a look (”holy shit.”)

           INT. GERHARDSEN SKI SHOP (WAY INT.) - CONTINUOUS

           TWENTY YOUNG AGENTS line various desks, all on computers.  
           ELECTRONIC MAPS on walls.  WEAPONS everywhere.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Gentlemen, you have at your disposal one 
                        of the finest task forces in the world. 

           Armstrong leads them through the room.  As he does, he 
           replaces GRENADES on shelves, re-latches MACHINE GUNS, 
           and pats AGENTS on the shoulder encouragingly.  

                                 ARMSTRONG (CONT’D)
                        We are here without any official 
                        protection from the United States.  We’ve 
                        been given orders through back channels, 
                        left to our own devices.  Should you be 
                        captured, you’ll be on your own.  The 
                        United States government will not get 
                        involved in a war with Switzerland.  It’s 
                        just too dangerous here.

                                 EMMANUEL
                                (floored)
                        I really just always thought they were 
                        neutral.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        That’s exactly what they want us to 
                        think.  Switzerland is hell on Earth, 
                        Gentlemen.  Up to me I’d nuke the whole 
                        place, send the entire lot of blonde 
                        haired Nordic fucks straight to hell.
           Gary and Emmanuel share a confused look.

                                 ARMSTRONG (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.  It’s just... this place.
                                (with disdain)
                        Switzerland.
                                (then, controlling himself)
                        Now normally, we’d put civilians through 
                        three months of rigorous training.  But 
                        we can only afford twenty-four hours.  I 
                        don’t suppose either of you have any 
                        previous combat training?

                                 GARY
                        I did an episode of Strokes where I had 
                        to fight the Gooch, but we used a double.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        I remember that episode, it was one of 
                        your best.

                                 GARY
                        Thanks.

           They turn back to a blank-faced Armstrong.  After a beat:

                                 EMMANUEL
                        No.  No combat training.

           EXT. SNOWY FIELD - LATER

           Combat training.  

           A completely empty, snowy field.  PULL DOWN to REVEAL:

           Emmanuel, as he crawls under one of those ROPE-LADDER-
           TRAINING-THINGS.  As he crawls, agents SHOUT and FIRE 
           SHOTS behind him to simulate battle.

           We watch for a moment as Emmanuel throws himself into it 
           (Note to reader: in case you’ve lost perspective by now, 
           please try and imagine Emmanuel Lewis crawling under a 
           rope ladder in the snow as CIA agents fire at his feet).

           Gary watches blankly.  He turns to Armstrong.
                                 GARY
                        Do you think it’s very likely we’re going 
                        to have to crawl under a rope ladder in 
                        the next seven days?  Cause I might sit 
                        this one out.

                                                                CUT TO:

           HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT

           Two AGENTS show off intensive hand-to-hand combat 
           maneuvers.  It’s rapid-fire and amazing.  They finish.

           Emmanuel and Gary turn to Armstrong, unsure what to do.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        You’re up, Gary.

           An AGENT approaches, gets down on his knees in front of 
           Gary (to get to eye-level).  After a beat... Gary turns 
           back to Armstrong. 

                                 GARY
                        When the bad guys decide to fight me, do 
                        you really think they’re gonna get down 
                        on their knees?

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Mr. Coleman, the point here is to train 
                        you!  If you don’t attempt anything, how 
                        can you--

                                 GARY
                        Okay!  Fine!

           Like that, Gary wheels and throws a hard punch hitting 
           the unsuspecting agent (who has since stood up) right in 
           the nuts.  The guy goes down.  

           Gary and Emmanuel turn back to Armstrong.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        What’s next?

                                                                CUT TO:

           BOMB DEACTIVATION.

           On a table, a large bomb.
                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Good news, bad news.  We believe 
                        Johansson has obtained a chemical weapon.  
                        It’s a powerful weapon, capable of 
                        killing everyone within a hundred mile 
                        radius.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        I hope that’s the bad news.

           Emmanuel belts his loud LAUGH.  Armstrong looks to Gary.

                                 GARY
                                (”see what I’m dealing with”)
                        Right? 

           Armstrong continues.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        The good news is that the device is not 
                        very sophisticated. Most unsophisticated 
                        devices have what we call a fail-safe: 
                        one wire that, if disarmed, can 
                        deactivate the bomb.  The key is knowing 
                        what to look for--

           Before he can finish, Gary pulls out a YELLOW WIRE.  
           Green smoke fires out of the mock-bomb.

                                 ARMSTRONG (CONT’D)
                                (calmly)
                        If that was a real chemical device, every 
                        piece of skin on your body would have 
                        already melted off.

           Gary looks at Emmanuel.

                                 GARY
                        Don’t pull the yellow wire.

                                 EMMANUEL
                                (committing to memory)
                        Yellow wire, skin melts off. Got it.

           WEAPONS TRAINING.

           A LARGE SUV is parked in the center of the field.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        You’ll tell Johansson you decided to stay 
                        and rented a car to get around.
                                 GARY
                                (impressed)
                        Honda Pilot.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        S-weeeeet!

           Armstrong studies them for a beat, then... REMOVES a 
           PANEL from the TRUNK, revealing an assortment of WEAPONS.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Obviously you can’t carry a weapon, 
                        You’ll keep everything in here.  Your job 
                        is to gather intel, not exchange fire.  
                        This is only for what we call a doomsday 
                        scenario.

           He demonstrates each weapon.

                                 ARMSTRONG (CONT’D)
                                (showing grenade)
                        Grenade.  Pull the pin, get rid of it.
                                (showing machine gun)
                        Assortment of machine guns.  Safety here, 
                        trigger here, you reload by--

           Emmanuel is chomping at the bit, adorably excited...

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Can we try it?

           Armstrong looks at Gary, who SHRUGS (he could care less).

                                                                CUT TO:

           FIRING RANGE

           Targets are about one hundred feet away.  Armstrong holds 
           the MACHINE GUN.  Emmanuel looks orgasmic.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Pretty simple weapon, you basically just 
                        point and fire, like this...

           He DEMONSTRATES, a perfect round decimates a target.

           Emmanuel holds out his hands, eager.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Me.  Me. Me.
           Armstrong shakes his head, carefully places the weapon’s 
           strap on Emmanuel’s shoulder.  

           As soon as Armstrong lets go, the weight of the gun drops 
           little Emmanuel to the ground.  GUNFIRE goes off 
           everywhere, as AGENTS dive for cover.  Finally it stops.  

           Everyone gets up slowly.  Gary turns to Armstrong.

                                 GARY
                        Do you have anything smaller?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HEADQUARTERS - LATER

           Gary and Emmanuel wear only wife-beaters.  WIRES are 
           being taped to their chests.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        These wires will avoid all kinds of 
                        electronic detection.  You NEVER take 
                        them off.

           The guys follow Armstrong as he approaches a MONITOR.

                                 ARMSTRONG (CONT’D)
                        We believe Johansson is working with a 
                        team, you’ve already met the key players.

           A PHOTO OF FREJA comes on the screen.

                                 ARMSTRONG (CONT’D)
                        Freja Karlsson. Most dangerous woman in  
                        Sweden.  She’s been married to five of 
                        the most important men in Europe.  They 
                        all died.  Prematurely.  You follow?

                                 GARY
                        Don’t marry Freja, got it.

           A PICTURE OF HENRIC comes on screen.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Henric Gustavsson, the professor.  Smart, 
                        probably the brains behind any operation 
                        of Johansson’s.  Reported weakness for 
                        men, especially young ones. 

           Emmanuel GIGGLES loudly.  Armstrong stops, turns to Gary.
                                 ARMSTRONG (CONT’D)
                                (re: the loud laugh)
                        Is that gonna be a problem?

                                 GARY
                        I imagine it will be, yes.

           Armstrong SIGHS, pulls up A PICTURE OF NICOLAS.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Nicolas Magnusson. Cold-blooded killer.

                        operatives already.  Should you have to 
                        engage him in any sort of physical 
                        combat, you’ll want to use every bit of 
                        training you’ve received here today.

                                 GARY
                        Hopefully there’ll be a rope ladder 
                        hanging two feet off the ground.

           Armstrong shuts off the monitor.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Gentlemen: tomorrow, you’ll tell 
                        Johansson that you’re staying the week to 
                        take in the sights.  Weasel your way in, 
                        keep your ears to the ground.  The United 
                        States of America is depending on you.  
                        Any questions?

           They look at each other.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Can we call our agent?

           INT. BOBBY WHITE AGENCY - LATER

           Bobby sits behind his desk, looking exhausted. JALEEL 
           WHITE (once known better as Erkle) sits in front of him. 

           In case you haven’t seen him in a bit, Jaleel White is

                        auditions and such.

                                 GARY
                        What auditions?

                                 BOBBY
                        If you get any.  I’ll push them back if 
                        you get any.  

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Alright, Bobby.  Later.

                                 GARY
                        Later.

                                 BOBBY
                        Later.

           They hang up.  Bobby turns back to Jaleel.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Hey - and I’m just spit-balling here - 
                        any interest in doing something reality-
                        based with those guys?
                                 JALEEL
                        Look at my face!  Do I look like I have 
                        any motherfucking interest in doing 
                        something reality-based with Emmanuel 
                        Lewis and Gary Coleman!?  Law and Fucking
                        Order, that’s what I want, Bitch!

           As Jaleel continues to rant, we...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. JOHANSSON’S MANSION - NEXT MORNING

           CUE: A LOUD BUZZER.

           Johannson, Henric, Freja, Nicolas, and Vilhelmina look at 
           a SECURITY MONITOR on the wall.

           ON SECURITY MONITOR

           Emmanuel and Gary, their faces really close to camera.

           BACK TO BAD GUYS

           Who look at each other, confused.  After a beat, 
           Johansson pushes a button on the wall.

                                 JOHANSSON
                        Let them in.

           INT. JOHANSSON’S MANSION - LATER

           The front door opens, revealing Gary and Emmanuel. 

                                 JOHANSSON
                        This is a surprise.  

                                 EMMANUEL
                        We wanted to apologize for leaving so 
                        suddenly last night.

           Johansson turns to Gary, expectant.  Emmanuel nudges him.

                                 GARY
                                (eating crow)
                        I was having a bad day.

           Henric steps forward, puts a hand on Gary’s shoulder.
                                 HENRIC
                        We all have bad days my doe-eyed little 
                        friend.

           Gary looks down at Henric’s hand, lingering an extra beat 
           on his shoulder.  Henric smiles and removes it.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        We’ve actually decided to stay for a 
                        week, take in the sights of your 
                        beautiful country.

           He catches Vilhelmina’s eye, smiles.  She smiles back.

                                 FREJA
                        This is a very bad week for us--

                                 JOHANSSON
                        Nonsense!  If our diminutive friends wish 
                        to stay, it is our job to pleasure them.

           Henric smiles at Gary.  Gary looks uncomfortable.

                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                        Come inside!  Of all the meals, breakfast 
                        is the one that holds the most impotence.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Great!  Could I just use your restroom 
                        before we eat?  Small guy, small bladder.

           He LAUGHS his big laugh.  Vilhelmina GIGGLES, stops 
           herself off Freja’s look.

                                 JOHANSSON
                        Of course.  Down the hall, to the right.

           Emmanuel EXITS.  Gary is left alone with the crew.  He 
           looks at Johansson.

                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                        I will not try to make you say it 
                        anymore.  I sense it upsets you.

                                 GARY
                        I appreciate that.

                                 JOHANSSON
                        But perhaps, in time, you will change 
                        your mind and come to think of me like 
                        your Mr. Drummond, a rich old white man 
                        who only wishes for a small black child 
                        to own.
                                 GARY
                        You never know.

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Emmanuel rushes down the long hallway of doors.

                                 EMMANUEL
                                (to himself)
                        Which one was it?

           He settles on a door, OPENS IT.

           INT. ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Wrong one.  It’s a child’s room (of Willis, the son).  
           Walls are covered in OUTDATED POSTERS of Gary and 
           Emmanuel.  A BED is filled with STUFFED ANIMALS.

           Emmanuel turns to go, but HEARS VOICES.  He darts inside.

                                 VOICE (O.S)
                        Quickly, we must talk.

                                 VOICE #2 (O.S.)
                        Let’s go in the boy’s room, he’s at 
                        school.  We can speak freely there.

           Emmanuel panics, looks for a place to hide.  With no 
           options, he jumps onto the bed and covers himself in the 
           OVERSIZED STUFFED ANIMALS.  

           ON EMANUEL

           Completely covered and still.  Only his face sticks out 
           from between the stuffed toys.  He blends right in.

           AT DOOR

           Freja, Henric, and Nicolas ENTER, close the door.

                                 FREJA
                        Ludvig’s adoration of these munchkins
                        overrides his common sense.  It is a 
                        mistake to allow them into our circle 
                        days before we launch our enterprise.  

                                 NICOLAS
                        Let us be safe.  I can eliminate them.

           Emmanuel’s eyes open wide.
                                 HENRIC
                        No, they are the biggest stars in the 
                        world.  It would be too public if they go 
                        missing.  Besides, I enjoy their company, 
                        particularly the cute little angry one.

                                 NICOLAS
                        Stop thinking with your viener, Henric.

           On “viener” Emmanuel GIGGLES.  They all turn.

                                 NICOLAS (CONT’D)
                        What was that?

           They look around.  Nothing.  Just a stuffed animals.

                                 FREJA
                        Let us remain focused.  Our development 
                        moves steadily.  In five days we strike a 
                        crippling blow at the heart of the people 
                        of California and begin the long awaited 
                        creation of a new Switzerland. 

           Nicolas NODS eagerly.

                                 FREJA (CONT’D)
                        We must monitor them closely.  If we 
                        sense anything, we take them out.

           The men NOD in agreement and they EXIT.  Once clear, 
           Emmanuel extricates himself from the stuffed animals.

                                 EMMANUEL
                                (speaking into chest)
                        Did you get that?  Target is somewhere in 
                        California in five days.  

           Emmanuel heads for the door.

                                 EMMANUEL (CONT’D)
                                (to himself)
                        This is so cool.  

           INT. DINING ROOM - LATER

           Gary sits at the table with his hosts.

                                 GARY
                        So, Mr. Johansson... what’s this big 
                        business project you keep talking about?
                                 JOHANSSON
                        Oh, Gary, it will be magnificent.  In 
                        just days we will announce to the world--

           Freja grabs his hand, shutting him up.  

                                 FREJA
                        Mr. Coleman, do you ski?  Perhaps we 
                        might show you some of Switzerland’s 
                        finest slopes.

                                 GARY
                        Nope, don’t ski.
                                (back to topic)
                        You were saying?

           Just then, EMMANUEL ENTERS from the “bathroom.” 

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Golly, I just peed forever, huh?!  I 
                        mean, I bet you were wondering how 
                        someone could take that long to pee but I 
                        swear I was peeing that whole time!

           Awkward beat.

                                 FREJA
                        Mr. Weebster, I was just asking Gary if 
                        he enjoyed the skiing.

                                 GARY
                                (to Emmanuel, pointedly)
                        I told her no.

                                 FREJA
                        You cannot come to Switzerland without 
                        skiing.  

                                 EMMANUEL
                        I’ve never ski’d before but I’d love to 
                        learn.

           Gary ROLLS his eyes.

                                 GARY
                                (imitating, pitching voice)
                        I’ve never ski’d before but I’d love to 
                        learn.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Stop it.
                                 GARY
                        You stop it.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        You.

                                 GARY
                        You.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Stop being mean.

                                 GARY
                                (imitating)
                        Stop being mean.

                                 JOHANSSON
                        Gentlemen!  
                                (then)
                        I begin to understand why Mr. Drummond is 
                        so tired usually. 

           He stands, CLAPS his hands.

                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                        It is settled! Vilhelmina will take you 
                        to shopping, and then, we will ski!

           Emmanuel and Vilhelmina share a smile.  Henric taps 
           Gary’s shoulder.

                                 HENRIC
                        I do not ski either.  We can sit by the 
                        fire at the lodge and become... better 
                        acquainted.

                                 GARY
                        Fantastic.

           INT. SKI RENTAL SHOP - LATER

           Emmanuel tries on SKI EQUIPMENT as Vilhelmina oversees.  
           Emmanuel jumps side to side in his skis.

           OFF TO THE SIDE Gary stands with his arms crossed, 
           watching the bizarre flirtation from afar.

                                 VILHELMINA
                        Yees! The ski’s feet perfectly.  I must 
                        buy for you!
                                 EMMANUEL
                        No, no.  You’re very generous but I can’t 
                        let a beautiful woman buy me ski’s.

                                 VILHELMINA
                                (blushing)
                        Oh, no.  I think I eem not beautifeel. I 
                        eem tall and awkward.

                                 EMMANUEL
                                (joking)
                        Imagine what our babies would look like.

                                 VILHELMINA
                                (serious)
                        Yees. I can.

           She smiles.  Emmanuel is completely smitten. Gary 
           approaches, grabs him.

                                 GARY
                        Can I talk to you?

                                 EMMANUEL
                                (to Vilhelmina)
                        Excuse me a moment.

           Gary pulls Emmanuel aside, speaks quietly.

                                 GARY
                        Listen to me.  I’m not gonna risk blowing 
                        one hundred grand cause you’re getting 
                        your little head stuck up your little 
                        ass.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        What are you talking about?  We’re 
                        supposed to get close to them, I’m 
                        getting close.

                                 GARY
                        Please.  Do you really think you have a 
                        shot with the six foot supermodel?

                                 EMMANUEL
                        You know what, Gary?  I’m getting sick of 
                        taking your crap. You want to hate me 
                        for something that happened twenty years 
                        ago, fine.  You want to feel like the 
                        world’s out to get you, like you don’t 
                        deserve anything you want, that’s your 
                        problem.  She likes me. She thinks I’m 
                        cute.  So deal with it.

                        Now if you’ll excuse me, I’ll be in the 
                        little boys department finding ski-pants. 

           Emmanuel storms off. 

           INT. SKI RENTAL SHOP - LATER

           Emmanuel tries on ski jackets as Vilhelmina watches.

                                 VILHELMINA
                        You and Mr. Colemeen, you do not leek 
                        each other much?

                                 EMMANUEL
                        We have a history.

                                 VILHELMINA
                        What ees this... heestory?

           Emmanuel takes a deep breath, tells her the STORY.  Note: 
           The story is told over REAL CLIPS and IMAGES from the 
           80’s.

           We start with EARLY CLIPS from Different Strokes.

                                 EMMANUEL (V.O.)
                        Gary’s show started in 1978, five years 
                        before mine.  Different Strokes was huge 
                        back then, I mean... Gary was the biggest 
                        thing around.

                                 EMMANUEL (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        He was everywhere.  God knows how much 
                        money he was making, I don’t think he 
                        knew, winning every award.

                        He won the People’s Choice Award for 
                        Favorite Young TV Performer in 1980, ‘81, 
                        ‘82, ‘83.  You’ve gotta understand... 
                        this was unprecedented.

                        My show started six years later, 1983.  
                        People compared the shows of course - 
                        small black kids, adopted by white folks - 
                        frankly, I never saw it.

                        I mean, my white family was middle-class 
                        his was rich, he had a brother I was an 
                        only child... whatever, don’t get me 
                        started.

                        Point is, suddenly I became the guy.  And 
                        then came ‘84.  People’s Choice Awards, 
                        my first time.  I was happy just to be 
                        there, got to meet Kenny Rogers--

                                 VILHELMINA (O.S.)
                        Oh my God!  Keenny Rogers.

                                 EMMANUEL (O.S.)
                        Kenny’s amazing.  We text constantly.
                                (then)
                        Anyhow, I certainly didn’t expect 
                        anything, I mean Gary had won four years 
                        in a row.  But then...

                        I won.  I beat him.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Vilhelmina listens, enraptured.

                                 EMMANUEL (CONT’D)
                        I made a joke during my acceptance 
                        speech.  It was pretty harmless.  I said 
                        something like, “Well, I guess Gary 
                        Coleman just became the second most 
                        popular little black kid in Hollywood.”
                        Got a huge laugh but it embarrassed him 
                        horribly.  And he never forgave me.

           He pauses, reflective.

                                 EMMANUEL (CONT’D)
                        It wasn’t a nice thing to say.  I was 
                        just a kid and it was just a joke but ... 
                        I don’t know.  I’ve always felt bad.

           Sheepishly, he looks up at Vilhelmina.  She leans in and 
           gives him a PECK on the cheek.

                                 VILHELMINA
                        You are a good person, I theenk.
                                 EMMANUEL
                        I try to be.

                                 VILHELMINA
                        That must be neece.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        What?  You’re not a good person?  

           She doesn’t respond, looks upset.

                                 EMMANUEL (CONT’D)
                        What is it, Vilhelmina? 

           Gary walks over, cuts him off.

                                 GARY
                        We should get going.

           Vilhelmina gathers herself, the moment lost.

                                 VILHELMINA
                        Yes, let us go.

           She EXITS.  Emmanuel glares at Gary, follows her.

                                 GARY
                                (re: the glare)
                        What?

           As Gary walks after him, TWO MEN IN BLACK emerge from 
           behind mannequins.  One of them speaks into his sleeve:

                                 MAN IN BLACK
                        The operatives are in play.  I repeat...

           He hesitates, turns to the other guy.  The other guy 
           SHRUGS.

                                 MAN IN BLACK (CONT’D)
                                (into sleeve)
                        The guys from Different Strokes and 
                        Webster are in play.
                                (to other guy)
                        This is so fucking weird.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SKI SLOPE - LATER

           Emmanuel rides on a SKI LIFT next to Vilhelmina.
                                 EMMANUEL
                        You’re sure I shouldn’t get a lesson? 

                                 VILHELMINA
                        I vill look out for you.

           The lift reaches the bottom.  Vilhelmina SCOOPS up 
           Emmanuel like a doll and places him on the ground.

                                 VILHELMINA (CONT’D)
                        We vill start on the easiest mounteen.

           She starts off.  Emmanuel walks/hops after her in his 
           skis, awkwardly.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        So Vilhelmina, before... it felt like you 
                        wanted to tell me something?

           Vilhelmina hesitates.  Just then FREJA whips over, 
           executing a HOCKEY-STOP and spraying snow everywhere.

                                 FREJA
                        Vilhelmina?  You have entertained our 
                        guest long enough.  I will take Mr. 
                        Weebster down the mountain.

                                 VILHELMINA
                        Oh, eet’s really not a probleem--

                                 FREJA
                                (coldly)
                        You are dismissed, Vilhelmina.

           Vilhelmina nods, smiles weakly at Emmanuel, and skis off.  

                                 FREJA (CONT’D)
                        A man of your stature should not spend 
                        his entire trip with a mere assistant. 
                        Come. I will take you to a more 
                        challenging hill.  It will give us a 
                        chance to talk about why you have decided 
                        to stay in Switzerland longer.

           Emmanuel SWALLOWS. Freja grabs his arm, pulls him off.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SKI LODGE - MEANWHILE

           Gary sits in a cozy lodge, sipping a warm beverage.  In 
           front of him sits Johansson, Henric, and Nicolas.
                                 JOHANSSON
                        So, Gary.  Tell me of your fictional best 
                        friend, Dudley.  Why in the show do we 
                        never see his parents?  And where comes 
                        from the name Dudley?  Is it an African 
                        name?  Are you close in the real life?

                                 GARY
                        Sorry, I haven’t heard from him in years.

           This stops Johansson.  He turns to Nicolas.

                                 JOHANSSON
                                (softly)
                        He gives me nothing!  Do I ask for so 
                        much!?  
                                (then, announcing)
                        I need a drink.

           He stalks off, Nicolas glares at Gary and EXITS after 
           Johansson.  Once they’re gone, Henric nudges closer.

                                 HENRIC
                        Nicolas follows him like a lapdog.  

                                 GARY
                        Yeah, they seem pretty tight.

                                 HENRIC
                        Johansson has always favored him.  Too 
                        much, I think sometimes.

           Gary picks up on the jealously, treads carefully.

                                 GARY
                        That must bother you a little.  How does 
                        he favor him?

                                 HENRIC
                        Oh, I could tell you stories.  

                                 GARY
                        Please do.

                                 HENRIC
                                (whispering)
                        We have a... project in California.  It 
                        was my... conception.  Yet despite the 
                        fact that Nicolas is idiot homophobe, 
                        Johansson chooses him to--

           He stops, hesitant.
                                 GARY
                        To what?

                                 HENRIC
                        Come.  Let us sit on the rug by the fire.  
                        It will make me more comfortable to speak 
                        freely.

           Gary SWALLOWS, looks at the BEARSKIN RUG near the fire.  

                                                               BACK TO:

           EXT. SKI SLOPE - MEANWHILE

           Freja leads Emmanuel through the snow.  She skis on the 
           flat ground with ease.  He labors after her.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        So, what is it you hoped to do with your 
                        extra time in Switzerland, Mr. Weebster?

                                 EMMANUEL (CONT’D)
                        Oh, you know, see the sights--

                                 FREJA
                        Such as what?  Opera houses?  Castles?  
                        Major cities?

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Yep.  Want to bang out all that stuff.

                                 FREJA
                        Such a sudden decision.  To leave dinner 
                        so quickly and then decide to stay 
                        another week.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        I’m a fly by the seat of my pants kinda
                        guy, Freja.  Is it much further?

                                 FREJA
                        You obtained a rental car so quickly.  

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Yep.

                                 FREJA
                        From where?  

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Oh, we got it at the airport.
                                 FREJA
                        Why do you lie, Mr. Weebster?

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Lie?

                                 FREJA
                        I know when men lie, Mr. Weebster. My 
                        first husband told me he did not cheat.  
                        My second, that he did not gamble.  I 
                        knew both times, immediately, that they 
                        lied.  Just as I know that you lie now.

           They have arrived at the EDGE OF A CLIFF.

                                 FREJA (CONT’D)
                        I think it may be time for you to tell me 
                        what you really do here, no?

           Freja pulls a GUN from behind her ski jacket.  Emmanuel 
           looks at the gun, speaks toward his chest/wire area.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Golly gee!  Freja has pointed a loaded 
                        gun at me!  I repeat: Golly gee!  Freja 
                        has pointed a loaded gun at me!”

           Freja looks confused.

                        I love your show, Gary.  I know many 
                        different strokes of my own if you get my 
                        meaning.

           Gary starts to protest, then stops himself.  He shakes 
           his head and bites the bullet.

                        one drum.
           Johansson looks completely shocked by the revelation.

           EXT. SKI SLOPE - MEANWHILE

           Emmanuel is still at the precipice of the cliff, being 
           held at gunpoint by Freda.

                                 EMMANUEL
                                (talking to his chest)
                        Freja, it’s not very nice that you have a 
                        gun pointed at my face.  On a cliff.  I’m 
                        not sure where...

                                 FREJA
                        Why do you speak into your chest?

                                 EMMANUEL
                        What do you mean?  That I’m talking into 
                        my chest as if I’m trying to get someone 
                        to come rescue me?  On the cliff?  Where 
                        Freja has a gun pointed at me?

           Realizing, Freja rips open Emmanuel’s ski jacket and 
           reaches down his shirt.  She rips out his WIRE.

                                 FREJA
                        I knew it!

           She levels her gun.  Emmanuel closes his eyes.  Just as 
           she goes to fire he JUMPS off the precipice.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        HOLY... CRAPPPPPPPPPP!

           Freja takes off after him.

           ACTION SEQUENCE

           Emmanuel races down the mountain, SCREAMING the entire 
           time, going a hundred miles an hour.

           Behind him, Freja gives chase, side to side across the 
           mountain... an expert skier.

           Emmanuel hits a MOGUL, flies, his legs go spread eagle.

           Behind him, Freja FIRES her weapon.  The bullet whizzes 
           through Emmanuel’s spread eagle legs.
           His eyes open WIDE.

           Freja catches up, grabs him.  Entwined (standing face to 
           crotch) they careen down the mountain.

           She angles her gun towards Emmanuel.  He grabs it.  They 
           fight for control of the weapon as they continue down.

           A TREE comes up quickly, dead center on the slope.  At 
           the last minute, they SPLIT UP, avoiding it.

           Still moving downhill, Emmanuel realizes: somehow’s he 
           retained possession of the GUN.

           Freja comes back after him.  He points the weapon at her.

           She leaps at him.  He FIRES.  

           The BACKFIRE from the GUN sends him TUMBLING backwards.  
           Simultaneously, the shot causes her to duck for cover and 
           start TUMBLING in the other direction.

           They ROLL down the hill, SOMMERSAULTING parallel to one 
           another.  Eventually, they come together.

           They both grab each other, roll down the hill as one.

           Freja is able to regain her footing, pulls Emmanuel up.

           Emmanuel looks forward.  They’re hurtling toward another 
           TREE.  He braces for impact.  At the last possible 
           second...

           Someone SWOOPS in from the side and grabs him... leaving 
           Freja to SMASH into the tree by herself.

           Emmanuel looks up, dazed.  Before him stands ARMSTRONG 
           (head of the CIA), dressed in all black.  

           Armstrong steadies Emmanuel on his feet, says nothing, 
           and skis fluidly over toward Freja.

           Meanwhile, a BLACK CHOPPER ARRIVES and LOWERS A ROPE 
           LADDER from above.

           Freja lies on the ground, groaning.

                                 FREJA
                                (half conscious)
                        I knew it!  I knew he was working for 
                        someone--
           Without a word, Armstrong reaches down and SNAPS her 
           neck.  She falls back, dead.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Holy crap!

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Emmanuel, come here, quickly. 

           Emmanuel WADDLES over in his skis.  Armstrong grabs him, 
           re-adjusts his “wire,” and zips up his jacket.

                                 ARMSTRONG (CONT’D)
                        Get to Johansson.  Say there’s been an 
                        accident. You have to move quickly.

           Armstrong grabs the rope ladder, gets lifted away.

                                 ARMSTRONG (CONT’D)
                                (calling out)
                        Meet at headquarters tonight for a 
                        debriefing.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        You killed her!  Holy crap! She’s like 
                        totally dead!

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        We had no choice!  Go, Emmanuel!  Now!

           Flustered, Emmanuel runs off in his oversized skis.  

           He looks ridiculous.

           INT. SKI LODGE - CONTINUOUS

           Johansson sits in front of Gary, still stunned by news of 
           his sexual orientation.

                                 JOHANSSON
                        Did Mr. Drummond know?  

           EMMANUEL BURSTS IN, out of breath.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        There’s been... accident... Freja... 
                        go... quickly...

           Everyone RUSHES OUT.  Gary goes to follow, Emmanuel grabs 
           him.  They speak quickly, heated WHISPERS.

                        You go first.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Freja found out I was wearing a wire.  
                        She chased me down the mountain with a 
                        gun.  Armstrong saved me and snapped her 
                        neck to make it look like an accident.

                                 GARY
                        Wow.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        It was bananas.  Now you go.

                        I let Henric feel up my leg in front of 
                        the fire and got him to tell me that 
                        Nicolas is the one delivering the bomb.
                                (then)
                        He just snapped it?  Her neck?

                        Like in the movies.  We’re supposed to

                        I almost got debriefed five minutes ago.

                        That’s funny, Gary.  You made a very 
                        funny joke.

                        Why do you have to do that?  The sarcasm?  

                                 GARY
                        Because you irritate me.  And stop being 
                        so sensitive.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Whatever.  I’m not the one holding onto a 
                        grudge from twenty years ago.

                                 GARY
                        Enough with that shit already! 

           He takes a deep breath.  Emmanuel does the same.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        I’m sorry.  It’s just... this is harder 
                        than anything I’ve ever done.

                                 GARY
                        Really?  Saving America from a terrorist

           They start walking out.

                        You’re such a dick.

                        You are...

           Their bickering FADES OUT as they EXIT the lodge...

           EXT. SKI SLOPE - LATER

           A GURNEY lifts Freja’s dead body into an ambulance.  

           Nicolas pulls back the SHEET over Freja’s body.  Her neck 
           has RED MARKS on it... like someone had their hands on it 
           before she died. 

           He looks off toward the side where...

           Emmanuel talks to MEDICAL WORKERS.  He points at the 
           tree, clearly explaining what happened.  
           Nicolas pulls the sheet back over Freja’s face.  His gaze 
           never leaves Emmanuel.

           INT. HEADQUARTERS - LATER

           Emmanuel and Gary stand in front of Armstrong.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Here’s what we now know: Nicolas will be 
                        delivering the bomb somewhere in 
                        California in four days time.  We need to 
                        know where and we need to know how.

           He turns to Gary.

                                 ARMSTRONG (CONT’D)
                        Gary, continue to focus on Henric.  He 
                        seems to have a loose tongue. 

           Emmanuel GIGGLES.

                                 ARMSTRONG (CONT’D)
                                (reprimanding)
                        Emmanuel.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Sorry.

           He turns to Emmanuel.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Emmanuel, the assistant, what’s her name?

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Vilhelmina.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Vilamina also seems--

                                 EMMANUEL
                                (correcting him)
                        Vilhelmina.

           Armstrong stops, takes a breath.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                                (trying calm)
                        Thank you. 
                                (then)
                        She also seems to know something.  
                                      (MORE)
                                      ARMSTRONG (CONT'D)
                        I want both of you to take twenty-four 
                        hours to gain their trust.  We need to 
                        see how far you can get with them.

           Emmanuel GIGGLES again.  Gary turns to Armstrong.

                                 GARY
                        If you shoot him, I won’t tell anyone.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Just get close, Gentlemen.  We just need 
                        them to believe they can trust you.

           WE CUE: the 80’s theme song from Webster (look it up on-
           line, it’s perfect): “Then Came You” as we launch:

           GARY-HENRIC/MANNY-VILHELMINA “FALLING-IN-LOVE MONTAGE” 

           A FUNERAL for Freja.  Everyone in black.  Johansson 
           speaks. 

           ON GARY.  As Henric, sobbing, rests his head on his 
           shoulder.  Gary pats his head, uncomfortable.

           ON EMMANUEL.  As Vilhelmina, tears in her eyes, takes his 
           hand.

           PULL BACK.  In the distance, Nicolas watches both of 
           them.  He looks suspicious.

           IN A CASTLE: As Henric and Vilhelmina lead Gary and 
           Emmanuel on a tour.  Vilhelmina holds out her hand, 
           Emmanuel takes it.  

           Henric holds out his.  Gary hesitates, then takes it.

           ON A SNOWY FIELD, Vilhelmina tosses snow playfully at 
           Emmanuel.  He throws a snowball at her.  She tackles him 
           and they frolic in the snow.

           OFF TO THE SIDE, Gary watches, shakes his head.  After a 
           beat, he’s tackled from behind by Henric.  

           IN THEIR CAR, as they drive and sing along to the radio.

           IN A MUSEUM, as Vilhelmina and Emmanuel look at a 
           painting of a young couple, very much in love.

           IN A BAR, where the couples slow dance.

           AND FINALLY, back at the hotel, where the couples bid one 
           another awkward goodnights. As Henric and Vilhelmina 
           clear frame, we PUSH IN ON...
           NICOLAS, sitting in the lobby, monitoring it all.  Once 
           they’re gone, he gets up and EXITS.

           END MONTAGE.

           INT. UNDISCLOSED LOCATION - LATER

           Johansson sits in a seat, looking out at SOMETHING (we 
           don’t see what).  He looks exasperated.

                                 JOHANSSON
                        No, no, no! It is not good enough!  We 
                        must be ready in FOUR DAYS!  

           Nicolas approaches, sits down next to him.

                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                        What of our diminutive friends?

                                 NICOLAS
                        They spend all day with Henric and 
                        Vilhelmina.  I have bad feelings.  

                                 JOHANSSON
                        I know, I know.

                                 NICOLAS
                        They decide to stay long. The angry one 
                        infects Henric with lust.  Now Freja is 
                        dead.  You must let me eliminate them.

           Johansson takes a deep breath, aggravated.

                                 JOHANSSON
                        I understand your concerns, Nicolas.  
                        This enterprise is too important to risk, 
                        even for the world’s greatest stars.
                                (then)
                        I have a plan.  We will take them to the 
                        Riviera.  I can always see a man’s soul 
                        at the Riviera.

                                 NICOLAS
                        And if you don’t like what you see?

                                 JOHANSSON
                                (dramatically)
                        Then Gary Coleman and Emmanuel Lewis die 
                        in Switzerland.

           A beat, then:
                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                        Oh Jesus, I really hope we don’t have to 
                        kill them.  They are so talented.

           INT. SKI RENTAL SHOP - CONTINUOUS

           Armstrong briefs Gary and Emmanuel.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Tonight is a big night.  Johansson only 
                        takes those in his inner circle to the 
                        Riviera.  We need to figure out where he 
                        plans on hitting us in California.  We’re 
                        running out of time.

           Emmanuel sits forward, excited.

                                 EMMANUEL
                                (eager)
                        Do you want us to shoot anybody?

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Emmanuel: what do I keep saying?

                                 EMMANUEL
                                (by rote)
                        Stop giggling like a idiot and 
                        interrupting you.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        No, about the guns.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Oh.
                                (then, the “right” answer)
                        The guns in the trunk are only for a 
                        Doomsday Scenario.
                                (quietly)
                        L-aaaaaame.

           Over ARMSTRONG’S NARRATION we watch our heroes prepare.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - EVENING

           Emmanuel stands in front of the mirror, puts on a TUXEDO 
           over his HIDDEN WIRES.

                                 ARMSTRONG (V.0.)
                        You’ll need to be at your best tonight.
           INT. SECOND HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Gary similarly adjusts his bow tie.

                                 ARMSTRONG (V.O.)
                        The closer you get, the more suspicious 
                        Johansson will become.

           EXT. HOTEL - LATER

           Gary and Emmanuel wait outside the hotel.  A LIMOSINE 
           ARRIVES.  The door opens and VILHELMINA steps out in an 
           evening gown.  Stunning.  Emmanuel melts.

                                 ARMSTRONG (V.O.)
                        Johansson said he’d be picking you at 
                        seven.

           INT. LIMOSINE - CONTINUOUS

           Gary and Emmanuel sit opposite Vilhelmina, Johansson, 
           Henric, and Nicolas.  It’s a ridiculous tableau.

                                 ARMSTRONG (V.O.)
                        I imagine you’ll head straight to the 
                        Casino.

           The limo stops.  They step out...

           EXT. RIVIERA - CONTINUOUS

           An OPULENT CASINO -the Bellagio times fifty.  Gary and 
           Emmanuel take it in.

                                 ARMSTRONG (V.O.)
                        The Riviera puts Monte Carlo to shame.  
                        The Swiss are notorious for their love of 
                        gaming and extravagance.

                                 GARY (V.O.)
                        Really?  The Swiss?

                                 ARMSTRONG (V.O.)
                        They’re fucking animals. 
           INT. RIVIERA CASINO - CONTINUOUS

           Johansson leads his “entourage” through the Casino.  
           SPECTATORS stop to pay homage.

           Nicolas, like a wrecking ball, clears a path for all.

                                 ARMSTRONG (V.O.)
                        Johansson’s a notorious gambler, he’ll 
                        head straight for the tables.

           A HOT WAITRESS stops the procession, holding out a tray 
           of MARTINIS.  Johansson passes one each back to Gary and 
           Emmanuel.  

                                 ARMSTRONG (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        He’ll try and get you drunk.  Be careful, 
                        you’ll need your wits tonight.

           Johansson turns, continues marching forward.  As soon as 
           he does, Gary and Emmanuel TOSS the contents of their 
           drinks over their shoulders...

           Into the faces of NEARBY SPECTATORS.

           INT. HIGH ROLLER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           VELVET ROPE parts, allowing them to enter a room with...  

           ONE POKER TABLE.

           At the table sit VARIOUS BUSINESSMEN.  Each has a 
           PERSONAL BEAUTIFUL WAITRESS who waits behind him.

           Manny, Gary, Johansson, Henric, and Nicolas take their 
           places at the table.  Vilhelmina steps behind Manny..

                                 JOHANSSON
                        Tonight we will gamble a game of real men 
                        in honor of dear Freja who was like a 
                        real man but with a vagina.

           He stops, gathers himself, and continues.

                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                        We will look into each other’s souls and 
                        see what we find.  Hopefully, we find a 
                        depth as I once found in Freja’s vagina.

           Gary and Manny SHUDDER as Johansson CLAPS TWICE.
           Instantly each waitress steps forward and places a TIARA-
           ESQUE CROWN around the forehead of each man at the table.  

           Gary and Manny look confused.

                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                        First we drink.  We drink because we are 
                        merry, and because I am a drunk who 
                        cannot find the pleasure in life without 
                        the alcohol.  Ha ha ha ha.

           Prompted, everyone joins him in a LAUGH.  

                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                                (stopping short)
                        It’s not funny.  I am not a happy person.

           They stop.  He CLAPS TWICE MORE.  Instantly, MARTINIS are 
           passed out by waitresses.  

           Johansson points at Gary and Emmanuel, waiting for them 
           to drink.   They hesitate, not sure what to do.  

                                 GARY
                        Omigod! Is that Todd Bridges?

           Everyone WHIPS around, excited.  Gary and Emmanuel, 
           synchronized, once again TOSS their drink contents over 
           their shoulders onto the WAITRESSES behind them.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Nope.  Just looks like Todd Bridges.

                                 JOHANSSON
                        DAMMIT!

           GROANS of disappointment.  Everyone turns back and 
           Johansson calms himself, continues.

                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                        The game is called One Card Stud. I have 
                        staked our celebrity friends with one 
                        million American dollars.  Consider it a 
                        gift.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Oh, no, we can’t acce--

           Gary SMACKS MANNY in the face with the back of his hand 
           without so much as changing his expression.

                                 GARY
                        Please continue. 
                                 JOHANSSON
                        Twelve men sit at this table, twelve 
                        cards will be dealt.  One card per man.

           CARDS are dealt.  Each man, without looking, TUCKS IT 
           INTO the front of his tiara so that the card faces out.  

           Goes without saying: it’s an odd sight.

                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                        You bet when you think you have high 
                        card.  You fold when you think you do 
                        not.  It is about reading your opponent.

           Johansson smiles, crosses his legs.

                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                        You see, my famous little purplish 
                        friends, I do not read books. I read 
                        people.  Sometimes I even go to libraries 
                        to read people.  Because it is often most 
                        interesting to read people while they are 
                        reading books.  If you know what I mean.

           No one does.

                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                                (frustrated)
                        IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN THAT I READ 
                        PEOPLE!?

           QUICK MURMURS OF AGREEMENT (”sure, sure,” “you’re great 
           at that” “Yes, especially in libraries”).

                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                        Henric starts the betting.

           Henric (with a KING in his Tiara), throws down his card.

                                 HENRIC
                        I fold.

                                 NICOLAS
                        You had King!
                                (under his breath)
                        Faggot.

                                 HENRIC
                        What was that?

                                 NICOLAS
                        You hear me.
           Henric shakes his head at Gary and MOUTHS, “Do you see 
           what it is I’m dealing with?”  

           Gary smiles gently, MOUTHS BACK, “Don’t let it get to 
           you.”

           Henric SIGHS and SLURPS down his entire drink, calls for 
           ANOTHER.

                                 HENRIC
                                (to Nicolas)
                        You’ll be sorry for talking this way to 
                        me, you overgrown moron.

                                 NICOLAS
                        What did you say?

                                 HENRIC
                                (imitating Nicolas)
                        You hear me.

           Nicolas JUMPS at Henric.  Johansson SLAMS the table with 
           his hand and Nicolas instantly sits... a dog restrained.

                                 JOHANSSON
                        Enough.  If I want more children why did 
                        I tie up my baby juice inside of me!?  So 
                        stop acting like children or I... will 
                        release my baby juice...  

           He peters out, losing even himself.

                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                        CONTINUE THE BETTING!

           The game continues to go AROUND THE TABLE, some men FOLD, 
           some men BET.  The bet comes to Gary.  He holds a “TEN.”

           He looks at Johansson who holds a JACK.

                                 GARY
                        So, Mr. Johansson.  You say you like to 
                        read people’s souls.  What do you see 
                        when you look at me?

                                 JOHANSSON
                        I see that despite your vast riches, Gary 
                        Coleman, you cannot take your eyes off 
                        the money in front of you.  I see a man 
                        who values money above all else.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Wow!  That’s so true!
                                 GARY
                        Shut up.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        But he’s spot on! 
                                (to Johansson)
                        Do me!  Do me!  Am I ever gonna get 
                        married?

                                 GARY
                        Shut up, Manny!

           Emmanuel goes quiet.  After a beat, Gary regains his 
           composure and his James Bond demeanor.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        Would you like to know what I see when I 
                        look at you, Mr. Johansson?

                                 MR. JOHANSSON
                        Please.

                                 GARY
                        I see a powerful man looking to feed a 
                        gigantic ego.  A man who plans on doing 
                        something big that will hurt many.
                                (then)
                        And I see a man with a better hand than 
                        me.  This time.

           Gary FOLDS.  Henric sits up, already drunk and SLURRING.

                                 HENRIC
                        Good work, Gary!  Adorable AND intuitive!  
                        Let me ask you... can you tell just by 
                        looking at him that he always sides with 
                        Nicolas over me?

                                 JOHANSSON
                                (tense)
                        That’s enough, Henric.

                                 HENRIC
                        And what can I do?  He is Ludvig
                        Johansson!  And on Saturday when we gain 
                        access to your Hollywood - with my plan I 
                        might add - even your famous leader Bush 
                        won’t be able to stop him--

                                 NICOLAS
                        Henric!

           Gary and Emmanuel share a quick look.
                                 HENRIC
                        Oh, I’m sorry, should I not say this?  
                        I’m just such a FAGGOT--

           Johansson leans over to Nicolas.

                                 JOHANSSON
                        I think Henric needs to use the restroom.

                                 HENRIC
                        I’m fine actually.

                                 JOHANSSON
                        Nicolas, help him to the restroom please.

           Nicolas pulls Henric away.  Everyone sits there in 
           awkward silence.  Finally, Johansson turns to Emmanuel.

                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                        In answer to your question: you will 
                        marry many times, Emmanuel Lewis.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Yay!

                                 JOHANSSON
                        Now, let us gamble.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CASINO RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Nicolas pushes Henric inside.

                                 NICOLAS
                        You idiot!  You practically give plan 
                        away.

                                 HENRIC
                        I am the one who found the bomb!  I will 
                        not be bullied by you anymore, Nicolas.  
                        My love of Gary Coleman has changed me.

           Nicolas smiles, a dangerous smile.

                                 NICOLAS
                        Yes, well, now your love of Gary Coleman 
                        will kill you.

           Henric’s face drops as Nicolas LOCKS THE DOOR.

                                                               BACK TO:
           INT. HIGH ROLLER ROOM - NEXT FEW HOURS

           As TIME PASSES we watch the men at the table gamble.

           - JOHANSSON wins a hand, LAUGHS and DRINKS.

           - GARY wins a hand, smiles at Johansson.

           - EMMANUEL helps Garry scoop up his winnings.  Gary slaps 
           his hand away from his chips.

           - ONE BY ONE, players exit the tournament.

           - Eventually, EMMANUEL loses to Johansson.  

           - Soon, only Gary and Johansson remain... each with LARGE 
           PILE OF CHIPS.

           We break from the GAMBLING MONTAGE as...

           NICOLAS returns to the table.  His shirt is splattered 
           with BLOOD.  Everyone looks up at him. 

           Beat.

                                 NICOLAS
                        Henric has a stomachache. 

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Ouch.  Is it bad?

           Nicolas looks at Johansson, nods.

                                 NICOLAS
                        As bad a stomachache as one can have.

           Johansson smiles, then... catches Gary’s eye.  Gary looks 
           at him, knowingly. 

                                 JOHANSSON
                        And so we are down to final two: Gary 
                        Coleman and myself. I have dreamt of this 
                        test ever since seeing the episode of 
                        Different Strokes where the evil bike 
                        shop owner tries to molest Gary Coleman’s 
                        handsome friend Dudley and Gary Coleman 
                        saves the day by alerting authorities.

           Two CARDS are DEALT.  Both men go to put their cards in 
           their TIARA’S... but Johansson stops.
                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                        Would you care to play this one blind, 
                        Mr. Coleman?

                                 GARY
                        It’s your game, Mr. Johansson.

           Both men lie their CARDS FACE DOWN, neither looking at 
           them.  The crowd GASPS.  

           Emmanuel looks confused, turns to Vilhelmina.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Is it just me or is this the most idiotic 
                        thing I’ve ever seen?

                                 VILHELMINA
                        Yes.  Ees very eediotic.

           Meanwhile, Gary and Johansson are locked on each other.  
           They hold conversation, never breaking their gaze.

                                 GARY
                        Tell me about this big project of yours 
                        in Hollywood.

                                 JOHANSSON
                        Happily. First, you say “What’chu talking 
                        about Willis?”

                                 GARY
                        I think you know I won’t do that.

                                 JOHANSSON
                        As do you, Mr. Coleman.

           Gary smiles, masking his irritation.

                                 GARY
                        What did you do to Henric?

                                 JOHANSSON
                        Nothing he didn’t do to himself.

                                 GARY
                        What’s in Hollywood?

                                 JOHANSSON
                        “What’chu talking about Willis?”

                                 GARY
                        Hollywood?  Saturday?
                                 JOHANSSON
                        Willis?  What’s he talking about?

                                 GARY
                        Tell me.

                                 JOHANSSON
                        Say it.

           Emmanuel jumps up from his seat, interrupting:

                                 EMMANUEL
                        WHAT’CHU TALKIN’ BOUT WILLIS!?  THERE!  I 
                        SAID IT!  ENOUGH!  JESUS!

           Everyone looks at Emmanuel for a beat, then turn their 
           attention back to the game.

                                 JOHANSSON
                        All in.

           He PUSHES all his chips in.  The crowd GASPS, then 
           APPLAUDS.  Gary hesitates.

                                 GARY
                        I’d be wise to fold, or else I risk 
                        blowing all my money.

           Johansson smiles, reaches for the pot.  

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        Then again... I’m Gary Coleman.  I’ve 
                        blown all my money plenty of times.
                                (a beat)
                        I call.

           Gary shoves his CHIPS into the center of the table.  The 
           place ERUPTS!

           Johansson’s FACE DROPS.  He TURNS his card.  A JACK!  
           Gary TURNS his...

           A KING!  GARY WINS!  Johansson stands, furious.

                                 JOHANSSON
                        You realize that required no skill of any 
                        kind.

                                 GARY
                        I do.  

                                 JOHANSSON
                        As long as you know.
           Johansson STORMS away.  Nicolas follows him.  

                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                                (to Nicolas)
                        I have looked in their souls. You are 
                        right: they are more than just the 
                        world’s preeminent superstars.  Tomorrow 
                        morning we get to the bottom of Gary 
                        Coleman and Emmanuel Lewis... even if I 
                        have to dig to the bottom of them myself.

           Nicolas smiles sadistically.  He takes a look back at...

           GARY AND EMMANUEL:

           As they revel in the ADULATION of the SPECTATORS, 
           completely unaware of what awaits them.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. HOTEL - LATER THAT NIGHT

           The LIMOSINE pulls to a stop in front of the hotel.  Gary 
           EXITS, followed by Emmanuel and Vilhelmina.  

                                 GARY
                        Well, thanks for the ride home, 
                        Vilhelmina.  We’ll see you tomorrow?

           Emmanuel steps forward, puts a hand on Gary’s shoulder.

                                 EMMANUEL
                                (pointedly)
                        Goodnight, Gary.

                                 GARY
                        Goodnight? Where the hell are you going?

                                 EMMANUEL
                                (pointedly, again)
                        I’m not going anywhere, Gary. 

           Emmanuel NODS toward Vilhelmina.  Gary looks at her, 
           confused.  She looks away, embarrassed.  

           Gary slowly smiles, getting it.

                                 GARY
                        Ohhhhh! I see!  Hadn’t realized Webster 
                        was laying his web!
           Gary looks at Vilhelmina: beautiful, blond, really 
           fucking tall.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        Vilhelmina.

           He looks at Manny: nervous, adorable, really fucking
           small.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t break him.

           Gary EXITS.  Manny CHUCKLES, sheepish.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        That guy... he’s just so... the thing 
                        is... are you hungry?

           Awkward silence.  Vilhelmina steps toward him.

                                 VILHELMINA
                        Emmanuel?  

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Yes?

                                 VILHELMINA
                        I want you--

                                 EMMANUEL
                        I want you too, Vilhelmina!  I want you 
                        so bad it feels like I have a hernia!

           She continues undeterred.

                                 VILHELMINA
                        I want you... to listen to me, Emmanuel.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Oh.  Should have let you finish I guess.

                                 VILHELMINA
                        My boss ees not neece Man, Emmanuel.  You 
                        are in danger.  You must leave 
                        Sveeterland.

           Emmanuel takes this in for a long beat, then...

                                 EMMANUEL
                        I feel really weird about saying that I 
                        wanted you just now.  I was just caught 
                        up in the moment, too much to drink 
                        maybe. 
                                      (MORE)
                                      EMMANUEL (CONT'D)
                        And you never know, I might actually have 
                        a hernia.  I mean, I’ve been lifting my 
                        suitcase a lot and--

           Suddenly, Vilhelmina SCOOPS him up like a doll and KISSES 
           HIM, the most romantic and bizarre kiss of all time.

           Finally, the kiss ends and they pull apart.  

           She puts him down.

                                 VILHELMINA
                        Just be careful, Manny.  Sveetzerland is 
                        a dangerous place for a neece person.

           She gets into the limosine and pulls away.  Emmanuel 
           can’t take the shit-eating grin off of his face.  

                                                             SMASH CUT:

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Emmanuel bursts into Gary’s hotel room.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        I kissed her, Gary!  Well, she kissed me. 
                        And I know what you’re going to say: that 
                        she’s too tall and too beautiful and that 
                        I’m a joke and she’d never like me in a 
                        zillion years but I DON’T CARE!  She 
                        picked me up like a Care Bear Doll and 
                        kissed me and I LOVE HER so there!

           He turns to go.  Gary’s voice stops him.

                                 GARY
                        Manny?

           Emmanuel turns around.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        I don’t know.  I mean...
                                (struggling)
                        I guess I can see how someone like her 
                        might be able to like someone like you.  
                        I guess.  If she was like, a little drunk 
                        or kind of retarded or something.

           It’s as close to “tender” as Gary Coleman gets. 
                                 EMMANUEL (CONT’D)
                        Gary! Thank you.  And I’ve gotta say: if 
                        you just lightened up a little I think 
                        you’d be a pretty easy guy to like yours--

                                 GARY
                        Get out.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Yep.

           Emmanuel turns and EXITS.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NEXT MORNING

           It’s early.  Emmanuel lies in bed, still grinning.

           A KNOCK on the door jolts him from sleep.  He gets up.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Okay, okay!  Gary, gee whiz, I’m coming--

           He opens the DOOR, revealing...

           NICOLAS!

                                 NICOLAS
                        Mr. Johansson wishes to see you for 
                        breakfast.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Oh, okay great.  Lemme just put my face 
                        on and--

                                 NICOLAS
                        Now.

           Emmanuel’s face drops.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           Nicolas pushes Emmanuel and Gary through the lobby.  Gary 
           leans in toward Emmanuel, speaks in WHISPERS.

                                 GARY
                        Were you able to get your wire on?

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Yeah.  You?
           Gary NODS just as Nicolas pushes them through the DOOR.

           EXT. HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           Nicolas heads toward his LIMOSINE, parked in front.  

                                 GARY
                        Hey, Nicolas?  Why don’t we take our car?  
                        You ever drive a Honda Pilot before?

           Gary TOSSES Nicolas HIS KEYS.  Nicolas GRUNTS, tempted.  

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                                (tempting him)
                        It’s a really smooth ride.

           Nicolas is torn.  After a beat, he grunts and pushes them 
           toward the Honda.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        So... Nicolas.  Is Henric feeling better 
                        today?  

                                 NICOLAS
                        No.  He is not.

           Nicolas opens the CAR DOOR, pushes Gary and Emmanuel in.

           INT. PING PONG ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Nicolas leads Gary and Emmanuel into Johansson’s empty 
           PING PONG ROOM, REVEALING...  

           Johansson is PLAYING PING PONG with his SON, WILLIS.  
           Willis wins a point with a wicked backhand.

                                 WILLIS
                        Game point for me!

                                 JOHANSSON
                        What are you talking about?

           Willis hesitates, confused.

                                 WILLIS
                        That was twenty.  It’s game point for me.

                                 JOHANSSON
                        What’chu talking about, Willis!?
                                 WILLIS
                        Daddy, it’s not funny.

                                 JOHANSSON
                        What’chu talking about, Willis!?

                                 WILLIS
                        Daddy, stop!

                                 JOHANSSON
                        What’chu talking about, Willis?

                                 WILLIS
                                (near tears)
                        I hate when you do this!

                                 JOHANSSON
                        What’chu talking about, Willis?

                                 WILLIS
                        I HATE YOU!

           Willis, crying, STORMS OUT.  Johansson calls after him.

                                 JOHANSSON
                        You are unworthy of the name bestowed 
                        upon you!

           Johansson SMASHES a PING-PONG BALL against the wall.

                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                                (without turning)
                        If you can’t tell by now, Mr. Coleman and 
                        Mr. Lewis, I am not a man to be 
                        disappointed.  It has begun to occur to 
                        me that perhaps you have disappointed me 
                        as well--

           Gary steps forward.

                                 GARY
                        Mr. Johansson?  I’m sorry, I really need 
                        to use the bathroom if you don’t mind.

                                 JOHANSSON
                        Now?

                                 GARY
                        Small guy, small bladder - remember?  And 
                        I know Emmanuel has to go too.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        No, I don’t.
                                 GARY
                                (pointedly)
                        But you always have to go.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Not now.

                                 GARY
                        Now.

                                 EMMANUEL 
                        I really don’t have to pee, I swear.

                                 GARY
                                (under his breath)
                        Well, then don’t pee.

                                 EMMANUEL
                                (under his breath)
                        If you think I’m going number two in 
                        someone else’s house you’re crazy.

           Gary clamps a hand around Emmanuel’s neck.

                                 GARY
                        If you’ll just excuse us one second.

           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           They ENTER.  Once the door closes, Gary grabs Emmanuel.

                                 GARY
                        I have a bad feeling.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Well, then I certainly don’t want to be 
                        in here to watch, Gary.  

                                 GARY
                        Listen to me you idiot: Johansson’s 
                        falling apart, acting strange.  We have 
                        to dump our wires.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Oh.  Yeah, that’s probably a good idea.

           They start RIPPING WIRES off from underneath their 
           clothing, dumping them in the toilet.
           INT. PING PONG ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Gary and Emmanuel RETURN.  Nicolas and Johansson wait.     

                                 GARY
                        Sorry about that, you were saying?

                                 JOHANSSON
                        I pay for you to come out here.  I show 
                        respect by naming my son for your 
                        program.  I make “Gary Coleman and 
                        Emmanuel Lewis Day” a national holiday.  
                        And how do you repay me--

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Wait, I didn’t know about the holiday 
                        thing?

                                 GARY
                        Me neither, when did you do that?

                                 JOHANSSON
                                (sheepish)
                        The other day.  I was going to surprise 
                        you.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        That’s really cool.  Thanks, Mr. 
                        Johansson.

                                 JOHANSSON
                                (embarrassed)
                        It’s just a national holiday.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Well it’s very generous of you, really. 
                                (then)
                        I’m sorry, you were saying?

                                 JOHANSSON
                        Oh, yes.
                                (then; back to evil)
                        And how do you repay me!?  By working 
                        against me as agents of my enemies!

                                 GARY
                        What are you trying to say?

           Johansson NODS at Nicolas.  Nicolas steps forward, RIPS 
           open Gary’s shirt.  There’s nothing but a WIFEBEATER.
           Nicolas looks at Johansson, confused.  Johansson NODS at 
           Emmanuel.  Same thing: ripped shirt, no wire.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Damn!  That shirt was custom!  

                                 JOHANSSON
                        I’m sorry.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        You think I can just walk into any store 
                        and find a silk shirt tailored to my 
                        size!? 

                                 JOHANSSON
                        No, I do not... But I thought...

           Johansson gathers himself.

                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                        If I am wrong about my instinct, I 
                        apologize with great sadness. 

           He looks at Nicolas, NODS.

                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                        Your visit has become distraction.  I 
                        have important business to attend to, 
                        something years in the making. See 
                        yourselves out of my house and my 
                        country. Quickly.

           He turns on his heels and EXITS (with Nicolas).  

           Once he’s gone, Gary and Emmanuel breath a SIGH OF 
           RELIEF... but then, Johansson peeks back in.

                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                        Before you go: you won’t just say it one 
                        time?

                                 GARY
                        No.

                                 JOHANSSON
                        I will give you my son.

                                 GARY
                        Not happening.

                                 JOHANSSON
                        My ping pong table and my son? 
                                 GARY
                        Nope.

                                 JOHANSSON
                        Both were made by the Chinese.

                                 GARY
                        Uh-uh.

                                 JOHANSSON
                        Damn you, Gary Coleman!

           He STORMS OUT. Gary and Emmanuel share a look then... 

           They GO AFTER HIM!

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Nicolas and Johansson walk briskly down the hall.

                                 NICOLAS
                        Everyone is ready and waiting for you.

                                 JOHANSSON
                        They better be.

           They CLEAR FRAME.  Once they do... GARY and EMMANUEL 
           EMERGE.  They give chase.

           EXT. LAWN - CONTINUOUS

           Nicolas and Johansson EXIT the back of the house.  They 
           cross a LONG LAWN and ENTER A SECOND BUILDING! 

           After a beat... Gary and Emmanuel EXIT the house, DART 
           across the lawn, and arrive at that second building. 

           They OPEN THE DOOR, REVEALING...

           INT. UNKNOWN BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           It’s dark.  Confusing.  There are WIRES everywhere.  

           They stop in their tracks, hearing something in the 
           distance.  It sounds like... LAUGHTER.  GROUP LAUGHTER. 
           And is that... APPLAUSE?

           Gary and Emmanuel head toward the NOISE and the LIGHT... 
           revealing:
           IT’S A SOUNDSTAGE!  The kind of set you’d find on a multi-
           camera sitcom.  A stage.  Lights.  A FULL AUDIENCE.  

           Gary and Emmanuel are completely confused.  They look out 
           to the stage where a “SHOW” is in full performance.  

           It’s the most offensive sit-com you’ve ever seen.

           ON STAGE

           A SMALL ASIAN CHILD sits on a couch between TWO WHITE 
           PARENTS.  

                                 WHITE MOM
                        Do you know why we’re mad at you, Chinky?

                                 ASIAN CHILD
                                (broken English)
                        Because you racists who adopt me for tax 
                        break?

           The jam-packed AUDIENCE explodes into CANNED SIT-COM
           LAUGHTER.  The actors wait for the hysteria to die down.

                                 WHITE DAD
                        That’s not why we’re mad at you.  We’re 
                        mad because you got in a fight at school.

           The child’s face registers surprise.  Then, with a huge 
           smile...

                                 CHINKY
                                (huge)
                        YOU A CRAZY WHITE DADDY!

           The AUDIENCE HOWLS!  Pure pandemonium.  Then...

                                 JOHANSSON (O.S.)
                        No!  Not good enough!

           In the center of the audience, Johansson STANDS.

                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                        Chinky must be the breakout star!  That 
                        is his catchphrase!  You must deliver 
                        “You a crazy White Daddy” like a real 
                        adorable Asian!
                                (then, horribly racist)
                        Ru a crazy Rite Raddy! Say it!

                                 ASIAN CHILD
                        You a crazy White Daddy!
                                 JOHANSSON
                        Ru a razy Rite Raddy!

                                 ASIAN CHILD
                                (confused)
                        You a crazy White Daddy?

                                 JOHANSSON
                        Ru a razy Rite Raddy!

           Exasperated, Johansson THROWS down his notebook in 
           frustration.  He begins pacing the aisle.

                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                        In just 48 hours we will gain our access 
                        to Hollywood!  Even their leader Bush 
                        will not be able to stop us!  WE WILL 
                        STRIKE AT THE HEART OF THE AMERICAN 
                        PEOPLE BY EXPLODING THEIR PEOPLE’S CHOICE 
                        AWARDS!  THE PEOPLE WILL HAVE NO CHOICE 
                        ABOUT THAT!

           The crowd CHEERS!  Gary and Emmanuel share a shocked look 
           as Johansson continues his speech.

                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                        The bomb will kill every major star in 
                        Hollywood who attends.  And the chemical 
                        fallout will destroy the rest.  No stars 
                        will survive.  No soundstages will remain 
                        standing.  And when Hollywood is no more, 
                        where will the world turn for their 
                        entertainment?  WHERE WILL THEY TURN!?

                                 CROWD
                        SWITZERLAND!

                                 JOHANSSON
                        Switzerland! The one place prepared for 
                        this attack because we DID it!  I have 
                        spent years putting into place all that 
                        we need here to fill void: studios, film 
                        equipment, back-lots!  We will have shows 
                        ready to sell, movies in post-production, 
                        and most importantly: a little Asian 
                        named Chinky who will go on lunch-pails 
                        and cereal boxes all over the world!

           More FRENZIED APPLAUSE!
                                 JOHANSSON (CONT’D)
                        Soon... Switzerland will not be known for 
                        just for neutrality, but as entertainment 
                        capital of the world!  Now: Chinky, 
                        please!  Be more Asian!  I’m later for my 
                        Cowboy movie run-through.

           The rehearsal continues.  We head BACK TO GARY AND 
           EMMANUEL but...

           They’re already gone!

           EXT. LAWN - CONTINUOUS

           They YELL breathlessly as they RUN across the lawn:

                                 EMMANUEL
                        WE DID IT! WE CAN TELL ARMSTRONG THE 
                        PLAN! 

                                 GARY
                        I CAN’T BELIEVE THIS ACTUALLY WORKED!

                                 EMMANUEL
                        JOHANSSON’S OUT OF HIS MIND!

                                 GARY
                        DOES HE REALLY THINK THAT SITCOM COULD 
                        WORK!?

                                 EMMANUEL
                        AN ASIAN KID ADOPTED BY WHITE PARENTS?  
                        PLEASE!

                                 VILHELMINA (O.S.)
                        Emmanuel?

           They stop.  Vilhelmina stands near the house.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Vilhelmina?

                                 VILHELMINA
                        Emmanuel, what are you doing here?

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Oh... well, it’s a bit complicated--

           She smiles, misinterpreting his awkwardness.
                                 VILHELMINA
                        You weeshed to speak with me about last 
                        night, no?  There ees much to say.  For 
                        us both, I theenk.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Yes, there is.  But... that’s not why I’m 
                        here. 

                                 VILHELMINA
                                (confused)
                        It’s not?

           Gary COUGHS.  They don’t have time for this.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Vilhelmina, I do want to talk but it’s a 
                        really bad time right now.  I have to go--

                                 VILHELMIN
                                (confused)
                        Go where?

           Emmanuel looks at Vilhelmina.  She’s lost.  He steps 
           forward, takes her hand.  She bends down to eye level.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        You were right about your boss, 
                        Vilhelmina.  He’s not a nice man.  And I 
                        haven’t been nice to you, either.  I 
                        haven’t been honest.  

           He takes a deep breath, melodramatic.

                                 EMMANUEL (CONT’D)
                        I’m a spy, Vilhelmina.  A covert 
                        operative for the United States 
                        government.  It’s a dangerous job, and 
                        because it’s dangerous, I sometimes have 
                        to lie to those that matter most to me--

                                 GARY
                                (under his breath)
                        Jesus Christ, seriously?

           Emmanuel pauses, regains his composure.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Your boss is going to unleash a chemical 
                        bomb on the People’s Choice Awards in 
                        Hollywood on Sunday night, Vilhelmina-- 
                                (to Gary)
                                      (MORE)
                                      EMMANUEL (CONT'D)
                        A really weird plan when you think about 
                        it, huh?

           Gary NODS.

                                 EMMANUEL (CONT’D)
                        Anyway... we have to go warn the people 
                        who can stop him--

                                 VILHELMINA
                                (head spinning)
                        I don’t understand.  Where are you going?

                                 EMMANUEL
                        There’s an American military base 
                        disguised as a ski chalet near the hotel.  
                        We’ll go there, warn them, then I’ll meet 
                        with you at the hotel and explain 
                        everything.  Okay?

           She NODS, lost.  Emmanuel, always the action star, turns 
           to Gary.

                                 EMMANUEL (CONT’D)
                        Let’s roll.

                                 GARY
                        Wow.  You’re just completely off the 
                        reservation aren’t you?

           They turn to go.  But once they do...

                                 VILHELMINA (O.S.)
                        Stop them both.

           They turn back.  Vilhelmina speaks into a WALKIE-TALKIE.

                                 VILHELMINA (CONT’D)
                        Johansson was right.  They’re working for 
                        the Americans.

           TWENTY HUGE SWEDISH GUARDS emerge out of nowhere, grab 
           Gary and Emmanuel. 

                                 VILHELMINA (CONT’D)
                                (to guards)
                        Find Nicolas.  The American base is at 
                        the ski chalet near their hotel.  He’ll 
                        know it, we’ve tracked them there before.

                                 GARY
                        You Swiss bitch!  

           Vilhelmina approaches them.
                                 EMMANUEL
                                (lost)
                        I don’t understand.  You knew that I... 
                        the whole time you were... 
                                (softly)
                        How could you do this to me?

           She kneels down, smiles sadly at Emmanuel.

                                 VILHELMINA
                        Johansson promeesed to make me the 
                        world’s beeggest movie star, Manny.  
                        Bigger even than Nicole Eggert of Charles 
                        in Charge.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        But she’s not even a star anymore!

           Vilhelmina CHUCKLES, sadly.

                                 VILHELMINA
                        Always trying to make me laugh, even at 
                        his lowest point.
                                (then)
                        I tried to warn you, Emmanuel.  
                        Sweetzerland is a not a safe place for 
                        neece person.  

           Her face hardens as she turns to one of the GUARDS.

                                 VILHELMINA (CONT’D)
                        Hold them here until Nicolas and his team 
                        finish with the Americans. 
                                (a beat)
                        Then kill them both.

           One last sad smile at Emmanuel... and she’s GONE.  

           As Emmanuel’s heart drops, TWO GUNS are simultaneously 
           raised at the heads of our heroes.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. LAWN - LATER

           Gary and Emmanuel are on their knees, GUNS still leveled 
           at their heads by TWO GUARDS. 

           Off to the side, THE OTHER GUARDS smoke.  They CALL to 
           the TWO GUARDS holding the guns.  
           The two men take a cursory look at Gary and Emmanuel, 
           then head over nearby to join in the smoking.

                                 GARY
                                (whispering)
                        Manny?

           Manny doesn’t respond.  He looks catatonic.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        Manny, look at me.

           Emmanuel turns slowly, a lost man.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        We have to get to the guns from the car.  
                        It’s our only chance.

           But Manny is in another world.  Gary thinks, calls out:

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me?  Bad guys?

           Two of them approach.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        You don’t happen to be fans of our shows?

           The guards share a look, then admit:

                                 GUARD #1
                        My son watches every Friday.

                                 GUARD #2
                        I have daughter. She adores the Weebster.

           Emmanuel doesn’t even look up.

                                 EMMANUEL
                                (sullenly)
                        I bet she just pretends to adore the 
                        Webster when she really just wants to 
                        have him killed.

           The guard SHRUGS.  Gary tries to keep on point.

                                 GARY
                        I bet you guys would be real heroes if 
                        you came home with autographed headshots.  
                        They’ll be worth a fortune after we’re 
                        dead.  I’ve got some in the trunk.  All 
                        you have to do is take us to get them. 
                                      (MORE)
                                      GARY (CONT'D)
                        We’re happy to sign until our 
                        assassinations.

           The guards look tempted.  Gary seizes the moment.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        All we ask is that you kill us quickly 
                        and painlessly.
                                (then)
                        Me more than him.

           The Guards share a look, intrigued.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Gary and Emmanuel walk toward the HONDA PILOT.  Guards 
           march ten feet behind them, guns aimed at their backs. 

                                 GARY
                                (quietly, to Emmanuel)
                        Soon as I open the trunk, we start 
                        shooting.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        What’s the point?  What’s the point of 
                        anything anymore?

                                 GARY
                        Manny: I want you to channel all that 
                        heartbreak you’ve got inside you and turn 
                        it into rage.  Your country needs you to 
                        be a forty-eight inch killing machine 
                        right now.  Are you ready to do that?  
                        Are you ready to make these Swiss 
                        bastards pay?

           Emmanuel turns to Gary.  Finally: something lights in his 
           eyes.  

           The fury within Emmanuel Lewis is about to be unleashed.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Just get me a gun.

           Gary NODS.  He takes out his key, POPS the trunk to the 
           Honda Pilot.  Revealing...

           HEADSHOTS! Lining the trunk of the car.  Gary turns back 
           to the wary guards (who see the headshots).
                                 GARY
                        Anyone got a Sharpie?

           The guards huddle, begin checking pockets.  Once they’re 
           distracted, Gary POPS the hidden PANEL, revealing...

           A FULL ARSENAL.  Gary and Emmanuel reach into the trunk, 
           quietly gathering hardware.  A GUARD approaches with PEN.

                                 GUARD #2
                        You will make mine out to Andrea?

           Emmanuel looks at Gary and NODS.

                                 EMMANUEL
                                (ala action star)
                        You wanted a headshot? Here you go.

           Synchronized: Gary and Emmanuel WHEEL AROUND, now TOTING 
           HUGE MACHINE GUNS!  

           Emmanuel SLAMS the butt of the gun into the guard’s 
           crotch as he and Gary WILDLY OPEN FIRE!  Two guards get 
           hit, the rest dive for cover.  

           FROM ABOVE

           Gary and Emmanuel let out simultaneous WAR CRIES as they 
           release a FLURRY OF BULLETS.  

           Some of the guards FALL, the rest RUN FOR COVER.

           Emmanuel grabs a load of WEAPONS and GRENADES from the 
           trunk, turns toward Gary.

                                 EMMANUEL (CONT’D)
                        No one survives.

           Emmanuel RUNS after the guards.  Gary stands there for a 
           second, then runs after him.

                                 GARY
                                (as he runs)
                        Really?  Cause I was kind of thinking 
                        we’d just get out of here now.

           But Manny’s off to the races.  Gary SIGHS, gives chase.

           EXT. LAWN - CONTINUOUS

           The guards run across the lawn toward the SOUNDSTAGE as 
           Gary and Emmanuel SPRAY FIRE at them.
           The GUARDS TURN, SPRAY FIRE BACK.

           Gary and Emmanuel DIVE for cover behind a TREE.  They’re 
           breathing hard.

                                 GARY
                        Manny: I really think we should just go  
                        warn Armstrong--

           Emmanuel BITES the pin out of a GRENADE.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Cover me.

                                 GARY
                        Wait, what?

           Emmanuel LOBS the GRENADE and takes off from behind the 
           tree as it EXPLODES in the distance.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        Jesus!

           Left with no choice, Gary PIVOTS and re-opens FIRE.

           ON EMMANUEL

           Man on fire.  He weaves side to side in SLO-MO, arms 
           crossed, a gun BLAZING in each hand.  

           ON GARY

           Chasing after him.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        Manny, slow down!  I’m gonna accidentally 
                        shoot you!

           He stops, realizing.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                                (to himself)
                        I can accidentally shoot him.

           He shakes off the idea, follows him. They reach the door 
           to the SOUNDSTAGE.  Emmanuel turns toward Gary.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Don’t stop firing until every last one of 
                        them is dead.
                                 GARY
                        Jesus, Man!  Listen, I know I told you to 
                        be a killing machine but--

           Too late.  Emmanuel BURSTS through the door.

           INT. SOUNDSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Where a full-fledged GUN BATTLE takes place on the sitcom 
           set.  

           Emmanuel runs past an end table bearing PHOTOS OF CHINKY 
           AND HIS WHITE PARENTS.

           BAD GUY GUNFIRE SHATTERS the pictures, just missing him.

           IN THE AUDIENCE

           The still seated CROWD APPLAUDS, thinking they’re 
           watching the show.  

           BACK TO ACTION

           As Emmanuel DIVES over the couch, firing in two 
           directions as he dives.  He takes out two guards, STANDS.

                                 EMMANUEL
                                (screaming to Heavens)
                        JOHANSSON!  

           The audience LAUGHS their canned sitcom laughter.  
           Emmanuel looks up, confused.

           Just then...

           A GUARD CHARGES AT EMMANUEL from behind.  GARY HURLS 
           himself at the guard and knocks him down.

           The Guard GROANS, prone on the ground and weaponless.  
           Emmanuel and Gary stand over him.

                                 GUARD
                        Please.  I have a family.

           Emmanuel COCKS his shotgun.  The crowd “WHOOS.”

                                 EMMANUEL
                                (melodramatic)
                        So did I.

           He raises gun over the soldier!  Gary is confused.
                                 GARY
                        What family?  What are you talking abo--

           Too late.  Emmanuel SHOOTS THE GUARD DEAD! 

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        Holy shit!  

           The CROWDS “OOHS” at the curse word.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Let’s roll.

           Emmanuel runs through another door.  Gary shakes his head 
           and follows him into...

           EXT. WILD WEST MOVIE SET - CONTINUOUS

           Something out of an old Eastwood movie. HORSES abound.  
           GUARDS spray GUNFIRE everywhere.  Manny spots a NEARBY 
           HORSE, runs to it.  Gary follows him.

                                 EMMANUEL
                                (to Gary)
                        Give me a boost.

                                 GARY
                        You know that’s a horse, right?

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Now, Gary!

           Gary BOOSTS Emmanuel up on the HORSE.  Emmanuel holds 
           down his hand as GUNFIRE rains around them.

                                 EMMANUEL (CONT’D)
                        You coming?

           Gary gives him his hand.  Emmanuel pulls him up on the 
           horse.  It takes a while.  Gary hangs from the horse 
           awkwardly. Finally, he’s up.

                                 EMMANUEL (CONT’D)
                                (kicking horse)
                        Ya!  Ya!

           FROM ABOVE

           Gary and Emmanuel ride, raining hell on the guards as 
           they weave through them.

           They ride between TWO GUARDS, one on each side of them.  
           Gary and Emmanuel LEAN over one another, FIRING back over 
           the other’s shoulder.  Both GUARDS DROP.

           IN THE DISTANCE

           Johansson!

                                 JOHANSSON
                                (to nearby Guards)
                        Get me out of here.

           Four more Guards rush him away, into a SALOON SET.

           BACK TO EMMANUEL AND GARY

           Emmanuel hops off the horse.  Gary awkwardly slides down 
           from the horse (it takes a while) and runs to join him.

           INT. SALOON SET - CONTINUOUS

           Your prototypical Cowboy movie Saloon.  

           As soon as the guys enter, GUARDS OPEN FIRE!  

           Gary and Emmanuel DIVE behind the “bar” as bottles of 
           fake alcohol shatter above them.  

           BEHIND THE BAR

           They breathe heavily, backs to the bar.  Emmanuel readies 
           two more GRENADES.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        On my count.  One.

                                 GARY
                        Manny, this is crazy--

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Two--

                                 GARY
                        I’m not Butch.  You’re not Sundance--

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Three.

                                 GARY
                        Oh shit.

           Emmanuel THROW TWO GRENADES over the bar.  As they 
           EXPLODE, he and Gary pop up ON TOP OF THE BAR.
           Avoiding incoming fire, they SLIDE the length of the bar 
           in opposite directions, firing all the while, as two more 
           Guards fall.  

           The two remaining guards hustle Johansson out the BACK.

           Gary and Emmanuel give chase.

           EXT. BACK EXIT - CONTINUOUS

           Johansson hops into a LIMOSINE as it speeds away.  Gary 
           and Emmanuel FIRE AFTER him until their guns run out.

           They watch the car escape off into the distance.  A long 
           beat of silence and heavy breathing.  Finally: 

                                 GARY
                        You’re a bad mother fucker, Webster.

           Emmanuel TOSSES his empty weapon aside.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Let’s get to Armstrong.

           Like that, Emmanuel Lewis, action star, walks away.  

           EXT. SKI RENTAL SHOP - LATER

           The Honda races up, parks in front. All seems quiet. Gary 
           and Emmanuel COCK their weapons, EXIT THE CAR.

           INT. SKI RENTAL SHOP - CONTINUOUS

           They ENTER, stop in their tracks:

           THE AMERICAN SENTRY lies face down at the desk.  Dead.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Oh my God.

           They walk into the main room, REVEALING:

           TOTAL CARNAGE.  American solders litter the floor, gone. 

           They are too late.

           Emmanuel turns over a body.  IT’S ARMSTRONG.  Dead.  
           Emmanuel CHOKES.  Like that he snaps out of action hero 
           mode.  All the fight leaves him instantly.
           He stands, turns, and EXITS.

           Gary stays behind a moment.  He bends down, closes 
           Armstrong’s EYES, and follows Emmanuel outside.

           EXT. HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

           Emmanuel sits on the stoop, eyes filled with tears.

           Gary EXITS the building, sits next to him.  They sit in 
           silence for a long beat.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        I did this.  I killed them.

                                 GARY
                        Manny--

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Say whatever you want but you know it’s 
                        true.  I told her exactly where they 
                        were.  She played me like a fiddle.
                                (beat)
                        You were right, Gary.  I’m a joke.  And 
                        everyone knew it except for me.

           Silence.  Gary hesitates, then:

                                 GARY
                        Do you know why I’ve always hated you?

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Yes, this is exactly what I need!  How 
                        many times do I have to apologize for 
                        some dumb thing I said in 1984!?  

           Gary takes a deep breath.

                                 GARY
                        You honestly think I care about some 
                        stupid awards show twenty-two years ago?
                                (then)
                        I hate you because as annoying as you may 
                        be - with your stupid giggle and your 
                        goofy smile - you’ve always refused to 
                        believe that you’re a joke.

           Emmanuel SIGHS.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Well, I was wrong.
                                 GARY
                        No, I don’t think you were.

                                 EMMANUEL
                                (aggravated)
                        What’s your point, Gary?

                                 GARY
                        I’M THE POINT!  Look at me!  I’m the 
                        joke, Manny.  And not because of some 
                        stupid show or some stupid catchphrase.  
                        I’m a joke because I spent my life 
                        believing I was one.  Pretty girl?  She’d 
                        never like me.  Job offer?  They just 
                        want to make fun of me.  You don’t want 
                        to turn into me, Manny.  Trust me, it’s 
                        not a lot of fun.  You are only a joke if 
                        you allow yourself to be one.  And I 
                        won’t let you do that.

           Gary looks at the shotgun next to him, picks it up.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        I haven’t exactly done anything with my 
                        life that I’m very proud of.  But I’d 
                        like to try.  I’d like to prove that 
                        maybe I’m not a joke either.  But I can’t 
                        do it alone.  I need you with me.  Much 
                        as it pains me to admit it: you’re my 
                        Sundance, Emmanuel Lewis.

           Gary stands up, dramatic.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        I never thought I’d say this in a million 
                        years but...

           He cocks his shotgun.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go save Hollywood.

           Emmanuel takes this in.  Then, slowly, he STANDS.  Cocks 
           his shotgun.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Let’s go save Hollywood.

           The music SWELLS.  Then, suddenly... it stops.

                                 EMMANUEL (CONT’D)
                        How exactly are we gonna do that?
           EXT. SKY - LATER

           An AIRPLANE crosses the night sky.

           EXT. THE BOBBY WHITE AGENCY - LATER

           A TAXI CAB drops off Emmanuel and Gary in front.

           INT. THE BOBBY WHITE AGENCY - CONTINUOUS

           They BURST INTO Bobby’s office. He sits behind his desk.

                                 BOBBY
                        Manny!  Gary!  

                                 GARY
                        Bobby, we don’t have a lot of time.  We 
                        need your help.

                                 BOBBY
                        Oh shit. What happened?  Does it involve 
                        a stripper?  Is she dead?

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Bobby, you better sit down.

           Bobby plops down in his seat, upset.

                                 BOBBY
                        Oh God.  She’s dead isn’t she?

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. BOBBY WHITE’S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER

           As Emmanuel finishes their story...

                                 EMMANUEL
                        ... then we called in an anonymous tip so 
                        that the bodies wouldn’t just be left 
                        behind, and we caught the first flight 
                        out of Zurich.  We came directly here.

           REVEAL BOBBY

           Wide-mouthed in front of the guys, speechless.

                                 EMMANUEL (CONT’D)
                        What do you think?
           Bobby rubs his face, taking it in.

                                 BOBBY
                        I think we can sell it at Fox.  For sure 
                        the CW.

                                 GARY
                        Bobby, this is real.

                                 BOBBY
                        Okay, okay.  Let’s assume for a minute 
                        that you two - Gary Coleman and Emmanuel 
                        Lewis - actually served as covert 
                        operatives in Switzerland, apparently 
                        home to the world’s most nefarious 
                        international criminal masterminds, and 
                        uncovered a terrorist plot aimed at 
                        detonating a chemical bomb in Hollywood 
                        only to watch as the team of Navy Seals 
                        you were working for were massacred after 
                        Manny was betrayed by a six foot Swiss 
                        amazon woman with whom he’d become 
                        romantically involved with.  Let’s assume 
                        that’s all true.  I just have one 
                        question.

           They wait for it.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        What the hell do you want me to do?

                                 EMMANUEL
                        We need you to get us into the People’s 
                        Choice Awards.

                                 BOBBY
                        Okay, well now you’re just being 
                        ridiculous.

                                 GARY
                        Bobby--

                                 BOBBY
                        Can’t you just call the police?  Or the 
                        White House!

                                 EMMANUEL
                        And tell them what?  This is Emmanuel 
                        Lewis and Gary Coleman calling for the 
                        President?  It was a top secret mission, 
                        Bobby!  Everyone who knew is dead!
                                 BOBBY
                        Do you know how hard it is to get tickets 
                        to the People’s Choice Awards?  I spent 
                        the entire month getting tickets for two 
                        of my clients.  

                                 GARY
                        There’s got to be a way.

           Bobby SIGHS, thinks.

                                 BOBBY
                        I got them each plus ones.  I mean, I 
                        guess I could call and ask them to take 
                        you as their plus ones.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        There you go, Bobby White!  Who are they?

                                                             SMASH CUT:

           INT. LIMOSINE - LATER

           Gary and Emmanuel wear TUXEDOS, sit next to each other.

           OPPOSITE THEM SITS...

           MR. T and JALEEL WHITE.  Both wearing tuxedos.  Awkward.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        So... Mr. T?  How you been?

                                 MR. T
                        Good, good.  I’ve been good.  Beat 
                        Cancer.  That was cool.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        That’s amazing, Mr. T!

                                 MR. T
                        My friends just call me T.

                                 EMMANUEL
                                (serious)
                        It’s an honor to be your plus one, T.  

           Gary shakes his head, turns to Jaleel White.

                                 GARY
                        And Jaleel?  What’s the latest with you?
                                 JALEEL
                        Oh, I don’t know?  I guess the latest 
                        thing is that I rented a three hundred 
                        dollar tuxedo and hired an eighty dollar 
                        an hour limo so I could bring a hot piece 
                        of ass with me to the People’s Choice 
                        Awards and look like a bigshot and maybe, 
                        just maybe, get myself a fine piece of 
                        pussy for the first time since 1994.  
                        Instead, my dumb-fuck agent calls me and 
                        tells me two of his clients are having 
                        mental breakdowns and I have to go on a 
                        triple date with Gary Coleman, Emmanuel 
                        Lewis, and mother-fucking Mr. T. 

           Mr. T GROWLS.

                                 JALEEL (CONT’D)
                        So I’m good, Man.  Never been better.

           EXT. SHRINE AUDITORIUM - LATER

           The RED CARPET is in full swing.  CELEBRITIES line the 
           carpet, doing interviews.  An ANNOUNCEMENT PLAYS:

                                 PA ANNOUNCEMENT
                        The show will begin in five minutes.  
                        Please proceed inside the Auditorium.

           We CLOSE IN on the reporter NANCY O’DELL.

                                 NANCY O’DELL
                        That’ll do it for our pre-show coverage.  
                        Don’t forget: we’ll be checking in all 
                        night backstage with Billy, who will be 
                        getting reactions from the stars just 
                        moments after they receive their awards. 

           Gary and Emmanuel’s LIMO PULLS UP.  The entourage EXITS.

           ON THE TABLEAU

           It’s an odd sight: Gary, Emmanuel, Jaleel, and Mr. T all 
           walking down the red carpet.  The PAPARAZZI GOES NUTS.

           Mr. T and Jaleel get CALLED OVER for sporadic interviews.  
           Gary and Emmanuel ignore it all, look around feverishly.

                                 GARY
                        Let’s split up.
                                 EMMANUEL
                        We have to find Nicolas.

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Gary!  Emmanuel!  One picture!

           Emmanuel puts his arm around Gary’s shoulder as they turn 
           and smile.  BULBS FLASH everywhere.  

                                 EMMANUEL
                        I think I blinked.

                                 GARY
                        Manny.  Nicolas.  Focus.

           Emmanuel NODS.  Instantly, they separate and run off.

           ON GARY

           Who heads down the red carpet, spinning people around.

           ON EMMANUEL

           Who does the same.  Looking everywhere.  Until...

           NICOLAS!

           Emmanuel spots him first.  He’s at the other end of the 
           red carpet dressed as a CAMERAMAN!  

                                 EMMANUEL
                                (calling out)
                        Gary!

           Gary turns.  Emmanuel points at Nicolas. Gary sees him.

           But so does Nicolas, who briskly heads inside. They try 
           to follow but get trapped by the surging crowd.

           INT. SHRINE AUDITORIUM - LATER

           Out of breath, Gary and Emmanuel finally get inside.  
           They search the crowd.  Under seats.  Under celebrities.  

                                 VOICEOVER
                        Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to the 
                        People’s Choice Awards.  And now, 
                        introducing your host... Craig Ferguson!

           ON STAGE
           Craig Ferguson takes the stage TO APPLAUSE.  Gary and 
           Emmanuel look up at him, only to spot...

           NICOLAS!  He’s looking out from behind the side curtain.

           Gary and Emmanuel bolt down the aisle toward stage as 
           Ferguson starts the show.

                                 CRAIG FERGUSON
                        When I was asked to host the People’s 
                        Choice Awards, I thought to myself: I can 
                        do this.  I’m a person, I know people, 
                        I’ve made choices--

           Gary and Emmanuel HOP up on the stage, interrupting.  The 
           CROWD CHEERS, thinking it’s a comedy bit.

                                 EMMANUEL LEWIS
                                (to crowd)
                        Everyone get out here now!  There’s a 
                        bomb in the building!

           The CROWD bursts into hysterics.  Gary grabs Emmanuel.

                                 GARY
                        You’re wasting time!  C’mon!

           They run off to Nicolas.  Ferguson is left alone, thrown.

                                 CRAIG FERGUSON
                        Ladies and Gentlemen: a round of applause 
                        for Gary Coleman and... the other one.

           LAUGHTER.

           INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Gary and Emmanuel part the side curtain, enter the CHAOS.  
           Cameras everywhere.  Stagehands.  PA’s.  Makeup people.  

           OFF TO THE SIDE

           ELLEN DEGENERES talks to a PRODUCER backstage.

                                 ELLEN
                        You want me to say this?  It’s not very 
                        funny.

                                 PRODUCER
                        We feel like you can make everyone laugh 
                        with it.
                                 ELLEN
                        I could tickle everyone in the audience: 
                        they still won’t laugh at this.

           Gary and Emmanuel run up toward them, frantic.

                                 GARY
                        Has anyone seen a man dressed as a camera-
                        man?  Orange t-shirt? Swiss accent?

                                 ELLEN
                        Gary Coleman!  Huge fan!  What’chu
                        talkin’ about, Willis!?

                                 GARY
                        God dammit, not now Ellen!

           He runs off.  She turns to the producer.

                                 ELLEN
                        Now that’s funny.

           BACK TO GARY AND EMMANUEL

           Who search frantically.  As they run through the chaos 
           they pass...

           BILLY BUSH

           Who is doing a stand-alone report from backstage.

                                 BILLY BUSH
                        I’m Billy Bush reporting to you from 
                        backstage at the People’s Choice Awards, 
                        where I’m just moments away from our 
                        first backstage interview.  Remember: 
                        only Access Hollywood can bring you this 
                        kind of, well, access...

           Gary and Emmanuel keep moving.  Suddenly, Gary stops.

                                 GARY
                        Wait!

           As he thinks, we hear FLASHBACK VOICES in his head.

                                 HENRIC (V.O.)
                        ...when we gain access to your Hollywood 
                        even your famous leader Bush won’t be 
                        able to stop him--

                                 BILLY BUSH (V.O.)
                        I’m Billy Bush.
                                 JOHANSSON (V.O.)
                        And when we gain access to your Hollywood 
                        even your famous leader Bush won’t be 
                        able to stop us--

                                 BILLY BUSH (V.O.)
                        Remember: only Access Hollywood can bring 
                        you this kind of, well, access...

           BACK TO GARY

           Who turns, in SLOW-MO, back toward Billy Bush.  And 
           there, holding a camera and “filming” Billy is...

           NICOLAS!

           He doesn’t see them yet.  Gary looks closer at...

           HIS CAMERA!  It has an extraordinarily large base.  Is 
           that the BOMB?

           Nicolas holds some kind of TRIGGER in his hand.  He 
           squeezes it, about to blow Hollywood to pieces.

                                 GARY
                        Manny!

           Before Manny can even react...

           Gary runs FULL SPEED at Nicolas.  He barrels over Billy 
           Bush, sending him flying, and...

           HE TACKLES NICOLAS!  The trigger FLIES from his hand!

           It ROLLS across the floor toward...

           BILLY BUSH!  Who gets up, confused.  He picks it up.

                                 BILLY BUSH
                        What the--

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Don’t!

           Emmanuel flies in, TACKLES BILLY BUSH AGAIN!  The trigger 
           again slides away across the floor to...

           ELLEN DEGENERES!  She picks it up.

                                 ELLEN DEGENERES
                        What is this?
                                 GARY
                        No!

           Gary launches himself at Ellen Degeneres, TACKLES her.  
           The trigger goes flying, sliding across the floor and...

           OUT ONTO THE MAIN STAGE!

           Gary, Emmanuel, and Nicolas all freeze. Then...

           THEY RACE ONTO STAGE!

           INT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Where Craig Ferguson continues his monologue...

                                 CRAIG FERGUSON
                        Now as many of you know, I’m not 
                        originally from the United States but... 
                        oh, you’ve gotta be kidding me--

           Gary and Emmanuel and Nicolas have RACED ONTO STAGE!

           Nicolas HAS A LEAD on them, heading toward the trigger!

           Gary DIVES and GRABS ONTO one of his legs.

           Emmanuel DIVES and GRABS ONTO the other.

           Nicolas SWATS at them and presses forward, pulling them.

           Gary PUNCHES at his knees!

           Emmanuel throws RABBIT PUNCHES at his testicles.

           The crowd is HYSTERICAL!

                                 CRAIG FERGUSON (CONT’D)
                        Ladies and Gentlemen, I swear I have no 
                        idea what is going on here.  Am I being 
                        Punked?  Ashton, is this your doing?

           IN THE CROWD

           ASHTON KUTCHER, hysterical, shakes his head “no.”

           BACK TO SCENE

           They hang onto Nicolas for dear life but can’t stop him. 
           He inches closer.  Closer.  He reaches for the trigger.  

           His fingertips graze it.  Just as he’s about to get it...
           BAM!

           A punch from the other side KNOCKS HIM OUT!

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

           Mr. T!  He stands over Nicolas like Ali over Liston.

                                 MR. T
                        I pity the fool who messes with my plus 
                        one!

           The crowd goes CRAZY.  Gary runs over to Ferguson. 

                                 GARY
                        I need your mic!

                                 FERGUSON
                        Oh what the hell.  I guess we’re off book 
                        at this point.

           He hands Gary the mic. Gary addresses the audience.

                                 GARY
                        Listen to me, everyone!

           Everyone’s LAUGHING.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        Shut the fuck up!  This is not a joke!

           That does it.  Laughter stops.  It’s gone from funny to 
           bizarre and uncomfortable in a heartbeat.  

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        This man is a terrorist!  He has a 
                        chemical bomb backstage.  We need to 
                        evacuate the building.

           Confused MURMURS from the audience.  A few people stand, 
           uncomfortable.  A few even hustle out.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Wait, wait.  Everyone relax.  We have the 
                        bomb’s trigger right here--

           He looks down.  The trigger is gone.

                                 EMMANUEL (CONT’D)
                        Oh oh.

           ON NICOLAS
           Who has regained consciousness and HOLDS THE TRIGGER.

                                 NICOLAS
                        All glory goes to Switzerland!

                                 GARY/EMMANUEL
                        NOOOOOOOOO!

           He SQUEEZES it it! They close their eyes, brace for 
           impact and...

           NOTHING.  They look at each other, confused.  After a 
           beat, they run backstage.

           INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

           They arrive at Nicolas’ camera.  A SHEET covers the base 
           of it.  They pull it back, revealing...

           THE ACTUAL BOMB!  A TIMER has been activated on it, 
           counting down from one minute.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        We have to deactivate it.

           He opens the casing.  WIRES are everywhere.

                                 EMMANUEL (CONT’D)
                        The yellow one melts skin off.

                                 GARY
                        You’re sure?

                                 EMMANUEL
                        I still use a technique I had for 
                        memorizing my Webster lines: If you had 
                        no skin, you’d be in pain.  You wouldn’t 
                        be mellow.  Mellow rhymes with yellow--

                                 GARY
                        Okay, I get it!  So if it’s not yellow 
                        than it’s between red and blue.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        I don’t know that one.

                        I think blue.

           He reaches in.
                                 EMMANUEL
                        Wait!  What if it’s red?

                                 GARY
                        I think it’s blue.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        But you don’t know?  

                                 GARY
                        No, but I’m going with my gut and trying 
                        to be a glass half full kind of guy.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        But--

                                 GARY
                        Jesus, Man!  You’re constantly saying I 
                        need to be more glass half full and I’m 
                        trying to be positive and say that the 
                        blue wire is the one and you’re gonna
                        give me shit about my decision right now?  

           Emmanuel thinks about this.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        I’m glad you’re more glass half full.

                                 GARY
                        Thanks.  Sorry if this kills you.

           Gary reaches down.  The timer ticks.  Four.  Three.  Two.

           He closes his eyes, SCREAMS, and PULLS IT!  It STOPS!  

           Long beat.  They just sit there, EYES CLOSED!  Finally...

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Are we in Heaven?

                                 GARY
                        If I go to Heaven and you’re there, I’m 
                        leaving immediately.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        That’s nice.

                                 GARY
                        All I’m saying is I’d get right on the 
                        elevator and head down to Hell.
                                 EMMANUEL
                        That’s great, Gary.  We just saved Los 
                        Angeles from a terrorist attack and 
                        you’re insulting me? 

                                 GARY
                        For God’s sake: stop being so sensitive.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Oh, okay, I’m being sensitive.  You just 
                        told me that you’d rather spend eternity 
                        in Hell than go to Heaven with me--

           We PULL UPWARDS, closing in on a single STAGE LIGHT...

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

           A SIMILAR SINGLE LIGHT. 

           We PULL DOWN, revealing that we’re in...

           INT. WASHINGTON D.C. UNDISCLOSED LOCATION - WEEKS LATER

           Gary and Emmanuel sit in front of a MILITARY PANEL.

                                 TRIBUNAL SOLDIER
                        Your debriefing is now complete.  
                        Obviously the events of the past two 
                        weeks can never be publicly disclosed. 

           SITTING ALONE in the audience is Bobby White.

                                 BOBBY
                        And just to confirm: that includes a made-
                        for-television mini-series?

                                 TRIBUNAL SOLDIER
                        Yes.

           Bobby shakes his head, disappointed.

                        All tapes of The People’s Choice Awards 
                        have been seized, all attendees have been 
                        sworn to silence under some obscure law 
                        we made up for this type of thing. 

                                 GARY
                        You can do that?
                                 TRIBUNAL SOLDIER
                        We can do anything.  It’s pretty great.
                                (then)
                        Because your country owes you its highest 
                        form of gratitude, we will now bestow on 
                        you its highest honor.

                        Gary Coleman and Emmanuel Lewis.  The 
                        President of the United States is 
                        bestowing upon you the Medal of Honor in 
                        honor of your heroic service.  You should 
                        be very proud of yourselves.

           They share a smile as medals are placed on them.

                                 TRIBUNAL SOLDIER (CONT’D)
                        You really can’t ever tell anyone about 
                        this.  I know it sucks, but you just 
                        can’t. 

           They NOD, understanding.

                                 TRIBUNAL SOLDIER (CONT’D)
                        Is there is there anything we can do that 
                        can begin to repay you for your service?

           They share a look.  Emmanuel tries first.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        We both really enjoyed that Honda Pilot.

                                 TRIBUNAL SOLDIER
                        You’ll each have one.

                                 GARY
                        I have some financial difficulties.

                                 TRIBUNAL SOLDIER
                        Not anymore.  Is there anything else?

           Gary and Emmanuel share a look, smile.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GUANTANAMO BAY - TWO DAYS LATER

           A WAITING ROOM. Gary and Emmanuel sit at SEPARATE TABLES.
           A DOOR OPENS.  In walk JOHANSSON AND VILHELMINA.  Both 
           are cuffed and wear prison garb.

           Vilhelmina is brought before Emmanuel, she sits opposite 
           him.  Johansson approaches Gary, does the same.

           ON EMMANUEL AND VILHELMINA

                                 VILHELMINA
                        Hello, Manny.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        Vilhelmina.

           ON GARY AND JOHANSSON

                                 JOHANSSON
                        You foiled my plan for world domination, 
                        Gary Coleman.

                                 GARY
                        Oops.

           BACK TO EMMANUEL AND VILHELMINA

                                 VILHELMINA
                        I’ve meesed you.

                                 EMMANUEL
                        I asked to come here for one reason and 
                        one reason alone, Vilhelmina.  

           BACK TO GARY AND JOHANSSON

                                 GARY
                        Because of me, Mr. Johansson, you are 
                        going to spend the rest of your life in 
                        prison.  I don’t know that I would wish 
                        that on my worst enemy.

           BACK TO EMMANUEL AND VILHELMINA

                                 EMMANUEL
                        I came here to tell you that you may have 
                        fooled me, you may have betrayed me, you 
                        may even have stuck your tongue so far 
                        down my throat that you almost choked me: 
                        but I am not a joke.  You are the joke, 
                        Vilhelmina.  YOU would have been 
                        overachieving by landing ME.  You’re a 
                        Heidi Klum wannabe who couldn’t scrape 
                        the gum off the shoes of Nicole Eggert.  
                        When she was young and in her prime. 
                                      (MORE)
                                      EMMANUEL (CONT'D)
                        Before the Cinemax movies and plastic 
                        surgery.  That’s what I came here to say.  
                        I wasn’t planning on the Nicole Eggert
                        thing, that just came out.

           BACK TO GARY AND JOHANSSON

                                 GARY
                        In a strange way, you gave me a reason to 
                        believe in myself again.  I figure the 
                        least I can do is give you the one thing 
                        I know you’ve been dying to hear from me.  
                        My catchphrase.  

           Johansson leans forward, practically drooling.  

                                 JOHANSSON
                        Yes!  Yes! 

           Gary leans in towards him, tantalizingly close.

                                 GARY
                        But then I thought about what you did to 
                        Armstrong and I changed my mind.  

                                 JOHANSSON
                        Noooooooo!

                                 GARY
                        Manny, you ready?

                                 EMMANUEL
                        All done here.

                                 GARY
                        Let’s roll.

           They stand and walk away.  Emmanuel lets out his GIGGLE.

                                 EMMANUEL
                                (calling back)
                        Have fun getting waterboarded.

           Johansson SCREAMS!

                                 JOHANSSON
                        DAMN YOU GARY COLE--!

           The door slams before he can complete the sentence.  

                                 THE END
