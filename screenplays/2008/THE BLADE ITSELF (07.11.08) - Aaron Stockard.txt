           EXT. DOWNTOWN CHICAGO - NIGHT

           It’s late. Security gates shutter the storefronts and the 
           windows of the office towers have dimmed. The traffic lights 
           cycle from green to yellow to red above streets that are 
           empty and stone quiet.

           EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           Twenty yards deep in a darkened alley sits a BLACK 1969 
           MUSTANG tucked behind a steel dumpster.

           INT. MUSTANG - CONTINUOUS

           EVAN McGANN (25) sits behind the wheel toying with a SNUB-
           NOSED REVOLVER. DANNY CARTER (25) is in the passenger seat 
           eyeing the gun nervously. These two have been best of friends 
           since birth, and it reflects in the ease of their rapport.

                                 DANNY
                        Put that thing away before you hurt 
                        yourself.

           Evan smiles, revealing a chipped tooth.

                                 EVAN
                        Keeps me calm.

                                 DANNY
                        Makes me nervous.

                                 EVAN
                        Everything makes you nervous- Hot 
                        cocoa makes you nervous.

                                 DANNY
                             (chuckles)
                        Well one of us has to be.

                                 EVAN
                        How about that fine-ass girl you 
                        met at Frank’s a couple weeks ago? 
                        Worked up the nerve to kiss her 
                        yet?

                                 DANNY
                        Her name is Karen. 

                                 EVAN
                        And has Karen been tagged yet?
                                 DANNY
                        Mind your business.

                                 EVAN
                             (grins)
                        Wow. It’s serious, huh? A man who 
                        won’t talk pussy with his best 
                        friend is a man in love.

                                 DANNY
                        Who said that? Joan Rivers?

           They start to laugh. But something through the windshield 
           catches Danny’s eye and he shushes Evan with a finger to his 
           lips.

           DANNY’S POV: The mouth of the alley glows a dim yellow in the 
           street lights. After a long moment, a DRUNK STUMBLES FROM THE 
           SHADOWS and pisses against the alley wall.

           Evan and Danny breathe a sigh of relief. The drunk zips up, 
           teeters back across the alley and sits against the wall, 
           pulling a bottle from his jacket.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        Looks like he’s settling in.

                                 EVAN
                        Can I shoot him?

                                 DANNY
                        Lemme talk to him first.

           Danny gets out of the car and starts down the alley. As he 
           approaches, the drunk looks up at him fearfully.

                                 DRUNK
                        Please don’t cut me, man. I ain’t 
                        got nothin’. 

                                 DANNY
                        Relax. I’m not gonna cut you. I 
                        just need a favor.

           Danny pulls a $20 bill from his wallet.

                                 DRUNK
                        Oh God, no...  I have herpes.

                                 DANNY
                        What?!
                             (then realizing)
                        No. Jesus no. Nobody’s pants are 
                        coming off...

                                 DANNY (CONT'D)
                        Listen to me: I have a very 
                        important assignment for you, okay? 
                        I need you to take this money up to 
                        the liquor store on Grand and 
                        LaSalle, get yourself a bottle, and 
                        find a seat in the parking lot.
                             (leans in: conspiratorial)
                        In about 20 minutes a friend of 
                        mine carrying a brown umbrella will 
                        come by. I need you to deliver a 
                        message to him. One I can’t give 
                        him over the phone, know what I’m 
                        saying? 
                             (off the drunk’s nod)
                        You tell him -- you listening? You 
                        tell him, ‘the birds have flown the 
                        cage.’ You do that and he’ll give 
                        you another twenty.

                                 DRUNK
                        That’s all I gotta do?

                                 DANNY
                        Easiest money you ever made.

           Danny extends the $20 bill toward the drunk. He reaches for 
           it, but Danny jerks it away.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        What are you gonna tell him?

                                 DRUNK
                        The birds are flying out of their 
                        cages.

           Danny smiles and presses the bill into the drunk’s palm. 

                                 DANNY
                        Good man. Now get moving soldier.

           The drunk nods purposefully before ambling from the alley and 
           down the street. Danny turns back to Evan with a smug grin.

                                                                CUT TO:

           SAME - MINUTES LATER 

           The mustang idles in the middle of the alley. One end of a 
           HEAVY CHAIN is fastened to the rear fender. Danny attaches 
           the other to a STEEL CAGE mounted over a door...
           Evan inches the mustang forward, pulling the chain taut. 
           Standing clear, Danny cocks his head and holds a hand up to 
           Evan: waiting -- listening for... 

           The LOW RUMBLE of an approaching EL TRAIN. Slow at first, it 
           builds swiftly to a FULL CLATTERING ROAR...

           Directly overhead, SPARKS blow sideways as the wheels SQUEAL 
           around a bend in the tracks. Danny drops his hand... 

           And Evan stomps on the gas. The mustang lurches forward, the 
           metal latch gives, and the cage rips from its hinges...

           The mustang’s BRAKE LIGHTS bathe the walls in red as the 
           train trails off and the alley falls quiet again. 

           Evan and Danny move fast: Danny stoops by the door and pulls 
           a purple CROWN ROYAL BAG from his coat. He removes LOCK 
           PICKING GEAR from the bag and sets to work on a DEAD-BOLT.

           Evan detaches the chain from the cage and the mustang’s 
           fender, and tosses it into the trunk...

                                 DANNY (O.C.)
                        In.

           Evan hurries to Danny’s side -- a flashlight in one hand, his 
           pistol in the other. 

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                             (re: gun)
                        Come on, man...

                                 EVAN
                        Shut up.

           Danny bites his tongue and they step through the door...

           INT PAWNSHOP (BACK OFFICE) - CONTINUOUS

           The FLASHLIGHT BEAM SCOURS the interior, picking up quick 
           glimpses of: 

           A MINI FRIDGE atop two rusty FILING CABINETS; A rumpled  
           MATTRESS on the floor; A CALENDAR with a swimsuit model 
           cozying up to a carburetor; A WOODEN DESK-   

                                 DANNY
                        There.

           Evan holds the beam on the desk as Danny moves to it. He 
           turns on a DESK LAMP, illuminating the entire room: a BACK 
           OFFICE stuffed with clutter.
                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        This looks like a manager’s desk, 
                        right?

                                 EVAN
                        That what we’re looking for?

                                 DANNY
                        Yeah.

           Danny tests the desk drawers: locked. He sets the Crown Royal 
           bag down and starts on the locks. 

           Evan crosses the room to a door opposite the one they 
           entered.

                                 EVAN
                        I’m gonna check the register.

                                 DANNY
                        Flashlight!

           Evan sighs and turns off his flashlight before slipping 
           through the door.

           ANGLE ON: Danny, concentrating hard. He runs a pick down the 
           inside of the lock, counting clicks... Four. He eases in a 
           TENSION WRENCH and starts on the first pin... 

           Moments later, the lock twists open and Danny pulls out the 
           drawer. A sleek, black AUTOMATIC PISTOL lays atop a NYLON 
           BANK BAG with a big, brass lock: Jackpot. 

           He removes the bag, sets it on the desk, and hurries to the 
           door Evan just went through.

           INT PAWNSHOP (FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS

           Danny pokes his head in. The pawnshop is a forest of dim 
           shapes: electric guitars strung above power tools; a couple 
           of racks of TVs. Evan is behind a counter rummaging through 
           an open cabinet.

                                 DANNY
                        Come on, man. I got it.

                                 EVAN
                        Give me a hand.

                                 DANNY
                        With what? Let’s go.
                                 EVAN
                        This dude sells weight, right? 
                        There’s gotta be a pound of reefer 
                        here, maybe two. That’s another 
                        couple grand easy.

                                 DANNY
                        No, Evan. That wasn’t the plan.

                                 EVAN
                        Fuck the plan. It’ll take two 
                        minutes... Check those cabinets 
                        over there.

           Danny shakes his head in agitation, but knows it’ll be faster 
           to help than to argue. He pushes through the door. 

                                 DANNY
                        This is how you get popped, 
                        shithead.

                                 EVAN
                        This is how you get a plasma for 
                        your bedroom.

           Danny rips open a cabinet: nothing but miniature porcelain 
           FIGURINES. He moves to the next one.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna check the office.

                                 DANNY
                        Ninety seconds-

           Suddenly, a LOUD METALLIC RATTLE makes Danny jump and his 
           eyes go wide. He turns to the front of the store:

           The security gate is up and the front door swings open. The 
           light from the streetlamps pours in alongside the THICK 
           SILHOUETTE OF THE SHOP OWNER. 

                                 OWNER
                        You won’t lose control on this 
                        stuff, sweetheart... It’s Hawaiian.

           The FLUORESCENT OVERHEADS flicker on. The OWNER, bearded and 
           clad in an orange hunting vest looms in the doorway, his 
           skinny, acne-scarred DATE by his side. 

           He spots Danny almost immediately and in a quick, practiced 
           move produces an AUTOMATIC PISTOL from his vest, spreads his 
           feet, and racks the gun while leveling it on Danny’s chest...

           Time slows down on Danny as he waits to be shot...
           BOOM. 

           A RED STAIN BLOOMS across the owner’s stomach. He collapses 
           to the floor and his gun clatters away.

           At the far end of the shop, Evan stands with his arm extended 
           -- smoke wafting from the barrel of his gun

           ANGLE ON: Danny -- frozen; mouth agape: Oh shit!

           Evan races across the shop floor and slams the front door 
           shut, shoving the shell-shocked date aside.

           On the floor, the owner writhes in a widening pool of blood, 
           clutching his stomach and groaning.

                                 EVAN
                        You alive?
                             (leaning closer)
                        You alive?!

           Evan stands over him. His eyes are afire, but his movements 
           are calm -- unhurried. 

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Where’s the weed, motherfucker!?

           Danny snaps from his fog.

                                 DANNY
                        Evan.

                                 EVAN
                        Where’s it at fucker!?

           Evan kicks the owner hard with his steel-toed boot.

                                 DANNY
                             (stronger)
                        Evan!

                                 EVAN
                        Relax!

                                 DANNY
                        No. You relax. Let’s go.

                                 EVAN
                        I ain’t going anywhere til this 
                        motherfucker tells me where his 
                        weed is at.

           He kicks the owner again -- harder.
                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                             (to owner)
                        You hear me!?

                                 DANNY
                        EVAN!

           Evan spins around and glares at Danny... But then a flash of 
           movement catches their attention and they turn to see the 
           owner’s date making a dash for the office.

                                 EVAN
                        Stop!

           She doesn’t, crashing through the door and locking it behind 
           her with an audible CLICK.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        GOD DAMMIT!

           His coolness evaporating, Evan delivers another kick to the 
           owner whose groans have turned to whimpers...

           Danny steps between them and pushes Evan back. Evan stumbles 
           but doesn’t fall, then gets up in Danny’s face -- eyes 
           narrowed, gun trembling in his hand.

                                 DANNY
                             (slow and calm)
                        Stop. We gotta take a deep breath, 
                        okay?
                             (beat)
                        Brothers.

           The tension ebbs from Evan’s body.

                                 EVAN
                        All right... Fuck the weed.

           But it occurs to Danny that he left the money on the desk in 
           the office. He drops his head and squeezes his eyes shut.

                                 DANNY
                        Shit.

                                 EVAN
                        What?

                                 DANNY
                             (pointing to the office)
                        I left the cash in there.

                                 EVAN
                        Jesus, Danny.
                                 DANNY
                        Well I hadn’t planned on a shoot-
                        out, bro. Didn’t think my fucking 
                        partner-

                                 EVAN
                        Shut it. Save that whiney bullshit 
                        for another time.

                                 DANNY
                        Fine. Nothing we can do about it 
                        now. Let’s go.

                                 EVAN
                        No.

           Evan starts back towards the office.

                                 DANNY
                        The cops will be here any second, 
                        Evan.

                                 EVAN
                        I ain’t leaving empty handed.

           Evan calls through the office door.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Lady?! Open the door or I will 
                        break it fucking down.

           Silence.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Okay... Here I come.

           Evan rears back and SLAMS the sole of his boot into the door 
           near the knob. It shudders but doesn’t give. As he winds up 
           again, a GUNSHOT rips a hole through the door, spraying 
           splinters everywhere. A SECOND BULLET punches through the 
           door and Evan dives for cover...

           A beat of silence -- stillness... And then EVAN ERUPTS. He 
           empties his gun into the door, leaps to his feet and starts 
           kicking it again -- frothing at the mouth.

           ANGLE ON: Danny. His friend gripped in a homicidal rage and a 
           stranger bleeding to death at his feet, Danny makes a 
           decision: 

           He RUNS...
           EXT STREET - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           Danny bursts through the front door of the pawnshop and 
           sprints down the sidewalk... before slowing to a brisk 
           stride, wary of drawing attention to himself.

           At the next corner he darts up the stairwell of an EL 
           STATION. The first WAILS OF A POLICE SIREN can be heard...

           After pushing through the turnstile, he heads down the 
           platform, away from A YOUNG COUPLE snuggling on a bench. The 
           LOW RUMBLE of an oncoming train starts to build...

           As the train approaches, its HEADLIGHTS bathe Danny in 
           blinding white... And as it races into the station, the RUSH 
           OF AIR snaps at his clothing -- whips up his hair. 

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           INT BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

           A pale dawn spills through the windows and onto a young 
           couple asleep in bed. 

           The man stirs, rolls onto his back and opens his eyes. It’s 
           Danny (now 32). The clock on the nightstand: 5:47 AM.

           INSERT CARD: Seven years later.

           INT BATHROOM - LATER

           The bathroom is thick with steam as Danny showers. His 
           girlfriend KAREN (32) sits on the toilet peeing -- rubbing 
           sleep from her eyes.

           She finishes, lets her bathrobe slide to the floor, and steps 
           into the shower with Danny. 

                                 KAREN
                             (groggy)
                        Morning.

                                 DANNY
                        Hey sunshine.

           They embrace.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        It’s all yours.
           Danny starts to pull away, but Karen doesn’t let him go. She 
           takes his hand and slides it onto her ass.

                                 KAREN
                        No.

                                 DANNY
                        I’m gonna be late.

           He squeezes her butt, kisses her forehead, and steps out of 
           the shower.

                                 KAREN
                        Noooooo. 

                                 DANNY
                        Raincheck.

                                 KAREN
                        It’s not raining.

           Danny chuckles.

                                 DANNY
                        I should’ve been outta here five 
                        minutes ago.

                                 KAREN
                        Well it’s not like you’re gonna be 
                        in here any more than ninety 
                        seconds so what’s the harm?

           Danny laughs... relents and steps back into the shower.

                                 DANNY
                        Mockery only makes it worse, honey.

           We can see their SILHOUETTES through the curtain wrapping 
           themselves around one another.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT PRISON CELL - MORNING

           The cellblock echoes with the fear and anger of hopeless men. 

           Evan (32) lies awake on a steel cot. The years have had a 
           more noticeable effect on him than Danny: Lines cut his face 
           into sharp angles; His body is lean and coiled... Everything 
           about him just looks hard.
           INT PRISON - DAY

           Evan stands before a steel cage. On the other side, a 
           CORRECTIONS OFFICER behind a counter pushes Evan’s belongings 
           through a small opening: A change of clothes; his wallet and 
           watch; a pair of steel-toes; and an envelope with $50 cash. 

                                 CORRECTIONS OFFICER
                             (pointing O.C.)
                        Shower and change through there.

           Evan crosses to a door and pushes it open. Inside, an 
           ENORMOUS CON, naked and sopping wet, stands under one of a 
           half dozen shower heads and stares back at him.

           EXT STATEVILLE PRISON - DAY

           A gate swings open. Evan and TWO OTHER CONS step through -- 
           free men again. 

           Evan looks for a familiar face among the SMALL GROUP OF 
           FAMILY AND FRIENDS waiting outside, but there isn’t one... 
           And so, after a beat of contemplation, Evan starts up the 
           road away from Statesville Prison -- alone.

           EXT CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

           FIVE STORIES OF STRUCTURAL STEEL rise from the ground, the 
           skeleton of what will become luxury residential lofts. 
           WORKERS ZIG-ZAG across beams in hard hats and orange vests. 
           WELDERS crouch in corners over showers of sparks.

           On the ground floor Danny talks with the foreman, JIM 
           McCLOSKEY (45) and his son MARK (23).

                                 JIM MCCLOSKEY
                        Nothing’s ever on time, Danny. You 
                        know that. It gets here by next 
                        week, we’re fine.

                                 DANNY
                        It’s getting cold already.

                                 JIM MCCLOSKEY
                        Even if it’s the week after we’ll 
                        be fine. We already got the floors, 
                        most of the wall-studding, the 
                        stuff we usually do later. Once it 
                        gets here, we’ll have the exterior 
                        up pronto... We’ll put the whole 
                        crew on it.
                                 MARK MCCLOSKEY
                        Just an early chill.

                                 DANNY
                             (snorts)
                        Yeah. Be seventy again before you 
                        know it. We’ll be working in 
                        bathing suits.

                                 MARK MCCLOSKEY
                        You mean we’ll be working.

           Danny shoots Mark a hard look -- one from his old life. It’s 
           still effective and Mark’s eyes shift to his feet.

                                 DANNY
                             (to Jim)
                        Why don’t we finish up inside.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT TRAILER - DAY

           Establish. A small trailer atop cinder-blocks serves as an on-
           site office.

           INT TRAILER - CONTINUOUS

           It’s cramped and cluttered inside. PLANS and REGULATIONS 
           paper the walls; FAST FOOD WRAPPERS are strewn everywhere; 
           Stack after stack of NEWSPAPERS and FILE FOLDERS.

           Danny sits in a chair. McCloskey stands, his hard hat tucked 
           under one arm.

                                 JIM MCCLOSKEY
                        I’m sorry about that, Danny. He 
                        works hard, but still got that 
                        angsty bullshit-

                                 DANNY
                             (cutting him off)
                        Don’t worry about it. I mouthed off 
                        to plenty of people in my day. 
                        Imagine you did too.

                                 JIM MCCLOSKEY
                             (chuckles)
                        One or two.

                                 DANNY
                        It’s forgotten.
                                 JIM MCCLOSKEY
                        I’ll make sure it doesn’t happen 
                        again.

                                 DANNY
                        I didn’t bring you in here to chew 
                        you out about your boy...
                             (hesitates)
                        I’m sorry, Jim, but I’m going to 
                        recommend to Richard that we put 
                        the site on hold for the winter.

                                 JIM MCCLOSKEY
                        That’s a mistake. We can get it 
                        done. We got two months -- maybe 
                        more.

                                 DANNY
                        Maybe.

                                 JIM MCCLOSKEY
                        I’m telling you, we can.

                                 DANNY
                        Let me level with you: We’re 
                        treading water. It was not the year 
                        we hoped it would be and Richard’s 
                        starting to panic. Money’s tight. 
                        The economy is- Shit, you don’t 
                        need me to tell you what’s going on 
                        with the housing market. We had two 
                        projects default on final payments 
                        this year. Good people, just ran 
                        out of money... Remember the office 
                        building over on Racine? Our big 
                        score? That was one.

                                 JIM MCCLOSKEY
                        Jesus.

                                 DANNY
                        I’d love to see this place humming 
                        all winter, I really would. But 
                        it’s a bad play. Something goes 
                        wrong, we can’t get the other two 
                        ready...

                                 JIM MCCLOSKEY
                        What about my crew?

                                 DANNY
                        I talked Richard into moving them 
                        onto the two other sites. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DANNY (CONT'D)
                        We may have to go to shifts, but no 
                        one loses their job this winter.

                                 JIM MCCLOSKEY
                        And me?

                                 DANNY
                        We have work for you, Jim. And 
                        you’ll get to finish here.

           McCloskey nods -- mulling things over.

                                 JIM MCCLOSKEY
                        All right. I’ll tell my boys.

           The foreman starts for the door, then turns back.

                                 JIM MCCLOSKEY (CONT’D)
                        Hey Danny. I appreciate you being 
                        straight with me like that. 

                                 DANNY
                        No worries, Jim.

           McCloskey exits and Danny beams a little, proud of the way he 
           handled that.

           INT EVAN’S UNCLE’S HOUSE - EVENING

           Underneath a “WELCOME HOME” banner tacked to the wall, Evan 
           sits on a couch next to an old girlfriend, DEBBIE. She’s in 
           her early 30s, but too many nights at the end of a bar have 
           her looking closer to 40. Her make-up is thick -- her clothes 
           a few sizes too tight.

           EVAN’S UNCLE (60s, with the reddened, bulbous face of a long-
           time heavy drinker) is slumped in a chair across from them, 
           close to passing out. A RADIO is tuned to the local classic 
           rock station.

                                 EVAN
                        This might just be the shittiest 
                        party I’ve ever been to. 

                                 DEBBIE
                        I’m sorry, Evan. 
                             (re: uncle)
                        I shouldn’t have let him do the 
                        planning.

           Evan’s uncle emits a loud SNORE and they can’t help but 
           chuckle. Debbie fills two glasses with whiskey, hands one to 
           Evan, and raises her own.
                                 DEBBIE (CONT’D)
                        Cheers.

                                 EVAN
                        Cheers.

           They swallow their drinks in one big gulp and sit through an 
           awkward beat of silence.

                                 DEBBIE
                        I’m happy you’re back.

           Evan looks into Debbie’s earnest, glazed eyes, then pulls her 
           close to him and kisses her. And, at least for the moment, 
           the tension and discomfort drains from their bodies and the 
           kiss moves toward something more... 

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT BEDROOM - LATER

           In a back bedroom, a post-coital Debbie is asleep in bed. 
           Evan lies next to her wide-awake. After a long moment he 
           slides out of bed and pulls on a tee-shirt.

           EXT UNCLE’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Evan exits onto the porch and heads around the side of the 
           house toward a RUNDOWN GARAGE set back from the street. 

           INT GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Evan tugs the chain on a bare bulb hanging from the ceiling, 
           filling the garage with light. It’s dank and full of crap --
           everything blanketed in a thick layer of dust...

           Including Evan’s MUSTANG which sits against the far wall. And 
           while it’s seen better days, it’s still a bad-ass car. 

           He gets in, finds a KEY stashed long ago beneath the seat and 
           slides it into the ignition. He pauses for a brief moment, 
           then turns it... Nothing. Not even a click.

           Evan reclines the seat back and closes his eyes.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.
           INT CAFETERIA - DAY (MOS)

           Dressed in blue coveralls, Evan swipes a mop back and forth 
           across the floor of a huge, empty cafeteria. 

           A CUSTODIAN in his early 20s approaches Evan, shaking his 
           head with a frown. He snatches the mop from Evan and 
           demonstrates the proper technique: pushing it down the floor 
           ten paces and pulling it back over the same area; then taking 
           a step to the left and repeating the process. Evan watches 
           him, unable to hide his disdain...

           INT SAME - LATER (MOS)

           The cafeteria is still empty. At a table near a large picture 
           window, Evan sits alone eating lunch.

           INT PUBLIC BUS - DAY (MOVING - MOS)

           The Bus is packed tight with rush hour COMMUTERS. Evan is 
           wedged in deep amongst a throng of bodies. It’s more physical 
           human contact than Evan had in seven years at Statesville...

           But it makes him anxious -- claustrophobic. And as the bus 
           PULLS TO THE CURB at the next stop, he squeezes his way to 
           the door and exits...

           EXT SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS (MOS)

           Evan takes a moment to catch his breath, get his bearings. 
           Then determines which direction’s home and starts walking.

           INT LEE’S BAR - NIGHT

           Lee’s is a working-man’s bar: press-paneled walls; a warped 
           pool table in the back; a faded newspaper cutout of an 
           American flag tacked above the bourbon. 

           Danny & his best friend PATRICK (30) sit at the bar before 
           two empty pints. Patrick calls to a SHOVEL-FACED BARTENDER.

                                 PATRICK
                        Two shots of Bush.

           The bartender plunks two shot glasses onto the bar and fills 
           them with whiskey.
                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        So I’m out in the West Loop the 
                        other day, where they’re making all 
                        those fake warehouses for yuppies. 
                        You know, people like you.

           Danny smiles, taking the ribbing in stride.

                                 DANNY
                        You mean lofts?

                                 PATRICK
                        Why you people would pay four 
                        hundred thousand dollars for a 
                        house with no walls is beyond me. 
                        But anyway, it’s a good spot, 
                        decent cars, not too many people. 
                        And there’s a GTO, you know the one 
                        with the V-8?

                                 DANNY
                        Sure.

                                 PATRICK
                        So I’m in the middle of loading it 
                        when, all of a sudden, running down 
                        the street comes this dude -- looks 
                        like he might be J. Crew himself... 
                        Probably a buddy of yours.

                                 DANNY
                        Fuck you.

                                 PATRICK
                        I don’t have the car locked down 
                        yet and I don’t want to just dump 
                        my truck. And worse, the guy’s on 
                        his cell as he’s running.

                                 DANNY
                             (winces)
                        Ouch.

                                 PATRICK
                        No shit. So I’m telling myself, be 
                        cool, just pop the guy hard enough 
                        to drop him, lock down the car, and 
                        get the fuck outta there. 

           Patrick downs his shot.

                                 DANNY
                        And?
                                 PATRICK
                             (chuckles)
                        Just as I’m about to hit him, he 
                        yells to whoever he’s talking to 
                        that his car’s getting towed and 
                        hangs up. My fist is balled, but I 
                        hold off -- just stand there 
                        staring at him. Guy barely looks at 
                        me, just asks what the problem is. 
                        So I tell him he was sticking into 
                        the alley.

           They both laugh.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        Then this clown, thinking he knows 
                        all the angles, pulls out his 
                        wallet and says, what’s it gonna 
                        take to settle this right now? Dude 
                        offers me fifty bucks to lower the 
                        car I’m in the middle of stealing.

                                 DANNY
                        Did you take it? 

                                 PATRICK
                        Fuck no. Made him give me a 
                        hundred, went down the street for a 
                        steak, then came back an hour later 
                        and stole his car anyway.

           They burst into a long fit of laughter...

                                 DANNY
                             (to the bartender)
                        Can we get two more beers?

                                 BARTENDER
                        Before I get you anything you 
                        should know something.

                                 DANNY
                        What’s that?

                                 BARTENDER
                        You two start any trouble, we keep 
                        a pistol under the bar.

                                 DANNY
                             (taken aback)
                        What makes you think we’re gonna 
                        start any trouble?

           The bartender’s eyes move off of Danny and over his shoulder.
                                 BARTENDER
                        Because that big guy’s been eye-
                        fucking you since he walked in.

           Danny swivels around in his chair...

           DANNY’S POV: And there, standing against the back wall and 
           staring straight at him is Evan.

           Danny is thunderstruck, his heart hammers against his chest. 
           Evan pushes off the wall and starts toward them.

                                 PATRICK
                        Holy fuck.

           Evan steps up to them, his eyes square on Danny.

                                 EVAN
                        Long time.

                                 DANNY
                             (stammers)
                        Evan, man. Shit.

           Danny gets up and embraces Evan in a hug. Evan offers a stiff 
           pat on the shoulder and pulls away.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        You know Patrick.

                                 EVAN
                        Yeah, I know Patrick.

                                 PATRICK
                        Hasn’t been twelve years, has it?

                                 EVAN
                        No... it hasn’t.

           Patrick and Evan eyeball each other for a hostile beat -- 
           they’ve clearly got some history.

                                 PATRICK
                        I’m gonna go introduce myself to 
                        those ladies over there, let you 
                        two catch up.
                             (rising from his stool)
                        And Evan, if you’re ready to give 
                        up the dick and come back to flavor 
                        country, feel free to join me 
                        whenever you like.

           Evan smiles, reminding himself he’s not on the yard anymore.
                                 EVAN
                        Nice seeing you, Patty.

           Patrick heads off towards a table full of YOUNG, DRUNK WOMEN.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Still got your lapdog, I see.

           Danny ignores the comment and calls the bartender over once 
           again. Evan sits.

                                 DANNY
                        What are you drinking?

                                 EVAN
                             (to bartender)
                        A Brubaker... and a big whiskey.

                                 BARTENDER
                             (to Danny)
                        You too?

           Danny nods and the bartender steps away.

                                 DANNY
                        So...

                                 EVAN
                        So.

                                 DANNY
                        Bad?

                                 EVAN
                        No. It was awesome.

           The bartender returns with their drinks and sets them down. 
           Danny throws a $20 bill on the bar and raises his whiskey.

                                 DANNY
                        Welcome back.

                                 EVAN
                        Cheers.

           They clink glasses and down their shots. Danny looks Evan up 
           and down.

                                 DANNY
                        Christ, you’re fucking huge.

                                 EVAN
                        Not much else to do
                                 DANNY
                        You’re out early, huh?

                                 EVAN
                        Don’t feel early.

                                 DANNY
                        Behaved yourself?

                                 EVAN
                        Dug myself a great tunnel.

           ANGLE ON Danny: huh?

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        I busted out thirty-six hours ago. 
                        I’m on the run, man.

           Danny’s eyes go wide -- he can’t believe what he’s hearing.

                                 DANNY
                        You escaped?!

           Evan milks the moment... before breaking into a laugh.

                                 EVAN
                        Good to see you still got the panic 
                        in you, Danny.

           SAME - LATER

           Danny and Evan have finished another round.

                                 EVAN
                        The North Side. Look at you. 
                        Probably rooting for the Cubbies 
                        now -- buying five dollar coffees.

                                 DANNY
                        Something like that.

           Evan laughs.

                                 EVAN
                        And this is the girl you were with 
                        before I went in?

                                 DANNY
                        Karen. Yeah.

                                 EVAN
                        Karen... right. That worked out, 
                        huh?
                                 DANNY
                        Sure did.

                                 EVAN
                        She was at my trial, wasn’t she? 

                                 DANNY
                        I asked her to go... Figured you 
                        should have someone there.

                                 EVAN
                        You had plans that day? 

                                 DANNY
                        They’d have made me in a heartbeat, 
                        Evan. 

                                 EVAN
                        ...yeah.

           An awkward beat.

                                 DANNY
                        Listen, Brother, it’s good to see 
                        you, but I gotta head out. I’m a 
                        civilian now. Got work in the 
                        morning.

                                 EVAN
                        Oh yeah? What do you do now, Danny?

                                 DANNY
                        Construction... But I’m in an 
                        office mostly. I’m a project 
                        manager.

                                 EVAN
                        Beats shoveling shit.

           Danny nods and places two $20 bills on the bar.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        You don’t need to buy my beers.

                                 DANNY
                        Yes I do. Least I can do.

           He cringes inside, wishes he hadn’t said that.

                                 EVAN
                        All right, Danny.
                                 DANNY
                        Congratulations again, man... Good 
                        luck.

           Danny turns and walks off before his foot finds its way any 
           deeper into his mouth. 

           ANGLE ON: Evan, watching him go...

           INT DANNY & KAREN’S CONDO - EVENING

           It’s late and Danny can’t sleep. Lying on the couch, he flips 
           aimlessly through the channels on the TV.

           Off screen, he hears the front door UNLOCK and swing open: 
           Karen coming home from work. She enters the living room, 
           surprised to see Danny awake.

                                 KAREN
                        Hey sweetheart. Can’t sleep?

                                 DANNY
                        Wide awake.

                                 KAREN
                             (sweet)
                        Awww...

           Karen moves to the couch and sits next to Danny.

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        Those pesky voices stirring things 
                        up in there?

           He pulls her close to him.

                                 DANNY
                        Glad you’re home. Work okay?

                                 KAREN
                        Enh. Same... You see Patrick?

                                 DANNY
                        Yeah.

                                 KAREN
                        How’s he?

                                 DANNY
                        Same. 

           We linger on them for an extended beat...
           INT PAROLE OFFICE - MORNING

           Evan’s disheveled, overworked PAROLE OFFICER (50s) sits at 
           his desk looking through a file folder. Across from him, Evan 
           is slumped in a chair -- tired... discouraged.

                                 EVAN
                        Even if I get one of these jobs 
                        what does that mean for me? How 
                        long am I really gonna be able to 
                        get up at 4:30 in the morning to 
                        clean cow intestines off the floor? 
                        Or salt french fries with some 
                        fucked-up-looking paper hat on my 
                        head? A month? I just endured seven 
                        years in prison for Christ’s sake 
                        and I can’t imagine doing more than 
                        two weeks in some of these places  
                        before taking my AK-47 to them.
                             (pause)
                        I realize I probably shouldn’t be 
                        saying this to you, but I’m just 
                        being honest... I mean, why don’t I 
                        just save everybody the trouble and 
                        go back to stealing shit from 
                        people now? 

                                 PAROLE OFFICER
                             (takes a long look at 
                              Evan)
                        I wouldn’t blame you for it. I’d 
                        arrest you, but I’d be hard pressed 
                        to blame you.
                             (off Evan’s sideways look)
                        What do you want me to say? It’s an 
                        imperfect system, to say the least. 
                        But I’d like to talk about this AK-

                                 EVAN
                             (rolls his eyes)
                        I don’t have an AK-47. I was just 
                        saying-

                                 PAROLE OFFICER
                        Are you angry at specific people or 
                        people generally?

           Evan stands, effectively ending the conversation.

                                 EVAN
                        I’ll let you know if I find 
                        anything.  
           He turns and exits the office.

           EXT ZOO - DAY

           SHORT MONTAGE: Danny and Karen stroll through the zoo hand in 
           hand...

           A CHEETAH sleeps in the shade...

           A GORILLA slumps against a wall in his habitat. Karen sits 
           next to him (separated only by plexi-glass) talking softly to 
           him -- trying to cheer him up...

           Karen’s got a swirl of COTTON CANDY...

           SAME - LATER

           Karen sits at the edge of a park bench. Danny is stretched 
           out, his head in her lap.

                                 KAREN
                        Happy?

                                 DANNY
                        Mm-hmm.

                                 KAREN
                        Me too.

           THUD... Out of nowhere, a 5-year-old ASIAN BOY slams into 
           their bench, startling Karen and Danny.

                                 DANNY
                             (to the boy)
                        You okay?

           The boy breaks into a radiant smile and darts off. Karen and 
           Danny watch him rejoin a SMALL GROUP OF KIDS PLAYING TAG.

                                 KAREN
                        I’m gonna want one of those, you 
                        know.

                                 DANNY
                        A small Korean boy?

           She laughs, smacks him playfully.

                                 KAREN
                        I’m serious.
                                 DANNY
                        Well I don’t not want one.

                                 KAREN
                        Good... No pressure. It’s just that 
                        pretty soon it could turn into 
                        fertility clinics and triplets. I 
                        don’t want that.

                                 DANNY
                        Oh God, me neither.

           A long beat.

                                 KAREN
                        So when should we start?

                                 DANNY
                        Stop pressuring me.

           Karen gives him a playful whack.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                             (grinning)
                        I can’t breath, woman. Your love is 
                        stifling me. 

           They laugh together on the bench, very much in love, and WE 
           PULL UP & AWAY from them... WIDENING to see the whole park 
           and the city beyond. 

           EXT NORTH-SIDE STREET - DAY

           Toting his briefcase and a coffee, Danny emerges from a 
           convenience store into a stream of BASEBALL FANS converging 
           on Wrigley Field. He weaves his way through and ducks down a 
           side street...

           The GUTTURAL RUMBLE of a car engine catches Danny’s 
           attention. The Mustang, looking and running great now, crawls 
           alongside him in the street. Evan looks out from the open 
           passenger window with a shit-eating grin on his face.

           Danny stops and admires.

                                 DANNY
                        Even prettier than I remember.

                                 EVAN
                        And just as fast. Hop in, I’ll show 
                        you.
                                 DANNY
                        Shit. I wish I could, man, but I 
                        need to get out to Evanston.

                                 EVAN
                        We’ll go to Evanston then.

                                 DANNY
                             (hesitates)
                        ...All right.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT MUSTANG - DAY (MOVING)

           Evan floors it along the PARKWAY, roaring through the light 
           traffic. Evan and Danny are loving it -- like they’re sixteen 
           again.

                                 DANNY
                        Is this a parole violation?

                                 EVAN
                        Only if they catch me.

           Danny laughs.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        But don’t worry. I’ll take the heat 
                        if we get stopped.

           Evan chuckles at his dig, but Danny’s smile quickly fades.

           EXT. RICHARD’S HOUSE - MORNING

           The Mustang rolls down an upscale street in EVANSTON and 
           pulls to the curb in front of a LARGE SINGLE FAMILY HOME.

           Evan remains in the car as Danny gets out and starts up the 
           walkway toward the house. As he nears, A 12 YEAR-OLD BOY 
           (TOMMY) bursts through the front door hollering angrily:

                                 TOMMY
                        AND ONE OF THE CONTROLLERS BROKE, 
                        TOO! EVERY TWO PLAYER GAME I HAVE 
                        IS USELESS!

           Tommy storms past Danny in the driveway. Without looking up 
           or losing his red-faced scowl, his voice softens:

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        Hi Danny.
                                 DANNY
                        Hey Tommy.

           Bemused, Danny turns and watches him grumble off.

           INT. RICHARD’S HOME - MOMENTS LATER

           Danny steps through the open door into the foyer.

                                 DANNY
                             (calling out)
                        Hello?!... Richard?!

                                 RICHARD (O.C.)
                        I’m in the back, Danny!

           Danny heads down a long HALLWAY. At the far end, he enters a 
           plush DEN/OFFICE and finds RICHARD (50s, balding; in his 
           pajamas) hunched over a mess of papers spread across an 
           enormous mahogany desk.

                                 DANNY
                        Hey Boss.

           Danny removes a small bundle of papers from his bag and 
           places them in front of Richard. Richard immediately begins 
           scribbling his signature on them.

                                 RICHARD
                        You see Tommy?

                                 DANNY
                        Doesn’t seem to be a big fan of 
                        yours this morning.

                                 RICHARD
                        I got him that video game machine 
                        last Christmas -- less than a year 
                        ago -- and now it’s obsolete.
                             (shaking his head)
                        I will not buy two of them in the 
                        same calendar year. I won’t do it.

                                 DANNY
                        Hold your ground Richard.

                                 RICHARD
                        I plan to.

           Richard hands the papers back to Danny.
                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        Thanks for coming out on a 
                        Saturday, Danny. Good man.

                                 DANNY
                        Not a problem.

                                 RICHARD
                        I’m having lunch at the club with 
                        some friends. You can tag along if 
                        you like.

                                 DANNY
                        Thanks Richard, but I got an old 
                        friend in town. We got some 
                        catching up to do.

                                 RICHARD
                        Maybe next time.

                                 DANNY
                        You got it.

           The two exchange good-byes and Danny leaves.

           INT MUSTANG - DAY (MOVING)

           Danny directs Evan through the streets of his neighborhood.

                                 DANNY
                        I’m on the left up here.

           Evan pulls to the curb and looks out at Danny’s house.

                                 EVAN
                        This it?

                                 DANNY
                        That’s it.

                                 EVAN
                        The whole thing?

                                 DANNY
                        No. About twelve hundred square 
                        feet of it.

                                 EVAN
                        A house, a woman, an SUV. All 
                        settled in -- snug as shit.

                                 DANNY
                        Snug as shit.
                                 EVAN
                        So that’s what you get? Life as a 
                        civilian?

                                 DANNY
                        That’s all I want.

                                 EVAN
                        And what do I get?

                                 DANNY
                        For what?

           Evan shakes his head, a rueful smile.

                                 EVAN
                        For what... How long we known each 
                        other?

                                 DANNY
                        Long time.

                                 EVAN
                        Since we were four.

           A beat. 

                                 DANNY
                        You’re pissed I walked out.

           Evan raises his eyebrows: you think?

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        What was I supposed to do? 

                                 EVAN
                        Get my fucking back, bro. That’s 
                        what you were supposed to do.

                                 DANNY
                        Get your back?! You were kicking a 
                        man in the face who you’d just 
                        shot.

                                 EVAN
                        If I hadn’t shot that man, he’d 
                        have shot you.

                                 DANNY
                        Bullshit. He’d have made me freeze 
                        and called the cops.
                                 EVAN
                        Come on, Danny. You remember that 
                        dude: The vest; The little stance. 
                        He’d been waiting his whole life 
                        for that moment.

                                 DANNY
                        We should have been out the back 
                        before he ever showed.

                                 EVAN
                        I saved your ass. Then I kept my 
                        mouth shut. And then I went to 
                        state prison for seven years all by 
                        myself.

           Danny averts his eyes.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        That judge just banged his little 
                        hammer. Said, ‘twelve years’ just 
                        like that. And where were you? 
                        Buying a fucking condo and coming 
                        up with names for your new Labra-
                        Doodle.
                             (beat)
                        Know what I was doing? Celling with 
                        a 270-pound banger named Isaiah, 
                        eye-balling me to see if I’m a 
                        guppy or a shark. How would you 
                        sleep?

                                 DANNY
                             (soft)
                        I’m sorry, man. I’m grateful for 
                        what you did for me.

                                 EVAN
                        You are?! Really?! I came out short 
                        seven years -- seven prison years. 
                        Okay, bad beat. But at least I 
                        figure when I get home I’ll find my 
                        partner waiting for me. Surely 
                        he’ll have something set up to take 
                        care of his best fucking friend. 
                        Only instead, he’s nowhere to be 
                        found. In fact I have to track him 
                        down. And when I do? He says he’s 
                        gone legit, buys me a beer, and 
                        says, ‘good luck.’
                             (pause)
                        I say bullshit to that.
                                 DANNY
                        What do you want me to do?

                                 EVAN
                        Help me level shit out. Show me how 
                        mother-fucking grateful you are.

                                 DANNY
                        I told you, Ev, I’m out of the 
                        game. I’m retired.

                                 EVAN
                        So I suppose I should just crawl 
                        back to my hole then.

                                 DANNY
                        No... I’ll help you. I’ll do what I 
                        can. But my life’s different now.

           A silent pause before Danny opens his door.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        I won’t go back to work.

                                 EVAN
                             (pissed)
                        I heard you the first time, D.

           He puts the car in gear. Danny pauses -- searching for 
           something to say. But nothing comes. He gets out of the car 
           and Evan speeds away.

           ANGLE ON: Danny, watching the Mustang race down the block.

           EXT O’DONNELL CONSTRUCTION CO. - DAY

           Establishing. A typical suburban office park housing several 
           companies. A sign hanging above one of the entrances reads: 
           O’Donnell Construction Company. 

           INT O’DONNELL CONSTRUCTION CO. - DAY

           Inside, the offices are clean and plush: framed artwork on 
           the walls; expensive fixtures; thick carpeting throughout.

           Danny walks to the end of a hall and raps on a door.

                                 RICHARD (O.C.)
                        Yeah?

           Danny pushes the door open and enters Richard’s office.
                                 DANNY
                        Hey boss. Got a minute?

                                 RICHARD
                        Sure. Come in.

           Danny sits in a chair on the other side of Richard’s desk.

                                 DANNY
                        So, I was catching up with this old 
                        buddy of mine last weekend. It 
                        turns out he’s moving here and 
                        looking for work. He asked if I 
                        knew of anything. I know we’re 
                        looking to cut payroll, but I told 
                        him I’d at least ask.  

                                 RICHARD
                             (pauses)
                        We are looking to cut, Danny. But 
                        if you can find a way to offset 
                        some of the cost it’s okay by me.

                                 DANNY
                        I really appreciate that, Richard.

                                 RICHARD
                        Listen. You’re pretty much second 
                        in command around here as far as 
                        I’m concerned. You may not have the 
                        title to prove it, but that doesn’t 
                        mean you don’t get the benefits of 
                        the position, right? You want to do 
                        a solid for an old friend, do it. 
                        You’ve earned it.

                                 DANNY
                        I appreciate that, Richard. I 
                        really do.

           Richard stands, signaling an end to the conversation.

                                 RICHARD
                        But whatever you do, don’t offset 
                        the cost out of your own salary. 
                        That’s not how we big-shots do it.

                                 DANNY
                        Yes sir.

           They share a small laugh before Danny stands and exits.
           INT POOL HALL - EVENING

           Danny enters a large pool hall and scour the room... He spots 
           Evan alone at a table near the back and starts towards him.

           As he nears, Evan sinks a tricky shot.

                                 DANNY
                        Nice shot.

           Evan looks up -- barely acknowledging Danny -- before 
           circling the table and lining up another shot.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        They let you have a pool table in 
                        your cell?

           Evan buries another shot.

                                 EVAN
                        No. My cell had a mattress and a 
                        steel toilet.

           A long beat as Evan continues to focus on his game.

                                 DANNY
                        I have an idea. But listen: You 
                        need to think about it for awhile. 
                        Don’t just snap on me... Like I 
                        said, I can’t come back. But I can 
                        help you earn. I can give you a 
                        job.

                                 EVAN
                        A civilian job?

                                 DANNY
                        It’s the best I can do, Evan.

           Evan looks up at Danny with a smirk: really?

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        I make more than we ever did. And 
                        it beats shoveling shit.

           Evan places his cue on the table and stares down at the felt.

           Danny tosses a THICK ENVELOPE onto the table in front of 
           Evan. He looks up: what’s this? 

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        I wish I had more, but I got a 
                        mortgage to pay.
           Evan picks up the envelope. There’s about $1000 CASH inside.

                                 EVAN
                        I don’t want your money.

                                 DANNY
                        I want you to have it.

           Evan laughs incredulously and throws the envelope back at 
           Danny, who catches it awkwardly.

                                 EVAN
                        Fuck off, Danny.

           He picks up his cue and starts shooting again.

                                 DANNY
                        You want my help, Evan, you can’t 
                        be too proud to accept it.

           Danny places the envelope on the edge of the table and walks 
           away. Evan watches him go, scorn across his face.

           EXT STREET - EVENING

           Karen and Danny walk down the street holding hands. They turn 
           a corner and arrive at the front of a NIGHT CLUB. This is 
           where Karen works. 

           She kisses Danny goodbye and heads inside, greeting the THICK 
           BODYGUARDS manning the door. Danny continues on.

           INT CONDO - NIGHT

           A pair of STEEL-TOED BOOTS on the floor.

           Danny stands just inside the front door staring down at them 
           curiously. He moves into the apartment, looking around...

           And spots EVAN SITTING AT HIS KITCHEN TABLE. He’s drinking a 
           beer and leafing through a J. Crew catalog. 

                                 EVAN
                        Nice place, Danny. The beer sucks, 
                        but otherwise...

                                 DANNY
                        What the fuck are you doing in 
                        here?

                                 EVAN
                        Hoping to finish that conversation.
                                 DANNY
                        You gotta break into my place to do 
                        it? What if Karen was home? She’d 
                        have had a heart attack.

                                 EVAN
                        For Christ’s sake, Danny, relax. I 
                        didn’t break anything. And you can 
                        frisk me on my way out.

           Danny wants to slug him, but knows better. Instead, he goes 
           to the fridge and grabs two Heinekins.

           He sits opposite Evan, pops the top off both beers and slides 
           one across the table.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Got a story for you about this con 
                        up Statesville -- prison queer 
                        named Chico. Kind that shaves his 
                        chest, wears his jumpsuit half-
                        open... Well, Chico belonged to 
                        Lupe, this big-ass Norteno Mexican 
                        and they had an understanding: 
                        Chico could work to keep himself in 
                        luxuries as long as he split the 
                        take.
                             (Evan tugs on his beer)
                        I’d been in only two months or so, 
                        still wide-eyed and shit, when 
                        Chico got a new cellie and fell 
                        madly in love... So much so that he 
                        tells Lupe he’s quitting him -- 
                        he’s a changed woman and demands to 
                        be set free. Now Lupe couldn’t care 
                        less about Chico giving his heart 
                        to someone else. What he did care 
                        about was Chico giving his ass to 
                        someone else who wasn’t paying for 
                        it. So a couple days later, Chico 
                        and his new fella are drinking 
                        pruno in their cell when Lupe and 
                        his crew pounce on ‘em and gag ‘em 
                        up. Lupe makes Chico watch him 
                        slide a 4-inch shank into his 
                        boyfriend’s throat and leave it 
                        there -- handle deep... He kisses 
                        Chico on the forehead and walks out 
                        while his boys break both Chico’s 
                        legs til the bones stick out.

           Danny can’t help but cringe.
                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Chico didn’t walk so good after 
                        that. But he never forgot who he 
                        was... or who he belonged to.
                             (beat)
                        I thought about your offer. Fold it 
                        sideways and shove it up your ass.

           Evan removes the envelope Danny gave him at the pool hall 
           from his pocket and slides it across the table.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        You owe me Danny. I’m not gonna 
                        waste my time trying to convince 
                        you to feel the same because I just 
                        don’t really give a shit. I’ve 
                        thought of a way to square us. And 
                        you’re gonna help, like it or not.

           They eye-ball one another. Danny swigs his beer.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT BAR - LATER

           Evan and Danny have moved to a local bar and occupy a small 
           corner table. Danny downs a shot, winces at the burn, and 
           looks up at Evan -- his face a tangle of amusement, 
           disbelief, and incredulity.

                                 DANNY
                        So... your big plan is to kidnap my 
                        boss’s twelve year old son and hold 
                        him for ransom? For a million 
                        dollars?

                                 EVAN
                        Yes.

                                 DANNY
                        And that’ll square things with us?

                                 EVAN
                        We split it in half and we’re even.

                                 DANNY
                             (laughs)
                        Are you kidding me? We were petty 
                        thieves -- fucking cat burglars. 
                        Not home invaders.
                                 EVAN
                        We can rob antique stores for two 
                        years if you want, but you said you 
                        weren’t going back to work. This 
                        will take three days and it’s done.

                                 DANNY
                        Both of them involve going back to 
                        work, Evan. Kidnapping Tommy is 
                        work -- and then some. They charge 
                        you with mayhem for that kind of 
                        shit, for Chrissake.
                             (pause)
                        Listen man, I’m sorry that things 
                        worked out the way they did. I 
                        really am. And if I wasn’t a good 
                        enough friend to you these last 
                        years, I’m sorry. I hope I can make 
                        up for that. I want to make up for 
                        that. But not like this... I wish 
                        you understood. And I know that if 
                        things were reversed, I wouldn’t 
                        begrudge you for such a choice.

                                 EVAN
                        But things weren’t reversed, were 
                        they? So you don’t know how 
                        begrudged I should be.

           Evan slides his chair away from the table and leans back, 
           exposing a HAND GUN STUCK IN HIS BELT.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Think about it.

           HOLD on them for an extended beat...

           EXT CONDO - NIGHT

           Patrick and Danny huddle on a small balcony. Patrick smokes, 
           listening to Danny with wide eyes.

                                 PATRICK
                        He pulled a gun on you?

                                 DANNY
                        He showed it to me.

                                 PATRICK
                        Motherfu-

                                 DANNY
                        Shh.
           Danny looks inside. Karen is clearing the table form dinner.

                                 PATRICK
                        What are you gonna do?

                                 DANNY
                        I don’t know -- I really don’t.  
                        Either we’re partners or I’m 
                        disrespecting what I owe him.

                                 PATRICK
                        You don’t owe him shit.

                                 DANNY
                        He doesn’t see it that way.

           Patrick takes a long drag on his cigarette.

                                 PATRICK
                        I’ll talk to him.

                                 DANNY
                             (quick)
                        No.

                                 PATRICK
                        Just to hear what he’s got to say.

                                 DANNY
                        Not a chance. This ain’t the Evan 
                        we grew up with.

                                 PATRICK
                        I’m all grown up too, Danny.

           Danny looks at Patrick.

                                 DANNY
                        I know you are, P.

           EXT. STREET - LATER

           Karen and Danny walk Patrick to his motorcycle.

                                 PATRICK
                        Shit. Forgot my gloves.

                                 DANNY
                        I’ll get ‘em.

           Danny turns and hustles back towards the house. 
                                 PATRICK
                        Thanks.
                             (to Karen)
                        And thank you. That was the best 
                        meal I’ve had since the last time I 
                        was here.

                                 KAREN
                        You’re welcome, Patrick. And that’s 
                        the nicest compliment I’ve had 
                        since the last one you gave me.

           A nice, earnest moment between them. Karen seizes it.

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        Is Danny happy?

                                 PATRICK
                        What do you mean?

                                 KAREN
                        I mean, I know he’s happy. But 
                        sometimes I get the feeling he 
                        misses the old life. 

                                 PATRICK
                        Really? Why?

                                 KAREN
                        I don’t know... The way he listens 
                        to your stories. I get the feeling 
                        sometimes he wishes he was back in 
                        the game... that he had some of 
                        those stories too.

                                 PATRICK
                             (smiles)
                        Didn’t you tell him that if he ever 
                        so much as stole a candy bar you’d 
                        leave? Wouldn’t even listen to an 
                        explanation?

                                 KAREN
                        Yes.

                                 PATRICK
                        Danny’s like my brother, Karen. 
                        Even if he was robbing again, I 
                        wouldn’t tell you. I can’t-

                                 KAREN
                        No, I know. I’m not asking you to-
                                 PATRICK
                        Look: I steal things. Danny used to 
                        steal things and he was really, 
                        really good at it. The times I 
                        worked with him were the smoothest 
                        jobs I ever had. And I trust him 
                        with my life. So I would love to 
                        see Danny come back to work. In 
                        fact, there’s only one thing I’d 
                        rather see him do.

                                 KAREN
                        What’s that?

                                 PATRICK
                        Not come back... He’s happy Karen. 
                        Happier than I’ve ever seen him. 
                        I’m sure he has moments where he 
                        wishes he was still at it, but he 
                        belongs in the life you guys have. 
                        I know it, and more importantly, he 
                        knows it.

                                 KAREN
                        Thanks Patrick.

           Karen wraps her arms around Patrick in a tight hug and we 
           HOLD ON HIS FACE, the wheels in his head turning.

           EXT DINER - DAY

           Establishing. A small, typical 24-hour diner in downtown 
           Chicago. A phone call plays in VOICE-OVER.

                                 OPERATOR (V.O.)
                        Homicide.

                                 DANNY (V.O.)
                        Detective Sean Nolan please.

                                 OPERATOR (V.O.)
                        Hold.

           INT DINER - DAY

           Danny approaches a MAN DRESSED IN A CRISP BROWN SUIT perusing 
           a menu at the counter. 

                                 DANNY
                        Sean?
                                 NOLAN
                        Danny. 

           SEAN NOLAN (36; Broad shouldered and serious-looking) extends 
           a hand. Danny shakes it and sits next to him.

                                 DANNY
                        Been some time. How’ve you been?

                                 NOLAN
                        Fine. Yourself?

                                 DANNY
                        Excellent. Never better.

           A WAITRESS arrives in front of them, coffee pot in hand. 

                                 NOLAN
                        I’ll have the number one: eggs over 
                        hard with bacon and wheat.

                                 DANNY
                             (scanning the menu)
                        I’ll do the Denver Omelette with 
                        white toast.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Coffee?

                                 DANNY
                        Please.

           She flips over a coffee cup in front of Danny and fills it 
           before moving off.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        So, you still in the neighborhood?

                                 NOLAN
                        No. We’re out in Beverly now.

                                 DANNY
                        Yeah?

                                 NOLAN
                        It’s nice. No gangs... No drunks at 
                        the St. Paddy’s Day Parade. My kids 
                        got a yard to run around in.  

                                 DANNY
                        Sounds nice. You know I left too. 
                        Got a place in Lakeview. Nothing 
                        fancy, but it’s mine, you know?
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 DANNY (CONT'D)
                        I work in construction. I’m a 
                        project manager. It’s nice to have 
                        made a place for myself. Made   
                        something... legitimate.

                                 NOLAN
                        Good for you.

                                 DANNY
                        So how many kids you got?

           Nolan looks at Danny: he’s done with the chit-chat.

                                 NOLAN
                        Plenty. Now how ‘bout you tell me 
                        why I’m sitting here.

           Danny sips his coffee.

                                 DANNY
                        When I started working construction 
                        one of the first things I realized 
                        was how much being a former thief 
                        helped out. Knowing how to bargain, 
                        negotiate. Being able to plan. But 
                        mostly, knowing when to take risks.

                                 NOLAN
                        That what you’re doing here? 
                        Because I’m the poh-lice? 

                                 DANNY
                        Yeah.

                                 NOLAN
                        Thought you said you were clean.

                                 DANNY
                        Oh, I’m hundred-proof. Go to work, 
                        pay my taxes. I’m a civilian.

           The waitress plunks their plates down in front of them. 

                                 NOLAN
                        Get to the fucking point, Danny.

                                 DANNY
                        I’ve got a problem. Someone’s 
                        harassing me. He broke into our 
                        apartment last Friday.

                                 NOLAN
                        He steal anything?
                                 DANNY
                        No. He was waiting for me.

                                 NOLAN
                        Waiting to do what?

                                 DANNY
                        To talk. To threaten me. 

                                 NOLAN
                        So this is someone you know?
                             (off Danny’s nod)
                        You file a report?

                                 DANNY
                        It’s not that simple.

                                 NOLAN
                        Why?

                                 DANNY
                        Because I got a felony conviction 
                        on my sheet. You know how tough it 
                        is for us when we yell for help.

                                 NOLAN
                        What makes you think it’ll be any 
                        easier with me?

           Pause... Danny searches for the words.

                                 DANNY
                        We don’t owe each other anything. I 
                        know that. But I’ve been spotless 
                        for years. Worked my way up same as 
                        you -- same as anybody. I did it on 
                        my own and I did it square.
                             (beat)
                        I’m worried. For myself. For Karen.

                                 NOLAN
                        What aren’t you telling me?

                                 DANNY
                             (hesitates)
                        It’s Evan McGann.

           Nolan almost chokes on his eggs, then erupts with laughter.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        I’m not kidding, Sean.
                                 NOLAN
                        Oh, I believe you. Time to pay the 
                        piper, eh Danny-Boy?

                                 DANNY
                        He’s not messing about.

                                 NOLAN
                        I bet. Probably a little pissed 
                        about his last fall, yeah? 

                                 DANNY
                        Come on, Sean. For Chrissake we 
                        grew up in the same neighborhood.

           Nolan’s tone switches abruptly. 

                                 NOLAN
                        Bullshit. Bullshit, Danny. Don’t 
                        lay that on me.

                                 DANNY
                        You won’t help.

                                 NOLAN
                        Help you what? Your old partner’s 
                        back in town and wants something 
                        from you? You’re in construction, 
                        right? So what’s he want?

           Danny doesn’t answer.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, I thought so. What, is he 
                        after some old score you spent 
                        instead of splitting? Or just 
                        pissed you bailed on him? You were 
                        in that pawnshop, weren’t you?
                             (Danny looks away)
                        You crack me up, you really do. 
                        You’re clean? Good for you. Most 
                        people have been their whole lives. 
                        You want special treatment because 
                        you mended your ways? 

                                 DANNY
                        The same would be nice.

                                 NOLAN
                        Then call it in and have a squad 
                        car come by, get the whole story. 
                        But you can’t do that, can you?

           Danny shakes his head.
                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        And that tells me all I need to 
                        know. Time to pay the fucking 
                        consequences... Long overdue if you 
                        ask me.

                                 DANNY
                        Sean-

                                 NOLAN
                        Thanks for breakfast.

           Nolan stands, grabs his coat, and walks away. Danny stares 
           dejectedly at the Denver omelette in front of him.

           EXT DINER - LATER

           Danny emerges from the diner and heads down the block towards 
           his parked SUV...

           He opens the door and slides in. As he starts the engine he 
           notices a SLIP OF PAPER tucked under the windshield wipers. 
           He rolls down the window and retrieves it:

           INSERT NOTE: D- I knew you were a DESERTER, but a RAT too? 
           This thing is happening with or without you. Just know that 
           if I go back to prison, you’re coming with me this time. -E

           Danny steps back into the street and looks all around for 
           Evan... But he’s gone.

           INT CONDO - NIGHT

           Danny stares into the bathroom mirror. He hasn’t slept much 
           and it shows. Karen appears behind him and wraps her arms 
           around his waist. 

                                 KAREN
                        Trouble sleeping again, baby?

                                 DANNY
                        A little bit.

                                 KAREN
                        What’s bothering you?

                                 DANNY
                        Work’s busy is all.
                                 KAREN
                             (furrows her brow)
                        Work makes you tired. What’s making 
                        you anxious?

                                 DANNY
                        Just a lot to get done before 
                        winter comes. Not sure we’re gonna 
                        make it.

           Karen lets go of Danny, frowns at his reflection in the 
           mirror... Then exits the bathroom.

                                 KAREN (O.C.)
                        Let me know when you want to talk 
                        about what’s really going on.

           He turns back to the mirror and sighs.

           INT MUSTANG/EXT STREET - MORNING

           POV: From a block away, someone is watching Danny and Karen 
           through the windshield of a car as they exit their condo. 
           They walk to the curb where the SUV is parked. They exchange 
           an extended goodbye kiss. Danny opens the door, but before 
           getting in he pauses and looks down the street.

           REVERSE POV: Evan’s mustang is parked at the far end of the 
           block. 

           Danny holds his gaze for a long beat before getting into the 
           SUV and firing up the engine.

           Inside the Mustang, Debbie is next to Evan.

                                 EVAN
                        For two people who’ve been together 
                        for so long they sure do get a kick 
                        out of each other.

                                 DEBBIE
                             (wistful)
                        They’re in love.

           Evan shoots her a look as he starts the Mustang.

                                 EVAN
                        Let’s get some eggs.

                                 DEBBIE
                        I thought we were gonna follow ‘em.
                                 EVAN
                        Don’t need to.

           He whips a U-turn and speeds down the street.

           INT PATICK’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Patrick rubs sleep from his eyes. Danny paces around the 
           apartment -- agitated.

                                 PATRICK
                        Where’s he staying?

                                 DANNY
                        His uncle’s place.

                                 PATRICK
                        Where’s that?

                                 DANNY
                        No Patrick.

                                 PATRICK
                        Relax, Danny. 

                                 DANNY
                        No.

           A pause. Patrick relents.

                                 PATRICK
                        Well what are you gonna do?

                                 DANNY
                        I don’t know... I go to Richard, 
                        he’ll go to the cops and Evan pops 
                        me for the pawnshop. He’s doing it 
                        with or without me. I say, ‘no’ and 
                        who knows what he does to Tommy.

                                 PATRICK
                        What if you did it?
                             (Danny shoots him a look)
                        I’m just saying... You know the 
                        house, the routines -- probably 
                        know the alarm code... Could be the 
                        easiest way out is all.

           Danny pauses...

                                 DANNY
                        Too much to lose.
           EXT RICHARD’S HOME - DAY

           Danny pulls into Richard’s driveway. A 4-MAN CREW OF 
           LANDSCAPERS shout to one another in Spanish as they rake 
           leaves and push lawn mowers.

           INT RICHARD’S HOME - MOMENTS LATER

           Richard leads Danny down the HALL and into the KITCHEN.

                                 DANNY
                        Sorry. Lakeshore was bumper-to-
                        bumper.

           Danny dumps a stack of contracts on the granite island. 

                                 RICHARD
                        You look them over? I don’t want to 
                        get rogered again.

                                 DANNY
                        They’re clean.

           Richard leafs through the contracts.

                                 RICHARD
                        How’s Pike Street?

                                 DANNY
                        McCloskey will have it locked down 
                        by the end of the week.

                                 RICHARD
                        Good. And we’ve got him on contract 
                        for the spring?

                                 DANNY
                        We’re keeping him on over the 
                        winter, remember?

                                 RICHARD
                        Yeah, I thought it over. It’s not 
                        gonna work.

                                 DANNY
                        What?

                                 RICHARD
                        We’ll pick him back up in the 
                        Spring.

           Danny shakes his head -- irritated.
                                 DANNY
                        I gave him my word that we had work 
                        for him.

                                 RICHARD
                        Why would you do that?

                                 DANNY
                        Because we agreed to do it.

                                 RICHARD
                        I never agreed to anything like 
                        that. I might have said it would be 
                        nice to, but...

                                 DANNY
                        We were in the conference room. 
                        Reviewing budgets. You wanted to-

                                 RICHARD
                        Hey. I know how you feel. But you 
                        know how rough things have been. 
                        Believe you me, nobody’s been 
                        bleeding more than I have.

           Richard starts scribbling his signature onto the contracts. 
           Danny stares at him for a beat then turns away, incredulous. 
           His eyes scour the room and find:

           The STATE-OF-THE-ART APPLIANCES that fill the kitchen, many 
           of them have likely never been used; A 42-inch PLASMA-TV 
           mounted on the wall; A FRAMED PHOTO of Richard lounging on 
           the deck of his sailboat moored in a tropical cove...

           Outside the bay window, Danny watches the men hard at work on 
           Richard’s yard.

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        Here.
                             (handing back the 
                              contracts)
                        Make sure Pike Street is locked 
                        down tight. I don’t want it turning 
                        into a homeless camp.

           Danny keeps his eyes out the window.

           EXT BRIDGEPORT - DAY

           The SUV crawls along the streets of Chicago’s South Side. Tan 
           and orange bungalows crowd the sidewalks; Gothic church 
           spires tower over tract housing -- White Sox flags dangling 
           from their windows. 
           INT SUV - CONTINUOUS

           Danny looks out on his old neighborhood filled with 
           nostalgia.

           He stops at a red light and A PACK OF TEENAGERS peacock 
           across the street in front of him. ONE OF THEM glares in at 
           Danny with a menacing sneer. Danny gives it right back to 
           him: Just like old times.

           EXT STREET - DAY (MOVING)

           Cold winds blow grim clouds across an October sky. A 
           MOTORCYCLE roars through the streets on the South Side of 
           Chicago, SLOWING through the turns and FLYING down the 
           straightaways...

           Slicing through a residential neighborhood, the motorcycle 
           slows -- its driver searching the numbers on the houses...

           A black Mustang with its hood up is parked in a driveway. The 
           motorcycle revs its engine and pulls up fast behind it. The 
           brakes squeal and Evan snaps his head out from behind the 
           Mustang’s hood, a wrench clutched in one fist. 

           The driver kills the engine and pulls off his helmet: It’s 
           Patrick. Evan’s muscles relax -- uncoil. 

                                 EVAN
                        Fix you a drink?

                                 PATRICK
                        All right.

           Patrick dismounts and follows Evan inside...

           INT EVAN’S UNCLE’S HOUSE - DAY

           In a clean, sparse KITCHEN, Evan pulls a bottle of Jameson’s 
           from the cupboard and fills two glasses. They sit around a 
           small table and Evan slides one of the drinks to Patrick.

                                 EVAN
                        What’s on your mind, Pat?

                                 PATRICK
                        I know what you’re doing to Danny.

                                 EVAN
                        It’s between Danny and me.
                                 PATRICK
                        He’s not in the game anymore.

                                 EVAN
                        So I hear.

                                 PATRICK
                        You guys were like brothers, man.

                                 EVAN
                        There’s a debt.

                                 PATRICK
                        Balls to your debt. Nobody fucked 
                        you. You fucked you.

                                 EVAN
                        That what you came to say tough 
                        guy?

                                 PATRICK
                        No. I came to ask nice: Leave him 
                        alone.

           Evan takes a swallow of whiskey, picks up a hand towel, and 
           wipes at the grime on his hands.

                                 EVAN
                        Go fuck your hat.

                                 PATRICK
                        Just got too used to being a bitch 
                        inside, huh?

                                 EVAN
                        Still shooting that mouth off, 
                        Patrick. Gonna get you slapped one 
                        of these days.

           Discreetly, Patrick lifts his foot and slips a hand down to 
           meet it. He slides out a knife tucked in his boot.

                                 PATRICK
                        I don’t get slapped around much 
                        anymore...

           Evan places the towel on the table, leaving his hand atop it.

                                 EVAN
                        Fuck you, Patrick.

           Patrick lunges toward Evan, the knife raised to strike- 

           POP! The whiskey bottle EXPLODES into tiny shards...
           And Patrick stops cold halfway across the table, as if he’d 
           been sucker-punched hard in the chest. A puzzled expression 
           washes across his face...

           He looks down at his body: what was that?... then across at 
           Evan... and then down to Evan’s hand resting on the kitchen 
           towel, SMOKE CURLING FROM A RAGGED HOLE, its edges burned 
           powder-black.

           ANGLE ON Patrick: Oh, no...

           Evan stands and slaps Patrick hard across the face. He 
           crashes to the floor, a red stain of blood filling his shirt.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           OVER BLACK, the sound of a car crawling to a stop. A car door 
           opens and shuts... A key turns in a lock and click:

           EXT RIVERSIDE - NIGHT

           The Mustang is parked beside a huge, deserted INDUSTRIAL 
           PLANT along the river with its trunk popped open. Evan 
           reaches in, lifts Patrick’s body out, and throws it over his 
           shoulder.   

           With surprising ease, he carries it to the edge of the river 
           and dumps it in... 

           Evan lights a cigarette and watches Patrick disappear beneath 
           the water -- the ripples fanning across to the far shore.

           INT NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

           A DANCEFLOOR FILLED WITH YOUNG CLUB-GOERS throbs to a thick 
           bass beat. Lasers cut rainbow swaths through the swirling 
           cigarette smoke...

           CRANING UP, we find Karen perched at the railing of a balcony 
           watching the throng below...

           She then turns and weaves through a maze of couches and 
           tables that make up the balcony’s VIP section and disappears 
           down a back staircase.

           EXT NIGHT CLUB - LATER

           Karen exits the club. Outside, the line to get in is long and 
           restless. HECTOR THE BOUNCER (6’6”; 320lbs.) stands at the 
           head of the line ignoring the barrage of impatient pleas. 
                                 KAREN
                        Hey Hector, where’s Rodney?

                                 HECTOR
                        He went home. He wasn’t feeling 
                        good, so I told him I’d cover for 
                        him.
                             (off Karen’s grimace)
                        Sorry Karen, I didn’t think you’d 
                        mind.

                                 KAREN
                        No, that’s all right. I was just 
                        hoping for a walk to my car.

                                 HECTOR
                             (pulling out his radio)
                        I’ll get Kevin or Joe.

                                 KAREN
                        Don’t bother. I’m just around the 
                        corner.

                                 HECTOR
                        Gimme two minutes.

           But Karen has already started off, holding up a can of mace 
           for Hector to see.

                                 KAREN
                        That’s okay Hector. I’m armed.

                                 HECTOR
                        Okay, boss. See you tomorrow.

           The sounds of the crowd outside the club fade and give way to 
           the CLICK-CLACK OF HER HEELS AGAINST THE SIDEWALK. At the end 
           of the block she turns onto a darkened side street...

           And suddenly a SECOND SET OF FOOTSTEPS join her own: heavy 
           and muffled -- a man’s stride. She quickens her pace and 
           grips the can of mace -- her thumb poised on the trigger...

           As she nears an alley, the footsteps seem to be closing fast. 
           Worry washes over Karen’s face and she darts into the alley.

           Her JETTA is parked 20 feet in. Karen runs to it, pulling 
           keys from her purse. As she slides the key into the lock a 
           SHADOW WIPES ACROSS THE ALLEY WALL... 

           Karen GASPS and fumbles with the can of mace... But a FIGURE 
           grabs her from behind, clasping a gloved hand over her mouth 
           and ripping the mace from her grip. THE ATTACKER pulls her 
           close, puts his mouth to her ear.
                                 ATTACKER
                        Relax, kitten. I’m not gonna hurt 
                        you tonight. But I may not feel so 
                        generous the next time.

           And then, as quickly as he had grabbed her, he pushes her, 
           still holding one arm, as if dancing. But as she reaches the 
           end of her steps he lets go, the momentum sending her 
           sprawling to the ground.  

                                 ATTACKER (CONT’D)
                        You need to be careful, Karen. 
                        Chicago is a dangerous place for a 
                        woman after dark.

           And then, as quickly as he pounced, the attacker bolts from 
           the alley... And Karen is alone -- rattled something fierce 
           and bleeding from an ugly scrape across her knee. 

                                                              FADE OUT.

           INT CONDO - NIGHT

           Every light in the apartment is on. Karen’s face is red and 
           puffy from crying, and Danny clasps her hands in his own -- 
           concern etched into his face.

                                 DANNY
                        You sure you don’t want to go to 
                        the hospital?

                                 KAREN
                        I’m fine... Just pissed off about 
                        ruining my favorite skirt.

           She attempts a smile.

                                 DANNY
                        What scared him off?

                                 KAREN
                        I don’t know. I don’t think 
                        anything. He just let me go.

                                 DANNY
                        Must have been something.

                                 KAREN
                        Maybe... But he said he wasn’t 
                        gonna hurt me tonight.
                                 DANNY
                        Huh? Said he wasn’t gonna hurt you 
                        tonight?

                                 KAREN
                        And that Chicago is a dangerous 
                        place for a woman.

           Danny stiffens.

                                 DANNY
                        Did you get a look at him?

                                 KAREN
                        No... But he knew my name, Danny.

                                 DANNY
                        He knew your name?

                                 KAREN
                        He called me Karen.

           Bothered, Danny stands and starts pacing.

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        What is it?

                                 DANNY
                             (distracted)
                        Nothing baby.
                             (off Karen’s look)
                        It just scares me, you know? The 
                        thought of something happening to 
                        you -- the thought of someone 
                        hurting you... 

           ANGLE ON: Karen, watching Danny’s agitation -- her suspicions 
           that he’s not being straight with her growing.

           EXT STREET/INT MUSTANG - DAY (MOVING)

           Evan’s Mustang rumbles past the boutiques on Halsted and into 
           Boystown, Chicago’s gay district.

           He slows as he nears an intersection and pulls up alongside a 
           BUS STOP where Danny’s waiting. Danny rises and walks to the 
           car -- a look of utter contempt on his face. He gets in.

                                 EVAN
                        Hey partner.

                                 DANNY
                        Drive, cocksucker. Lakeshore North.
           Evan chuckles, pops the car in gear, and tears away from the 
           curb.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT PARKING LOT - LATER

           Evan parks in a lot for a recreation area near the Lake 
           Michigan shore. It’s crowded with JOGGERS, DOG WALKERS, and 
           ROLLERBLADERS.

                                 DANNY
                        Let’s take a walk.

           They exit the car and Danny heads across a field toward the 
           Lake. Evan follows a few paces behind.

           EXT LAKE MICHIGAN - MOMENTS LATER

           At the water’s edge, Danny stares out at the horizon. Evan 
           lights a cigarette.

                                 EVAN
                        You want to cuddle? Watch the sun 
                        go down?

                                 DANNY
                        Let’s talk about the rules.

                                 EVAN
                        What rules?

                                 DANNY
                        The rules of the job.

           A grin spreads across Evan’s face and he takes a long drag 
           from his smoke.

                                 EVAN
                        So you’re in.

                                 DANNY
                        Not giving me much choice, are you? 
                        You made your point.

                                 EVAN
                        About time.

                                 DANNY
                        I got three rules and they’re non-
                        negotiable. 
                                 EVAN
                        Yeah?

                                 DANNY
                        First off, nobody gets hurt. Not a 
                        scratch. Especially not Tommy.

                                 EVAN
                        Who’s Tommy?

                                 DANNY
                        Tommy’s the boy you want to kidnap, 
                        shithead. 
                             (beat)
                        Second: You listen to me. You want 
                        my help? Fine. But only if I make 
                        the plan and we stick to that plan. 
                        Understand?

                                 EVAN
                             (nods)
                        And third?

                                 DANNY
                        Third is that this squares us. 
                        After it’s done, we never see each 
                        other again. You and I? We’re done.

           Evan cocks his head at Danny and takes another drag.

                                 EVAN
                        All right.

                                 DANNY
                        One more thing-

           BAM! DANNY SUCKER-PUNCHES EVAN square in the jaw, dropping 
           him to the ground.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        That’s for Karen, motherfucker. 
                        Don’t you even think about touching 
                        her again.

           Evan swallows hard, gives Danny a free pass on that one. He 
           props himself up and rubs his jaw as Danny offers his hand to 
           help him up.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go to work.

                                 EVAN
                        Now?
                                 DANNY
                        Now.

           Evan grabs hold of Danny’s hand.

           EXT RICHARD’S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

           An October shower has soaked the hell out of everything. 
           Rotting leaves tattoo the asphalt streets orange and brown. 

           INT MUSTANG - CONTINUOUS

           Danny and Evan are in the parked mustang half a block down 
           from Richard’s house. 

                                 DANNY
                        Where do you want to go in?

                                 EVAN
                             (thinks a beat)
                        Why don’t we just knock on the 
                        front door sometime when he’s alone 
                        and grab him?

                                 DANNY
                             (grimaces)
                        We’ll break in the back.

                                 EVAN
                        House like this, there’s gotta be 
                        an alarm.

                                 DANNY
                        Yeah, but the maid kept setting it 
                        off. They only use it at night.

           Evan smiles, slaps Danny’s shoulder playfully.

                                 EVAN
                        There it is: Excellent inside info. 
                        You’re paying off already.

           Danny stares at Evan -- his mood not ready to lighten.

                                 DANNY
                        We’ll go next week sometime. After 
                        school.

                                 EVAN
                        You know the maid’s schedule?
                                 DANNY
                        Yep.

                                 EVAN
                        Cha-ching.

                                 DANNY
                        We need to keep him from hitting 
                        the ‘panic button’ or calling 911, 
                        but I’ll think of something.

                                 EVAN
                        Yes you will.

                                 DANNY
                        Let’s get outta here before the 
                        neighbors start getting curious.

           Evan puts the car in gear and pulls away from the curb.

           INT SOUTH SIDE BAR - DAY

           An empty bar in the afternoon. The BARTENDER chats with a 
           BARFLY. Danny and Evan sit at a table strewn with a half 
           dozen empty beer bottles... 

           Danny finishes a beer with a full swallow and plunks it on 
           the table. He and Evan are both feeling the buzz.

                                 EVAN
                        I love beer in the afternoon... 
                        Ever since we used to smuggle it 
                        into the girls’ soccer games in 
                        high school.

           Evan starts to laughs. Danny cracks a smile.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Didn’t we go to a girls’ swimming 
                        practice once?

                                 DANNY
                             (laughing despite himself)
                        Yeah. That’s when you went down to 
                        the bench and offered massages. 
                        Told them physical therapy was one 
                        of your hobbies.

           They crack up at the memory. 

                                 EVAN
                        We need a place to stow him.
           Danny nods, scanning instinctively for anyone in earshot.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Someplace where if something goes 
                        wrong and he makes a lot of noise, 
                        nobody can hear.

           Another nod from Danny.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m thinking an even million.

                                 DANNY
                        Too much.

                                 EVAN
                        Too much? You see that house?

                                 DANNY
                        It’s not the Playboy Mansion. It’s 
                        a five-bedroom.

                                 EVAN
                        How many bedrooms you have growing 
                        up.

                                 DANNY
                        That ain’t the point.

                                 EVAN
                        That’s exactly the point. You know 
                        how it works. Guys like that, they 
                        make sure that the rest of us stay 
                        where we are. They hire us to work 
                        shitty jobs for shitty money so we 
                        can pay for our shitty one-bedroom 
                        apartment with no windows. Tell us 
                        the world needs ditch-diggers as 
                        they send their kids to private 
                        school. And all the while they’re 
                        building prisons for when we get 
                        upset about being on the shit side 
                        of the bargain. Fuck that.
                             (pause)
                        Or have you forgotten how it works? 
                        Now that you got your Cubs jersey 
                        and discovered the pumpkin latte at 
                        Starbucks it’s all different now? 
                        Now that you’re pretending to be 
                        someone else?
                                 DANNY
                        What, because I have a job I’m 
                        supposed to vote Republican? Fuck 
                        you, man. It doesn’t work that way.

                                 EVAN
                        How does it work then, smart guy?

                                 DANNY
                        I don’t know. But blaming your dad 
                        and the cops and every guy out 
                        there who’s got more than you ain’t 
                        the answer. And it doesn’t change 
                        the fact that you’re a thief... a 
                        criminal. And criminals get caught. 
                        Especially when they do stupid shit 
                        like ask someone for a million 
                        dollars they don’t have -- five-
                        bedrooms or not.
                             (beat)
                        That was my point.

           They fall silent. Evan pulls on his beer.

                                 EVAN
                        So how much do we ask for, smart 
                        guy?

                                 DANNY
                        Two-fifty’s the safe play.

                                 EVAN
                        Half a mill.

           After some thought, Danny nods reluctantly.

                                 DANNY
                        Also, we need someone else. To 
                        watch Tommy.

                                 EVAN
                        Why?

                                 DANNY
                        Because we shouldn’t be around 
                        after we take him. We don’t want to 
                        give him anything to remember when 
                        he’s talking to the cops 
                        afterwards. 

                                 EVAN
                        Why not just tape him up and leave 
                        him be? Come in once a day to feed 
                        him, let him piss.
                                 DANNY
                        Jesus, Evan. He’s a kid.

                                 EVAN
                        It’s only for a couple days.

                                 DANNY
                        I said nobody gets hurt. Leaving a 
                        twelve-year-old kid duct-taped in 
                        the dark for a couple days counts.
                             (pause)
                        I can ask Patrick. I don’t want to, 
                        but...

           ANGLE ON: Evan, betraying nothing.

                                 EVAN
                        I got someone. 

                                 DANNY
                        Who?

                                 EVAN
                        A girl of mine.

           Danny eyes Evan skeptically.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        She’ll do what she’s told.

           Danny stands, pulls some cash from his wallet and throws it 
           on the table.

                                 DANNY
                        I want to meet her. But right now, 
                        I’m going home. I’ll call you 
                        later.

           He turns and heads toward the front door.

                                 EVAN
                        Welcome back, Danny-Boy.

           Danny ignores him, exiting the bar without looking back.

           INT CONDO - MORNING

           Danny’s in the kitchen with the phone pressed to his ear. The 
           other end rings several times before an answering machine 
           picks up. Danny curses as the message plays.
                                 DANNY
                        Where are you, Patrick? I need to 
                        talk to you about that thing from 
                        the other night. Call me back as 
                        soon as you get this... It’s Danny.

           He hangs up -- frustrated. 

           INT DENNY’S RESTAURANT - MORNING

           Danny, Evan, and DEBBIE sit in a booth at Denny’s scanning 
           through the endless menu options. 

                                 EVAN
                        I’m gonna take a dump. Order me 
                        some eggs if they come by.

                                 DANNY
                        Nice... Very classy.

           He ignores Danny and walks off. Awkward silence falls over 
           the table until...

                                 DEBBIE
                        So Evan tells me you’re a thief.

                                 DANNY
                        I’m in construction.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Really? He said you were his 
                        partner.

                                 DANNY
                        Long time ago.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Must feel like deja-vu, huh?

                                 DANNY
                        Something like that.

           Something on the menu catches Debbie’s eye.

                                 DEBBIE
                        That’s what I’m talking about. 
                        Chocolate Chip pancakes with 
                        strawberries. 

           Debbie pops her chewing gum. Danny forces a smile, clearly 
           unimpressed by this potential co-conspirator.
                                 DEBBIE (CONT’D)
                        Lemme see your hand.

                                 DANNY
                        What?

                                 DEBBIE
                        I read palms.

           Reluctantly, Danny plays along and lays his hand in front of 
           Debbie. She holds it still and studies it closely.

                                 DEBBIE (CONT’D)
                        Hmmmmm... Fascinating. I see a 
                        couple of things.

                                 DANNY
                        Oh yeah?

           Debbie nods and traces one of the lines on his palm.

                                 DEBBIE
                        This here is telling me that you 
                        think I’m a moron.

                                 DANNY
                             (smiles -- surprised)
                        That’s in my palm?

                                 DEBBIE
                        That’s in your eyes. Your palm 
                        tells me you work in management.

                                 DANNY
                        How?

                                 DEBBIE
                        I used to date an ironworker. His 
                        hands were like baseball mitts. 
                        Yours are soft.

                                 DANNY
                             (his smile widens)
                        What else?

                                 DEBBIE
                        You’re not wearing a wedding ring, 
                        but you didn’t check me out. So I’d 
                        say you’ve got a serious girlfriend 
                        you really, really love.

           Danny pulls his hand away, leans back, and looks across the 
           table at Debbie -- a self-satisfied expression on her face.
                                 DANNY
                        Very impressive Debbie.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Thank you. 

           Evan returns from the bathroom and slides in next to Debbie.

                                 DEBBIE (CONT’D)
                        My God, that was a speedy dump.

           Danny bursts out laughing.

                                 EVAN
                        It was occupied.

                                 DANNY
                             (to Evan)
                        I think we’ll get along just fine.

           EXT CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

           Danny’s SUV and Evan’s Mustang are parked side by side in 
           front of the trailer.

           INT TRAILER - CONTINUOUS

           The interior of the trailer has been cleaned out. Danny, 
           Evan, and Debbie sit around a coffee table finalizing their 
           plans.

                                 DANNY
                             (to Debbie)
                        We’ll bring him directly here and 
                        drop him with you.
                             (she nods)
                        The fridge is stocked and the TV 
                        works, but you’ll be holed up here 
                        for a couple of days, so make sure 
                        you bring whatever else you might 
                        need to make it through. 

                                 DEBBIE
                        Okay.

                                 DANNY
                             (turns to Evan)
                        And you should wait until morning 
                        to get the car. Doesn’t matter what 
                        kind, so long as it’s decent. 
                        Neighbors might notice a beater.
                                 EVAN
                        And afterward?

                                 DANNY
                             (pointing off-screen)
                        Leave it right down here in front 
                        of Cabrini Green with the keys in 
                        it. It’ll be gone before you make 
                        it to the corner.

           Evan smiles -- he likes it.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        I’ll bring masks and gloves...
                        And Evan: No fucking guns. 

                                 EVAN
                             (shrugs)
                        Okay.

                                 DANNY
                        I’m serious. Not a scratch, 
                        remember?

                                 EVAN
                        I remember, boss.

                                 DANNY
                        All right. You can pick me up in 
                        the same spot as last time. One 
                        o’clock.

                                 EVAN
                        We going tomorrow?

                                 DANNY
                        You got somewhere else to be?

           Evan thinks... then shakes his head, “no.”

           INT SUV - EVENING

           Driving home along the parkway, Danny’s eyes are fixed on the 
           road before him. WE PUSH IN TO A CLOSE-UP and...

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT CORNER STORE - EVENING (FLASHBACK)

           A MATCHING CLOSE-UP OF A 12 YEAR OLD DANNY emerging from a 
           convenience store into the streets of his old South Side 
           neighborhood.
           Just behind him is 12 YEAR OLD EVAN and we TRACK WITH THEM as 
           they stroll down the block. 

           As they get further from the store, they take stock of their 
           haul: pulling CANDY from their pockets; COMIC BOOKS from 
           inside their jackets; SMALL TRINKETS from their pants.  

           With a proud grin, Evan holds up a STAR WARS ACTION FIGURE. 

                                 EVAN
                        Check it out.

                                 DANNY
                        Boba Fett!

           Danny takes it and inspects it admiringly. Then Evan stops, 
           looking up at something in the skyline. He grabs Danny’s arm.

                                 EVAN
                        Challenge.

           Danny follows Evan’s gaze to AN ENORMOUS NEW SKYSCRAPER being 
           erected. The concrete and glass facade is only half done, the 
           dark silhouette of a tower crane looms sixty floors up.  

                                 DANNY
                        No.

                                 EVAN
                        Challenge.

                                 DANNY
                        Come on, Evan.

                                 EVAN
                        “The Big Dick” just called a 
                        challenge. But hey, you want to 
                        stay “The Pisser” for another three 
                        months, fine with me.

           Danny hangs his head and curses to himself.

           EXT SKYSCRAPER SITE - LATER

           The sun has ducked below the horizon. TWO SMALL FIGURES hop a 
           chain link fence and dart towards the base of the skyscraper. 

           INT SKYSCRAPER - CONTINUOUS

           Danny and Evan enter the building and bound up a set of 
           stairs...
           Several flights up, the stairs give way to plywood ramps and 
           the boys zig-zag their way to the base of the crane... 

           Danny hoists himself over the rail and starts up the gridwork 
           stairs. Evan stops here and watches Danny’s ascent.

           Danny charges up with grim determination. He’s ten stories 
           up... Then twenty -- his calves burning.

           Thirty-five stories up the outside wall ends and the wind 
           hits... At fifty stories the people on the street below are 
           dots -- the cars no bigger than grains of rice...

           At 60 stories, Danny’s at the top of the skyscraper, but he’s 
           not done climbing... One hundred and eighty steps later, he’s 
           at the operator’s cab of the crane...

           He stops and takes a deep breath. On the ceiling of the city, 
           surrounded by an indigo sky, the world is spread out beneath 
           Danny like a jeweled quilt...

           Then Danny steps out onto the two-foot wide crane arm and 
           starts out toward its tip. With eyes fixed on the horizon, 
           crouching low to fight the wind, he moves beyond the 
           skyscraper walls -- two inches of steel between him and a 
           five second trip to the street below... Step. Breath. Step 
           Breath...

           Danny reaches the end of the crane. And very carefully, he 
           stands up straight and takes a bow -- the slightest of smiles 
           evident on his face. The FLASHBACK ENDS as we:

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT RICHARD’S HOUSE - DAY

           TRACKING CLOSE UP OF TOMMY trudging down the street. PULLING 
           BACK, we see him turn up the walkway to his house lugging a 
           cumbersome school bag on his back. He takes keys from his 
           pocket, opens the front door, and enters...

           INT RICHARD’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           STEADI-CAM ON TOMMY:

           In the FOYER, Tommy dumps his coat and bag on the floor and 
           heads down the HALL and into...

           The KITCHEN. He goes to the freezer, grabs a frozen burrito, 
           tosses it into the microwave and sets the timer...
           He retrieves a glass from the cupboard and fills it with soda 
           he’s pulled from the fridge...

           In the PANTRY he finds a bag of chips... and 2 Oreo’s.

           The microwave BEEPS and Tommy retrieves a now steaming 
           burrito...

           Gathering up his goodies, he exits the kitchen through a door 
           across from the one he entered, which leads him into...

           The LIVING ROOM. Tommy sets his food onto a large coffee 
           table, plunks himself onto the couch, and manipulates a 
           handful of remote controls that fire up a high-end TV SYSTEM.

           As Tommy starts flipping through stations, we PUSH IN ON 
           HIM... Then DRIFTS OVER HIS SHOULDER...

           Through a window, a SAAB pulls up the driveway and stops in 
           front of the closed doors of the garage. A wide-eyed Danny 
           stares out at Richard’s house from the passenger window.

           EXT RICHARD’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The doors of the Saab pop open. Evan and Danny step out and 
           move quickly to the rear of the house...

           Danny leads them to a door underneath a deck overlooking the 
           big, green back yard. He slips a backpack from his shoulder 
           and removes the Crown Royal bag we first saw at the pawnshop.   

                                 EVAN
                             (smiles)
                        Couldn’t quite get rid of every 
                        piece of your past, huh?

           Danny ignores him, concentrating hard on the door. Within 
           seconds -- like riding a bike -- POP, the door opens and they 
           slip inside...

           INT RICHARD’S HOME - CONTINUOUS

           The door leads them into a MUDROOM. From his backpack, Danny 
           removes 2 SKI-MASKS which they pull over their faces. Evan 
           moves for the door leading into the kitchen, but Danny grabs 
           him and hold up a finger: wait. 

           He opens his cell-phone, scrolls to a number tagged “Debbie” 
           and chooses “send text.” He types the word: “NOW” and presses 
           the “send” button. Evan cocks his head inquisitively. Danny 
           holds his finger to his mouth and cracks open the kitchen 
           door... 
           They can hear the blare of the TV... which is shortly joined 
           by the SHRILL RING OF THE HOUSE PHONE...

           Danny pushes into the kitchen -- Evan following close behind. 
           They cross the room and pause at the doorway to the living 
           room... 

           The phone RINGS again... and we MOVE OFF Danny and Evan into 
           the living room where Tommy, still on the couch, answers the 
           phone. 

                                 TOMMY
                        Hello?

           We can hear the FEMALE VOICE on the other end of the phone 
           which we soon recognize to be Debbie’s. 

                                 FEMALE VOICE
                        Is this Tommy O’Donnell?

                                 TOMMY
                        Um... yeah.

                        Congratulations Tommy! You’ve just 
                        won a Sony Playstation3!

                        You just won a Playstation3! This 
                        is Tina Cervasio from MTV’s Trick-
                        or-treat Thursdays and you’ve just 
                        won our big treat of the day: The 
                        Playstation3 from Sony!

                                 TOMMY
                        I did?

                                 FEMALE VOICE
                        Yes you did!

           Tommy is up on his feet now, his initial confusion giving way 
           to excitement.

                                 FEMALE VOICE (CONT’D)
                        You got your TV on Tommy?

                                 TOMMY
                        Yeah!
                                 FEMALE VOICE
                        Well if you put on MTV you’re gonna 
                        see your name scrolling across the 
                        screen any minute now.

           Tommy grabs the remote and switches to MTV. An earnest rapper 
           in a jacuzzi with a dozen women.  

                                 TOMMY
                        It’s a Nelly video.

                                 FEMALE VOICE
                        Just keep your eyes on that scroll 
                        Tommy.

           ANGLE ON DANNY: Peeking into the living room, he’s overcome 
           by a sudden realization of what he is about to do. His eyes 
           fill with panic and he turns to Evan.

                                 DANNY
                        Wait-

           But Evan is out of his crouch and charging into the room 
           WIELDING A TASER in his right hand...

           Danny races after Evan, shoves him aside and grabs Tommy, 
           who’s frozen stiff with terror. Danny covers Tommy’s mouth 
           and glares at Evan.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck are you doing?!

                                 EVAN
                        You said no guns.

                                 DANNY
                        Goddammit! I said no one gets hurt!

           As the two continue to bicker, WE PUSH IN ON TOMMY: his eyes 
           bulge... he starts to hyperventilate.  

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           EXT GAS STATION - LATE AFTERNOON

           2 pumps, a service garage, and a mini-mart. Danny’s SUV turns 
           into the station and drives around to the back. Evan’s 
           Mustang is parked along a fence and Danny pulls up next to 
           him. They lower their windows.

                                 DANNY
                        Let’s get this done.
           They get out and walk to a PAY PHONE. Danny hands Evan a pair 
           of GLOVES.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        Wear these.

                                 EVAN
                        Christ. Your ass must be puckered 
                        so tight you need a shoehorn to 
                        take a shit.

           Danny ignores him, and after some hesitation Evan snatches 
           the gloves and pulls them on. He picks up the phone and 
           deposits fifty cents into the coin slot...

                                 DANNY
                        8-4-7... 8-6-6... 0-3-0-0.

           Evan punches in the number and waits for an answer...

                                 RICHARD (O.C.)
                             (through phone)

                                 EVAN
                        We have your son.

           A long beat of silence.

                                 RICHARD (O.C.)
                        What? Who is this-

                                 EVAN
                        We have Tommy. When I hang up you 
                        can go home and see for yourself. 
                        But now you’re going to want to 
                        listen quietly. You got me?
                             (pause)
                        Good boy, Dick. Here’s the story. 
                        To save your son’s life, all you 
                        have to do is everything I say. If 
                        you call the cops or do anything to 
                        make us nervous, Tommy dies.
                             (silence)
                        Dick? You there?

                                 RICHARD (O.C.)
                        How do I know he’s all right?

                                 EVAN
                        Nope. We’re not gonna do that. I’m 
                        not gonna send you a photo of him 
                        holding up today’s newspaper. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 EVAN (CONT'D)
                        I’m not gonna play a tape of his 
                        voice, and I’m not gonna threaten 
                        to cut his fingers off and send 
                        them to you in the mail. I’m just 
                        gonna kill him and disappear. 
                        Understand?

                                 RICHARD (O.C.)
                        How much do you want?

           Evan looks straight at Danny...

                                 EVAN
                        A million dollars cash.

           Danny closes his eyes and drops his head.

                                 RICHARD (O.C.)
                        I don’t have that much.

                                 EVAN
                        Nice talking to you, then. Goodbye-

                                 RICHARD (O.C.)
                        Wait! I can get it- I mean I will 
                        get it.

                                 EVAN
                        Atta boy. We’ll call you in a 
                        couple of days. And Dick? Remember 
                        that you’re dealing with serious 
                        people. Doubt it for a minute and 
                        you’ll spend the rest of your life 
                        wishing you hadn’t.

           Evan hangs up. A big smile spreads across his face.

                                 DANNY
                        You’re a stupid bastard.

           This only pleases Evan more. He chuckles.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        Half a million he could pull from 
                        his bank account. Cash in an IRA. A 
                        million makes it more likely he 
                        goes to the cops.

                                 EVAN
                        You wanna call him back?

           Danny stares at Evan -- incredulous... then turns and starts 
           back towards his car without saying a word.
                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Hard part’s over, partner. It’s all 
                        down hill from here.

           As he watches Danny go, Evan takes a paper and pen from his 
           jacket and writes: 847-866-0300 Dick

           INT CONDO - NIGHT

           Danny enters the apartment. It’s dark -- quiet. His 
           exhaustion is evident as he hangs up his coat, shuffles into 
           the LIVING ROOM, and slumps onto the couch...

           He picks up the phone, dials, and places the receiver to his 
           ear. After several rings, Danny hears Patrick’s outgoing 
           message on the other end... 

                                 DANNY
                             (to himself)

                        I need your help! Please. Call me 
                        back.

           CUT TO THE BEDROOM where Karen stands by the door listening. 
           HOLD on her for a long beat as she tries to sort through what 
           she’s just heard.

           EXT RIVERFRONT - NIGHT

           PATRICK’S CORPSE lies in an open body bag -- stiff and 
           discolored.

           Nolan and his partner, DETECTIVE MATTHEWS (40s) stand over 
           the body with TWO UNIFORMED COPS. An EVIDENCE TECH kneels by 
           Patrick, painting his fingertips with black ink. 

                                 MATTHEWS
                        How long’s he been in the water?

                        at least.

                             (turns to Nolan)
                        What do you think?

                        You can do the prints if you want, 
                        but I don’t think we need them... 
                        Because that’s Patrick Connelly.

           INT CONDO - MORNING

           In the kitchen, Danny is dressed for work and filling a 
           travel mug with coffee. Karen watches him from the doorway.

                        I was thinking we could go out 
                        tonight.

                                 DANNY
                        If I don’t need to work, sure.

                                 KAREN
                        When will you know that?

                                 DANNY
                        I’ll call later.

           Danny crosses the kitchen and slides past Karen into the 
           hall. He pulls his coat on and grabs his briefcase.

                                 KAREN
                        When are you going to stop keeping 
                        things from me?

                                 DANNY
                             (taken aback)
                        What?

                                 KAREN
                        Something has clearly been 
                        bothering you-
                                 DANNY
                             (interrupting)
                        I told you, Karen, I’ve got all 
                        this shit going on with work and 
                        it’s wearing me out. 

                                 KAREN
                        Keeping things from me hurts, 
                        Danny. Lying to me pisses me off.

                                 DANNY
                        I’m not lying to you.
                             (she stares at him -- 
                              unconvinced)
                        I’m not lying to you, Karen.

           Karen shakes her head in disgust, then turns away from him 
           and starts down the hall toward the bedroom.

                                 KAREN
                        See ya...

                                 DANNY
                        Karen.

                                 KAREN
                        Go to work, Danny.

           Danny sighs... his shoulders sag.

           EXT CONSTRUCTION SITE - MORNING

           The SUV pulls into the construction site and parks next to an 
           old FORD TEMPO covered in BUMPER STICKERS and DECALS. 

           INT SUV - MORNING (CONTINUOUS)

           Danny kills the engine and looks out at the trailer...

           A moment later, the door opens and Debbie slips outside. She 
           comes to the passenger side and gets in. 

                                 DEBBIE
                        Good morning.

                                 DANNY
                        Morning... 
                             (indicating a coffee in 
                              the drink holder)
                        That’s for you.
                                 DEBBIE
                        Bless you.

           She picks it up eagerly and has a sip. 

                                 DANNY
                        How is he?

                                 DEBBIE
                        He’s fine. He was pretty scared at 
                        first, but calmed down pretty 
                        quick. We’re halfway through a 24 
                        hour Cheers marathon on WGN.

                                 DANNY
                        Jesus. You didn’t take his mask off 
                        did you?

                                 DEBBIE
                        Of course not. I thought we were 
                        past the part where you thought I 
                        was dumb.

                                 DANNY
                        Right. Sorry... But he’s okay?

                                 DEBBIE
                        He is. Really. He’s a sweet kid. He 
                        calmed down after an hour or so and 
                        we’re buddies now. He’s got a crush 
                        on this girl at school and I’ve 
                        been telling him what to say to 
                        her... He’s totally gonna score.

           Danny leans back and sighs -- relieved.

                                 DANNY
                        It’s good to hear that, Debbie.

           A beat. Debbie frowns.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Can I ask you one thing?

                                 DANNY
                        Of course.

                                 DEBBIE
                        He said you guys had a gun.

                                 DANNY
                             (sighs; looks down)
                        It was a taser.
                                 DEBBIE
                        A taser? You were gonna electrocute 
                        him? He’s twelve.

                                 DANNY
                        That wasn’t supposed to happen.

           A silent beat falls over the SUV...

                                 DEBBIE
                        I should get back. 

                                 DANNY
                        Thanks for taking care of him, 
                        Debbie. 

           She nods, then steps out of the car and starts back for the 
           trailer. Danny rolls down the window.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        Hey. 

           She turns and he indicates the car he’s parked alongside.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        I like your car.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Yeah?

                                 DANNY
                        Reminds me of you.

                                 DEBBIE
                        I remind you of an ‘84 Tempo?

                                 DANNY
                             (laughs)
                        Just that at a glance, it might 
                        give someone the wrong impression.

           She smiles and nods her head in thanks.

           INT PATRICK’S APT - DAY

           Nolan and Matthews search Patrick’s apartment. At the kitchen 
           counter, Nolan plays through the messages on Patrick’s 
           answering machine:

           BEEP. It’s Danny’s voice.
                                 DANNY (O.C)
                             (on machine)
                        Where are you, Patrick? I need to 
                        talk to you about that thing from 
                        the other night. Call me back as 
                        soon as you get this... It’s Danny.

           ANGLE ON: Nolan, starting to fit the pieces together.

           INT DANNY’S OFFICE - DAY

           Danny sits in his office before a desk full of paperwork, but 
           his mind is elsewhere. A KNOCK on his open door snaps him to 
           attention. His co-worker, JEFF (40s) sticks his head in.

                                 JEFF
                        Hey Danny.

                                 DANNY
                        Jeff. What’s up?

           Jeff takes a step into the office, pulling another MAN in 
           beside him.

                                 JEFF
                        Can I introduce you to Clint?

                                 DANNY
                             (standing and smiling)
                        Of course.

                                 JEFF
                        Clint’s an electrician. Gonna come 
                        aboard with us this winter.

           Danny comes around his desk and shakes hands with Clint.

                                 DANNY
                        Welcome Clint. I’m Danny.

                                 CLINT
                        Nice to meet you.

                                 JEFF
                        Danny’s one of our project 
                        managers. The one you hope is 
                        running your job.

                                 DANNY
                        Easy, Jeff, you’re on contract now. 
                        No need to kiss my ass anymore.

           They all laugh.
                                 RICHARD (O.S.)
                        Danny.

           Danny looks to the door and sees Richard leaning in. It’s 
           been a long 20 hours for Richard and it shows -- dark circles 
           around his eyes; a tuft of hair sticking in the wrong 
           direction. 

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        Can you join me please?

           Richard disappears and the three of them exchange a look.

                                 DANNY
                        But we all need to keep kissing 
                        his.

           More laughter.

           INT RICHARD’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Richard leans over his mahogany desk, staring at a mess of 
           papers. He jumps when Danny raps on the open door, then 
           motions to an empty chair.

                                 RICHARD
                        Get the door, would you?

           Danny closes the door behind him and sits. Richard leans back 
           and rubs his eyes -- exhausted.

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        What’s our progress on the 
                        restaurant?

                                 DANNY
                        Fine. Running electrical this week.

                                 RICHARD
                        They know they need extra breakers 
                        in the kitchen?
                             (off Danny’s nod)
                        And they’re aware of the new wiring 
                        codes?

                                 DANNY
                        It’s under control, Richard. What’s 
                        on your mind?

           Richard hesitates.
                                 RICHARD
                        Nothing... Just going over the 
                        financials. Making sure everyone’s 
                        up to date.

                                 DANNY
                        As of last week.

                                 RICHARD
                        Good.
                             (beat)
                        We haven’t gotten the advance from 
                        Cumberland, have we?

                                 DANNY
                        No, not yet. But I don’t expect 
                        that until February.

           Richard nods -- thinking. 

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        But I could call them about it.

                                 RICHARD
                        Yeah, do that.

                                 DANNY
                        Any reason I should give them for 
                        why we want it this early?

                                 RICHARD
                             (checks his notebook)
                        Tell ‘em we can swing a twenty 
                        percent discount on materials.

                                 DANNY
                        How we gonna do that?

                                 RICHARD
                        I’ll negotiate a ten percent on a 
                        preorder. We’ll make up the rest by 
                        running a tight project.

                                 DANNY
                        That bid’s already tight.

                                 RICHARD
                             (testy)
                        We’ll figure it out when the time 
                        comes. Right now I just need the 
                        money.

           Seeing the anguish on Richard’s face, Danny softens his tone.
                                 DANNY
                        I’ll call them now, okay?

                                 RICHARD
                        Okay... Let me know how it goes.

                                 DANNY
                        I will.

           Danny stands and as we LEAD HIM OUT OF THE OFFICE, the strain 
           and guilt are clearly evident.

           INT THE FIG TREE - NIGHT

           A classy Italian restaurant: hushed and dimly lit.

           Karen and Danny sit at a table together looking over the 
           menu. Danny finishes his drink and sets the empty glass on 
           the table. Karen’s wineglass is still full.

                                 KAREN
                        Want another?

                                 DANNY
                        Guess I was thirsty.

                                 KAREN
                        I’ll catch his eye.

           Danny nods and turns back to his menu.

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        I’m at a total loss, Danny.

                                 DANNY
                        About what?

                                 KAREN
                        I’m not an idiot. 

                                 DANNY
                        Who said you were an idiot?

                                 KAREN
                        You’re treating me like one. And 
                        it’s infuriating. And confusing. I 
                        know you better than anyone and I 
                        know when something’s wrong. But 
                        not only do you deny it, you act as 
                        though I’m nuts for thinking it. I 
                        mean, how can you treat my concern 
                        with so little regard?
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 KAREN (CONT'D)
                        I’ve never felt like this with 
                        you... I’ve never felt alone with 
                        you.

           Danny reaches across the table and wraps his hands around 
           hers, squeezing them tight.

                                 DANNY
                        Oh, Karen. Sweetheart. I’m so 
                        sorry...

           He pauses, teetering on the brink of breaking down and 
           telling her all that has happened. But he balks, unable to.

           Karen pulls her hands away and sits back.

                                 KAREN
                        Why did a detective call our house 
                        today?

           The words hit Danny like a ton of bricks. 

                                 DANNY
                        What?

                                 KAREN
                        A Detective Nolan left a message 
                        for you. Said he had some things he 
                        wanted to discuss. 

                                 DANNY
                             (scrambling)
                        Oh... Right. Good. We had some 
                        break-ins. Vandalism, some tools 
                        stolen. Probably just kids, but we 
                        gotta go through the motions, you 
                        know?

           The lie could not have fallen flatter.

                                 KAREN
                        Good night, Danny.

           She rises from her chair and walks away, leaving Danny all 
           alone.

                                                              FADE OUT.

           EXT IHOP - DAY

           Establishing. The familiar facade of the ubiquitous pancake 
           house. 
           INT IHOP - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

           Debbie and Evan share a booth. Her plate is clean, but he’s 
           still working on a burger.

                                 DEBBIE
                        We should go.

                                 EVAN
                        Relax.

                                 DEBBIE
                        It’s almost two. I told him I’d be 
                        back to watch The Rockford Files. 

                                 EVAN
                        That’s sweet. Let’s adopt him.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Fuck you. I just don’t think Danny 
                        would be happy about us leaving him 
                        alone for this long is all.

           Evan shoots a look across the table.

                                 EVAN
                        Fuck Danny. Christ, the two of you 
                        are like a broken record.
                             (with a mocking whine)
                        Oh golly, I hope nothing goes 
                        wrong. Oh gee, I just know we’re in 
                        for one heckuva disaster.

                                 DEBBIE
                        You’re mean.

                                 EVAN
                        No. I’m just not soft.

           He finishes his burger and stands.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        C’mon. I gotta make a call. Then we 
                        can go, okay Polly Panic?

           He throws cash on the table and leads Debbie through the 
           dining area to a pay phone near the restrooms.  

           Evan takes the SLIP OF PAPER from his jacket with Richard’s 
           phone number on it and dials.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Who are you calling?
                                 EVAN
                        Danny’s boss.

           Her eyes widen with worry and her voice drops to a whisper.

                                 DEBBIE
                        You mean Tommy’s- You’re not 
                        calling him from here, are you?

                                 EVAN
                        What? Something could go wrong?

                                 DEBBIE
                        Evan-

           He holds up a finger, cutting her off.

                                 EVAN
                             (into phone)
                        Dick. You know who this is?
                             (pause)
                        That’s right. How’s the money 
                        coming?
                             (pause)
                        Half the money, you get half the 
                        kid. You want the top or the 
                        bottom? Or I could split him down 
                        the middle, you’ll still have one 
                        of everything.
                             (pause)
                        By tomorrow, Dick. We’ll call you 
                        with a time and place... And if we 
                        even suspect that you’ve called the 
                        police, I’ll shoot your boy in the 
                        head. Okay?
                             (pause)
                        Good. We’ll talk tomorrow then.

           As Evan hangs up, the men’s room door suddenly swings open 
           and a MIDDLE-AGED MAN emerges. His eyes meet Debbie’s briefly 
           and the anxiety in them betrays that he’s heard too much.

           Evan watches him hustle back to his table, grab his BILL and 
           head for the front register.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        He heard me.

                                 DEBBIE
                        No he didn’t.

           As the man exits, he steals a glance back at Evan.
                                 EVAN
                        Yes he did.

           Evan starts after him...

           EXT IHOP PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Evan and Debbie walk through the lot arm in arm. Ahead of 
           them, the customer gets into his SUV which is parked a couple 
           of spaces from Evan’s Mustang.

           Upon reaching the Mustang, Evan opens the door for Debbie and 
           she gets in. 

           DEBBIE’S POV: Evan starts around the front of the car, but 
           instead of getting into the driver’s side, he moves quickly 
           to the customer’s SUV and jumps into the passenger seat. Evan 
           grabs the man violently by the neck and pins him back in his 
           seat. The man’s eyes bulge with fear.

           ANGLE ON: Debbie, just as terrified... And then she FLINCHES 
           at the MUFFLED POP-POP-POP OF THREE GUNSHOTS.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           INT CONDO - DAY

           Karen’s in the BEDROOM -- restless and agitated. She searches 
           the pockets of Danny’s clothes, rummages through his chest of 
           drawers, looking for something -- anything -- that will clue 
           her into what Danny is keeping from her.

           On the closet floor she sees the backpack Danny had when 
           kidnapping Tommy. She grabs it, sits on the bed, and opens 
           it. Inside she finds the ski-masks, gloves, and Crown Royal 
           bag.

           INT CONDO - LATER

           Karen paces nervously in the kitchen, the phone to her ear.

                                 NOLAN (O.C.)
                             (through phone)
                        Detective Nolan.

                                 KAREN
                        Hi. This is Karen Moss. You called 
                        Danny and me yesterday... Danny 
                        Carter.
                                 NOLAN (O.C.)
                        Yes, you’re right. I did. Is Danny 
                        there?

                                 KAREN
                        No. He’s been real busy lately so I 
                        thought I’d see if I could help.

                                 NOLAN (O.C.)
                        I’d really like to speak to him. Do 
                        you have another number?

                                 KAREN
                        Not really. It’s difficult to get 
                        him at work. He’s away from his 
                        desk most of the time.

                                 NOLAN (O.C.)
                        I see. When does he get home 
                        tonight?

                                 KAREN
                        I’m not sure when that will be.

           A pause.

                                 NOLAN (O.C.)
                        Does Danny know you’re calling me, 
                        Ms. Moss?

                                 KAREN
                             (another pause)
                        No.

                                 NOLAN (O.C.)
                        Could we talk in person, Ms. Moss? 
                        Can I buy you a coffee? Some lunch?

           Karen hesitates...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT BELMONT RESTAURANT - DAY

           Karen and Nolan sit at a corner table in a NEAR EMPTY DINER.

                                 NOLAN
                        How long have you and Danny been 
                        together?

                                 KAREN
                        A long time.
                                 NOLAN
                        Yeah? Since before he got into the 
                        construction business?

           She gives him a look.

                                 KAREN
                        What do you mean?

                                 NOLAN
                        Nothing... I’ve known Danny since 
                        before he could walk. Known all 
                        those guys: Danny, Patrick 
                        Connelly... Evan McGann. That whole 
                        sticky-finger crew.
                             (beat)
                        You know them? Patrick, Evan?

                                 KAREN
                             (cautious)
                        Patrick’s a friend. He and Danny 
                        are like brothers really. We still 
                        see a lot of him.

                                 NOLAN
                        Oh yeah? When was the last time you 
                        saw him?

                                 KAREN
                        Just last week. He was over for 
                        dinner.

                                 NOLAN
                        And Evan? You know Evan McGann too?

                                 KAREN
                        We haven’t seen Evan for many 
                        years.

                                 NOLAN
                        Since he went to prison?

                                 KAREN
                        Why did you call, Detective?

           Nolan sits back in his seat, looks Karen over.

                                 NOLAN
                        Did you know that Danny came to see 
                        me last week?

           Karen looks up at him, betrays her surprise.
                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        We had breakfast. 
                             (beat)
                        And I know he’s got a problem.
                        I know that Evan came to see him.

                                 KAREN
                        But he’s not out yet.

                                 NOLAN
                        Yes he is.

                                 KAREN
                        He got twelve years.

                                 NOLAN
                        And got paroled after seven.
                             (beat)
                        What’s Danny up to, Karen?

                                 KAREN
                        I’m sorry. I don’t know what you’re 
                        talking about.

                                 NOLAN
                        I think you do. Your boyfriend and 
                        Evan McGann are back together 
                        again, Karen, and you and I both 
                        know how dangerous that can be.

           Her heart pounds in her chest.

                                 KAREN
                        I can’t help you, Detective... I’m 
                        sorry.

           Without meeting his eyes, she slides out of her chair and 
           walks away quickly. 

           REVERSE ON KAREN as she beelines for the exit.

           INT SUV - EVENING (MOVING)

           POV: Approaching the parking lot of O’Donnell Construction. 
           Suddenly, out of nowhere, Debbie appears in the street. Danny 
           squeals to a stop and rolls down the passenger window.

                                 DANNY
                        You shouldn’t be here, Debbie.

           She leans in through the window -- rattled, scared.
                                 DEBBIE
                        I know, Danny. I’m sorry. I didn’t 
                        know what else to do.

                                 DANNY
                        Are you okay?

                                 DEBBIE
                        No... Evan killed someone.

                                 DANNY
                        Get in.

           INT SUV - LATER

           They’re parked in a MALL PARKING LOT. Danny stares vacantly 
           out the window. Debbie talks to her lap.

                                 DEBBIE
                        We drove to O’Hare and left the car 
                        in long-term parking. Said he’d 
                        deal with it later.

                                 DANNY
                        Where is he now?

                                 DEBBIE
                        At the trailer.

                                 DANNY
                        All right. You should go home.

                                 DEBBIE
                        And do what?

                                 DANNY
                        Do your best to pretend none of 
                        this ever happened.

                                 DEBBIE
                        What do you mean?

                                 DANNY
                        Time to walk away, Debbie.

                                 DEBBIE
                        How do I do that?

           Danny stops, looks over at her: good question.

                                 DANNY
                        I don’t know.
                                 DEBBIE
                        What are you gonna do?

           A long pause...

                                 DANNY
                        I don’t know.

           EXT CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT

           Danny pulls in fast and parks next to the Mustang. As he 
           jumps out, Evan exits the trailer and descends the steps. 

                                 EVAN
                        Hey partner.

           Danny closes the distance between them in four long strides 
           and unloads a HAYMAKER that connects square to Evan’s jaw. 
           Evan falls back, crashing onto the steps...

           Danny keeps coming. But Evan recovers quick and POUNCES, 
           driving Danny backwards with a series of BOOMING PUNCHES, 
           several of which land solidly...

           Danny gets a hold of Evan’s jacket and grapples him to the 
           ground...

           As they writhe in the dirt, Evan frees an arm and delivers 
           two brutal hits to Danny’s ribs, then hops to his feet and 
           backs away... 

           Slowly, Danny stands, wincing in pain. They’re both out of 
           breath, shoulders heaving...

           Danny’s not done yet, however. He takes a step towards Evan 
           and LUNGES. But Evan sees it coming. He steps to his left and 
           buries an uppercut fist in Danny’s face, dropping him to the 
           dirt with a thud... 

           ANGLE ON: Danny, splayed across the ground and staring into 
           the night sky. His ears ring -- his brain reboots... Now he’s 
           done. 

           Evan sits on the trailer steps and lights a cigarette. 
           Danny’s right eye is swelling shut fast.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        So that dumb cooze of mine found 
                        you, huh?... Well, I’m not going 
                        back to Statesville because of some 
                        fat-ass Bears fan. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        I realize it probably wasn’t part 
                        of the plan, but I don’t seem to 
                        fit into your plans anyway. So I 
                        went my own way.

                                 DANNY
                        You need to get out of here. And I 
                        need to get that kid home somehow.

                                 EVAN
                        Nothing changes.

                                 DANNY
                        Everything already is changed, 
                        Evan... Killing someone in the 
                        middle of the job changes 
                        everything.

                                 EVAN
                        It doesn’t change the fact that 
                        tomorrow I’m trading that kid in 
                        there to his father for a million 
                        bones.

                                 DANNY
                        You have to leave, man. You need to 
                        get as far away from here as you 
                        can. This ain’t pawnshops. You 
                        killed a guy in the middle of the 
                        afternoon. In a fucking IHOP 
                        parking lot! Cops are coming for 
                        you, bro.

           Evan sneers at Danny. He stands and starts up the steps.

                                 EVAN
                        Come with me... I got something to 
                        show you.

           Danny struggles to his feet and follows Evan into the 
           trailer. 

           INT TRAILER - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           They step inside. The TV lights the dank interior in 
           flickering shades of blue and white. Empty microwave dinner 
           packages litter the counter.

           Tommy lies prone across the couch, strips of duct-tape 
           covering his eyes and mouth. His feet are taped to one arm of 
           the couch, his hands to the other. It’s a horrific sight.
                                 DANNY
                        Jesus Christ.

           Evan moves to the couch. He takes a gun from his belt and 
           presses the muzzle to Tommy’s forehead.

                                 EVAN
                        You’re right, Danny. This isn’t a 
                        pawnshop.

                                 DANNY
                        Evan-

                                 EVAN
                        Enough of your talking. It’s time 
                        you understood something. You 
                        bailed on me once. That’s not gonna 
                        happen again. Not without 
                        consequences.

           He cocks the pistol and holds a hard stare on Danny. 

                                 DANNY
                             (relenting)
                        Okay... Okay Evan.

           INT CONDO - NIGHT

           Danny enters the condo holding an ICE PACK to his eye. The 
           swelling has gone down some, but there’s still nothing pretty 
           about it. As he’s pulling his coat off he notices 2 SUITCASES 
           at his feet. Karen appears at the lip of the hall, the Crown 
           Royal bag in her hands.

                                 DANNY
                        I didn’t know we’d gotten this far.

                                 KAREN
                        You should have.

                                 DANNY
                        Would it make any difference that I 
                        was coming home to tell you what’s 
                        been going on? To tell you the tru-

                                 KAREN
                        You’re too late, Danny. Someone 
                        already told me what’s going on.

                                 DANNY
                             (taken aback)
                        What?
                                 (MORE)
                                 DANNY (CONT'D)
                             (she doesn’t answer)
                        Who told you what’s going on? 

                                 KAREN
                        It doesn’t matter. What matters is 
                        that you broke the only rule I ever 
                        had.

                                 DANNY
                        Karen, you need to tell me who you 
                        talked to.

                                 KAREN
                        Why?

                                 DANNY
                        Because there aren’t that many 
                        people who know what’s going on. 
                        And I need to know which one it  
                        is.

                                 KAREN
                        Sean Nolan told me.

                                 DANNY
                             (surprised)
                        Sean Nolan? What did Sean Nolan 
                        tell you?

                                 KAREN
                        He told me that Evan is out of 
                        prison.

                                 DANNY
                        He is.

                                 KAREN
                        And that you two are back together 
                        again.

                                 DANNY
                             (laughs)
                        Back together again?

                                 KAREN
                        Don’t fucking laugh, Danny.

                                 DANNY
                        Sean Nolan doesn’t know anything, 
                        okay? And whatever he might have 
                        told you is just a guess on his 
                        part... 
                                 KAREN
                        Then you tell me.

           Danny takes a deep breath -- steeling himself.

                                 DANNY
                        None of it’s good.

                                 KAREN
                        Is it the truth?

                                 DANNY
                        Yes.
                             (pause)
                        About three weeks ago, Evan came to 
                        see me. He was out on parole and 
                        wanted to go back to work. I don’t 
                        know why I didn’t tell you. I think 
                        I was scared to even bring up the 
                        idea of Evan back into our lives... 
                        I guess I thought I could get rid 
                        of him.

                                 KAREN
                        But you couldn’t.

                                 DANNY
                             (shakes his head)
                        I told him I wasn’t interested, but 
                        he wasn’t having it. I offered him 
                        a job -- some cash for his pocket, 
                        but that only seemed to piss him 
                        off more. It insulted him.
                             (beat)
                        And then one day I came home and 
                        found him sitting in the kitchen.

                                 KAREN
                        Our kitchen?

                                 DANNY
                        Yes.

                                 KAREN
                        Why didn’t you call the police?

                                 DANNY
                        I did. That’s when I went to Nolan.

                                 KAREN
                        I mean the regular police.
                                 DANNY
                        Because... I’m an ex-con. Because I 
                        was in the pawnshop. I was worried 
                        they’d start digging through all of 
                        that. At least with Nolan, I 
                        thought maybe he’d understand -- 
                        help out. But I couldn’t tell him 
                        everything either.

                                 KAREN
                        Why not?

                                 DANNY
                             (hesitates)
                        Because I was thinking about doing 
                        it.

                                 KAREN
                        Doing what?
                             (beat - nothing)
                        Doing what, Danny?

                                 DANNY
                        He wanted me to help him kidnap 
                        Richard’s son.

           A laugh bursts from Karen. But Danny remains straight-faced, 
           and Karen’s expression changes rapidly to disbelief -- a hand 
           comes up to cover her mouth.

                                 KAREN
                             (a whisper)
                        Oh my God...

                                 DANNY
                        It’s complicated, Karen.

                                 KAREN
                        Oh my God. Why aren’t you telling 
                        me you didn’t do it?

           Danny looks down. Karen can’t believe what she’s hearing -- 
           the room starts to spin.

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        Why would you do that? How could 
                        you do that?

                                 DANNY
                        I didn’t think I had a choice. If 
                        you understood what was-

                                 KAREN
                        What is there to understand? 
                                 DANNY
                        Listen-

                                 KAREN
                        No. I don’t want to- I can’t. Oh my 
                        God that poor little boy. What did 
                        you do to that poor little boy?

                                 DANNY
                        Karen!

                                 KAREN
                        You’re a monster.

                                 DANNY
                        Goddammit, Karen. You’re not 
                        listening to me!

           And in a quick and violent burst, Danny PUNCHES HIS FIST 
           THROUGH THE WALL. Silence -- stillness -- descends on the 
           room.

                                 KAREN
                        You need to leave.

                                 DANNY
                        I did it because I had to. Because 
                        I thought that if I was there I 
                        could keep Tommy safe -- protect 
                        him from getting hurt. That I could 
                        somehow manage the situation-

                                 KAREN
                        Danny-

                                 DANNY
                        I did it because he attacked you in 
                        an alley and I couldn’t think of 
                        any other way to get him to leave 
                        us alone.

           Taken aback, Karen looks at Danny -- shaken, overwhelmed.

                                 KAREN
                        Please go Danny... Please just go.

           His eyes plead, but she turns away from him and disappears 
           down the hall.
           INT APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Danny pounds on the front door to Patrick’s apartment. But 
           after several attempts and no response, he fishes a SWISS 
           ARMY KNIFE from his pocket, drops to his knees, and starts 
           picking the lock. 

                                 MALE VOICE (O.C.)
                        I’ll call the police, sir.

           Danny freezes. The voice comes from behind a neighbor’s door.

                                 DANNY
                        Please don’t do that. My friend 
                        lives here -- Patrick. I haven’t 
                        been able to reach him for a while. 
                        I just want to make sure he’s okay.

           A long silence fills the hallway... Then a BUSINESS CARD 
           slides out from beneath the neighbor’s door.

                                 MALE VOICE (O.C.)
                        The detective who was here left 
                        this.

           Danny picks up the business card: It’s Sean Nolan’s.

                                 DANNY
                        Why was he here?

           Another long silence.

                                 MALE VOICE
                        I’m very sorry, sir... but I’m 
                        afraid your friend was killed last 
                        week.

           The words hit Danny like a bag of wrenches to the head. His 
           knees buckle and he slumps awkwardly to the floor in a heap. 

           And we HOLD ON Danny for an extended beat... and then:

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           INT SUV - MORNING

           The bright morning sun burns through the windows and onto 
           Danny’s face as he sleeps in the back seat of his car.

           His eyes crack open and he sits up -- hair a mess; clothes 
           disheveled -- wearing the events of last night like a bad 
           hangover. 
           EXT CONSTRUCTION SITE - MORNING

           The SUV enters the site and parks next to Debbie’s car. Danny 
           jumps out and hurries to the trailer door...

           INT TRAILER - MORNING (CONTINUOUS)

           He enters. The lights are off and so is the TV. He scours the 
           trailer, but it’s empty: No one’s here.

           A NOTE scribbled on a piece of paper sits on the counter. 
           Danny picks it up and reads:

           INSERT NOTE: Partner - Change of plans. Sorry.

                                 DANNY
                        Fuck! 

           He takes a moment -- considering his option... before 
           exiting.

           EXT CONSTRUCTION SITE - MORNING (CONTINUOUS)

           Emerging from the trailer, Danny stops short...

                                 NOLAN (O.S.)
                        Danny Carter.

           Sean Nolan and Detective Matthews stand next to a BLACK CROWN 
           VICTORIA that has pulled in behind the SUV. 

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Turn around and put your hands on 
                        your head.

           Danny hesitates... Before complying. 

           Nolan approaches Danny and fastens a PAIR OF HANDCUFFS around 
           his wrists. He then leads him toward the Crown Victoria.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        You know you really should return 
                        phone calls from the police.

                                 DANNY
                        Sorry.

                                 NOLAN
                        You know who doesn’t?

                                 DANNY
                        People who are busy?
                                 NOLAN
                        People with something to hide.

           He opens the back door to his car and shoves Danny inside.

                                 DANNY
                        Touche.

           Nolan slams the door shut.

           EXT PIKE STREET - SECONDS LATER

           The Crown Victoria pulls out of the construction site and we 
           follow it down the block. But as it turns, it leaves frame 
           and we stay on a PARKED CAMARO with tinted windows.

           INT CAMARO - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

           Evan and Debbie sit inside. She’s agitated -- staring after 
           the Crown Victoria.

                                 DEBBIE
                        What the fuck, Evan?
                             (he doesn’t respond)
                        What the fuck does that mean? Did 
                        you rat him out?
                             (still nothing)
                        ...Evan-

                                 EVAN
                             (sharply)
                        Shut it or I’m throwing your tired 
                        ass in the trunk too! 

           She recoils, slumps in her seat. Evan stares at her hard. But 
           then something occurs to him and he starts the car...

           As the Camaro pulls from the curb, we DRIFT into the back 
           seat and PUSH THROUGH the leather cushions INTO THE TRUNK 
           where Tommy lies bound and gagged in the darkness, his eyes 
           wet with tears and round as half-dollars...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT HOLDING CELL - DAY

           Danny sits on a bench inside a small holding cell. 

           A PEEPHOLE cut into the door darkens suddenly and Danny 
           realizes someone is watching him.
                                 DANNY
                        Do I get a phone call?

           A long beat... And then a key turns in the lock. The door 
           swings open and Nolan stands framed in the threshold.

                                 NOLAN
                        Yeah... Then we’ll talk.

                                 DANNY
                        You’re the boss.

           INT HOMICIDE DEPARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Nolan leads Danny through the department to a desk. He cuffs 
           Danny to a chair and points to the phone. 

                                 NOLAN
                        Ten minutes.

           Danny nods and Nolan walks off. He waits until the cop is out 
           of earshot before picking up the phone and dialing... The 
           other end rings several times before the answering machine 
           picks up:

                                 KAREN’S VOICE (O.C.)
                             (message)
                        You’ve reached Danny and Karen. 
                        We’re not in right now, but if you 
                        leave your name and number we’ll 
                        get back to you as soon as we can. 
                        Thanks.

           BEEP.

                                 DANNY
                        Karen? Pick up if you’re there... 
                        Dammit Karen, where are- 

           Click. The other end picks up.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        Karen?

                                 EVAN (O.C.)
                             (on phone)
                        Hey Partner.

           Danny’s stomach drops.

                                 EVAN (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, but Karen’s tied up at 
                        the moment.
           Evan chuckles. Danny’s grip tightens around the phone.

                                 DANNY
                        I’m warning you-

                                 EVAN (O.C.)
                        Shut up you arrogant prick. She’s 
                        okay. But you just be careful about 
                        what you say to our old buddy Sean, 
                        or that’ll change.

                                 DANNY
                             (a long pause)
                        I understand.

                                 EVAN (O.C.)
                        Atta boy. Gotta run. 

           Click. Evan hangs up. 

                                 DANNY
                        Okay. I’ll see you later then.

           He places the receiver back in its cradle, the dread 
           unmistakable across his face.

                                 MATTHEWS (O.S.)
                        Bad news?

           Matthews has materialized beside him. Danny forces a smile 
           and stands.

                                 DANNY
                        Angry girlfriend. You guys ready 
                        for me?

                                 MATTHEWS
                             (smirks)
                        Yeah... This way.

           INT INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

           Danny and Nolan sit across from one another at a table in a 
           small windowless room. A two-way mirror fills one wall; A 
           surveillance camera mounted in one corner of the ceiling 
           records the conversation.

                                 NOLAN
                        So, I’m obligated to remind you 
                        that you can have counsel here if 
                        you like.
                                 DANNY
                        Do I need it?

                                 NOLAN
                             (shrugs)
                        I just have a couple questions.

                                 DANNY
                        About Patrick?

                                 NOLAN
                        Mostly, yeah.

                                 DANNY
                        I only found out last night.

                                 NOLAN
                             (skeptical)
                        Is that so?

                                 DANNY
                        What happened?

                                 NOLAN
                        Someone shot him and dumped him in 
                        the river.

           Danny winces.

                                 DANNY
                        Well I don’t know who would do that 
                        to Patrick, but he was the closest 
                        thing I had to a brother, so I’m 
                        just as interested in figuring it 
                        out as you are.

                                 NOLAN
                        Right. So how come your little 
                        brother didn’t follow your lead on 
                        the path to upstanding citizenry? 

                                 DANNY
                        I can’t answer that.

                                 NOLAN
                        You can’t, or you won’t?

                                 DANNY
                        If I could, I wouldn’t.

           Nolan snorts incredulously.
                                 NOLAN
                        So it was brotherhood that 
                        prevented you from severing ties 
                        with a piece of shit felon like 
                        Patrick?

           Danny’s eyes narrow.

                                 DANNY
                        You want to push my buttons, Sean? 
                        It ain’t gonna work. Talk shit 
                        about my friend who just got killed 
                        and I will lawyer up right now.

           Nolan puts his palms on the table in front of Danny and leans 
           in close to him.

                                 NOLAN
                        Fair enough. But give me another 
                        flip answer and I’ll shine up that 
                        left eye of yours brighter than the 
                        right. 

           They stare one another down like a couple of prizefighters.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                             (re: black eye)
                        How’d you get that anyway? Looks 
                        nasty.

                                 DANNY
                        Work. Ran smack into a cold water 
                        shut-off valve.

                                 NOLAN
                        I see. Thought maybe it had to do 
                        with that thing you came to see me 
                        about the other day.

                                 DANNY
                        Evan? Haven’t heard from him in a 
                        couple weeks.

                                 NOLAN
                        Just went away, huh? 

                                 DANNY
                        Guess he figured I wasn’t much of a 
                        target for a shakedown.

                                 NOLAN
                        Nice when problems solve themselves 
                        like that, huh?
                                 DANNY
                        Sure is.

           Pause. 

                                 NOLAN
                        So who killed Patrick?

                                 DANNY
                        I don’t know, Sean.

                                 NOLAN
                        I think you do. In fact, I think 
                        you killed him.

                                 DANNY
                        What?

                                 NOLAN
                        I think you hired him to get rid of 
                        Evan, but Evan got the best of him. 
                        Which means, basically, you killed 
                        him.
                             (pause)
                        We got you on tape asking Patrick 
                        to call you about a job. Sounding 
                        desperate. This is a couple of days 
                        after Patrick was supposed to have 
                        taken care of Evan and you’re 
                        getting worried.

                                 DANNY
                        What tape?

                                 NOLAN
                        Come on, Danny. You were scared. 
                        You needed help. You paid your best 
                        friend to take care of it for you, 
                        but things went bad. And that’s why 
                        you’ve been running from me.

                                 DANNY
                        I have no idea what you’re talking 
                        about.

                                 NOLAN
                        Don’t be stupid. Evan is still out 
                        there and I’m sure he knows who 
                        sent Patrick after him. We can 
                        protect you. We can make a deal. 
                        You might have to face some 
                        charges, but Evan will go away for 
                        good -- for killing your brother... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 NOLAN (CONT'D)
                        And you can stop looking over your 
                        shoulder.

           Danny takes a long beat, considering the choice before him... 
           then looks square into Nolan’s eyes:

                                 DANNY
                        I have no idea what you’re talking 
                        about.

           Nolan straightens, starts to seethe.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT OBSERVATION ROOM - LATER

           Nolan now stands on the other side of the 2-way mirror. He 
           and Matthews watch ANOTHER DETECTIVE (50s) run Danny through 
           the same questions as before.

                                 MATTHEWS
                        You wanna hold onto him? Sweat him 
                        over the weekend? 

                                 NOLAN
                        No. He ain’t gonna budge. Turn him 
                        loose when Willie’s done. See if he 
                        leads us someplace.

                                 MATTHEWS
                        All right.

           INT SUV - LATE AFTERNOON

           Parked in a POLICE IMPOUND LOT, Danny sits inside his SUV 
           searching for a number in his cell phone. Finding it, he 
           presses send and puts the phone to his ear...

                                 DEBBIE (O.C.)
                        Hello?

                                 DANNY
                        Listen. I don’t have much time so I 
                        need you to pay attention. Evan has 
                        lost it. He’s got my girlfriend... 
                        He kidnapped my girl-

                                 DEBBIE (O.C.)
                             (interrupting)
                        I know.
                                 DANNY
                        What?

                                 DEBBIE (O.C.)
                        He put a gun in my mouth, Danny. He 
                        put a gun in my mouth and said he’d 
                        kill me. 

           Danny hears the panic in her voice and softens his tone.

                                 DANNY
                        Where’s Karen, Debbie?

                                 DEBBIE (O.C.)
                        She’s here. Tied up in the other 
                        room.

                                 DANNY
                             (shudders)
                        Did he hurt her?

                                 DEBBIE
                        No. Not yet.

                                 DANNY
                        Where are you, Debbie?

                                 DEBBIE
                        In the bathroom.

                                 DANNY
                        What bathroom? Where? 

                                 DEBBIE
                        I’m scared.

                                 DANNY
                        Then tell me where you are so I can 
                        come and help, okay?

                                 DEBBIE
                        I can’t. He’ll kill me if you come 
                        here.

                                 DANNY
                        I know you’re scared Debbie. I know 
                        you’re hoping things will turn out 
                        all right -- that you can ride it 
                        out. But you can’t. Evan is gonna 
                        kill Karen, and probably Tommy and 
                        his dad, too... He’s gonna kill 
                        Tommy, Karen.
                                 DEBBIE
                        You don’t know that.

                                 DANNY
                        Yes I do. I thought the same as 
                        you, okay? Thought I could just 
                        play along and everything would 
                        work out. But it can’t. Not 
                        anymore. The only way things will 
                        end is if we end them.

           A BANGING SOUND on the other end and a muffled voice:

                                 EVAN (O.C.)
                        What the fuck’s taking so long, 
                        Deborah?

                                 DEBBIE (O.C.)
                        I’ll be right out.
                             (to Danny)
                        I have to go.

                                 DANNY
                        No. Wait! Debbie, please. Tell me 
                        where you are.

                                 DEBBIE (O.C.)
                        I’m sorry, Danny.

                                 DANNY
                        Debbie!

           But the line is dead.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        Fuck!

           He redials... but the phone goes directly to Debbie’s voice-
           mail.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        FUCK!!!

           He slumps, about to concede defeat... But suddenly, an idea 
           occurs to him and he sits up straight. He starts the car and 
           tears out of the parking lot.

           EXT RICHARD’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           HALLOWEEN NIGHT in a prime trick-or-treating neighborhood. 
           COSTUMED KIDS stalk the houses in small clusters. EXCITED 
           PARENTS watch from the street under a barrage of CAMERA 
           FLASHES.
           Danny stands at Richard’s door and rings the bell... No 
           answer. He rings again and peers through the door’s 
           windowpane into the darkened interior... He spots something 
           and starts pounding on the door with his fist.

                                 DANNY
                        Richard! Richard, I need to talk to 
                        you.

           The door cracks open and Richard pokes his head out. He looks 
           awful.

                                 RICHARD
                        I can’t talk right now, Danny.

                                 DANNY
                        Please. I need to talk to you.

                                 RICHARD
                        Not now.

           He starts to close the door, but Danny stops it with his 
           foot.

                                 DANNY
                        I know what’s going on, Richard... 
                        I know about Tommy.

                                 RICHARD
                             (startled)
                        What?

                                 DANNY
                        I know about Tommy. I know he’s 
                        been taken.

           Richard pulls the door open.

                                 RICHARD
                        How do you know that?

                                 DANNY
                             (a long beat)
                        Because I took him.

           Richard stares blankly at Danny for a long time... Then turns 
           and heads down the hall, leaving the front door open. Danny 
           pauses before following after him.

           INT RICHARD’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Danny follows Richard down the length of the hall and into 
           his OFFICE...
           Richard goes to a closet and searches inside. Danny lingers 
           just inside the door...

           Richard pulls out a BASEBALL BAT and charges Danny -- his 
           anger bursting forth...

                                 RICHARD
                        Where is MY SON!?

                                 DANNY
                             (flinching)
                        Jesus Christ, Richard!

           He pummels Danny, who falls to the floor, covering himself 
           with his arms.

                                 RICHARD
                             (screaming)
                        WHERE IS MY SON!?

                                 DANNY
                        I don’t know. I don’t know, 
                        Richard! Please!

                                 RICHARD
                        You fucking asshole! WHY!? WHY 
                        WOULD YOU DO THAT!?

           He continues to pound on Danny.

                                 DANNY
                        Richard, STOP!

                                 RICHARD
                        FUCK YOU!

                                 DANNY
                        RICHARD!

                                 RICHARD
                        FUCK YOU!

                                 DANNY 
                        Please! He’s gonna kill your boy! 
                        Just listen to me. Before you kill 
                        me just listen to me.

           And then, as quick as it came, the homicidal impulse loses 
           its grip on Richard and he drops the bat to the floor. He 
           staggers across the room and collapses into his desk chair.

                                 RICHARD
                        Is he hurt?
                                 DANNY
                        No... At least he wasn’t yesterday.

                                 RICHARD
                             (sharp)
                        What do you mean?
                             (beat - nothing)
                        What do you mean?!

                                 DANNY
                        The man I took him with disappeared 
                        last night... with Tommy.

                                 RICHARD
                        The man who’s been calling me?

                                 DANNY
                        Yes. His name is Evan.

                                 RICHARD
                        Evan?

                                 DANNY
                        When did he call last?

                                 RICHARD
                        This morning- What do you mean 
                        disappeared?

                                 DANNY
                        What did he say?

                                 RICHARD
                        Where did he disappear to?

                                 DANNY
                        I don’t know. Did you set up the 
                        exchange?

                                 RICHARD
                        Answer me, Goddamnit!

           Danny stops. A long beat passes between them...

                                 DANNY
                        There are some things you should 
                        know, Richard. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Yes there are.

                                 DANNY
                        Some other things, too. 
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 DANNY (CONT'D)
                        I’ve been lying to you for a long 
                        time. Ever since I met you... I 
                        didn’t grow up in Detroit. Or go to 
                        Michigan State -- never even been 
                        to East Lansing. I didn’t lay brick 
                        for my father before coming to work 
                        for you. Those were all lies. My 
                        dad was a longshoreman, died of 
                        heart failure when I was fourteen. 
                        I’m from the South Side -- born and 
                        bred in Bridgeport. And in an 
                        earlier life I robbed people... I 
                        was a thief. 

           Richard stares at Danny in stunned disbelief.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           SAME - LATER

           They’re in the same spots as earlier. Danny has finished 
           laying it all out before Richard.

                                 RICHARD
                        You kidnapped my son to settle a 
                        debt? A criminal debt?

                                 DANNY
                        No. I did it because he blackmailed 
                        me. He threatened Karen, jumped her 
                        in an alley... I did it because I 
                        knew he was going to do it either 
                        way. If I didn’t help, he was going 
                        to hurt Karen. And I thought that 
                        if I were involved, I could protect 
                        Tommy.

           Richard glares across his desk at Danny.

                                 RICHARD
                        Why are you here, Danny?

                                 DANNY
                        Because if you deliver the money 
                        alone he’s going to kill you and 
                        Tommy both.

                                 RICHARD
                        How do you know that? 

                                 DANNY
                        Because he’s already killed two 
                        people since he got out.

                        My best friend and some guy who 
                        overheard a call he made to you. 
                        This is his big score. He’s not 
                        taking any chances... I’m here to 
                        help, Richard. I know that sounds 
                        crazy, but it’s true.

                                 RICHARD
                        Why should I believe anything you 
                        say?

                                 DANNY
                        Because he’s got Karen too.

                                 RICHARD
                        What?

                                 DANNY
                        He took Karen from the apartment 
                        this morning. He thought I was 
                        gonna go to the cops so he took her 
                        to insure I kept my mouth shut.

           A long silence passes between the two men.

                                 RICHARD
                        I’m supposed to be at the Pike 
                        Street construction site at 9:00 
                        with a million dollars.

           A WALL CLOCK reads: 7:14

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           INT RANGE ROVER - NIGHT (MOVING)

           The CLOCK on the dashboard reads: 8:31. Richard drives; Danny 
           next to him in the passenger’s seat. 

                                 RICHARD
                        It’s funny. This is the last thing 
                        in the world Tommy would expect 
                        from me.

                                 DANNY
                        What’s that?

                                 RICHARD
                        Me coming to save him.
                             (beat)
                        Tell me again why we’re not calling 
                        the police?
                                 DANNY
                        Trust me. You bring the police, 
                        Tommy and Karen die. Evan will be 
                        watching. You’d save your life, but 
                        it will cost you your son’s.

                                 RICHARD
                        They have SWAT teams -- snipers.

                                 DANNY
                        You call now, you’ll get squad 
                        cars, maybe a couple of detectives. 
                        They’ll be noisy and they’ll be 
                        slow.

                                 RICHARD
                        That’s gotta be better than the two 
                        of us.

                                 DANNY
                        You’d be surprised.

           Pause.

                                 RICHARD
                        Why is this happening to me?

                                 DANNY
                        Because you have something. Because 
                        your life is blessed. Because 
                        nothing is out of reach... It’s not 
                        complicated. It’s happening because 
                        you have something and others 
                        don’t. And that’s all the reason 
                        some people need.

                                 RICHARD
                        People like you.

           ANGLE ON DANNY: That stung... but it was not unfair. He looks 
           out at the approaching Chicago skyline towering before them.

           EXT STREET - NIGHT

           The Range Rover pulls to the curb. Danny gets out of the car 
           and darts into a lot alongside an abandoned building.

           As Richard drives off, we see a Crown Victoria idling a short 
           distance away. It’s Nolan. He drops the car into gear and 
           follows the Range Rover.
           EXT ROOF - MOMENTS LATER

           Atop the roof of an abandoned CONVENIENCE STORE, Danny crawls 
           to the edge. The rooftop borders the construction site and 
           gives him a clear view of the unfinished lofts.

           Danny’s eyes search the structure, but plastic sheeting 
           encases the first four floors making it impossible to see 
           inside. He looks at his watch: 8:49.

                                 DANNY
                        Fuck.

           He starts to turn back, but something catches his eye and he 
           stops...

           DANNY’S POV: By the stairwell on the top floor he sees 
           movement. Squinting, he can make out the faint outline of two 
           people huddled on the floor: Tommy and Karen! 

           And then, two floors below, a BRIEF FLASH OF LIGHT shines 
           through the plastic: Evan lighting a cigarette. 

           Danny scurries back across the roof and descends a metal 
           ladder to the alley...

           EXT ALLEY/STREET - CONTINUOUS

           He hits the ground and races down the alley, emerging onto 
           the street that runs along the back of the construction 
           site...

           In plain view of the structure now, Danny slows as he moves 
           to a 7 foot high chain-link fence that surrounds the site. He 
           takes a deep breath, grips the top of the fence, and pulls 
           himself up and over... 

           EXT CONSTRUCTION SITE - CONTINUOUS

           On the other side, he hurries to the base of the structure, 
           stopping at an H-BEAM that extends all the way up one corner 
           of the building. The plastic sheeting has come loose in a few 
           spots and it SNAPS and POPS violently in the wind.

           DANNY’S POV: Looking up, the beam seems to ascend into the 
           clouds... 

           But Danny does not hesitate. He grips the lip on either side 
           of the beam, extends his arms, and places the soles of his 
           shoes flat against its sand-papery surface. He throws his 
           weight back and puts one foot in front of the other, sliding 
           his hands along with them...
           And it works! Soon his hands bump into the CROSS-BEAM of the 
           second floor. He pulls himself up and repeats the process... 

           Danny reaches the third floor... 

           Then the fourth. His arms are tiring and the strain shows on 
           his face, but he presses on...

           His hands hit the cross-beam of the top floor and Danny hauls 
           himself up. He rolls onto his back -- exhausted.

                                 EVAN (O.C.)
                        Stop there!

           Danny’s eyes squeeze shut: Fuck!

                                 EVAN (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        Under the light. Take your jacket 
                        off... Throw it on the ground and 
                        turn around.

           Danny opens his eyes, realizing Evan is talking to Richard. 
           He moves to the front of the building and looks down: 

           The Range Rover idles inside the gate. Richard stands ten 
           feet away following Evan’s orders. 

           Danny turns away and rushes to the stairwell. Tommy and Karen 
           are gagged and blindfolded -- their wrists bound to a 
           railing. He removes their blindfolds to find two sets of the 
           most petrified eyes he’s ever seen looking up at him.

                                 DANNY
                             (softly)
                        It’s okay. We’re gonna be okay. But 
                        we need to be really quiet.

           He puts his hands on their shoulders, trying to calm them.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        You’re gonna follow me to the 
                        bottom of the stairs. We’re gonna 
                        get in the car that’s down there 
                        and we’re gonna drive away... Easy 
                        as that, understand?

           Karen nods. Tommy doesn’t -- his eyes still as big and round 
           as half-dollars. Danny puts both of his palms on Danny’s 
           shoulders and looks him square in the eye.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        It’s gonna be okay. I promise. We 
                        just need to remember to be really 
                        quick and really quiet.
           He gets a slight nod from Tommy and Danny smiles.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        Good.

           Danny frees them from the rest of their bindings, then pulls 
           Karen into him and squeezes her tight.

                                 EVAN (O.C.)
                        Atta boy, Dick. Come on up.

           They stand and Danny peers down the stairwell. He can see 
           Richard starting up, hears the heavy plod of his shoes.

                                 DANNY
                             (to Karen)
                        Count to thirty and then follow me, 
                        okay? Straight to the bottom and 
                        into the car.

                                 KAREN
                        No... 

                                 DANNY
                        You can do it, baby. 

                                 KAREN
                        Where are you going?

                                 DANNY
                        I need to stop on the third floor.

                                 KAREN
                        No.

                                 DANNY
                        I need to help Richard. 

                                 KAREN
                        Danny, no.

                                 DANNY
                        Count to thirty.

           Danny spins and darts down the stairs. On the fourth floor 
           landing, he sees Richard exit the stairwell one floor below.

                                 RICHARD (O.C.)
                        Where’s my son?

                                 EVAN (O.C.)
                        Where’s my money?
                                 RICHARD (O.C.)
                        It’s here.

                                 EVAN (O.C.)
                        Well bring it over and let me have 
                        a look-see.

           Danny descends the next flight of stairs and perches at the 
           doorway Richard has just entered. He hears the PULL OF A 
           ZIPPER and peeks around the corner...

           POV: The space is large. Light from the street lamps outside 
           pour through the plastic sheeting, but the half-finished 
           walls create large pockets of shadows throughout the expanse. 
           Twenty feet away, Richard stands facing Danny, holding open 
           the duffel bag of cash. Evan, his back to the door -- gun at 
           his side -- leans over and inspects the contents.

                                 RICHARD
                        It’s all there.

                                 EVAN
                        It better be.

           A PILE OF CARPENTRY WOOD sits on the ground nearby. Danny 
           grabs a THREE FOOT LONG 2’ BY 4’ and slips silently into the 
           room. He sneaks toward them, his soft-soled shoes silent on 
           the concrete floor...

           But he doesn’t make it three strides before he stops dead in 
           his tracks: Off to his left, no more than a dozen feet from 
           him, is Debbie. And she’s staring straight at him...

           The moment seems to hang in the air for an eternity...

           But then Debbie takes a pull on her cigarette and turns away, 
           returning her gaze to the streets below. And Danny exhales 
           and continues to close on Evan.

                                 RICHARD
                        Where is my son?

                                 EVAN
                        Right... Well, I changed up the 
                        plans some, Dick.

           He points the gun at Richard’s chest and cocks the hammer-

           WHACK! Seemingly out of nowhere, Danny drills Evan in the 
           side of the head with the 2’ by 4’ -- staggering him...

           Dropping him to his knees, and then the floor. Evan loses his 
           grip on the gun and it clanks against the concrete floor.
           Danny kicks it across the room and stands over his old 
           friend, his 2’ by 4’ raised and ready to strike again.

                                 TOMMY (O.C.)
                        DAD!!!

           Tommy races through the stairwell door and leaps into his 
           dad’s arms. Richard squeezes him, overcome with emotion.

           On the floor, Evan is coming to. He rolls onto his back with 
           a groan.

                                 EVAN
                        Danny Fucking Carter.

           Danny turns to the others.

                                 DANNY
                        Everyone down to the car.

                                 EVAN
                        That’s some ace lookout work, 
                        Debbie. Nice job.

                                 DEBBIE
                        I wasn’t- I was looking out there. 
                        For cars.

                                 EVAN
                             (propping himself up)
                        Sold me down the river too?

                                 DEBBIE
                        No, I-

                                 DANNY
                        Always someone else’s fault, huh 
                        Ev?

                                 EVAN
                             (bile in his tone)
                        You don’t say a word to me, Judas.

                                 DANNY
                        Judas? What does that make you?

                                 NOLAN (O.C.)
                        Drop that board, Danny!

           Danny spins around to find Sean Nolan, gun drawn, herding 
           Karen, Richard, and Tommy towards him.

                                 DANNY
                        Sean-
                                 NOLAN
                        Drop it.

           As the 2’ by 4’ clatters to the floor, Evan springs to his 
           feet and scampers in the direction of where Danny kicked his 
           gun.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        STOP!

           Nolan FIRES HIS GUN -- BANG! BANG BANG BANG! But Evan has 
           reached the cover of a dividing wall... and his GUN. He 
           returns fire: BOOM BOOM BOOM!

           Caught in the crossfire, Danny hits the floor and scurries 
           towards the stairwell where the others have fled. Nolan dives 
           behind a PILE OF BRICKS, unloads two more shots -- BANG BANG -
           - and screams into his radio: 

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Taking fire! Taking fire! 
                        Construction site on Pike Street! 
                        RIGHT NOW! Pike and Warren.

           Danny reaches the door and hurls himself onto the landing, 
           right on the heels of Karen, Debbie, Richard, and Tommy.

                                 DANNY
                        GO! GO! GO!

           As they reach the bottom and spill into the night TWO MORE 
           GUNSHOTS RING OUT... Followed by Nolan HOWLING IN PAIN.

           Debbie, Tommy, and Richard pile into the Range Rover. Danny 
           pushes Karen into the passenger seat, slams the door behind 
           her, and then races back into the building...

                                 KAREN
                        Danny!

           Danny takes the stairs three at a time. On the third floor 
           landing, he pauses and listens just outside the door. It’s 
           quiet... He takes a deep breath, pokes his head around the 
           corner, and looks into the room:

           Standing over a groaning Nolan, who’s bleeding badly from 
           GUNSHOT WOUNDS to the shoulder and leg, Evan reloads his gun.

                                 EVAN
                        I know you got backup on the way so 
                        this’ll have to be quick. But we 
                        had ourselves a little reunion 
                        going, didn’t we? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 EVAN (CONT'D)
                        Before Danny pulled his little, 
                        bitch-ass runaway move again, we 
                        had the whole range going: The Cop, 
                        the criminal... and whatever the 
                        hell Danny thinks he is these days.

                                 NOLAN
                        Shut it, convict.

           Evan delivers a sharp kick to his jaw, knocking Nolan over -- 
           his head crashing into the floor. In the distance, a SIREN 
           WAILS.

                                 EVAN
                        All right, I gotta get outta here.

           He raises the gun to the cop’s head...

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Good night, Sean.

           Suddenly, DANNY POUNCES FROM THE SHADOWS BEHIND EVAN. He 
           plows into him, knocking the gun from his hand, and driving 
           them both into the plastic sheeting. Their weight rips it 
           away in several spots and they fall out away from the floor. 
           But it doesn’t give completely, and for a moment the two 
           dangle above the ground, suspended in a cocoon of plastic...

           But they’re too heavy and the rest of it tears away and they 
           PLUMMET TWO STORIES, slamming into the ground with the 
           DULLEST OF THUDS...  

           The sheeting settles to the ground around them. Evan’s back 
           is flat against the ground. Danny lies atop him... Neither 
           one moves...

           Finally, Danny lifts his head and looks down at his childhood 
           friend beneath him: Evan’s eyes are closed -- unconscious -- 
           but he’s breathing...

           The LIGHTS of an EMERGENCY VEHICLE flicker across their faces 
           and we:

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           INT COOK COUNTY JAIL - DAY

           A long row of cubicles runs down the center of the VISITING 
           ROOM. PRISONERS talk to LOVED ONES and LAWYERS through thick 
           panes of plexi-glass.

           Danny and Karen sit opposite each other at one of them, 
           talking through a phone line.
                                 KAREN
                        He fired you.

                                 DANNY
                        I should hope so.

                                 KAREN
                        But he doesn’t plan to help the 
                        D.A. make his case, Danny. He 
                        wanted me to tell you that.

                                 DANNY
                             (taken aback)
                        Really? Why?

                                 KAREN
                        Tommy. Doesn’t want him to have to 
                        deal with a trial -- relive it all. 

                                 DANNY
                        How is Tommy?

                                 KAREN
                        I could hear him playing video 
                        games in the next room when I went 
                        over there. But when I asked 
                        Richard about him he told me it was 
                        none of my business. 

                                 DANNY
                        He said that?

                                 KAREN
                        Pretty much. He also said that if 
                        you ever try and contact him or 
                        Tommy he will bring ‘a world of 
                        shit’ on you.

                                 DANNY
                        Jesus. Well my world’s all set in 
                        the shit department right now-

           A RECORDED VOICE cuts into their line.

                                 RECORDED VOICE
                        Sixty seconds.

           Danny hangs his head -- sad... contrite.

                                 DANNY
                        Karen, I’m sorry.

                                 KAREN
                        I know.
                                 DANNY
                        Thank you for coming. You don’t 
                        know how much it means...

                                 KAREN
                        Staying away would have been 
                        harder.

                                 DANNY
                        Can you come back?

                                 KAREN
                        Whenever they’ll let me.

                                 DANNY
                        I love you, Karen.

           The line goes dead. 

           Karen kisses her hand and presses it to the glass. Danny 
           brings his hand up to meet hers, takes the “kiss” and tucks 
           it in his pocket.

           INT STATESVILLE PRISON - DAY

           Evan stands in a row of CONVICTS being processed. He pulls on 
           his JUMPSUIT and picks up a neatly folded set of sheets and a 
           pillow from the table in front of him. A GUARD approaches. 
           They know each other and the exchange is friendly.

                                 PRISON GUARD
                        What happened?

                                 EVAN
                        No room for me out there, Fenton.

           The line of convicts starts moving out of the room. Fenton 
           walks alongside Evan.

                                 PRISON GUARD 
                        Sorry to hear that. 

                                 EVAN
                        Nah... Ain’t nothing but simpletons 
                        and degenerates in this place, but 
                        at least I get ‘em.

           They enter a cavernous, circular-shaped CELL BLOCK. WHISTLES 
           and THREATS and CATCALLS rain down on them from the six tiers 
           of prisoners above.

                                 PRISON GUARD
                        Welcome home, Evan.
