           A single RED BALL sails up into the air. It completes its 
           upward arch and lands in the hand of...

           INT. GLITTER MAGIC SHOP - DAY

           KIP GLITTER (40). His stern face and flattop belie the  
           colorful novelties that surround him in his magic store.

                        To be a great magician you must 
                        learn one thing...

           Kip expertly rolls the ball between his fingers as he talks 
           to a pudgy, awkward kid with glasses, BOBBY (9).

                                 KIP (CONT’D)
                        ... magic belongs to the fans. 
                        Forget that, and you bring shame on 
                        the long line of Glitter magicians 
                        going back to your Great Grandfather 
                        Gunther Gleeter.

           With a sleight of hand, the ball DISAPPEARS.  

                                 BOBBY   
                        Where’s the ball, daddy?

                                 KIP
                        Check your pants, Bobby Glitter.  

           Bobby digs into his pants and... comes out with the red ball.  

                                 KIP (CONT’D)
                        Now practice until your hands are 
                        raw with the bittersweet chafe only 
                        a true magician can know.
                             (re: the ball)
                        Uh, ya might wanna wash that first. 

           EXT. LITTLE LEAGUE BASEBALL FIELD - ANOTHER DAY

           Bobby’s in the outfield as he practices with the red ball.  

           CRACK.  A baseball flies right past him. The crowd BOOS.

                                 KIP (O.S.)
                        That’s it, Bobby. Make me proud!
           INT. ROLLER RINK - ANOTHER DAY

           TEENAGERS race around, laughing.  Not Bobby (15); all his 
           focus is on the red ball. A BULLY shoves him into the boards.

                                 BULLY
                        Stop playing with your balls, retard!

           Bobby ignores everyone’s LAUGHTER and grips the ball tighter.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL SEX ED CLASS - ANOTHER DAY

           A TEACHER stands next to an anatomically correct mannequin.  

                                 TEACHER
                        And that is how venereal diseases are-
                        - BOBBY GLITTER! Put that ball away!

           ALL EYES on Bobby. He slaps the ball down and removes his 
           hand. To his - and everyone else’s surprise- THE BALL’S GONE.

                                 TEACHER (CONT’D)
                        Wh-- where did it go?

                                 BOBBY
                        ... check your pants?

           The puzzled teacher pats her pants, pulls out THE BALL. 

                                 BULLY
                        ... that was ... awesome.

           EXT. SCHOOL  PARKING LOT - DAY

           Bobby hurls SEVERAL BALLS in the air, making them disappear 
           and reappear to the amazement of several students.

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           A CROWD OF KIDS surround Bobby, in a flashy sequined shirt. 
           He stands before a statue of the school’s mascot: a PUMA.

           Bobby drapes a curtain over the stone cat and YANKS it 
           away... The STATUE’S GONE.  The kids go nuts.

                                 HOT GIRL
                        What other tricks do you know?
           INT. GREMLIN -  NIGHT

           Bobby and the HOT GIRL make out.  

                                 HOT GIRL
                        Oh, Bobby Glitter, I’m ready to 
                        take it to the next step.

                                 BOBBY
                        You already have, baby.

           PULL BACK to see the girl is NOW TOPLESS.  

           EXT. PACKED HOUSE PARTY - FRONT LAWN - NIGHT

                                 DRUNKEN KID
                        HEY! Here comes Bobby Glitter!

           Bobby, in a more flamboyant outfit struts onto the lawn - a 
           far cry from the pudgy, awkward kid we first met.

           He drapes a HUGE multicolored sheet over a TRANS AM and YANKS 
           the sheet away with some DANCE MOVES... THE CAR IS GONE. 

           As the CROWD CHEERS, he sloppily makes out with TWO HOT GIRLS 
           at once when he notices - ACROSS THE STREET... A disappointed 
           Kip watches. He shakes his head and walks away.  

                                 BOBBY
                        Daddy! C’mon. I’m just having fun!

                                 CROWD
                        BOBBY!  BOBBY!  BOBBY!

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. THE MANDALAY THEATRE - LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

                                 HUGE CROWD
                        BOBBY!  BOBBY!  BOBBY!

           CLOSE on Bobby (20s), sweat dripping down his brow. Gaze upon 
           his purple sequined unitard, reflecting every shaft of light 
           in the room. Behold as he LEVITATES IN MIDAIR onstage.  

           TITLE CARD - LAS VEGAS, NEVADA 1992

           The lights dim and Bobby puts a finger to his lips. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Sssssshhhhhhhhhh...
           The crowd hushes as he drapes his VELVET CAPE over his head. 
           Suddenly, the cape falls to the ground and Bobby has 
           DISAPPEARED. Silence from the audience. 

                                 LONE AUDIENCE MEMBER
                        Where’d you go, Bobby Glitter?!

                                 BOBBY (O.S.)
                        I’m right. Here.

           Bobby appears at the back of the auditorium, arms crossed. 
           The crowd GOES APESHIT as he dances down the aisle, fire and 
           sparks emanating from his jazz hands. 

           He FLIPS onstage as a pyrotechnic explosion erupts and - POW!

           INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - LATER

           FOUR NAKED BUSTY BLONDES giggle past a SECURITY GUARD toward 
           a dressing room. A disgusted Kip walks behind the girls, but--

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Sorry, Pops.  Closed party.

                                 KIP
                        But I’m Bobby Glitter’s father dammit!

           INT. BOBBY’S DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Bobby’s in a hot tub with more naked girls in the center of 
           the CROWDED, SMOKE-FILLED PARTY ROOM.  Bobby’s manager, 
           BAXTER TAMBLYN (40s), enters and exhales in exasperation.

                                 BOBBY
                        Baxter!  You know what this hot tub 
                        needs? MORE COCAINE, BABY!!!

           Bobby spits a mouthful of water at Baxter. The girls laugh. 

                                 BAXTER
                        C’mon Bobby, you already dumped four 
                        kilos in there. Tomorrow’s your live 
                        TV special. Bobby Glitter’s gonna 
                        fly! No wires this time!  

                                 BOBBY
                        Relax. I nailed it in rehearsal!

                                 BAXTER
                        Yeah Bobby, and I usually keep my 
                        mouth shut, but can’t you slow down 
                        and play it safe this time? For me?
                                 BOBBY  
                        Fuck safe. I’m a magician! I don’t 
                        just live on the edge. I AM the edge.

                                 BAXTER
                        If you say so, Bobby.  By the way, 
                        your dad’s trying to get back here.

                                 BOBBY
                        Fuck him, too! WOOOOO!!!  NOW WHO 
                        WANTS MORE COCAINE WATER!?

           SETH DESSTINY (18) wears a Criss Angel-esgue outfit: head-
           scarf under a backwards baseball cap, acid-wash jeans and 
           black nail polish.  A prim girl, PENNY (19), is behind him.

                                 SETH DESSTINY
                        Mr. Glitter... Uh, Mr. Glitter?

                                 BOBBY
                        BAXTER? Who the shit is talking to me?  

                                 SETH DESSTINY
                        Seth Desstiny. I’ve been your 
                        roadie for like six months.   

                                 BOBBY
                        Destiny?

                                 SETH DESSTINY 
                        Desssstiny. Two ‘S’s’.

                                 BOBBY
                        Classy name. QUEER ALERT!  

           Everyone around Bobby CRACKS up and high-fives him.

                                 SETH DESSTINY
                        Huh, that gets funnier every time. 
                        Anyway, m- my girl Penny flew in all 
                        the way from Nebraska to meet you--

                                 BOBBY
                        Riddle me this, Penny: What’s a 
                        comely swan like you doing wasting 
                        time with a roadie?

                                 SETH DESSTINY
                        Uh, actually, I’m an illusionist.  
                        Like you. Or I’d like to be, anyway.

                                 BOBBY
                        Not with your backwards ball cap and 
                        Jordache jeans you’re not. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BOBBY (CONT'D)
                        Where’s your razzle? Your pizzazz? 
                        Your sequins?

                                 SETH DESSTINY
                        I’m kinda goin’ for something 
                        darker and a little more...serious.

                                 BOBBY
                        Serious. Right. Hey, Bax!  Didn’t 
                        you say we had something that Sucks-
                        Dickstany here needs to do?

                                 BAXTER   
                        Oh, yeah, Seth.  Come with me.

           Seth and Penny follow Baxter. Bobby grabs Penny.

                                 BOBBY
                        Tell me, chiquitita: You ever Fiero’d?

                                 PENNY
                        “Fiero’d?”

           EXT. LAS VEGAS STRIP - NIGHT

                                 BOBBY 
                        FIERO!!!

           Bobby drives a T-top ‘92 Fiero with Penny on his lap and the 
           busty girls in the other seat. Onlookers point, CHEER WILDLY.

                                 PENNY
                        Vegas sure is different than Nebraska.

                                 BOBBY
                        You bet it is. Watch this: Starla, 
                        Becky, make your tongues disappear!

           The girls in the other seat smile and MAKE OUT.

                                 PENNY 
                        But... they’re both... girls.

                                 BOBBY
                        Oh, I’ve got so much to teach you.  

           INT. BOBBY’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Gauche.  Leopard-print carpet.  A trained leopard on a leash.  
           The circular bed is a hydra of NAKED BODIES wiggling and 
           squirming.  Bobby and Penny are on top of the sex-pile.
                                 PENNY
                        Oh, Bobby. I think... I love you.

                                 BOBBY
                        I think I love you too, baby. Uncle 
                        Bobby’s gonna do right by you.

           CUT TO: A SHADOWY CORNER OF THE ROOM - Seth watches and bites 
           his clenched fist, eyes tearing up with anger.

           EXT. DARK ALLEY - NIGHT

           Seth stalks up to a SHADY DRUG DEALER.

                                 SHADY DRUG DEALER
                        Bobby G. send you for the usual?

                                 SETH DESSTINY
                        No. This time I think he wants 
                        something a bit more... potent.

           INT. DRUG DEALER’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           The dealer dangles a tiny vial full of brown powder.

                                 SHADY DRUG DEALER
                        Quan Tao Ping. Translation: Happy Tiger 
                        No More. Grown by leper monks in the 
                        holy soil of Namche Bazaar. Just a 
                        fingernail-full and you’ll be able to 
                        smell time. Any more than that, and you 
                        may never come down.

           Seth smiles. 

           EXT. THE SANDS HOTEL AND CASINO - NIGHT

           A HUGE CROWD has gathered around the hotel.

                                 TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        For those just tuning in, magic 
                        sensation Bobby Glitter will actually 
                        fly from the roof of the Sands Hotel 
                        to the roof of MGM Grand. This will 
                        cement Glitter’s place in the 
                        pantheon of legendary magicians.

           INT. THE SANDS - GREEN ROOM - DAY

           BLECH!  Bobby is a heaving mess. He pukes into a flower pot.
                                 BOBBY
                        Forget it!  I’ll do it tomorrow!

                                 BAXTER 
                        Bobby, this is everything we’ve 
                        worked for! WHERE’S THAT COFFEE?!

           INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Seth smiles as he dumps the ENTIRE VIAL into a mug of coffee.

           INT. GREEN ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Seth hands the mug to Baxter, who makes Bobby swill it down.

                                 BAXTER
                        There ya’ go. Down the hatch!

           Seth smiles to himself. Bobby stares-- maybe a little 
           suspicious-- but finishes the coffee.

           EXT. THE SANDS - ROOFTOP - MOMENTS LATER

                                 TV ANNOUNCER
                        Ladies and gentlemen, BOBBY GLITTER!

           Bobby stumbles on a rooftop stage, surrounded by an AUDIENCE.

                                 BOBBY
                        Hey, hey! Y’all feelin’ the Glitter?!   

           BOBBY’S POV - It’s like we’re looking at the audience through 
           a kaleidoscope... reflected into a carnival mirror.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        What the--

           He looks down at his hands, noticing the same effect.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        W-- what’s with my eyes?

           The audience is baffled. A CUTE KID looks up to Bobby, but in 
           Bobby’s eyes, the boy becomes a RACCOON.  

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        HOLY SHIT! A RACOON!

                                 STAGEHAND (O.S.)
                        Mr. Glitter?  Is something wrong?
                                 BOBBY
                        Yeah! This kid’s a fuckin’--

           A trembling, sweating Bobby turns to the Stagehand to see a-

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        -- RACCOON!  

           His eyes dart around. All of the stage hands are raccoons. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        ... s-stay back...

                                 RACCOON STAGEHAND
                             (whispering to his pal)
                        What’s wrong with him?

                                 BOBBY
                        WHAT’S WRONG WITH YOU, RACCOON?!

           Bobby turns to the audience to see that they are all now 
           WOODLAND CREATURE-HUMAN HYBRIDS.  

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Oh... my... god... 

           The Audience starts booing. 

           EXT. THE SANDS - BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Seth Desstiny smiles broadly.  And removes his jacket.

                                 BAXTER
                        What the hell are you doing?

                                 SETH DESSTINY 
                        Fulfilling my...desstiny.

           EXT. THE SANDS - ROOFTOP - SAME

           Bobby tears through his clothes as he watches the Stage 
           Hands/Raccoons descend on him. 

                                 BOBBY
                        WE’VE ANGERED MOTHER NATURE! SHE’S 
                        RAISED AN ARMY TO EXACT HER REVENGE!

           He runs to one of the television cameras and screams into it.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        PROTECT YOUR CHILDREN! THE BEASTS 
                        ARE EVERYWHERE!
           A half-naked Bobby grabs a fire extinguisher.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        I MUST KILL THEIR LEADER!

           He charges straight at the raccoon child when--

           WHAM! He is clotheslined by Desstiny and sent to the ground. 
           Seth bends down over a whimpering and confused Bobby. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        You! You did this to me!

                                 SETH DESSTINY
                        Yes I did. Now sleeeep, douchebag. 
                        Your time is done...

           He pinches Bobby’s neck, knocking him out, turns to the crowd-

                                 SETH DESSTINY (CONT’D)
                        Fear not!  There will be magic 
                        tonight!  I. Am. Seth Desssstiny.

           The audience OOO’S as Seth mugs to the camera. Bobby is 
           hauled off by some stage hands as Seth steps over him.  

                                 SETH DESSTINY (CONT’D)
                        You came here to see a mortal fly.
                        Well, let’s... FLY!

           Seth steps off the rooftop into MIDAIR. The CROWD GOES NUTS.

           EXT. THE SANDS - BACKSTAGE - SAME

                                 BAXTER
                        Bastard stole Bobby’s trick...

           EXT. THE SANDS - ROOFTOP - SAME

           Seth flies gracefully through the air. WE PULL BACK and the 
           screen becomes glassy like we’re watching this on TV...

           INT. DOCTOR OFFICE - WAITING ROOM DAY - DAY

           A TELEVISION mounted on the wall shows the FLYING BROADCAST.

           TITLE CARD: ANGEL FIRE, NEW MEXICO PRESENT DAY

           BOBBY (40’s) - dirty, unshaven, wearing the THICKEST GLASSES 
           this side of Mr. Magoo - watches in motionless disdain.
           The OTHER PEOPLE in the waiting room stare at Bobby on T.V. 
           then at the real-life Bobby.  Bobby ignores their SNICKERS.

                                 TV NARRATOR (ON TELEVISION)
                        That was Seth Desstiny’s first 
                        televised appearance ten years ago. 
                        The career-defining moment was also 
                        the beginning of the end for one-
                        time magic sensation Bobby Glitter.  

           ON T.V.-- Seth Desstiny today, (30’s) super-trendy, goth, in 
           all black.  He stares wide-eyed, diabolically to the camera.

                                 TV NARRATOR (CONT’D)
                        Desstiny’s making headlines again 
                        with his “Mallusionist’s Challenge” 
                        which offers aspiring conjurers a 
                        $100,000 prize and a chance to 
                        square off against Desstiny himself--

                        Glitter. Robert.  You’re up!

           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           The OLD DOCTOR stares perplexed at Bobby in silence.

                                 DOCTOR
                        How does a man contract syphilis 
                        four times in one year?

                                 BOBBY
                        It was a good year, Doc.

           RING.  Bobby shrugs and answers his ancient cell phone.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Glitter Management... Alright, calm 
                        down. I’ll be there in ten minutes. 

           The doctor hands Bobby a VD PAMPHLET on his way out.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Wait! Please, just, read this! And 
                        for god sake, until the sores go 
                        away, NO MORE SEX. You’ll only spread-

           SLAM.  Bobby’s gone.
           EXT. UPPER-CLASS SUBURBAN HOME- DAY

           Bobby’s beat-up Fiero SCREECHES up and Bobby jumps out.  An 
           uptight mom, MRS. HUNTER, (30’s) waits for him-- arms folded.

                                 MRS. HUNTER
                        Mr. Glitter, the so-called 
                        ‘magician’ we booked through your 
                        company is an absolute disaster.

                                 BOBBY
                        Relax, Mrs. Hunter, Miguel’s just a 
                        little new to the profession. 

           INT. UPPER-CLASS HOME - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           The “magician” MIGUEL (107), stands before a GROUP OF 
           DISGUSTED EIGHT-YEAR OLDS. He drunkenly holds up a quarter.

                                 MIGUEL
                        And now, Miguel (burp)... will make 
                        this...penny disappear.

                                 KID
                        That’s a quarter, dumbass.

           As the kids BOO, Bobby pulls Miguel aside.

                                 BOBBY
                        What’s your problem, Miguel? You 
                        want that case of Schnapps or not? 

                                 MIGUEL
                        Crap, Bobby. I’m sorry. Hey. Why 
                        don’t you do a couple tricks? 

                                 BOBBY
                        We’ve been through this: Bobby 
                        Glitter can’t do magic anymore. 

           The bratty kid, SOREN, pipes up.

                                 SOREN (O.S.)
                        You suck dick, Miguel! Do some 
                        street magic like Seth Desstiny.

           Bobby cringes at the words SETH DESSTINY and turns to Soren.

                                 BOBBY
                        So you like Seth Desstiny, huh? 

                                 SOREN
                        At least he can make shit disappear.
                                 BOBBY
                        Well, I specialize in making people 
                        disappear. Upstanding people. People 
                        like your mommy and daddy.  

                                 SOREN 
                        My - my mom and dad?

                                 BOBBY
                        Oh yes. And you know what happens 
                        to little boys whose mommy and 
                        daddy disappear, don’t you?  They 
                        go to a magical place called a 
                        foster home, where new mommies beat 
                        them with tube socks stuffed with 
                        maaagical gin bottles. Would you 
                        like to go there for your birthday? 

                                 SOREN
                        ... n... no...please...

                                 BOBBY
                        Then let’s get something straight. 
                        Anything Miguel does is 
                        magnificent. If he takes a dump on 
                        your cake I wanna hear you cheer 
                        and ask for seconds. Got that?

           Soren nods, terrified.  Bobby scruffs his head.

           INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Bobby and Mrs. Hunter watch the party from the doorway...

                                 MRS. HUNTER
                        I owe you an apology.  I haven’t 
                        seen little Soren like this in 
                        years. He’s so happy he’s crying!

           THE LIVING ROOM - Soren CLAPS VIGOROUSLY with tears streaming 
           down his cheeks as Miguel makes him a SHITTY BALLOON ANIMAL.

           She hands a Bobby a check.  

                                 BOBBY
                        I’ll see Miguel gets this.

                                 MRS. HUNTER
                        Y’know, when I was younger, I was 
                        quite a fan of yours.  Though I - 
                        don’t remember the glasses. 

           Bobby hangs his head, putting on his best “sad” act.  
                                 BOBBY
                        That was before the... accident.  
                        When I still had my depth perception 
                        and could perform my magic.

           She puts her hand tenderly on his.  Bobby curls a smile.

           INT. FOOD PANTRY - MOMENTS LATER

           Bobby GRINDS Mrs. Hunter from behind, his glasses fogged up, 
           her face smushed into a box of Fruit Roll-Ups.

                                 MR. HUNTER (O.S.)
                        Where’s my Birthday Boy?

           The door opens to reveal the woman’s husband, MR. HUNTER.

                        RUN BOBBY!

           Mrs. Hunter holds her husband back as Bobby hurdles over 
           Soren and opens the door to his car.

                                 BOBBY
                        Happy Birthday, kid. Oh, and...

           He hands the kid the VD PAMPHLET.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        ...might wanna give this to Mommy. 

           EXT. EXTENDED STAY MOTEL - LATER

           Bobby’s Fiero screeches into an empty spot in front.

           INT. BOBBY’S APARTMENT - LATER

           He opens the door and-- CRACK. A FIST whacks Bobby in the 
           eye. It knocks his glasses off and sends him to the floor.

                                 FLEANCE
                             (French accent)
                        Where eez our money, Bubby?!

           A scrawny guy, FLEANCE, wearing designer jeans and a flowery, 
           silk shirt stands over Bobby.  
           Bobby grabs his BROKEN glasses. Another skinny guy with a 
           pony tail and Gucci sunglasses giggles. This is LANCOME.  

                                 BOBBY
                        Fleance, you dick!  You broke my 
                        glasses! 

           THUD! Fleance KICKS Bobby with pointy alligator boots.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Okay.  Here. Take this as my first 
                        installment.

           Bobby hands Fleance Miguel’s check.  

                                 FLEANCE
                        A hundred dollars? And who is zis 
                        Miguel?!  

           Fleance crumples the check and YANKS Bobby up by his collar.

                                 FLEANCE (CONT’D)
                        No one takes advantage of Le Cirque du

                        Mais oui, I almost forgot.  You

                        It was a girl. From your dark past.

           Lancome hands Bobby the note, but Bobby reaches “past” it.

           Lancome dangles the note in front of Bobby.

                                 BOBBY
                        Ha.  Ha. Just gimme the damn note?

           Lancome finally takes pity on him and shoves it in his hand.

                        She did not give her name. She said

                                 BOBBY
                        ... Fiero’d?

           Bobby stares at the slip of paper:  85 GILMORE STREET.

           EXT. 85 GILMORE STREET - DAY

           Bobby lights a menthol. We see that 85 Gilmore is a Hospital. 

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Sir, this is a non-smoking building.

                                 BOBBY
                        Since when? 
                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        It’s a hospital, sir.

           A curly-haired PUDGY BOY (9) in a tight T-shirt and glasses 
           plays with G.I.JOE FIGURES in the ash-tray sand. This kid’s 
           at the bottom of the dork food-chain... the porker who used 
           to pull down his pants to pee in a urinal. You knew him once.

           He MUMBLES  and makes explosion sounds with his mouth. 

                                 PUDGY KID
                        Knowing is half the battle, Snow 
                        Job. Let’s find Cobra Commander... 

           Bobby stares in disgust as the tubby wonder digs into his 
           fanny pack and pulls out two UNWRAPPED DONUT HOLES.  

                                 PUDGY KID (CONT’D)
                        Would you like a donut hole?

           Bobby SLAPS them from the kid’s hand and goes in the hospital.

           INT. HOSPITAL - INFORMATION DESK - DAY

           Bobby ambles up to a NURSE sitting at the desk.

                                 BOBBY
                        ‘Scuse me...my name is Bobby--

                                 NURSE
                        Oh yes, Mr. Glitter. Penny’s been 
                        waiting for you.  Room 309.  

           INT. ROOM 309 - MOMENTS LATER

           Penny rises as Bobby enters. She’s gaunt but still beautiful.  

                                 PENNY
                        B...Bobby?

                                 PENNY
                        Penny. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Of course.  You look beautiful.

                                 PENNY
                        I’m sorry Bobby, but we don’t have 
                        much time.

                                 PENNY (CONT'D)
                        I asked you here because I’ve got 
                        some bad news. 
                             (tearing up)
                        I’ve been infected with 
                        macroglossia entritis, and it’s 
                        spread to my brain.

                                 BOBBY
                        Wh - what’s that?

                                 PENNY
                        It’s a rare virus. It causes an 
                        internal rash, and in some cases... 
                        it’s fatal. 

                                 BOBBY
                        It causes an internal rash?

                                 PENNY
                        Yes. Like hives.

                                 BOBBY
                        In your brain?

                                 PENNY
                        Uh-huh.

                                 BOBBY
                        So  - you have brain hives?

           At the mention of it, Penny starts crying.  Bobby runs a 
           consoling hand through her hair, then YANKS IT away.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Wait. Are brain hives contagious?

                                 PENNY
                        No! (sniffle) Now listen, remember 
                        you said you’d always be there for 
                        me...well-- I really need you now.

           Bobby puts a dirty finger over her lips-- hushing her.

                                 BOBBY
                        Save your strength. Uncle Bobby 
                        always keeps his word.

           Bobby starts climbing on top of her.

                                 PENNY
                        Wh - what are you doing?!
                                 BOBBY
                        You wanna stand? Fine, but watch 
                        all these tubes and gear.

                                 PENNY
                        Christ, I don’t want to screw you!

                                 BOBBY
                        But, isn’t that why you called me 
                        here?  For the Glitter send-off?

                                 PENNY
                        I called you because we have a son!

           Bobby jumps off her like she’s radioactive. 

                                 BOBBY
                        I get it. You lure me down here 
                        with the promise of sex--

                                 PENNY
                        Who said anything about sex!? I’m 
                        going into surgery and my odds 
                        aren’t good. There’s a good chance 
                        our son won’t have a mom soon. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Well-- I’ve been hearing great things 
                        about the foster care system. 

                                 PENNY
                        He’s your child, Bobby! Doesn’t 
                        that mean anything to you?! 
                             (off Bobby’s shrug)
                        Fine. But you have to look that 
                        sweet little kid in the eye and 
                        tell him you don’t want to take 
                        care of him. Or are you too weak 
                        for that?

                                 BOBBY
                        Okay, okay! Just - where is he?

                                 PENNY
                        Didn’t you see him? I told him to 
                        wait for you down at the lobby.

           And then Bobby slowly realizes... and is horrified.

           INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

           The pudgy wonder.  Still playing in the ashtray. Still 
           mumbling to himself.  Still wets the bed.  
           Bobby approaches as if he was a zoologist studying a new 
           species of venomous snake.

                                 BOBBY  
                        Um... are you... St - Stevie? 

                                 STEVIE
                        Yes. You talked to Mommy? She said 
                        I was going to stay with you for a 
                        while, Daddy. Can I call you Daddy?  

           Bobby cringes at the word Daddy. This can’t be happening.

                                 BOBBY
                        Say Stevie - whaddya say we sit 
                        down and rap for a sec?

           INT. HOSPITAL CAFETERIA - MOMENTS LATER

           Bobby gets a pack of Twinkies out of the vending machine, 
           brings it over to Stevie, who’s sitting on a bench.

                                 BOBBY
                        Want a Twinkie?

                                 STEVIE
                        Oh no, Daddy. Twinkies contain 
                        cornstarch, and cornstarch is only 
                        for birthday parties and Halloween. 

           `Bobby looks at Stevie and crams a twinkie into his mouth. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Right.  About this ‘daddy’ thing. See, 
                        most mommies and daddies stay together.  
                        But me and your mommy were different.  
                        We fell in love 10 years ago at a 
                        magical party called an ‘orgy.’ We 
                        loved each other so much that we made a 
                        little boy - you, Stevie.

                                 STEVIE
                        Then what happened, Daddy?

                                 BOBBY
                        Well, it’s a long story, and it gets 
                        a little hazy in some parts.  But it 
                        ends with daddy owing a bunch of 
                        Canadian aerialists 95,000 dollars.

                                 STEVIE
                        What’s a Canadian arrowlist, Daddy?
                                 BOBBY
                        They’re clowns who act like bookies.

                                 STEVIE
                        What’s a bookie?

                                 BOBBY
                        It’s like a boogie man for adults. 
                        And that’s why living with me right 
                        now would be a real catastrofuck. 

           Silence. Stevie breaks out into a wide smile.

                                 STEVIE
                        Mommy said you’d try to trick me. 

                                 BOBBY
                        No - I’m being serious, kid.

                                 STEVIE
                        Sure, daddy, the bookie man’s going 
                        to get me. Right, Daddy?  

                                 BOBBY
                        Quit calling me - Look, I can’t 
                        deal with this right now. Good luck 
                        and all that crap, but I gotta run.

           Bobby gets up and makes it all the way to the door, but--

                                 BURLY SECURITY GUARD (O.S.)
                        Excuse me, sir!

           Bobby spins around to see a BURLY SECURITY GUARD.

                                 BURLY SECURITY GUARD (CONT’D)
                        You can’t leave your child unattended.

                                 BOBBY
                        He’s not my kid.

                                 STEVIE
                        Yes I am, Daddy. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Okay. I’m technically responsible for 
                        his birth. But he belongs to his Mom.  
                        She’s upstairs. With brain hives.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        I suggest you take him there, then.  
           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Bobby rushes toward Penny’s room with Stevie in tow. 

                                 NURSE
                        Excuse me.  If you’re looking for 
                        Penny, she’s being prepped for 
                        surgery now.  

                                 BOBBY
                        Damnit!  Already?  Well, what am I 
                        supposed to do with-- Okay, look, 
                        I’ll just leave the kid here.

           Bobby hustles away from Stevie and toward the elevator.

                                 NURSE
                        I’m sorry. The kid? MR. GLITTER?!!!

           As Bobby gets to the elevator, its doors open.  The Burly 
           Guard steps off and glares at the unattended Stevie.

                                 BOBBY
                        Shit.

           INT. HOSPITAL PAYPHONE - NIGHT

           Bobby is on the phone. Stevie (out of earshot) is playing 
           with GI Joe’s and eating donut holes by the vending machines.

                                 BOBBY
                        Baxter, you gotta help me get rid 
                        of this kid! 

           INT. GLITTER MANAGEMENT’S SHITTY OFFICE - INTERCUT

           BAXTER TAMBLYN - balder, fatter, than when we first met him -
           sits at his pressboard desk.  

                                 BAXTER
                        Calm down, Bobby. I just got a 
                        complaint from the Hunter’s. They say 
                        you tried to pass off some wino as a 
                        magician. I mean - what happened to 
                        scouting us some new talent? 

                                 BOBBY
                        I can’t scout anything with this 
                        kid up my ass! WHAT THE HELL AM I 
                        GONNA DO WITH HIM?! 

           Bobby looks down the hall. The GUARD is eyeing him intently.
                                 BAXTER
                        I dunno, call the Department of 
                        Social Services. They take needy 
                        kids. I think they even pay you.

                                 BOBBY
                        Huh. No shit?

           INT. BOBBY’S FIERO - DAY

           Bobby drives and tries to ignore Stevie.

                                 STEVIE
                        Where’re we going, daddy?

                                 BOBBY
                        A magical, fun place called the DSS.

                                 STEVIE
                        Ooh, okay. That sounds wondrous.
                             (looking around)
                        Daddy... do you see my Destro 
                        anywhere? I dropped him-- 

                                 BOBBY
                        Kid, I don’t even know what the 
                        fuck a Destro is. And can we please 
                        cut the Daddy shit?

                                 STEVIE
                        Destro’s an independent weapons 
                        dealer for the terrorist 
                        organization Cobra. Sworn enemies 
                        of GI Joe: Real American Hero.

           Silence.

                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                        I also like Oprah. Do you like Oprah? 

                                 BOBBY
                        Jesus.

                                 STEVIE
                        She’s a philanthropist.

                                 BOBBY
                        Who- Wha- I mean, are you a fucking 
                        joke? Who the hell are you?  

                                 STEVIE
                        Wanna hear my all-time top three 
                        Oprah moments? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 STEVIE (CONT'D)

           Stevie points as he relives Oprah’s Pontiac giveaway.

                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                        You get a car! You get a car! You 
                        get a car! You get a car! 

           INT. DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES - DAY

           Bobby sits with Stevie at the desk of  LANGLEY, (45) fat, 
           humorless social worker.

                                 BOBBY
                        Look, I can see you’re busy, so 
                        lemme just toss out a number. I was 
                        thinking... forty-five thousand?

           Bobby coolly leans back in his seat.  Stevie does the same.

                                 LANGLEY
                        Stevie, why don’t you go to the 
                        play area?  There’s Ho-Ho’s back 
                        there too if you want a snack.

                                 STEVIE
                        Ho-Ho’s contain cornstarch and 
                        cornstarch is only for--

                                 BOBBY
                        Damnit, Stevie!  Just go.

           Stevie waddles to the PLAY AREA where OTHER KIDS play. 

                                  LANGLEY
                        Mr. Glitter - I get delusional 
                        jerks like you coming in all the 
                        time. And every time I have to 
                        repeat - the Department of Social 
                        Services is not in the business of 
                        buying or selling children.

                                 BOBBY
                        You’re a shrewd operator, Mrs. 
                        Langley.  Forty-one, five.

                                 LANGLEY
                        I’m calling the police!
                                 BOBBY
                        Okay, Jesus.  Just take the kid, okay? 
                        Just-- do you at least validate?

                                 LANGLEY
                        Mr. Glitter, if you really believe 
                        you’re an unfit parent--   

                                 BOBBY
                        You want unfit? I haven’t spoken to 
                        my own father in ten years. And might 
                        I also add that I have syphilis.

                                 LANGLEY
                             (suppressing disgust)
                        Very well. It’ll take us two 
                        business days to process the 
                        paperwork, at which point an agent--

                                 BOBBY
                        Wait, so I’m stuck with the 
                        mongoloid for two more days?

                                 LANGLEY
                        Unless we see that you pose an 
                        immediate threat to your child-- 
                        under which case you’d have to be 
                        taken under police custody-- you’re 
                        going to have to wait until the 
                        paperwork has been filed.
                             (beat)
                        It’s two days. How bad can it be?

           EXT. PANDA EXPRESS - PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON

           The Fiero pulls into an open spot.  

                                 STEVIE (O.S.)
                        ...and that’s why Cinnabuns are one 
                        of Oprah’s favorite things!

           INT. BOBBY’S FIERO - CONTINUOUS

           Bobby slams his head against the steering wheel.

                                 STEVIE
                        Wanna hear what Gayle’s doing for 
                        spring break?

                                 BOBBY
                        NO!
           Stevie’s eyes drift to the RED BALL hanging from the rearview.  

                                 STEVIE
                        Daddy, there’s a red ball hanging 
                        from the mirror. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Really?

                                 STEVIE
                        Is it a special ball?  

                                 BOBBY
                        Yes. 

                                 STEVIE
                        Ooooh... can I bounce it?

                                 BOBBY
                        Fine!  But only if you shut up for 
                        thirty seconds - that’s all I ask.

                                 STEVIE
                        Okay. Thirty. Go.

           Stevie reaches up and starts playing with the ball. Then--

                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                        Uh-oh, Daddy. I think I lost count.

           And with that, Bobby exits the car and SLAMS the door. 

           INT. PANDA EXPRESS - MOMENTS LATER

           Bobby’s in line.  Stevie catches up to him.

                                 STEVIE
                        Thirty, Daddy. You forgot to wait 
                        for me.  

           The SERVER stares at Stevie-- waiting to take his order.

                                 BOBBY
                        You gonna tell her what you want?

                                 STEVIE
                        I - I don’t think I like this place.

                                 BOBBY
                        It’s Panda Express! Nobody likes 
                        this place!  Fuck - okay... fine. 
                        Then what do you like?
           INT. DUNKIN’ DONUTS - MOMENTS LATER

           A FAT SERVER stands behind the counter.

                                 FAT SERVER
                        Welcome to Dunkin’ Donuts, may I 
                        take your order.

           Stevie. Silent. Scared.

                                 STEVIE
                        ...can you order for me Daddy?  I’m 
                        not good in pressure situations. 

                                 BOBBY
                        You’re not good in - Alright. Fuck. 
                        Fine. How about a... cruller?

                                 STEVIE
                        Do crullers have corn starch?

                                 BOBBY
                             (to the Server)
                        You know what?  Just give us a 
                        dozen donut holes.

           INT. DUNKIN DONUTS -  TABLE - MOMENTS LATER

           Stevie intently studies his donut holes.

                                 STEVIE
                        I found a donut crumb that looks 
                        like Storm Shadow, Daddy.

           Bobby stares at his son in disbelief.  Stevie’s smile fades.

                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                        Uh oh... 

                                 BOBBY
                        What now?

                                 STEVIE
                        I have to make.

                                 BOBBY
                        Make what? 

                                 STEVIE
                        ...a nuglet.
                                 BOBBY
                        The fuck’s a nuglet? A shit? You 
                        gotta take a shit? So do it. What 
                        do you want from me?

           INT. DUNKIN DONUTS - FILTHY BATHROOM - SECONDS LATER

           Stevie steps in and Bobby closes the door behind him.  

                                 STEVIE (INSIDE THE BATHROOM)
                        Make sure no one comes in and looks 
                        at my dangle. Okay Daddy?

           Bobby makes sure the coast is clear.  Then quickly FLEES.

                                 STEVIE (INSIDE THE BATHROOM) (CONT’D)
                        Okay? ... daddy...?

           INT. FIERO - TRAVELLING - SAME

           SCRREECH! Bobby rockets down the street in his Fiero. He 
           catches his eyes in the rearview and there’s a hint of guilt. 
           He shrugs it off, but does double-take as he notices:

           THE BALL’S NOT HANGING FROM HIS MIRROR.

           INT. DUNKIN DONUTS - COUNTER - MOMENTS LATER

           Bobby storms in and walks to the counter. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Hey, listen, that kid I was here 
                        with...  Did you see where went?

           Bobby turns to see an angry MANAGER, arms crossed.

           INT. DUNKIN DONUTS - BREAK ROOM - DAY

           Stevie keeps his back to Bobby in the doorway.

                                 STEVIE
                        The Donut Man said you left me.

                                 BOBBY
                        Left you?  No. Now come on, give me 
                        the ball and let’s get out of here.

           Bobby reaches for it, but the kid yanks it away.
                                 STEVIE
                        No. You’ll leave me again.

                                 BOBBY
                        Stevie, quit dicking around--

           He snags the kid’s clenched, chubby hand.  

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Open your hand, Stevie! Now!

           Stevie slowly opens his hand... THE BALL HAS DISAPPEARED. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Stevie.  Where’s my ball?

                                 STEVIE
                        I dunno.... 

                                 BOBBY
                        Where is it Stevie?!

                                 STEVIE
                        Ch- check your pants?

           Bobby slowly digs in his pants and pulls out...  THE BALL.  

                                 BOBBY
                        How. The. Hell. Did. You. Do. That?

                                 STEVIE
                        I - I learned it.

                                 BOBBY
                        Who taught it to you?

                                 STEVIE
                        Y - you did, Daddy. On the video. 

                                 BOBBY
                        What video?

           INT. BOBBY’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Stevie pulls a dusty BETAMAX TAPE from his backpack: BOBBY 
           GLITTER-THE GLITTER MAN COMETH - GREATEST TRICKS 1984-1990.  

                                 BOBBY
                        Where’d you get this?

                                 STEVIE
                        Mommy’s closet. She said I can’t 
                        learn anymore tricks. 
                                 BOBBY
                        Wait, you’re telling me you learned 
                        that ball trick just by watching this 
                        tape? Impossible, that’s one of the 
                        hardest misdirection tricks there is. 

                                 STEVIE
                        Mister Lection?  Who’s Mr. Lection?

                                 BOBBY
                        Misdirection. When you make someone 
                        look the other while you do a trick.

                                 STEVIE
                        Like when I hid the ball from you.

                                 BOBBY
                        Exactly. What other tricks do you 
                        know?

                                 STEVIE
                        Some.

                                 BOBBY
                        How many?

                                 STEVIE
                        All of them.

                                 BOBBY
                        Right. What about the one where I 
                        make the Trans-Am disappear?

                                 STEVIE
                        That one’s easy, Daddy.

                                 BOBBY
                        Easy?! David Copperfield couldn’t 
                        figure it out! How’d I do it?

                                 STEVIE
                        Magic mans don’t tell their secrets. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Goddammit-- I invented that trick!  

                                 STEVIE
                        Oh, would you do it, Daddy?  I’ve 
                        always wanted to see you do a magic!  

                                 BOBBY
                        Tough shit. I don’t do magic anymore. 
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 BOBBY (CONT'D)
                        Say Stevie, didn’t you say Oprah 
                        was on right now?

                                 STEVIE
                        Tonight’s an “On the Road With Oprah” 
                        episode. She’s going to feed puffins! 

                                 BOBBY
                        Wow, that sounds terrific.  How 
                        about you tell me about the Trans 
                        Am trick, and we’ll watch it 
                        together?  Like father and son.

                                 STEVIE
                        Oh Daddy, that would be wondrous!

                                 BOBBY
                        It would. But you have to tell me 
                        the secret first.

           Stevie thinks. Then leans in to Bobby’s ear and whispers.  
           Bobby’s eyes light up as if he’s just seen the face of God.

           INT. BOBBY’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Bobby sits on the couch next to Stevie, both of them 
           illuminated by the television.  Bobby is on the phone.

                                 BAXTER’S ANSWERING MACHINE
                        This is Glitter Management LLC. 
                        Leave a message at the beep. BEEP!

                                 BOBBY
                        Bax, you cocksucker, clear our 
                        schedule tomorrow. We’re back!

           He hangs up and puts his arm around Stevie as Oprah drones on 
           in the background.  

                                 STEVIE
                        Did I do good, Daddy?

                                 BOBBY
                        Oh yeah, Stevie. Real good. 

           INT. GLITTER MANAGEMENT’S SHITTY OFFICE - INTERCUT

           Baxter’s at his desk, across from Stevie and Bobby. He’s not 
           amused by the heavily-breathing piggy boy staring at him.

                                 BOBBY
                        Ready to be amazed, Baxter?
           Bobby puts the RED BALL in Stevie’s hand.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Annnnnnnd...go!

           Bobby reaches for the ball, but this time, Stevie doesn’t 
           make it disappear. Bobby swipes it clean out of his hand.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        C’mon, Stevie. Show Uncle Baxter 
                        what you can do.
                             (hands the ball back)
                        Annnnnnnnd....WALA!!!

           Bobby grabs it again.  Stevie just sits there. Baxter sighs.

                                 BAXTER
                        Stevie, why don’t you wait outside 
                        while me and Daddy talk?  

           INT. BAXTER’S SHITTY WAITING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Stevie sits down on a dirty chair.  He pulls Destro and Snow 
           Job out of his pockets and starts MUMBLING to them.

                                 BAXTER (O.S.)
                        What the fuck’s the matter with you?

           INT. SHITTY OFFICE - SAME

                                 BOBBY
                        That kid figured out every one of my 
                        tricks just by watching my greatest 
                        hits tape when he was six! Now, I 
                        know he’s got some kind of people 
                        problem, but I could work with him.

                                 BAXTER
                        Work with Miss Piggy? For what?  

           Bobby pulls a clipping out of his pocket and lays it on the 
           desk: SETH DESSTINY CHALLENGE AT THE MGM GRANDE IN LAS VEGAS.

                                 BAXTER (CONT’D)
                        Jesus.  Desstiny again?  C’mon, we 
                        all know - the guy humiliated you. 

                                 BOBBY
                        HUMILIATED ME?! That shit he put in 
                        my coffee fucked my eyesight! 
                                 BAXTER
                        I know, I know - and ‘cause of that 
                        you can’t do magic anymore. Butcha 
                        gotta let it go already! Move on. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Just hear me out-- I’ll call in some 
                        favors and get the kid a couple of 
                        practice gigs on the way to Vegas.  
                        All I need is cash to get there.

                                 BAXTER
                        Do you have any idea the kinda talent 
                        that competes at these things?!  

           Baxter tosses MAGIC WORLD MAGAZINE on the desk. On the cover: 
           a PORTLY MAGICIAN with a goatee and pointed eyebrows.

                                 BAXTER (CONT’D)
                        That’s Dante Inferno. Five time 
                        mallusionist champion. He’s what you 
                        should be bringing me. Not some... 
                        sausage-y... pre-teen Rain Man.

                                 BOBBY
                        You’re making a huge mistake, Bax.  
                        We could be up to our necks in 
                        cocaine-water again. Whaddya say?

                                 BAXTER
                        You’re fired.

                                 BOBBY  
                        Fi--?! You can’t fire me.  That’s 
                        my name up on the wall there!

                                 BAXTER
                        Yeah... and it’s my company.  

           EXT. STREET IN FRONT BAXTER’S SHITTY OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Bobby huffs across the street and drags Stevie behind him.

                                 STEVIE
                        Did mister cocksucker give you the 
                        money, Daddy?

           Bobby stops when he sees:  A BEAT-UP ‘89 CHEVY BERETTA. He 
           reaches under the car.  Groping for... THE MAGNETIC KEY.  

                                 BOBBY
                        Old, predictable Baxter.
           EXT. SEEDY PART OF TOWN - DAY

           Bobby and a group of STREET KIDS stand next to Baxter’s car.

                                 STREET KID #1
                        I dunno, we can give you two-fifty 
                        for it.

                                 BOBBY
                        Sold!

           INT. BOBBY’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Bobby hastily packs his suitcase. Stevie sits on the bed

                                 STEVIE
                        Why are we packing, Daddy?

                                 BOBBY
                        We’re going to Las Vegas.

           EXT. BOBBY’S DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Bobby crams his ratty suitcase into the back of the Fiero.

                                 STEVIE
                        What’s in Las Vegas, Daddy?

                                 BOBBY  
                        A big magic contest. 

                                 STEVIE
                        Are you going to do magics, Daddy? 
                        I always wanted to see that.

                                 BOBBY
                        Even better. You’re gonna do magic. 

                                 STEVIE
                        But, I don’t wanna do magics.

                                 BOBBY
                        “Don’t wanna do magics?”  You’re a 
                        Glitter fer chrissakes! I’d hate to 
                        think what your great grandfather 
                        Gunther Gleeter would say.

                                 STEVIE
                        He did magics too?
                                 BOBBY
                        Sure.  All the Glitter men are 
                        magicians.  Me.  Your grandfather--

                                 STEVIE
                        I have a grandpappy and he does 
                        magics?  Where’s he from?  Fresno?

                                 BOBBY
                        What? No, he lives in Arizona-- 
                        Look, let’s not talk about my dad.

                                 STEVIE
                        Why?

                                 BOBBY
                        Because I don’t ever talk about my 
                        dad. Let’s talk about Vegas.

                                 STEVIE
                        ...but if we go, we’ll miss Oprah. 

                                 BOBBY
                        We won’t miss Oprah. In fact-- 
                        Oprah’ll be there. She’s presenting 
                        the grand prize to the winner. 

                                 STEVIE 
                        Oprah!  How wondrous!  But wait... 
                        Won’t Mommy be mad if I do magics?

                                 BOBBY
                        I wasn’t gonna tell you this, but 
                        Mommy told me her deepest wish would 
                        be to see you do - magics - on 
                        television. She said that she’d be 
                        so proud that it might be her only 
                        chance of beating those brain hives. 

                                 STEVIE
                        So if I don’t do magics, Mommy 
                        might... die?

                                 BOBBY
                        Looks that way. But no pressure. If 
                        you don’t wanna do this, fuck it. 
                        We’ll go get some donut holes.

           Bobby walks away when--

                                 STEVIE
                        WAIT!
           INT. HOSPITAL RECOVERY ROOM - DAY

           Penny’s in bed with a bandaged head. She slowly awakens. 

                                 PENNY
                        Whe-- Where’s Stevie?

                                 NURSE
                        Shh. Relax. He’s safe with his Dad.

           EXT. OPEN HIGHWAY - DAY

           From high above, we see the Fiero speed down the empty road.

                                 STEVIE (O.S.)
                        Mommy says if you don’t buckle your 
                        seatbelt, you’ll become a statistic.

           INT. FIERO - SAME

           Bobby smokes a menthol with closed windows. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Here’s a statistic for you: Seatbelts 
                        are for fags. A seatbelt is a 
                        restriction. If you’re gonna be a 
                        magician, you have to live on the 
                        edge. You have to feel free inside 
                        and out at all times. You’ve gotta 
                        grab life by the balls and squeeze 
                        the baby batter out of them. Trust me 
                        on this one, okay?

                                 STEVIE
                        ...Okay Daddy. I’ll live on the edge. 

           Stevie nervously takes off his seatbelt. 

                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                        I feel scared, Daddy.

                                 BOBBY
                        No you don’t, stupid.  You feel 
                        free.  Now, let me hear you say it.

                                 STEVIE
                        Say what?

                                 BOBBY
                        I’m free! C’mon-- say it. 
                                 STEVIE
                        ...I’m free.

                                 BOBBY
                        SAY IT WITH BALLS. C’MON! I’M FREE!

           Bobby pumps his fist in Stevie’s laughing face.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        I’M FREE!!! WOOOO!!!

                                 STEVIE
                        I’m free! YAAAAY!!!  I’M FREE!!!! 
                             (beat)
                        Daddy, there’s a truck coming.

                                 BOBBY
                        Don’t sweat it.  It’s at least half a 
                        mile away.

           BLEEEEEEP!  The horn JOLTS Bobby, who realizes the TRUCK IS 
           MUCH CLOSER THAN HE THOUGHT. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        OH, SHIT!   

           He SLAMS the brakes. Stevie’s head CRACKS against the dash.  

                                 STEVIE
                        AAAHOW!!! 

           Bobby gains control of the car. He turns to a reeling Stevie. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Crap, kid. Are you alright?! I’m 
                        sorry - it’s my goddamn eyes!

           Stevie takes his head out of his hands, looks up. Smiling. 

                                 STEVIE
                        Let’s do it again, Daddy. 

           INT. BIG RED’S NIGHT CLUB - EVENING

           Sleazy joint. An old rotary phone RINGS. The owner, BIG RED 
           (60’s female), yellow teeth and a CANCER COUGH answers it. 

                                 RED
                        Big Red’s.
           INT. REST STOP - EVENING - INTERCUT

           Bobby’s squeezed into a tiny phone booth. Stevie reads 
           BROCHURES from a tourist stand in the background.  

                                 BOBBY
                        Red, you old cuntbag. 

                                 RED
                        Bobby Glitter. What’s it been? Five 
                        years?  Where the hell’s my money?

                                 BOBBY
                        I see you haven’t lost your sense of 
                        humor. You still doing magic Sundays?

                                 RED
                        Oh, no. Last time I let you pay me 
                        back by doing a show, you gave two 
                        of my waitresses gonorrhea.    

                                 BOBBY
                        Don’t worry. I don’t do magic 
                        anymore, but I’m managing this kid. 
                        He’s gonna be the best.

           A wary Red chain lights a cigarette.

                                 RED
                        Awright. But if he sucks, I’m taking 
                        one a’ your fingers.

                                 BOBBY
                        There’s that Big Red humor again. 

           INT. REST STOP - CONTINUOUS

           Bobby hops out of the booth and rubs his hands together.

                                 BOBBY
                        Good news, kid. We got you your 
                        first gig.  Now let’s find a motel.

                                 STEVIE
                        Can we stay here, Daddy?

           Stevie hands him one a brochure.  Bobby looks at it.

                                 BOBBY
                        You gotta be shitting me.
           EXT. DINOMOTOR INN - NIGHT

           Each bank of rooms is a different dilapidated STUCCO DINOSAUR.

                                 BOBBY
                        You sure this is what you want? 

           Stevie’s hypnotized. He can barely utter the word:

                                 STEVIE
                        ... stegosaurus...

           INT. DINOMOTOR INN - OFFICE - NIGHT

           A CLERK dressed in a cheesy Triceratops costume takes Bobby’s 
           cash and hands him a BRONTOSAURUS key. Stevie nudges Bobby.

                                 BOBBY
                        Actually, can we... get a room in 
                        the...Stegosaurus building? Please?

                                 CLERK
                        Dude. They’re all the same inside.

           EXT. STEGOSAURUS BUILDING - NIGHT

           Bobby lugs their bags as Stevie skips merrily behind him

           INT. STEGOSAURUS SUITE

           Stevie is already on the television, searching for Oprah.  

                                 STEVIE
                        I’ve never watched Oprah in a 
                        Stegosaurus before, Daddy. 

           Bobby shuts off the TV.

                                 BOBBY
                        We have a show tomorrow, Stevie. 
                        That means you’ve gotta get used to 
                        performing in front of real, live 
                        people. And that’s a shitload more 
                        important than watching Oprah. Got 
                        it? Good. Now let’s get set up.

                                 STEVIE
                        Set up for what?

                                 BOBBY
                        Your people practice.
           EXT. DINOMOTOR INN - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Bobby pokes his head out of the room to see a short 
           ECUADORIAN MAID in a T-Rex costume wheeling down the hall.

                                 BOBBY
                        Pssst! Hey! Taco-saurus!

           INT. STEGOSAURUS SUITE

           The Maid sits in a chair while Bobby plays announcer.

                                 BOBBY
                        And now, for your viewing pleasure, 
                        the one, the only: STEVIE GLITTER!

           The door slowly opens. Stevie nervously shuffles out wearing 
           sequined pants. He stares at the floor, holding the red ball.

                                 STEVIE
                        ... rubber ball... red... 
                        it...it...IcannotdothisDaddy.

           And Stevie runs back into the bathroom, SLAMS the door shut.

                                 MAID
                        Que?

           Bobby runs to the bathroom and ENTERS.

           INT. BATHROOM - SECONDS LATER

                                 BOBBY
                        What the hell’s wrong with you?! 

                                 STEVIE
                        She’s judging me.  

                                 BOBBY
                        Judging you?! She doesn’t fucking 
                        understand English! 

                                 STEVIE
                        She’s judging me in Spanish.

                                 BOBBY
                        Look-- I used to get stage fright 
                        too. Then my dad taught me a trick.  

                                 STEVIE
                        Pappy taught you magics?  That 
                        must’ve been wondrous!
                                 BOBBY
                        Yeah. The fuck’s with all this 
                        wondrous shit?  What kind of nine 
                        year old says wondrous?
                             (before Stevie can answer)
                        Lemme guess:  Oprah.

                                 STEVIE
                        How’d you know?

                                 BOBBY
                        Look, my dad taught me that when 
                        you get nervous onstage, you have 
                        to imagine you’re someone else.  
                        When I was offstage, I was boring, 
                        old Bobby Glitter.  But when I was 
                        out there doing magic, I became...
                             (jazz hands)
                        BOBBY GLITTER!  

                                 STEVIE
                        Ooh.  Can I be Destro?

                                 BOBBY
                        You can be whoever the fuck you 
                        want.  That’s the point.

                                 STEVIE
                        But Destro wouldn’t wear this.

                                 BOBBY
                        Sure he would. They’re his... 
                        leisure clothes.

                                 STEVIE
                        Destro doesn’t wear lesion clothes. 
                        Destro has a very specific uniform.  
                        How can I be Destro without the 
                        uniform, Daddy?  How?

                                 BOBBY
                        ALRIGHT! JESUS! I GOT IT!

           INT. WAL-MART - HALLOWEEN SECTION - NIGHT

           Bobby sifts through a mountain of costumes, exhausted.

                                 STEVIE (O.S.)
                        I FOUND DESTRO!!!

           Bobby looks up and Stevie emerges from under another huge 
           pile of costumes with a Destro mask and outfit in his hands.
                                 BOBBY
                        Magnificent. Let’s get the fuck 
                        outta here.

                                 STEVIE
                        But Daddy. What about Storm Shadow?

                                 BOBBY
                        Fuck him. 

                                 STEVIE
                        But Daddy - Destro never goes on a 
                        mission without Storm Shadow. 
                        They’re partners. 

           Bobby stares at the kid and rolls his eyes.

           INT. STEGOSAURUS SUITE - LATER

           The Maid and the Indian Clerk are seated.

                                 BOBBY (O.S.)
                        Ladies and gentlemen, introducing 
                        the spectacular... Stevie Glitter!

           Stevie waddles out in a TIGHT VINYL DESTRO COSTUME that hugs 
           his fat folds. He wears his glasses over his mask.

                                 STEVIE
                        ...hi...  this... is... a...  this.

           Stevie’s eyes nervously dart across the room to reveal -

           BOBBY - who’s in an even tighter STORM SHADOW costume.  

                                 BOBBY
                             (mouthing)
                        You can do it, Stevie.

                                 CLERK
                        I don’t have time for this shit.

                                 STEVIE
                        Wait! Wh - what’s your name, sir?

                                 CLERK
                        I’m just the desk clerk, okay?

                                 STEVIE
                        Okay, Clark.  M-- may I borrow your 
                        watch, Clark?
           The clerk grudgingly takes off his SEIKO WATCH.  Stevie takes 
           the watch and puts a HANDKERCHIEF on top of it.

                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                        Clark, put your hand on top of my 
                        hand and let’s count to three.

           The clerk grudgingly puts his hand on top of Stevie’s.

                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                        One... Two... Three.

           Stevie yanks the sheet away... but the WATCH IS STILL THERE.

                                 CLERK
                        Jeez.  Thank you for wasting my 
                        time.  You’ve just made my life 
                        that much more miserable.

           The clerk grabs his watch and starts to leave the room.  
           Bobby motions for Stevie to ‘keep going’... but he’s frozen.

                                 BOBBY
                        Hey! You sure that’s your watch?    

                                 CLERK
                        Of course, I’m--

           The clerk looks down to see he’s holding a LADY’S WATCH.

                                 CLERK (CONT’D)
                        What the-- whose watch is this?!

                                 MAID
                        ¡Ése es el mío! 

           The clerk and maid see that their watches have been SWITCHED.

                                 CLERK
                        Wow!  Kid, that was incredible!

           They APPLAUD wildly and Bobby smiles ear to ear.

                                 BOBBY
                        Now, for Stevie’s next trick...

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. STEGOSAURUS SUITE - NIGHT

           Bobby sits in bed studying a roadmap. He rolls the RED BALL 
           in his fingers. He yells to Stevie who’s in the bathroom.
                                 BOBBY
                        After tomorrow night, we got five 
                        more joints to iron out the kinks 
                        before the regional qualifiers! 

           He makes the ball disappear in his hand, then reappear. His 
           cell phone rings. Without looking at it, he answers.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        This is Bobby. 

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - INTERCUT

           A groggy and recovering Penny is laid up in bed on the phone. 

                                 PENNY
                        Bobby?  It’s me.

           Bobby perks up and makes sure Stevie can’t hear him.

                                 BOBBY
                        H-- hey. How are you?  

                                 PENNY
                        Not feeling too hot, but the 
                        surgery went well. When can you 
                        bring Stevie by the hospital?

                                 BOBBY
                        Bring him by? Oh gosh. I’m not 
                        gonna be able to do that.

                                 PENNY
                        Why not? 

                                 BOBBY
                        Um, because we’re... at camp.  
                        Yeah. We’re at a camp.

                                 PENNY
                        Camp? Stevie hates the outdoors.

                                 BOBBY
                        Yeah, well... it’s a... 

           Bobby looks at the TV where Star Trek is playing silently.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        ...space camp. 

                                 PENNY
                        Space camp? Where?
                                 BOBBY
                        In... Ohio?

                                 PENNY
                        You’re at space camp in Ohio?  
                        Bobby, what is going on?

           Stevie pops out of the restroom.  Bobby jumps at the sight of 
           the ungodly HEADGEAR fastened around his head. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Um... what was that? I can’t hear 
                        you. We’re in the... anti-
                        gravity... thing, right now.

           Bobby changes the channel to static and CRANKS UP THE VOLUME.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        DON’T WORRY! WE’LL CALL YOU LATER!

                                 PENNY
                        Wait--  Bobby!

           And CLICK. He hangs up.  Penny looks at the phone, perplexed. 

           INT. MOTEL BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

                                 BOBBY
                        The fuck is on your head?!

                                 STEVIE
                        Ish my headgear. I wear it 
                        Tueshdaysh and Thurshday nightsh.
                        Who wasch that on the phone?

                                 BOBBY
                        Your mom.

                                 STEVIE
                        MOMMY?! Ish she okay?!

                                 BOBBY
                        Guess that depends on how we do at 
                        the contest. Now, let’s get some 
                        shut eye. Big day tomorrow.

           Stevie lays down on his makeshift floor-bed. 

                                 STEVIE
                        Are you going to tuck me in, Daddy?
                                 BOBBY
                        Listen, I may be your Dad, but I 
                        don’t do the gay shit. Capeche?

                                 STEVIE
                        Doesh that mean you’re not going to 
                        give me eshkimo kisses?

                                 BOBBY
                        I’m not going to dignify that with 
                        an answer.

           Stevie fluffs his pillow. Bobby looks down at him. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        I’ve got something for you. Catch. 

           Bobby tosses a videotape and hits Stevie smack in the face. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Sorry.  Depth perception.

           Stevie rubs his head and reads the tape’s label: Oprah 10/7.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        I had that clerk tape it for you. 

           Stevie’s eyes well with tears as he hugs the tape close. 
           Bobby TURNS OFF the light. 

                                 BOBBY  (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Goodnight Destro.

           Stevie chuckles in the dark.

                                 STEVIE (O.S.)
                        Goodnight Shtorm Shadow.

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. BIG RED’S NIGHT CLUB - DUSK

           The neon lights of this strip-mall club buzz in the cold air.

           INT. BIG RED’S NIGHT CLUB - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

           Stevie, wearing his Destro costume, stares in the mirror. 

                                 STEVIE
                        You’re going to be out there, 
                        right, Daddy? 
                                 BOBBY
                        Of course. Oh, and I should 
                        probably mention... This is a 
                        special kind of magic club.

           INT. BIG RED’S NIGHT CLUB - BACKSTAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           BOOBIES.  A SPOTLIGHT shines on a FAT STRIPPER dancing.

           Stevie stares at her with wide eyes.  Bobby, in his Storm 
           Shadow costume, is behind him.

                                 STEVIE 
                        That magician’s twillies are showing!

                                 RED (O.S.)
                        Let’s hear it for Lady Nadine!

           Red hops on stage as the stripper grabs her tips.  

                                 RED (CONT’D)
                        Now, as part of a tradition at Big 
                        Red’s, Sunday night is magic night!

           There’s a collective GROAN from the audience.

                                 BOBBY
                        Knock ‘em on their ass, kid.

           Stevie smiles and pulls his mask down over his face.

           INT. BIG RED’S NIGHT CLUB - MAIN STAGE - SAME

           Bobby runs into the audience and stands at the bar.  The 
           BARTENDER has a bandaged hand.

                                 BOBBY
                        What’s with your hand, Clyde?

                                 BARTENDER
                        Red’s lost it. She got pissed at me 
                        last week and hacked my finger clean 
                        off. I thought she was just joking. 
                        Worst mistake of my life. 

           Bobby’s smile fades.

                                 RED  
                        Here he is: LITTLE STEVIE GLITTER!

           Stevie waddles onstage as CHUCKLES slip from the audience.
                                 HECKLER #1
                        Holy shit!  That kid’s got the 
                        biggest rack I’ve seen all night!

           STEVIE’S POV as he sees Bobby at the bar, giving him a thumbs 
           up.  Stevie nervously holds the red ball up to the audience. 

                                 STEVIE
                        This-- this is a ball.

                                 HECKLER #2 (O.S.)
                        No shit, ya eat beast!

           SCHILUCK! The spotlight shines on Stevie. HE CAN’T SEE BOBBY. 

                                 STEVIE
                        Uh... ball... it’s a round... I...

           Stevie DROPS THE BALL ON THE GROUND. 

                                 HECKLER #3
                        Show those tits or get off stage! 

           MORE LAUGHTER.  Bobby feels Red’s cold glare upon him. 

                                 STEVIE
                        Daddy... DADDY?!  I can’t see you!

                                 BOBBY
                        Damnit, Stevie, I’m right here!

           Someone throws a beer can on stage. Others do the same.  

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Turn off that damn spotlight!

           Bobby jumps on stage as the JEERS continue. 

           INT. BIG RED’S NIGHT CLUB - BACKSTAGE

           Bobby nervously shells out cash, putting it in Red’s palm.

                                 RED
                        And fifty more for stage damages.

                                 BOBBY
                        Is that... it?

                                 RED
                        No.

           Bobby nervously closes his eyes.
                                 RED (CONT’D)
                        I also got some advice for you.  Quit 
                        retard wrangling, get your eyes fixed 
                        and go back to work for yourself.  

           Bobby breathes a sigh of relief. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Y’know - for a second, I thought you 
                        were really going to take my finger.

           Bobby’s chuckles subside when he sees that Red isn’t smiling.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BIG RED’S NIGHT - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

                                 BOBBY
                        MOTHERFUCKER!

           Bobby, with a bloody, bandaged hand, storms out with Stevie.  

                                 STEVIE
                        Are you okay, Daddy?

                                 BOBBY
                        THE FUCK DO YOU THINK?! THAT BITCH 
                        HACKED OFF THE TOP OF MY PINKIE!

                                 STEVIE
                        Where are we going?

                                 BOBBY
                        Home! 

                                 STEVIE
                        What about the magic contest? What 
                        about meeting Oprah?  

                                 BOBBY
                        WHAT ABOUT ME, HUH? LOOK AT ME!  
                        I’M A FUCKING FREAK!  

                                 STEVIE
                        I - I’m sorry, Daddy. I’ll give you 
                        my pinkie.

           Bobby collects himself.

                                 BOBBY
                        Look, kid. This was all a mistake. 
                        This whole goddamn trip.  
                                 STEVIE
                        But I thought maybe... maybe we 
                        could be partners someday, Daddy.

           Bobby walks away.

                                 BOBBY (O.S.)
                        MOTHERF--

           INT. STEGOSAURUS HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Bobby opens the door to find a fat guy wearing eyeliner and 
           pleather pants, lounging on the bed. This is-- 

                                 BOBBY
                        Le Petit Gerard.  

           Lancome and Fleance close the door behind Bobby and Stevie. 

                                 LE PETITE GERARD
                        Bon soir, Ro-bear, locating you has 
                        been... tres difficile.

           THUD!  Lancome CRACKS Bobby in the stomach.

           SHLICK! Fleance draws a switchblade pokes it in Bobby’s face.

                                 LANCOME
                        Ziss is zee end of zee line, Bubby!

                                 STEVIE
                        Daddy!

                                 BOBBY
                        It’s okay, Stevie. These are... 
                        magician friends of mine.  We’re 
                        just practicing a magic trick.
                             (to Gerard)
                        Can’t we do this without the kid? 

           Gerard stares at the kid, and then nods to Fleance.

           INT. STEGOSAURUS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           A nervous Stevie sits. Sounds of a BEATING in the background.

           INT. STEGOSAURUS HOTEL ROOM - SAME

           A bloodied and bruised Bobby is slumped against the wall.
                                 BOBBY
                        Look guys, you really think doing 
                        this is gonna get your money back?

                                 LE PETITE GERARD
                        Sweet Bubby, this is no longer 
                        about zee money.

           Lancome pulls out a PISTOL.  KNOCK.  KNOCK.  

           He hides his gun as Stevie OPENS THE DOOR and waddles in... 

                                 STEVIE
                        I - I left my Snow Job in my bag.

                                 BOBBY
                        Jesus, Stevie! Get out of here!

                                 STEVIE
                        Are you guys still doing magics?

                                 LANCOME
                             (chuckling)
                        Oui.  We are performing magics.

                                 STEVIE
                        Wanna see a trick... Mister?

                                 BOBBY
                        Just get out of here, Stevie--

                                 LE PETITE GERARD
                        Let zee child do his trick.  

           Stevie nervously smiles and fans a deck of cards.  

                                 STEVIE
                        Pick any card. 

           Lancome picks a SIX OF HEARTS. 

                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                        Now. I’m gonna - I’m gonna mix up 
                        all the cards and find your card.  

           Stevie reshuffles, then pulls out... A JOKER.

                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                        Is this your card, Mister?

                                 FLEANCE
                        Monsieur Bubby, your child is an 
                        even bigger imbecile zan you are.
                                 STEVIE
                        I did it, Daddy.  It worked.

                                 LANCOME
                        Nothing worked!  Zat was zee worst 
                        card trick I’ve ever seen. 

                                 STEVIE
                        But... it wasn’t a card trick.

                                 LANCOME
                        No, mon enfant?  Zen, what was it?

                                 STEVIE
                        A Mister Lection.

           Everyone’s jaw drops when they see... STEVIE GLITTER WIELD 
           LANCOME’S PISTOL.

                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                        RUN DADDY!!!

           BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Stevie SCREAMS as he waves the gun and 
           FIRES. A STRAY BULLET plugs Gerard in the foot.  

                                 LE PETITE GERARD
                        AAAHHOW! MON ORTEIL GRANDE!

           Bobby grabs Stevie and sprints out the door.

           EXT. STEGOSAURUS BUILDING - PARKING LOT - SECONDS LATER

           Bobby and Stevie race to the Fiero.  Bobby sees a Taurus with 
           a Canadian license plate: MAGIQUE!. He grabs the gun and 
           SHOOTS at the TIRES, but HITS the trunk.

                                 BOBBY
                        STEVIE - HELP ME AIM THIS THING! 

           Stevie grabs Bobby’s hand and aims the gun at the back tire.

                                 STEVIE
                        NOW, DADDY!

           BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Bobby and Stevie obliterate the back tire. 

           INT. FIERO - MOMENTS LATER

           Bobby floors the Fiero down the highway. 

                                 BOBBY
                        HOT SHIT, KID!  THAT WAS AWESOME!
                                 STEVIE
                        Are we still going home?

                                 BOBBY
                        Shit no! You’re a natural. 

                                 STEVIE
                        But what about what you said--

                                 BOBBY
                        Look, I was just frustrated. We 
                        still got a lotta work to do before 
                        qualifiers, but I think I can teach 
                        you by then...

                                 STEVIE
                        Teach me what, Daddy?

           Bobby grins as ROCK MUSIC fades up on the soundtrack and we--

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. VIDEO STORE - DAY

           Bobby struts down the aisle, his arms filled with titles like 
           “FLASHDANCE,” “DIRTY DANCING” and “FOOTLOOSE”

           Another tape catches his eye: “SPACE CAMP.”

           INT. MOTEL 6 ROOM - DAY

           ON TV: “FOOTLOOSE” - Bacon is going balls-out in the warehouse.

                                 BOBBY 
                        There’s more to being a magician 
                        than sleight of hand.

           With tongue hanging out, Stevie’s in front of the TV trying-- 
           and failing-- to mimic the dance moves from FOOTLOOSE.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        A magician is a showman first. And 
                        showmanship is the art of seduction.  

                                 STEVIE
                             (panting)
                        What’s...seduction...Daddy?

                                 BOBBY
                        First and foremost, it is a dance. 
           INT. SLEAZY BIKER BAR - NIGHT

           Stevie’s onstage in front of a sparse audience.  He awkwardly 
           does high-kicking dance moves as a dove flies from his hand.

                                 BOBBY (O.S. FROM AUDIENCE)
                        Now, jazz hands! That’s it!

           INT. SUPER EIGHT MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Bobby sits on the bed feeding the dove perched in his hand. 

                                 BOBBY
                        In order to beat Seth Desstiny, you 
                        have to dress like you can beat Seth 
                        Desstiny. Now money’s tight, so 
                        we’re going to have to be creative.

           INT. LAUNDROMAT - DAY

           Bobby and Stevie walk down the row of LAUNDROMAT PATRONS, 
           slyly snagging clothes from their baskets unnoticed.

           MOMENTS LATER: They exit with a pile of clothes when--

                                 OLD LADY (O.S.)
                        HEY! COME BACK WITH MY UNDERTHINGS!

           Bobby and Stevie make a break for it.   

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Penny, looking much better, is on her feet.  She’s on the 
           phone, and it’s ringing on the other end.  No answer...

           INT. MOTEL 6 ROOM- SAME

           Bobby ignores his ringing cell phone and continues to put 
           rhinestones on a jacket with a bedazzling gun.  

           Stevie works out to FLASHDANCE, in parachute pants.

           INT. OLD GYM - DAY

           Stevie hits a HEAVY BAG with everything he’s got. A picture 
           of Seth Desstiny is taped to the bag.
                                 BOBBY
                        You don’t think Desstiny wants this 
                        as much as you do!?!  THINK AGAIN!

           INT. REC ROOM - NIGHT

           POW! A smoke bomb explodes. Stevie prances through the smoke 
           in a GARISH RHINESTONE-COVERED COSTUME, the room full of 
           people wearing dark glasses. 

                                 BOBBY
                        YOU’RE KILLIN’ UP THERE, BOY!!!

           Stevie nervously smiles as we reveal the sign behind him--
           ‘LIVINGSTON COUNTY HOME FOR THE BLIND’

           INT. FIERO - DAY

           Bobby ties a bungee cord around the roof of the car. 

                                 BOBBY
                        There’s not much time before 
                        regionals, so these next few 
                        lessons are going to be quick.

           EXT. FIERO - MOMENTS LATER

           Bobby drives the car slowly down the empty road in the rain.

                                 BOBBY
                        AGILITY IS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL 
                        TOOLS IN THE MAGICIAN’S ARSENAL! 

           TRACK UP to see Stevie nervously standing on the roof of the 
           car, holding onto the cord, trying to keep his balance. 

                                 STEVIE
                        Are y- you sure this is s- safe?

                                 BOBBY
                        You think Seth Desstiny gives a 
                        crap if you’re safe or not?! 

           SCREECH! The Fiero accelerates out of frame.  

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           A NURSE hands Penny a stack of mail.  In the stack is a 
           “postcard” for SPACE CAMP-- clearly cut from the video box.
           Penny stares at it curiously as she flips it over.  On the 
           back it reads: “Wish you were here.  Love, Bobby and Stevie.” 

           INT. DAYS INN MOTEL ROOM - DAY

                                 BOBBY (V.O.)
                        Remember, kid.  You always have to 
                        be able to clear your mind.  Block 
                        out every distraction.

           Stevie CLOSES HIS EYES and matches his yelps to the 
           television, where Michael Jackson’s ‘Captain EO’ plays.

                                 STEVIE
                        OW! OW! OW! OW!

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

           A BANNER reads:“DESSTINY MALLUSIONIST COMPETITION QUALIFIERS”

           Stevie TWIRLS on stage in his costume.  His hair is done up 
           in a pompadour. An EXPLOSION rains PLAYING CARDS down on him.  
           He catches one and turns it to a JUDGE on the panel.

                                 STEVIE
                        Was this your card...  Ma’am?

           A kid in a top hat, ANOTHER CONTESTANT, knows it’s over and 
           throws his cane to the floor.  The CROWD ERUPTS.

                                 BOBBY
                        Oh yeah. He’s ready for Vegas.

           INT. SETH DESSTINY’S CANDLE-COVERED LIVING SPACE - DAY

           Seth Desstiny sits in front of his plasma-screen T.V. 
           watching a news report on Stevie with contempt.

                                 ANCHORWOMAN (ON TELEVISION)
                        His name’s Stevie Glitter, son of 80s 
                        magic phenom, Bobby Glitter.  Little 
                        Stevie may not be the most polished 
                        magician-- but he’s comin’ Vegas!

           An androgynous acupuncturist, SHIDESHI, twists needles in 
           Seth’s temple.

                                 SETH DESSTINY
                        ...and so, Shideshi, the son has 
                        risen from the ashes of the father.
           INT. BAR - LATER

           Stevie and Bobby sit at the bar.  Bobby pounds a beer.

                                 BOBBY
                        Congratulations, kid.  You really 
                        rocked the cock back there.
                             (to Bartender)
                        Hey, Chuckles!  Two beers.

           The FAT FEMALE BARTENDER looks at Bobby like he’s crazy.

                                 STEVIE
                        LOOK! That’s me rocking the cock!

           A TV on the wall shows Stevie doing magic at the qualifier.  
           One of the bar patrons turns up the volume as the bar hushes.

                        boys at the Seth Desstiny Challenge. 
                        It’ll be an uphill battle for New 
                        Mexico’s littlest wizard.

           The bar patrons CHEER for the kid as Bobby hoists him up.

                                 STEVIE
                        This is the happiest day of my life!

           CLINK.  The bartender puts TWO BEERS down in front of them.

                        One beer never hurt anyone.  

           Stevie takes a swig of his beer. The patrons CHEER AGAIN.

                                 BOBBY
                        Say, Stevie. Have you ever... Fiero’d?

           INT. FIERO - NIGHT

           Journey’s “ANY WAY YOU WANT IT” BLASTS from the Fiero.  

           A drunk Bobby and Stevie and a COUPLE GIRLS FROM THE BAR sing 
           along as they speed down the street.  

                                 BOBBY
                        This ain’t just a song, kid!  You 
                        beat Seth Desstiny in Vegas and 
                        anything you want is yours!

           EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT

           Bobby and Stevie sprint out of a convenience store. A CLERK 
           chases them with a shotgun.  Bobby pulls a stolen SIX PACK 
           from under his shirt and Stevie pulls a FORTY from under his.

                                 STEVIE
                        I WANT DONUT HOLES!

                        BUT I’LL TAKE YOU THERE!

           Stevie crams donut holes into his mouth as he and his dad 
           CHEER FOR THE WINNING ROOSTER.

                                 STEVIE

           The crowd disperses as COPS storm the alley.

           INT. JAIL CELL - DAY

           A BURLY SHERRIFF slams a cell door on Bobby and Stevie.  

                                 SHERIFF
                        Public intoxication, endangering a 
                        minor, badgering the elderly, 
                        illegal gambling and impersonating 
                        a tollbooth operator. You’re in a 
                        world of trouble, Bobby Glitter.

           The Sheriff leans into the bars, and speaks in a low tone.

                                 SHERIFF (CONT’D)
                        But look, the boys at the station 
                        caught your kid’s act. He’s not bad. 
                        We don’t wanna leave an-- emerging 
                        talent-- like him in the clink.

                                 BOBBY
                        Thanks--

                                 SHERIFF
                        Don’t thank me yet, cochese. The 
                        kid’s fine, but your eyes are more 
                        fucked than Dakota Fanning in 
                        Bangkok. I can’t letcha drive outta 
                        here without some heavy-duty 
                        corrective lenses. So I’m afraid 
                        we’re gonna hafta impound that 
                        pretty lil car of yours.

                                 BOBBY
                        Not the Fiero!

                                 SHERIFF
                        There anyone that you can call to 
                        come getcha?

           Bobby hangs his head.
                                 BOBBY
                        Nope.  Nobody.

                                 SHERIFF
                        Sure?  No one around here you know?

                                 BOBBY
                        I said no.

                                 SHERIFF
                        Have it your way. But unless you 
                        get someone to come quick, you’re 
                        gonna have to stay till we can get 
                        you a court date-- which’ll take at 
                        least a week.  So... get comfy. 

           The Sheriff walks away.  Stevie stares at Bobby.

                                 BOBBY
                        What?

                                 STEVIE
                        If we stay, we’ll miss the contest.  

                                 BOBBY
                        Yeah, I know.  

           Stevie still stares. Bobby sighs.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Goddammit. 

           INT. YUMA HEIGHTS NURSING HOME -  ALL-PURPOSE ROOM - DAY

           A GROUP OF SENIORS sit in a semi-circle and stare sullenly at  
           KIP GLITTER (60’s), grayer and paunchier.  He makes a balloon 
           animal to the groove of ‘My Beautiful Balloon.’

                                 KIP
                        Wa-lah!  A giraffe!

           He gives it to an almost-dead OLD WOMAN in an oxygen mask.  

                                 KIP (CONT’D)
                        Here you are, young lady.

           Her eyes and mouth open wide and Kip smiles back at her.

                                 NURSE
                        Sir, you’re on her oxygen.

           Kip looks down to see he’s stepping on her oxygen tube.  He 
           moves his foot and the lady’s sullen expression returns. 
           Kip answers his ringing cell phone.

                                 KIP
                        The Astounding Kip Glitter.

           INTERCUT THE CONVERSATION - Bobby’s on the jail pay phone.

                                 BOBBY
                        H-hey, Kip.  It’s... Bobby. 

                                 KIP
                        Bobby?  Goodbye.

                                 BOBBY
                        Don’t hang up!  I need help.

                                 KIP
                        Tough. 

                                 BOBBY
                        It’s not just me... it’s your 
                        grandson, too.

           Momentary silence. Kip considers.

           INT. KIP’S FORD TEMPO - TRAVELING

           Kip drives, Stevie’s next to him, and Bobby’s in back.  You 
           can cut the tension with a knife.

                                 KIP
                        So. Stevie...you do magic, do you?

                                 BOBBY
                        Yeah, you should see him--

                                 KIP
                        I was talking to the boy.

                                 STEVIE
                        I rock the cock with Daddy. We’re 
                        going to the Seth Desstiny challenge.  

           Kip catches Bobby’s eyes in the rearview.

                                 KIP
                        Seth Desstiny, huh?

           Bobby looks away.  Kip notices Stevie’s seatbelt is off.

                                 KIP (CONT’D)
                        Don’t forget to buckle your belt. 
                                 STEVIE
                        A seatbelt is a restriction. And 
                        real magicians have to feel free 
                        inside and out at all times.

                                 KIP
                        That’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever 
                        heard.

           INT. GLITTER MAGIC SHOP - LATER

           The store is a dilapidated shell of what it used to be.

                                 STEVIE
                        Can I use your restroom?  

                                 KIP
                        In the back, kiddo.  

           Stevie runs to the back. Bobby enters, lugging their bags.  

                                 KIP (CONT’D)
                        You can stay for one night, Bobby. 
                        And only because of the kid.

           Kip walks away, leaving Bobby alone in the doorway.

           EXT. GLITTER MAGIC SHOP - DAY/NIGHT

           The desert sun sets as night descends on the barren town.

                                 STEVIE (V.O.)
                        Daddy, can I ask you a question?

           INT. REAR APARTMENT - BOBBY’S OLD BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Stevie’s in one of the twin beds in his PJ’s and headgear. 

                                 STEVIE
                        Do you think we’ll ever hate each 
                        other like you and pappy do?

                                 BOBBY
                        It’s not like I hate pappy. It’s 
                        just, y’know... people grow apart.

                                 STEVIE
                        I jusht wanchoo to know that we’re 
                        not gonna grow apart. We might even

                                 BOBBY
                        Whatever you say. Get some sleep.
                             (re: Stevie’s headgear)
                        Oh, wait.  You’re loose here.

           Bobby tightens one of the headgear’s wingnuts.

                                 STEVIE
                        Thanksh, daddy.

           INT. REAR APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Kip falls asleep in his LaZ Boy. Bobby slips into the room...

                                 BOBBY
                        Look. I know you went outta your 
                        way, and I hate asking for more--

                                 KIP
                        Then don’t.

                                 BOBBY
                        It’s just...the kid. He’s the best 
                        I’ve ever seen. I need the car to 
                        get him to Vegas. I got a real shot 
                        at beating Desstiny.

           Kip doesn’t answer, just ignores him. Bobby turns away.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Well, good night, then. Kip.

           Bobby wakes up to see that the bed next to him is empty. 

           INT. GLITTER MAGIC SHOP - STORAGE GARAGE - DAY

           Bobby searches through the wall-to-wall novelties.  

                                 BOBBY
                        Stevie?

                        Over here!

           Stevie, wearing a SWAMI TURBAN, pops up from inside a van. 
           The side of the van reads, “KIP GLITTER’S MAGIC BUS.”  
                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                        This is wondrous. What is it?

                                 BOBBY
                        Your Grandpa’s magic van. For when 
                        we used to go on the road.

           Stevie hops out and points to a freestanding brick wall.  

                                 STEVIE
                        How about that?

                                 BOBBY
                        That was a great trick that your 
                        Grandpa and I used to do together.

           Kip’s stocking shelves but stops when he hears...

                        We made it look like he could walk 
                        straight through a brick wall. We 
                        were a great team.

           Kip grins just a bit.

                                 STEVIE
                        Woah. What is that?

           Stevie’s gaze is drawn to a MASSIVE GUILLOTINE.

                                 BOBBY
                        “King Louie’s Revenge.” It’s another 
                        two-person trick. Great Grandpa 
                        Gleeter used to do it. They say it 
                        was the best magical feat ever.  

                                 STEVIE
                        Can we do that trick together, Daddy? 

                                 BOBBY
                        You kidding? With my eyes like they 
                        are, I’d get killed. Besides, it 
                        broke a long time ago and nobody 
                        knows how to fix it. 

                                 KIP (O.S.)
                        Bobby, I need your help out here.
           Bobby turns to see Kip holding a couple of boxes.  

           INT. GLITTER MAGIC SHOP - DAY

           Bobby stocks malt liquor into a cooler along the wall.

                                 BOBBY
                        When did you get into the liquor 
                        business? And why’d you stop 
                        selling the novelty costumes and 
                        tricks?

                                 KIP
                        ‘Cause showmanship is dead. People 
                        want bullshit street magic now. All 
                        you need for that is black nail polish 
                        and eyeliner. Fortunately, malt liquor 
                        and porn are recession-proof. 

           THE OTHER END OF THE STORE - MOMENTS LATER

           Kip hands porn DVD’s to Bobby, who files them along the wall.

                                 KIP
                        So, what’s your angle with the kid?

           Bobby looks up, offended.

                                 BOBBY
                        No angle. 

                                 KIP
                        C’mon Bobby... the kid doesn’t stand 
                        a chance in Vegas. Those guys’ll chew 
                        him up and spit ‘im out. 

                                 BOBBY
                        I have faith in my son, Kip. Not that 
                        you’d know anything about that.    

                                 KIP
                        If I wasn’t helpin’ you, you’d 
                        still be in jail right now.

                                 BOBBY
                        You think bailing me out makes up 
                        for the last ten years?
                                 KIP
                        What?  You think I left you? Well, 
                        I think you’re just too ashamed to 
                        admit you forgot the number one 
                        rule about magic-- it isn’t about 
                        you, it’s about the audience.  And 
                        you can blame me for that, or Seth 
                        Desstiny. You can even blame your 
                        own eyes. But nothing’s gonna 
                        change the fact that you blew it. 

           Bobby is silent. He knows it’s true.

                                 KIP (CONT’D)
                        Do whatcha want with yourself, but that 
                        kid trusts you. Break that trust and 
                        you’ll regret it for the rest of your 
                        life. I know. I already lost a son.

           Bobby looks at the ground, ashamed. 

           INT. BOBBY’S OLD BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Stevie intently scribbles SOMETHING on a sheet of paper.  
           Bobby grabs his suitcase.

                                 BOBBY
                        Come on, kid.  Time to go.

           INT./EXT. GLITTER MAGIC SHOP - APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Bobby opens the door, drags Stevie out, still scribbling. 

                                 KIP (O.S.)
                        Bobby, wait!

           Kip walks out and throws him some keys.  Bobby catches them.

                                 KIP (CONT’D)
                        It’s a long way to Vegas.

           Bobby throws the keys back.

                                 BOBBY
                        No thanks. I don’t need your help.

                                 KIP
                        You may be pissed at me, Bobby -  
                        but don’t take it out on the boy. 

           Bobby purses his lips, looks to Stevie.
           EXT. GLITTER MAGIC SHOP - MOMENTS LATER

           Bobby starts the car as Kip hugs Stevie outside.

                                 STEVIE
                        Are you coming with us, Pappy?

                                 KIP
                        Believe me, son, there’s nothing 
                        I’d  like to do more, but Bobby 
                        hasn’t wanted me around for ten 
                        years, and I don’t think he’d 
                        appreciate me tagging along now.

                                 STEVIE
                        But you’re not going to see him, 
                        Pappy.  You’re going to see me.

           Kip scruffs Stevie’s hair.

                                 KIP
                        We’ll see, okay?

                                 STEVIE
                        Oh. Here, Pappy. I almost forgot...

           Stevie hands Kip the SHEET OF PAPER that he was drawing on.

                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                        I thought up how to fix your magical 
                        gi-la-team. 

           Kip looks up, amazed as Stevie hops in the car. 

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. DESERT ROAD - NIGHT

           Slowly the familiar VEGAS SKYLINE grows from the horizon.

           INT. KIP’S CAR - SAME

           Bobby drives down the glowing strip. Stevie has his face 
           pressed to the window glass.  

           INT. MGM GRAND - CONVENTION ROOM - NIGHT

           Stevie’s jaw drops when he sees... A SEA OF MAGICIANS FROM 
           ALL OVER THE GLOBE.  Bobby leads him to a registration desk, 
           when a SHORT MAGICIAN approaches. 
                                 SHORT MAGICIAN
                        Holy shit! You’re Bobby Glitter! I 
                        saw you on T.V. when I was a kid. 
                        You were awesome!

                                 BOBBY
                        Yeah. Thanks very much. 

                                 SHORT MAGICIAN
                        That freakout you had in front of 
                        everybody was hilarious!

           Bobby looks down, embarassed.

                                 ANOTHER PERSON IN THE CROWD (O.S.)
                        OH MY GOD, IT’S HIM! IT’S DANTE!

           A bloated man in a black-sequined shirt swaggers in. His 
           eyebrows are shaped into points. This is DANTE INFERNO.

                                 STEVIE
                        Who... who’s that?

                                 SHORT MAGICIAN
                        Dante Inferno.  Five-time mallusion 
                        circuit champion. Legend has it 
                        that he lived with a band of 
                        Latvian gypsies only to rob them of 
                        their black arts.

           Stevie eyes Inferno and THE OLD LADY who follows him.

                                 BOBBY
                        What’s with the fossil?

                                 SHORT MAGICIAN
                        That’s Nana, his grandmother. She 
                        does his every bidding. 

           Inferno stops when he sees Stevie.

                                 INFERNO
                        You’re going to trip in if you don’t 
                        lace your shoes properly, child. 

                                 STEVIE
                        But, my shoes are laced--

           Stevie looks at his Kangaroos- HIS LACES ARE GONE. 

                                 INFERNO
                        Are they?
           Stevie looks back up to see Inferno DANGLING THE LACES in his 
           terrified face.  Inferno chuckles and moves on.  

           INT. MGM GRAND - BALLROOM - LATER

           MAGICIANS mingle amongst the hors d’oeuvres and open bar. 
           Stevie crams his mouth with free shrimp.

                                 BOBBY
                        Ease up on the shrimp, chief.  
                        You’re gonna get lockjaw. 

                                 SETH DESSTINY (BOOMING OVER THE P.A.)
                        FELLOW MALLUSIONISTS, I’M SETH 
                        DESSTINY. WELCOME... TO MY FANTASY!

           A CHORUS SINGS as Seth, in a BLUE ORB, descends to the floor.  

                                 BOBBY
                        You gotta be shittin’ me.

           Seth HIGH KICKS and the orb disappears. The CHORUS is 
           replaced with GUITAR RIFFS as Seth levitates onto the stage.

                                 SETH DESSTINY
                        Congratulations to all of you. To 
                        the one of you I shall face in 
                        battle, I wish you... good luck!

           Seth SNAPS his fingers and is ENGULFED by A WALL OF FLAMES. 
           The crowd’s in awe, save Bobby. He turns to a nervous Stevie.

                                 BOBBY
                        Wait here-- I gotta pinch a squirt.

           INT. RESTROOM - SAME

           Bobby’s alone at the urinal, whistling while he pisses. 

                                 SETH DESSTINY (O.S.)
                        Greetings, Bobby. 

           He turns to see Seth, sidling up to the urinal beside him.

                                 SETH DESSTINY (CONT’D)
                        I’m happy to see you can still 
                        urinate without your glasses. I can 
                        call a custodian to help you aim if 
                        you’d like. 
                                 BOBBY
                        I’ll manage. Great stunt out there. 
                        Here’s a trick for you: Why don’t 
                        you conjure yourself a breath mint?

                                 SETH DESSTINY
                        Dear, Bobby. Haven’t you heard? I run 
                        the show now. I sell out the Bellagio. 
                        I have the El Pollo Loco endorsement. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Whoopdie-shit.

                                 SETH DESSTINY
                        And what have you been up to lately?  
                        Spreading syphilis among the 
                        housewives of suburbia?
                             (off Bobby’s surprise)
                        Oh Bobby, you know there are no 
                        secrets in the magic community.

                        Ahh, shrimp. Magicians of the sea.

           Stevie turns to find Inferno and his Nana behind him.

                                 INFERNO (CONT’D)
                        Well, well-- Little Steven Glitter. 
                        We saw some of his impish devilry 
                        on the Youtube. Didn’t we, Nana?

           Nana nods coldly. Inferno drinks in Stevie’s fear.

                                 INFERNO (CONT’D)
                        Your feeble attempts at fata morgana 
                        may wow the rubes in Provo, but trust 
                        me, they will fail here. By the limbs 
                        of Osmodeus, they will fail.

           Stevie’s hands go limp and he drops his shrimp plate.

                        You’re not worried, are you, Seth?

                                 SETH DESSTINY
                        It’s sad, really. You’re too afraid to 
                        exact revenge yourself, so you hide 
                        behind that mongoloid kid of yours.

           Bobby grabs Seth and pins him against the wall.

                                 BOBBY

                        Stevie and I’ll break you in half. 

           CREAK. The door opens. The Short Magician walks in to see 
           them against the wall, dicks hanging out of their pants.

                        Ladies and gentlemen, before you 
                        stand twenty-four of the world’s 
                        greatest mallusionists, all competing 
                        for the honor of facing the Master of 
                        Mystique himself, Seth Desstiny!

           Stevie nervously gazes around the circle at his competition.  

           - A BREAKDANCING MAGICIAN wearing a red leather jacket. 

           - A MIME MAGICIAN who smugly leans on an imaginary mantle.

           - A KABUKI MAGICIAN in long flowing robes.

           - DANTE INFERNO stares through Stevie with bloodlust.
           INT. DRESSING ROOM - LATER

           Bobby touches up Stevie’s costume and notices he’s trembling.

                                 BOBBY
                        What’s the matter? 

                                 STEVIE
                        I-- I’m scared, Daddy.

                                 BOBBY
                        Relax - this first guy’s a hack. 
                        He’s only here because there are 
                        only two magicians in his whole 
                        region and one of them is a 
                        paraplegic.

                                 STEVIE
                        It’s not that, Daddy...it’s...it’s--

           Stevie points to a MAGIC MAGAZINE. Inferno’s on the cover.

                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                        They say he steals people’s souls. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Look at me, kid. You’re the best 
                        out there. Soon everybody is gonna 
                        know it. Including Inferno. But you 
                        gotta believe in yourself first.

                                 STEVIE
                        Do you believe in me?

                                 BOBBY
                        Shit yeah, partner.

                                 STEVIE
                        Really Daddy, you mean it? We’re 
                        partners? Real partners?!

                                 BOBBY
                        Partners, sure.  Whatever. 

           Stevie shakes Bobby’s hand excitedly.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Now let’s go whoop some ass!

           INT. MGM GRAND - AUDITORIUM - MOMENTS LATER

           The SMALL CROWD CHEERS as a SIGN displaying the TOURNAMENT 
           BRACKET lowers from the ceiling.  On the chart, we read...
           FIRST ROUND: BOBBY GLITTER v. PABLO CHARADE

                                 ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        First up, Pablo Charade!!!

           A single SPOTLIGHT shines down on a mime magician, PABLO 
           CHARADE crouched into a child’s pose.  He rises to PLAYFUL 
           MUSIC, mimes coughing, and pulls SILK SCARVES from his mouth.  

           Bobby leans in and whispers to Stevie.  

                                 BOBBY
                        What’d I tell ya’... total hack.

           Pablo pounces to THE JUDGE’S TABLE and pulls scarves from a 
           Female Judge’s cleavage. He bows to THE BOOING audience.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Okay, kid.  It’s Glitter time.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Stevie steps onto the stage. He smiles at the FEMALE JUDGE.

                                 STEVIE
                        Miss - may I, um, borrow your ring?

           She hands her wedding ring to a nervous Stevie. He grabs a 
           BLOW TORCH and WELDER’S MASK, but something catches his eye:  

           INFERNO in the front row, Nana rubbing his shoulders.

                                 INFERNO
                             (mouthing the words)
                        YOU WILL FAIL, CHILD!

           A trembling Stevie proceeds to MELT the ring down to a lump. 

                                 STEVIE
                        Don’t be-- af-- afraid. I have powers 
                        to turn this ring back to normal.  

           He covers the lump with a hankie and again catches Inferno...

                                 INFERNO
                             (mouthing the words)
                        OH, NO YOU DON’T.

           Stevie YANKS THE HANKIE. The ring IS STILL A MELTED LUMP.

                                 STEVIE
                        I’m - sorry. Let me... try again.

           He covers the lump and pulls the hanky back... STILL MELTED.  
                                 INFERNO (O.S.)
                        Bravo, Merlin!

                                 JUDGE #1
                        I think we’ve seen enough.

           Stevie nervously looks back to Bobby in the corner. 

                                 BOBBY
                        YOU CAN DO IT PARTNER!

           Stevie smiles a little, then covers the ring. He closes his 
           eyes, sweat dripping from his brow, and YANKS back the hanky-- 
           The RING IS BACK TO NORMAL.

           Bobby breathes a SIGH of relief. The crowd politely applauds.

                                 INFERNO
                             (to Nana, grumbling)
                        Lucky break...

           Stevie rushes to a grinning Bobby and HUGS HIM.  

           IN A BOX SEAT - 

           Seth Desstiny and Shideshi look on, snickering. 

                                 SETH DESSTINY
                        Beginner’s luck.  

           ROCK MUSIC fades up on the soundtrack as we--

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

           ONSTAGE, the breakdancing magician, Devo, puts three sparkle-
           covered softballs under three plastic buckets.

           TITLE: ROUND TWO - STEVIE GLITTER v. DEVO TOXIC

           Using WICKED SPEED and dance moves, he SHUFFLES the buckets, 
           then lifts all three to show they’re all EMPTY. Devo 
           moonwalks to Stevie and taunts him by doing THE ROBOT.  
           Stevie is clearly intimidated, but Bobby rubs his shoulders.

                                 BOBBY
                        Just like we practiced, buddy.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Stevie lies in a box and nervously saws himself in half. 
                                 DEVO
                        Shit...that’s easy!

           Bobby gives Stevie the ‘thumbs up’ and Stevie’s LEGS SEPARATE 
           FROM HIS BODY and MOONWALK over to a stunned Devo.   

                                 STEVIE
                             (like Michael Jackson)
                        OW! OW! OW!

           The CROWD GOES APESHIT. Devo knows he’s been bested.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

           Inferno conjures a FIREBALL and TORCHES his opponent’s chair. 

           INT. BOBBY AND STEVIE’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Stevie uses a RED PENCIL to practice a card trick with Bobby 
           when, on the TV--  

                                 REPORTER (ON TELEVISION)
                        You’re the five-time champion of 
                        the mallusion circuit, Mr. Inferno, 
                        but there’s a lot of underdog talk 
                        about Little Stevie Glitter.  
                        Anything you’d like to say to that?

                                 INFERNO (ON TELEVISION)
                        I know you’re watching, Stevie.  
                        I’m gonna drink your blood and 
                        bathe in your father’s tears! 

           The reporter tries to take the mic, but Inferno won’t let go.

                                 INFERNO (CONT’D)
                        I’M COMING FOR YOU STEVIE 
                        GLITTER!!! NO MERCY!!!  

           Bobby reaches for the TV to turn it off, but misses the knob.  
           He misses again.  Stevie grabs the remote and turns it off.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER

           Two flamboyant magicians in matching white costumes, SALSA 
           and SEBASTIAN levitate WHITE LEOPARDS through a fire ring. 

           TITLE: ROUND 3 - STEVIE GLITTER v. SALSA & SEBASTIAN

                                                                CUT TO:
           Stevie’s on stage holding a phone book up to the audience. 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Look Salsa, ze boy’s calling Mommy 
                        to pick him up from ze magic school!

           Stevie tears out a PHONE BOOK PAGE, CRUMPLES it, and throws 
           it through the fire ring. In mid-air, it turns into A WHITE 
           DOVE.  He does it again and again. The crowd goes nuts.

                                 BOBBY
                        Welcome to magic school, boys!

           EXT. MGM GRAND - REAR COURTYARD

           JIAN RAN, the Kabuki Magician, stands next to two 
           freestanding doors on the otherwise empty stage.   

           TITLE: ROUND 4 - STEVIE GLITTER v. JIAN RAN SHU - SEMIFINALS

           He walks through one of the doors and DISAPPEARS.

           Suddenly, the second door on the far side of the stage opens 
           and he walks out of it-- out of thin air.  The crowd CHEERS.

                                 BOBBY
                             (to Stevie)
                        Showtime.

           EXT. MGM GRAND -  PARKING LOT - LATER

           A crowd stands around a MINT-CONDITION TRANS AM.

           Stevie pulls out a HUGE multi-colored sheet and drapes it 
           over the car.  He does some dance moves and YANKS the SHEET 
           away to reveal THE CAR IS GONE. 

                                 SMART-ASS IN THE CROWD (O.S.)
                        Come on, kid!  Your dad did that 
                        trick years ago!  It’s old news.

                                 BOBBY
                        Keep watching, asshole!

           Stevie THROWS THE SHEET into the air over his head.  As it 
           gently drifts back down, it takes the shape of the TRANS AM.   

           Stevie pulls the sheet through the Trans-Am’s sunroof to 
           reveal that the car has REAPPEARED and he sits inside.

           Not only does the CROWD CHEER, they start CHANTING... 
                                 CROWD
                        STE-VIE! STE-VIE! STE-VIE!

           INT. KIP’S MAGIC SHOP - NIGHT

           Kip is filled with pride as he watches his grandson in the 
           car on TV.  He turns to a PERVERT browsing the porn aisle. 

                                 KIP
                        Hey, look! That’s my grandson. 
                        THAT’S MY GRANDSON!

                                 PERVERT
                        Huh. Then why aren’t you there?

           A look of realization washes over Kip’s face. 

                                 PERVERT (CONT’D)
                        That’s okay, man. My grandpa never 
                        came to any of my baseball games and 
                        I turned out okay.

           INT. SETH DESSTINY’S GAUCHE LAIR - NIGHT

           Shideshi gives Seth a massage as he watches Stevie on T.V.  

                                 SETH DESSTINY
                        The child and his father are making 
                        a mockery of my competition. 

                                 SHIDESHI
                        Stevie shan’t be our problem for 
                        much longer, Lord Desstiny.  He must 
                        face Dante Inferno in the finals.

                                 SETH DESSTINY
                        And if he beats Inferno? Then what? 
                        Seth Desstiny plays a humiliating 
                        round of patty cake with the sequin-
                        clad retarded son of his enemy in 
                        front of the whole world?  No, 
                        Shideshi, the child cannot make it 
                        to the finals.

           Shideshi stares at the TV where Stevie happily hugs his dad. 

                                 SHIDESHI
                        Then it would appear that the road 
                        to Stevie’s ruination runs directly 
                        through your old rival. 
           Seth fixes his stare on Bobby’s happy face.  

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY

                        mallusionist champ Dante Inferno in 
                        the finals. What a match that’ll be!

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Bobby holds Stevie upside-down over a bathtub full of water.  
           Stevie again holds the RED PENCIL. He stabs at playing cards 
           that float face down on the water’s surface.

                                 BOBBY
                        Come on, Stevie! You know which 
                        card it is!  Just stab it!

                                 STEVIE
                        I don’t like this trick.  I’m 
                        afraid of heights, Daddy.

                                 BOBBY
                        You’re like two feet off the ground.  
                        Now, come on! You think you’re gonna 
                        beat Desstiny with that attitude?!

           There’s a knock at the door.  It’s a BELLHOP.

                        Speak of the douchebag.
           INT. PENTHOUSE - EVENING

           DING! The elevator door opens to reveal a room adorned with 
           waterfalls, a circular bed and Seth in a silk kimono, lounges 
           in the center of it all.

                                 SETH DESSTINY 
                        Aaaaahhh, Bobby Glitter.

                                 BOBBY
                        Madam Butterfly. 

                                 SETH DESSTINY
                        Nice to see you’ve retained your 
                        sense of humor after all those 
                        years of humiliation. 

                                 BOBBY
                        I have a feeling those days are 
                        coming to the end. And you know it.

                                 SETH DESSTINY
                        Oh? 

                                 BOBBY
                        That’s why you invited me here. You’re 
                        scared you’ll look like an idiot when 
                        we win this thing.

                                 SETH DESSTINY
                        Let’s get something clear: Seth 
                        Desstiny fears nothing. But, I do have 
                        my image to think about. How will it 
                        look to the world when the Shaman of 
                        Shadows destroys the chubby little 
                        planetoid you call ‘Stevie’?

                                 BOBBY
                        If you want him out of this contest, 
                        you can forget it. 

                                 SETH DESSTINY
                        It’s not Stevie that I want out, 
                        Bobby. It’s you.  

           Seth rises and paces to a window overlooking the strip.

                                 SETH DESSTINY (CONT’D)
                        It’s no secret that you and your son 
                        share a special bond. Some might 
                        call it... love. He needs you out 
                        there. He is like the mighty Sampson 
                        and you are like... his... hair.
                             (turning)
                                 (MORE)
                                 SETH DESSTINY (CONT’D)
                        I’m prepared to offer you a fair 
                        sum for your absence.  

           Shideshi CLICKS open a brief case full of cash.  Bobby stares 
           at it-- the slightest flicker of interest in his eye.

                                 SETH DESSTINY (CONT’D)
                        Shall we say the prize money? One-
                        hundred thousand dollars?

                                 BOBBY
                        Do you think you can buy me off--?

                                 SETH DESSTINY
                        One-hundred and fifty thousand.

           CLICK. Shideshi opens another case. Bobby won’t look at it.

                                 BOBBY
                        You’re gonna have to do better than-

           CLICK.

                                 SETH DESSTINY
                        Two-hundred thousand.  

           Bobby can barely stand as he looks at all. That. Money.

                                 SETH DESSTINY (CONT’D)
                        Think of all you’ll be able to do 
                        for little Stevie with $200,000.  

           It takes all of Bobby’s strength to say--

                                 BOBBY
                        Sorry, no deal. Seeing you broken 
                        and humiliated is going to make me 
                        happier than money ever could. 

           He takes a last look at the cash and walks away. 

                                 SETH DESSTINY
                        Plan B, then.

           Shideshi nods.

           EXT. MGM GRAND - NIGHT

           Excited magic-goers file into the auditorium entrance.
           INT. MGM GRAND AUDITORIUM - BACK STAGE - NIGHT

           We hear the MURMUR of people entering the auditorium outside. 
           Shideshi skulks at the top of a TWO-STORY PLATFORM. 

           He sneaks to a WINCH and REMOVES A 4” BRACING PIN from it. 

                                 STAGEHAND (O.S.)
                        Twenty minutes to showtime.

           Shideshi steals away into the darkness unseen.

           INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

           Barely containing frustration, Bobby RAKES a comb through 
           Stevie’s hair.   

                                 STEVIE
                        Ouch!  That hurts! 

                                 BOBBY
                        Sorry... Just a little...nervous. 

           Stevie slumps in his chair and fiddles with his Destro.

                                 STEVIE
                        Yeah. Me too.

                                 BOBBY
                        Don’t worry kid. You’ll be fine. 
                        Just do like we practiced.

                                 STEVIE
                        Is Mommy still going to be watching?  

           Bobby looks to the ground guiltily. A TEEN PAGE ducks in. 

                                 PAGE
                        Stevie Glitter?  It’s show time.

           INT. MGM GRAND - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

           It’s packed. A light shines on Seth, standing center stage.

                                 SETH DESSTINY
                        Ladies and gentlemen, we are down 
                        to our final two mallusionists. 
                        Each will be given the chance to 
                        perform a single illusion.  First 
                        up...  DANTE INFERNO!

           OMINOUS MUSIC plays. A spotlight illuminates Inferno.
                                 INFERNO
                        Ready my swords, Nana!!  

           INT. MGM GRAND - MOMENTS LATER

           Center Stage - Inferno holds FOUR RAZOR SHARP SWORDS.

                                 INFERNO
                        You’ve seen this trick before. A 
                        magician’s assistant steps into a 
                        box and allows his master to 
                        puncture that box with several, 
                        razor sharp swords.

           He tosses a CANTALOUPE into the air and DEFTLY slices it in 
           two with one of the swords.  The CROWD OOO’s.

                                 INFERNO (CONT’D)
                        I too will perform this trick but--

           Inferno STABS clean through NANA with one of the swords.  

                                 INFERNO (CONT’D)
                        -- WITHOUT THE BOX!  

           The crowd GASPS.  Nana cringes.  Stevie watches intently.

                                 INFERNO (CONT’D)
                        Relax, Nana.  For the first cut is 
                        always the deepest.  Number two!

           Inferno stabs her with another sword.  And then another.

           Nana looks like a human pincushion as she struts to center 
           stage.  She opens her mouth and looks up.  Inferno takes his 
           last sword and slides it DOWN HER THROAT.  

           Inferno turns to the crowd with raised arms.

                                 INFERNO (CONT’D)
                        My Nana, ladies and gentlemen. 
                        She’s a real... cut-up.  

           Nana takes a gracious bow and the CROWD APPLAUDS.

                                 SETH DESSTINY
                        DANTE INFERNO! 

           Bobby rises and pats Stevie on the back.

                                 BOBBY
                        C’mon kid, we’re up.
                                 SETH DESSTINY
                        And now, Little Stevie Glitter.

           Bobby and Stevie make their way to THE TWO-STORY HIGH 
           PLATFORM being wheeled in at the other end of the stage.  

           As they pass Seth, he gently leans down and lays his hand on 
           Little Stevie’s shoulder, whispering in his ear:

                                 SETH DESSTINY (CONT’D)
                        The pressure’s on, Stevie. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Back off!

           Bobby shoves Seth. The crowd GASPS. A STAGEHAND rushes in and 
           breaks it up.  Seth smugly raises his hands in surrender.

                                 SETH DESSTINY
                        Whoa, take it easy, Bobby Glitter. 

           INT. MGM GRAND - TWO STORY PLATFORM - MOMENTS LATER

           The PLATFORM overlooks an ABOVE-GROUND POOL below.  

           Stevie wears a HELMET and BUNGEE HARNESS and stares nervously 
           down at the pool.  A still-riled Bobby stands behind him.

                                 BOBBY 
                        Okay, kid, you all set?

                                 STEVIE
                        Daddy... can’t you stay here? 

                                 BOBBY
                        Don’t do this to me, Stevie. We’ve 
                        practiced this thing a million 
                        times. You’ll be fine.

                                 STEVIE
                        B- but Daddy-- Maybe we could do 
                        this tomorrow.  Maybe--

                                 BOBBY
                        Maybe shit kid. I’ve worked way too 
                        hard to let up now.

           Stevie trembles. Bobby hands him THE RED PENCIL.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Now come on. We’re partners, right?  

           Stevie looks up at his Dad. Takes the pencil.
                                 STEVIE
                        R- right. 

           INT. MGM GRAND - STAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Bobby stands next to the pool and tests the water. A FAT 
           JUDGE draws a JACK OF HEARTS from a deck of cards.

                                 FAT JUDGE
                        What now, Mr. Glitter?

                                 BOBBY
                        Toss ‘em.

           The FAT JUDGE puts the JACK OF HEARTS back and tosses the 
           entire deck into the pool. 

           Bobby stares up at the trembling Stevie.  

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Come on, kid. 

           Stevie’s legs move slightly-- but he can’t jump.  He mumbles.

                                 STEVIE
                        ...can’t do it... 

           Suddenly, we hear Bobby’s voice in his head...

                                 BOBBY (V.O.)
                        Remember, kid.  You always have to 
                        clear your mind.  Block out every 
                        distraction.

           The kid closes his eyes and everything falls SILENT as we...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. FIERO - FLASHBACK

           Bobby drives and Stevie clings to his seatbelt. 

                                 BOBBY (V.O.)
                        ... if you’re going to be a 
                        magician, you can’t limit yourself. 
                        Real magicians have to feel free 
                        inside and out at all times. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. STAGE - PRESENT

           Stevie takes a deep breath.

                                 STEVIE
                        Okay, Daddy. I’m free.

           Bobby eyes catch Seth and Shideshi whispering backstage. SETH 
           HOLDS THE 4” BRACING PIN.

           Bobby looks up at the winch on the platform above him: THE 
           RAIL IS WOBBLING SLIGHTLY.  His eyes go wide. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Stevie!  NO!  WAIT!  DON’T!

           Too late. With eyes still closed, Stevie steps forward and--

           DIVES OFF THE PLATFORM.  In SLO-MO, his chubby little body 
           falls toward the pool, the bungee cord trailing.

           He hits the water as the cord stretches to its capacity.  

           Bobby watches with wide eyes for what feels like an eternity.

           The cord snaps back up, bringing little STEVIE up along with 
           it.  The WINCH wobbles, but holds its place.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        THANK GOD!

           The upside-down, bobbing and soaking Stevie slowly turns to 
           the judges.  His pencil is stuck through THE JACK OF HEARTS.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        YOU DID IT!

           The CROWD’s on their feet. Inferno and Nana scowl. Seth 
           represses his rage and manages a grin.

                                 CROWD
                        STE-VIE! STE-VIE! STE-VIE!

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        Ladies and Gentlemen, we have a 
                        champion: LITTLE STEVIE GLITTER!

                                 BOBBY
                        SETH DESSTINY HERE WE COME!  

                                 STEVIE
                        We did it, Daddy!

           Bobby jogs to his son, but SNAP- the WINCH finally gives way.  
           STEVIE SCREAMS AND PLUMMETS face first into the pool’s side

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. VEGAS STRIP - MOMENTS LATER

           An AMBULANCE streaks down the street.

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Bobby peeks out to see a DOCTOR coming out of Stevie’s room.

                                 BOBBY
                        How is he doing?! 

                                 DOCTOR
                        He suffered a minor concussion.  He 
                        should take it easy for a few weeks. 

                                 BOBBY
                        But - what about the show?

                                 DOCTOR
                        What about it?

                                 PENNY (O.S.)
                        Bobby?  

           Bobby turns to see Penny. Standing behind him.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Penny strokes Stevie’s head. His little eyes flutter open.

                                 STEVIE
                        Mommy...me and Daddy... magic... 
                        wondrous.

                                 PENNY
                        Shhhhh... it’s gonna be alright...

           INT. WAITING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           SLAM! Penny storms out of Stevie’s room to see Bobby sitting 
           in one of the waiting room chairs.

                                 PENNY
                        How could you do this to our son?!
                                 BOBBY
                        It wasn’t me! That asshole Desstiny--

                                 PENNY
                        Seth Desstiny didn’t drag a nine-
                        year-old boy across the country to 
                        compete in some stupid magic show.

                                 BOBBY
                        It’s not stupid. We got a real shot 
                        at kicking Desstiny’s ass.

           Penny scowls.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        ...and winning a lot of money.

                                 PENNY
                        Just curious - what were you 
                        planning on doing with that money?

                                 BOBBY
                        I’m his manager, Penny!

                                 PENNY
                        You’re his father. And you’re using 
                        him. 

                                 BOBBY
                        He wants to go on and win this 
                        thing as much as I do!

                                 PENNY
                        And then what? He grows up and 
                        becomes just like you?  You’ve 
                        already ruined my life Bobby - are 
                        you going to ruin his too?

           Bobby hangs his head.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Bobby enters quietly and sits beside Stevie. 

                                 STEVIE
                        D- Daddy... you missed it. Mommy 
                        was playing tricks on me. Sh-- she 
                        said Oprah wasn’t going to be at 
                        the contest... but, that’s a trick. 
                        Right, Daddy?... Right?

           No answer. Stevie’s eyes start to tear up.
                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                        So...so you lied about Oprah?

                                 BOBBY
                             (mumbling)
                        Yeah, kid. I did.

                                 STEVIE
                        And... about me... making Mommy 
                        better?  That was a lie too?

           Bobby can only nod, ashamed.

                                 BOBBY
                        Everything was a lie.

                                 STEVIE
                        So...we’re not...partners.

                                 BOBBY
                        Not that. I didn’t lie about that.  

           Stevie puts SOMETHING in Bobby’s hand and rolls over. 

                                 STEVIE
                        Partners don’t lie to each other.

           Reveal the SOMETHING in Bobby’s hand is-- THE RED BALL.  
           Bobby looks at it mournfully.  Then to his son, sniffling 
           quietly to himself in bed-- his back to Bobby.

                                 BOBBY
                        Alright, then. 

           Bobby walks to the door, opens it. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        G - goodbye. Stevie.

           No response. Bobby exits and SAD MUSIC fades up...

           INT. MGM GRAND - BOBBY AND STEVIE’S ROOM - DUSK

           Bobby packs as the TV plays in the background.

                                 NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)
                        The magic world was rocked today when 
                        it was announced that Little Stevie 
                        Glitter will not be competing against 
                        Seth Desstiny tomorrow night...
           INT. MGM GRAND - LOBBY

           Kip is at the front desk, talking to the CONCIERGE.

                                 CONCIERGE
                        Mr. Glitter checked out already.

                                 KIP
                        Any idea where he was headed?

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - EVENING

           Penny watches as Stevie sadly picks at his hospital food.  

                                 NEWS ANCHOR 2 (ON TELEVISION) 
                        Desstiny has decided to go through 
                        with the festivities anyway - putting 
                        on a show in Little Stevie’s honor--

           CLICK.  Stevie turns off the TV and returns to his dinner. 

           INT. HOTEL BAR - DAY

           A drunk Bobby’s slumped at the bar watching the news on TV.  
           He holds a bus ticket to ANGEL FIRE, NEW MEXICO.

                                 KIP     
                        Hey there, Bobby.

                                 BOBBY
                        What are you doing here?

                                 KIP 
                        I-- I came to see my grandson.

                                 BOBBY
                        You just missed him.  He’s gone.

                                 KIP
                        Bobby, what did you do? 

                                 BOBBY
                        I did what was best for Stevie. 
                        Congratulations. You were right. 
                        He’s better off without me.  

                                 KIP
                        No son is better off without his dad. 
                        You know that better than anyone. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Too late now. He hates me.
                                 KIP
                        It’s never too late! You’ve made 
                        some stupid mistakes. The drugs, 
                        the money, the syphilis. But I made 
                        a mistake too: I gave up on you.

           Bobby finally looks at his Dad.  

                                 KIP (CONT’D)
                        If you love your son, don’t let him 
                        go. You got to show him you love him. 

                                 BOBBY
                        How the hell would I do that?

           Bobby follows Kip’s eyes to the TV where--

                                 NEWS ANCHOR 2 (ON TELEVISION)
                        All proceeds from the festivities 
                        will go to a charity in Stevie’s 
                        honor. What brought that about?

           CUT TO a smiling Seth Desstiny on TV. 

                                 SETH DESSTINY (ON TELEVISION)
                        Stevie is truly a special boy.   

           INSERT footage of Stevie in SLOW MOTION, that makes him 
           especially... special.  CUE sappy music.

                                 SETH DESSTINY (CONT’D)
                        A deadbeat stagefather and a mental 
                        disability that would otherwise make 
                        him useless to society. Yet, he came so 
                        far. Don’t you worry, little Stevie. 
                        You’re one of Desstiny’s kids now.

           Kip gives a steely look to Bobby. 

                                 KIP
                        I can think of one way. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Oh no, Dad. I can’t do magic again. 
                        Look at my eyes for Christ’s sake!

                                 KIP
                        Magic comes from the heart, Bobby. 
                        How long are you going to hide 
                        behind excuses? 

           Kip grabs Bobby’s hand.  
           INT. SETH DESSTINY’S LAIR - DAY

           Seth and Shideshi are doing Yoga.  Bobby bursts in the door.

                                 SETH DESSTINY
                        Gosh, Bobby-- you look terrible.

                                 BOBBY
                        You and me, Desstiny. I’m taking 
                        Stevie’s place in the challenge.

                                 SETH DESSTINY
                        Look at yourself.  We’re not even 
                        in the same league anymore. 

           Bobby gets right in Seth’s face.

                                 BOBBY
                        Seems to me that if you really ran 
                        the show, you wouldn’t be afraid of 
                        a washed-up old man like me. 

           Seth’s eyes narrow at Bobby.

           INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE SETH DESSTINY’S SUITE - MOMENTS LATER

           Bobby bursts out of the room. Kip, who was waiting, catches 
           up with him.

                                 KIP
                        Well?

                                 BOBBY
                        It’s on. I just hope we know what 
                        the hell we’re doing. 

           INT. BOBBY’S HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Bobby and Kip walk into his room only to discover...

                                 LE PETITE GERARD
                        Bobby.  Funny how we keep running 
                        into each other like zis.

           Lancome and Fleance grab them.

                                 BOBBY
                        Look... guys. I know you’re mad--

                        A prosthetic toe?  Really?

                        be killing your son, maintenant.

           Lancome COCKS his pistol.

                                 BOBBY
                        Wait! Just - just hear me out. I 
                        know you want your money back. You

           INT. BOBBY’S HOTEL ROOM - EVENING

           It’s a war room. Bobby and Kip study reams of Kip’s old notes.      

                                 BOBBY

                        But it’s Bobby Glitter who will face 
                        Desstiny. That’s right. The eighties’

                        Though no one expects much from the

                        anticipate an outrageous spectacle.

           Bobby crosses to the other side and, exhausted, he collapses.

           Kip gives a nervous Bobby a comforting pat on the back.  The

           A spotlight shines on a BEAUTIFUL STAG hopping on the stage.  

           BLAM!  A plume of smoke engulfs the deer. When the smoke 
           dissipates, the deer is gone. In its place is SETH DESSTINY.

           The CROWD GOES NUTS as Seth winks at a clearly nervous Bobby.

           Seth JUMPS in the pool and the fish ATTACK, feeding with such 
           speed we can’t even see through the vicious cavitation.

           Suddenly, Seth emerges from the feeding frenzy, unscathed. 
           The AUDIENCE APPLAUDS.  

           Seth grins smugly at Bobby.

           TWO BEAUTIFUL WOMEN, one in a RED BIKINI and the other in a 
           BLUE BIKINI, lounge on two deck chairs center stage.  

                                 BOBBY
                        Ladies, you look lovely in those 
                        bikinis, but you must be chilly.  

           Bobby does some SHOWY DANCE MOVES and accidentally ELBOWS one 
           of the Bikini Girls in the face.  The audience LAUGHS.

                                 BIKINI GIRL
                        AAHOW! MY NOSE!

                                 BOBBY
                        Sorry. Depth perception.

           He turns to Kip with a nervous expression. Kip nods to him. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                             (sotto)
                        Come on, Bobby.  You can do this.

           A trembling Bobby covers the two girls a blanket, counts to 
           three and-- yanks the blanket away: The WOMEN ARE GONE.    
           The audience lets out a SURPRISED GASP. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry!  I’d be an idiot to 
                        lose track of those two beauties.

           Bobby replaces the blanket and again YANKS IT AWAY. The girls 
           are back. But their bikinis have been SWITCHED.  

           The AUDIENCE CHEERS. Bobby sighs in relief. 

                                 KIP
                        ATTA BOY!

                        Hydrochloric Acid!  Nature’s 
                        deadliest venom. It can eat through 
                        the hide of a rhino!
           Suddenly THIRTY GALLONS OF ACID splashes down on him.  As the 
           steam from the acid clears, Seth is unharmed.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           An AUDIENCE MEMBER signs his name on a playing card and hands 
           it to Bobby who immediately shuffles the card into a deck.

           SHLICK.  With a machete, Bobby cracks open a COCONUT. Inside, 
           covered in coconut milk, is the AUTOGRAPHED CARD.  The 
           audience LOVES IT.  Some are even on their feet.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A crane lowers Seth-- in a straightjacket-- into a pit of 
           fire.  He frees himself in the nick of time.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Bobby levitates knives around Kip. He’s getting into it-- his 
           dance moves STIR THE ALREADY EXCITED CROWD even more.

           Seth lies on a bed of nails as a MUSCULAR MAN hits him in the 
           stomach with a sledge hammer.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A sweat-drenched Bobby pulls back his cape to reveal A MIGHTY 
           FALCON.  The FALCON flies above the amazed audience.

           Seth chuckles and winks at Bobby as he drapes a SHEET over 
           the wall and walks behind it.

           Silence.  Then there’s slight movement from behind the sheet. 
           We begin to make out a head pushing through.  A hand rips 
           through the sheet... and Seth bursts from behind it.  
           The wall is still ROCK SOLID.

                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                        DADDY! I SAW YOU ON TV! I SAW YOU! 

           The crowd coos as Father and Son embrace. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Look, kid. I’ve never been good at this 
                        kind of thing, but, I want to say... 
                        I’m sorry. Sorry for a lot of things. 
                        Sorry for being such a... such a...

                                 STEVIE
                        Cocksucker?

                                 BOBBY
                        Well... I was gonna say jerk.

           FROM THE STAGE - Kip looks on with pride. And claps.

           The audience joins in. They clap and cheer louder than they 
           did for Seth.  Louder than they have before.  

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Come on, let’s get out of here.

                                 STEVIE
                        What about your trick?  

                                 BOBBY
                        Stevie, I don’t give a shit if either 
                        of us ever does another trick again. 
                        We can go home and watch Oprah and 
                        play GI Joes. From now on, it’s 
                        whatever you want.

           Stevie smiles and looks on stage at Seth, scowling.

                                 STEVIE
                        I think... I wanna beat Mr. 
                        Desstiny with you, Daddy. 

           Bobby looks to Penny, who nods.  He looks back at Stevie.
                                 BOBBY
                        I think that’d be wondrous, kid.

           Bobby’s eyes desperately scan the stage.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        There’s just one problem.  Desstiny 
                        stole our trick. 

                                 KIP
                        He didn’t steal every trick.

           INT. GLITTER MAGIC BUS - MOMENTS LATER

           Kip yanks a tarp off THE GUILLOTINE.  

                                 BOBBY
                        King Louie’s Revenge? Are you crazy?

                                 KIP
                        My grandson was on to something. I 
                        think I got it working.

                                 BOBBY
                        Think?! Dad, that’s a real blade!  We 
                        couldn’tve done this twenty years ago!  

                                 KIP
                        We aren’t doing anything.  

           Kip and Bobby slowly turn to Stevie.

                                 KIP (CONT’D)
                        You two are.

                                 STEVIE 
                        Don’t be scared, Daddy.  

           Stevie takes his hand.

           EXT. MGM GRANDE - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           The GUILLOTINE stands in the center of the parking lot.  The 
           crowd and cameras now surround it-- waiting.

                                 STEVIE
                        Don’t worry, Daddy. I’ll help your eyes.     

           Bobby winks nervously at Stevie and then addresses the crowd.  
                                 BOBBY
                        Ladies and gentlemen, this is in 
                        fact a real guillotine.  

           Bobby kneels behind the guillotine and carefully places his 
           neck on the stump directly beneath the razor sharp blade.  

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Escape isn’t really my kind of thing, 
                        but tonight’s special. I have my 
                        partner here-- Little Stevie Glitter.

           Stevie glows as Bobby nods and Kip lowers a stockade over 
           Bobby’s head, BLINDFOLDS him.  

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        In a moment, my son will pull this 
                        release, which will leave me less 
                        than a second to escape these binds 
                        before the blade decapitates me. 
                             (to Stevie, quiet)
                        Ready?

                                 STEVIE
                        Yes, Daddy. Don’t lose your head.

           The CROWD CHUCKLES. Bobby nervously exhales as Stevie grabs 
           the THICK ROPE connected to the blade above.

                                 BOBBY
                        Okay.  On three. One... two... 

           Bobby grabs his son’s free hand and squeezes tight just as...

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        ...THREE!

           Stevie yanks the cord and the blade COMES DOWN.

                                 STEVIE
                        NOW!

           Bobby STRUGGLES against the shackles, but... SHLICK.  Too 
           late.  Bobby’s head comes off and lands upright in a BASKET. 

                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                        DADDY, NO!

           EVERYONE IS SPEECHLESS.

                                 ANNOUNCER

                        SOMEONE CALL 911!

                                 BOBBY (O.S.)
                        Screw 911. Anybody got an aspirin?

           Bobby’s DISEMBODIED HEAD smiles wide in the basket.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        ‘Cause I got one hell of a headache!

           The AUDIENCE GOES WILD as Stevie, in on the trick, removes 
           Bobby’s blindfold and replaces his head on his shoulders.

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        MR. BOBBY GLITTER!

           Bobby hugs Stevie and Kip. The CROWD IS ON THEIR FEET. 

                                 SETH DESSTINY
                        Big friggin’...deal...

                                 CROWD
                        GLITTER! GLITTER! GLITTER!

           The Judges hand the Announcer their decision.  SILENCE.

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        Ladies and Gentlemen! We have a 2-1

                        the match to... SETH DESSTINY!

           The crowd politely applauds.  

                                 ANNOUNCER (CONT’D)
                        Judge Rupert gives the match to... 
                        BOBBY GLITTER!

           The CROWD GOES WILD.

                                 ANNOUNCER (CONT’D)
                        And the deciding vote, Judge 
                        Shideshi gives it to... 
                             (reading card)
                        SETH DESSTINY!

           Seth SCREAMS with arms up in victory. The crowd is muted. 

                                 LONE AUDIENCE MEMBER (O.S.)
                        Glitter!

                        DESSTINY!

           But it can’t be stopped...

                                 CROWD
                        GLIT-TER! GLIT-TER! GLIT-TER! 

           Seth runs offstage covering his ears. Bobby smiles at Stevie.

                                 BOBBY
                        Hear that?! They’re cheering for you!

                                 STEVIE
                        NO DADDY! THEY’RE CHEERING FOR YOU!

                                 KIP
                        They’re cheering for both you 
                        idiots! Now take a take a bow!

           Bobby nods at Stevie. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Partners?

           Stevie takes his Dad’s hand.

                                 STEVIE
                        Partners.

           And they both bow like conquering heroes as we...

           TITLE CARD - LAS VEGAS, NINE MONTHS LATER

                                 CROWD
                        GLITTER! GLITTER! GLITTER!

           Sweat drips from Bobby’s brow.  PULL OUT to reveal we are in -

           INT. THE MANDALAY THEATRE - LAS VEGAS

           Bobby, wearing a garish version of his STORM SHADOW costume, 
           LEVITATES in front of a cheering crowd.  

           He looks across to-- STEVIE, levitating right beside him, 
           dressed in a sequined version of his Destro costume.
                                 STEVIE
                        Are you ready, Daddy?

           Bobby looks down to the LEFT WING OF THE STAGE where-- Kip 
           waits with his arm around a smiling Penny. 

                                 KIP
                        That’s my boy.

                                 PENNY
                        Mine too.

           Bobby turns to Stevie.

                                 BOBBY
                        Whaddya say we rock the cock?

                                 STEVIE
                        Okay, Daddy. One...

           They both take off their capes in unison.

                                 BOBBY
                        Two!

           Stevie and Bobby drape the capes over their heads.

                                 STEVIE AND BOBBY (O.S.)
                        THREE!

           ...and with that, they DISAPPEAR. 

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.
