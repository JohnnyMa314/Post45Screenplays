           A BLACK SCREEN.

           BAM! A loud thud.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. A DUSTY DESERT BAR - DAY

           Pulpy black and white fill the screen. We don’t know what 
           we’re looking at but as - BAM! - another thud comes, we CUT 
           OUT WIDER - BAM! - and wider - until we see, in bold black 
           typewriter ink:

           NOVEMBER 28, 1934

           BAM! Another slamming noise.

           And now we see printed on the page:

           LOS ANGELES EXAMINER

           The newspaper is in the hands of - BAM! -

           WILL KEMPT.

           Forties. Well fed. He does a good job of filling his dirt-
           stained overalls and wool coat. He sits behind a bar, reading 
           an ADVERTISEMENT FOR WOMEN’S NYLONS.

           BAM! Dust falls from the cracks in the woodbeams above him.

           In bold white, a title appears at the bottom of the screen:

           NEVADA

           Then BAM! Another damn thud. The walls creak. Sounds like 
           hammering.

           As the pounding continues, it becomes clear that the sound 
           can only be one thing: a mattress hitting the wall again and 
           again and again...

           BAM! Another thud from upstairs. Dust falls on Will’s 
           shoulders. He looks up. 

           SHREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK!

           The sound of heavy wood dragging across the floor upstairs.

           Then silence.

           The HUMPING starts again. Glasses RATTLE.
           The pounding builds to a crescendo. Then stops altogether.

           Thank God.

           A DOOR CLOSES.

           FOOTSTEPS.

           A YOUNG MAN, 18, descends the stairs. Sweaty and rosy-
           cheeked, he carries a flannel coat over his shoulder. Will 
           will call him KID.

           He approaches the bar.

                                 THE KID
                        What’s the damage?

                                 WILL
                        Hour and a half. You do the math, 
                        kid.

           The kid scrapes up fifteen bucks.

                                 WILL
                        Didn’t know if it was gonna happen 
                        there at the end.

           Will stands to collect the money.

                                 THE KID
                        You should be careful how ya talk 
                        to people.

                                 WILL
                        That right?

           The kid moves his flannel to reveal -

           A REVOLVER.

                                 WILL
                        Have a drink, kid.

           He drops a quarter on the bar and sits. Will pours him a 
           glass.

                                 THE KID
                        I don’t drink gin.

                                 WILL
                        Well, you do today.
                             (off the kid’s glare)
                        Unless you want pump water.
           The kid hesitates... slugs it back.

           That’s when he sees -

           THE MAN AT THE END OF THE BAR.

           Sitting in the shadows, his face hidden behind a brimmed hat. 
           He slumps dejectedly over a mostly-empty glass of gin.

                                 THE KID
                        What’s his problem?

                                 WILL
                        Who? Him?

                                 THE KID
                             (to the man in the 
                              shadows)
                        Hey, doc!
                             (beat)
                        Anyone home?

           The kid drains what little is left of his gin and stands. 
           Walks down the bar, to the man. Who doesn’t move. Will 
           watches, wary.

           The kid puts his fingers in front of the man’s nose -

           And SNAPS.

           The man lifts his head. Just slightly. Face still hidden 
           under that hat. He lifts the glass, downs the last of his 
           gin. Wipes his mouth. All very slow, very careful, and from a 
           man who doesn’t talk, very intimidating.

                                 THE KID
                             (to Will)
                        I’ll stay the night. I’d ask you if 
                        there’s anything doin’ round here 
                        but I don’t think I’ll partake of 
                        the town pig fuck.

           The kid lights a hand-rolled cigarette as he makes his way 
           out the door.

           It SHUTS behind him. A posted sign on the door reads:

           ORDER TO VACATE

           Will lays a five dollar bill in front of the man in the hat.

                                 WILL
                        There’s your cut.
           The man looks up. His EYES for the first time -

           They could cut glass.

           This is CLAY DERING. Late thirties, rough-looking. A drinker. 
           He’s got smarts behind his drunk eyes.

           Will thinks better of it and leaves Clay alone. And Clay 
           stumbles off the bar stool, glass still in hand -

           CRACK!

           The glass in his hand SHATTERS against the bar top.

           BLOOD FLOWS BETWEEN HIS FINGERS.

                                 WILL
                        Christ, Clay!

           Clay stands, grabs a rag off the bar. Wraps his torn hand.

                                 CLAY
                             (heading for the door)
                        Give the extra five to Annie. She 
                        earned it.

                                 WILL
                        What about your hand?

                                 CLAY
                        Don’t worry. I’ll keep it right 
                        here on the end of my arm.

           He ties off the rag -

           SLAM! The door shuts on his heels.

           Bloody shards of glass on the floor.

           EXT. STREET - LATE IN THE DAY

           A MATCH is struck -

           Clay lights a cigarette. Lets it just smolder in his mouth.

           He stands in the middle of the dirt street. The Kid stands 
           fifteen paces away, smoking. But not for long. The Kid walks 
           away to smoke alone on the side of the building.

           Clay looks toward the defunct POST OFFICE: empty.

           Toward the FIRE VALLEY MINING CO. HEADQUARTERS: in disrepair.
           The GENERAL STORE and BARBER’S across the street: closed, 
           just a Coca-Cola sign sitting by the door.

           And...

           There is a gaping hole in the nearest hillside, railwork 
           leads into it.

           An unworked mine.

                                 ANNIE (O.S.)
                        Jesus, what’d you do?

           Clay turns: ANNIE is in her late twenties, dark-haired. She’s 
           part-white, part-Navajo; got the best of both and it lends a 
           wise look to her face.

                                 CLAY
                             (re: the kid)
                        I didn’t touch ‘im.

           She approaches, looks at his bloody, bandaged hand.

                                 ANNIE
                        You’re drunk.

                                 CLAY
                        I was drunk. I lost a lot of liquor 
                        with the blood.

                                 ANNIE
                        You’re not drunk now?

                                 CLAY
                        What’d I say?

                                 ANNIE
                        You cut your hand.

                                 CLAY
                        I cut my hand... You’re a whore. 
                        Let’s not point out the obvious.

           She looks in his eyes, angry.

           He smells her, afraid to find the scent of another man.

                                 CLAY
                        How was it?

                                 ANNIE
                        He placed his hands on me in the 
                        most manly of ways. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANNIE (cont'd)
                        Ripped the stockings from my legs 
                        so I could feel his ribs sliding 
                        against my bare thighs. You can’t 
                        imagine how it felt. It was all so 
                        strange. But then, my experience 
                        with men of vigor is... lacking, at 
                        best.

           She backs up, heads to the brothel -

                                 CLAY
                        Wait.

                                 ANNIE
                        What d’you want from a fuckin’ 
                        whore?

                                 CLAY
                        You gotta dirty mouth.

                                 ANNIE
                        That’s right.

                                 CLAY
                        Lemme see it.

                                 ANNIE
                        You can see it fine from there.

                                 CLAY
                        Lemme see it...

           She walks to him, tentatively. He brings his hand gently to 
           her face. Looks at her soft lips.

                                 ANNIE
                        You got a good enough look?

           And with his thumb at the thick of her lip...

                                 CLAY
                        Don’t leave.

                                 ANNIE
                        Come with me.

           CLAY AND ANNIE ARE TWO SPECKS, CLINGING TO EACH OTHER IN A 
           VAST, UNFORGIVING NEVADA LANDSCAPE.
           EXT. THE OAK TREE - LATER - SUNSET

           The sun is barely hanging on the horizon. Annie and Clay sit, 
           clothes hastily put back on, hair messy, atop a coarse 
           blanket under a thirsty Holm Oak Tree.

           Clay is looking out at something that isn’t there.

                                 ANNIE
                        I like you sober.

           She waits for an answer that doesn’t come.

           And Annie quietly removes the LOCKET from her neck. She puts 
           it in Clay’s hand. This is hard for her.

                                 CLAY
                        I gotta see my cousin out. I’ll 
                        come to you.

           She looks in his eyes. Searching for truth in that statement. 
           And now she looks to the horizon... the line that separates 
           here from there.

           The sun slips out of sight and sinks the world into darkness.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BROTHEL - DAWN

           A JALOPY is parked at the dirt corral in front of the 
           brothel. Loaded with supplies.

           Annie sits on her trunk in the back of the truck, forces a 
           polite smile at -

           THE DRIVER (60), who hands her a blanket before walking 
           around and climbing into his seat. He starts the truck, not 
           without some complaints from the rusted engine.

           Annie watches the brothel windows for something, anything...

           But the truck crawls away in the dirt.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. DESERT - DAWN

           A male SAGE GROUSE struts through the sparse brush. One foot 
           before the other, its beak raised regally.
           EXT. DESERT - MOMENTS LATER

           Clay and Will walk through the brush. TWO DEAD SAGE GROUSE 
           swing from Will’s hands, a shotgun over his shoulder.

           He smiles at Clay.

                                 CLAY
                        What’re you smilin’ about?

                                 WILL
                        It’s nice empty, in’it?

           Clay follows Will’s gaze three hundred yards. The town.

                                 WILL
                        I gotta toss the man drives the 
                        food truck an extra five dollars 
                        just to keep him comin’ now.
                             (beat)
                        It’s a fair price.

           They walk toward town. This is their home.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. NEVADA DESERT - DAY

           We ride in the backseat of a 1930 PATROL CAR. That is to say, 
           a BLACK CHEVY.

           The driver is SHERIFF JOHN JOAD (45). A good old boy with a 
           sizeable moustache. He WHISTLES the tune of the children’s 
           song: DO YOU KNOW THE MUFFIN MAN.

           Sees an approaching JALOPY of a truck.

           It rattles past: an OLD MAN and his WIFE driving it. ANNIE 
           rides on the back with crates and blankets, next to her is a 
           hand-painted sign: COLORADO OR BUST.

           As Annie rolls by, Sheriff John’s whistle changes to a sort 
           of CAT CALL. She can’t hear it.

           His Sheriff’s badge glints in the sunlight. The town ahead...

           EXT. STREET

           Sheriff John’s CHEVY growls in, down the dirty main street.
           HONK! HOOONK! Rolls to a stop. Sheriff John squeezes out.

           EXT. OUTHOUSES - BEHIND THE BROTHEL - SAME

           The hole in the outhouse seat leads to a stinking, murky, 
           shit-laden soup somewhere below.

           GARRETT COWLY (37), a gangly, unseemly man in dirty jeans 
           stares into the depths from the open door. He has the look of 
           a starved coyote. Weak and afraid, something unsettling about 
           his lonely desperation. Not to mention his current fixation.

                                 A MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Don’t fall in.

           Garrett turns, yellow-faced. He stands before two conjoined 
           outhouses, one of them occupied. And -

           Sheriff John’s smile belongs to the Big Bad Wolf. But he 
           isn’t looking at Garrett now, he turns to -

           Will. Who’s at the wood block twenty feet from the outhouses, 
           cutting the grouse. Blood runs. Will turns, their eyes meet.

                                 SHERIFF JOHN
                        Didn’t ya hear me honkin’ my horn?

                                 WILL
                        Didn’t know that was you, John.

                                 SHERIFF JOHN
                        You got so many customers you don’t 
                        know who’s honkin’ and who’s 
                        humpin’, huh?
                             (beat)
                        Shall we?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BROTHEL - SAME

           Clay sits at a table in the back next to JACK BRYAN. 
           Thirties. Cold, tall and lean. He’s unshaven and particularly 
           dirty. A regular here. The only ‘townie’ left.

                                 JACK
                        So... you really stayin’?

                                 CLAY
                        What d’you think?
                                 JACK
                        I think maybe you need a tall 
                        drink.

                                 CLAY
                        I’ll be right here.

           Jack gets up, taking his glass with him. ON CLAY AS:

           EEEEEK... the back door opens.

           Clay lowers his face, hiding. JUST HIS EYES, as they follow 
           someone from the back door to the bar, footstep by footstep.

           And now Sheriff John stands at the far end of the bar. Will’s 
           behind it, digging into the cash box.

                                 JACK
                        How’s the sober life?

                                 SHERIFF JOHN
                        Go crawl up a cooze, Jack.

           Sheriff John looks at Clay - just a DARK FIGURE at the back 
           of the room, ducking under a hat. He stares curiously for a 
           moment. Until Will slaps something on the counter -

                                 SHERIFF JOHN
                        What’s that?

           It’s ten dollars. In singles and coins.

                                 WILL
                        I can’t help we got no customers.

                                 SHERIFF JOHN
                             (nods to Jack)
                        He looks like a customer to me. Him 
                        too.

           THE KID sits at one of the tables. A coquettish, twenty-five 
           year-old hooker, MARY, sits on his lap - playing solitaire.

                                 SHERIFF JOHN
                        How much you boys got on ya?

           Blank faces. Sheriff John lopes over to Jack, shoves a hand 
           in his jacket, rifling for money.

           He comes out with some change, keeps digging...

           Red-hot indignation on Jack’s face.
           And Sheriff John turns, his eyes meet Garrett’s for the brief 
           second before Garrett shoots his eyes downward like a 
           battered child. Sheriff John approaches.

           And Garrett pulls out his coin purse -

                                 GARRETT (CONT’D)
                        Uh... I got... fifty...

                                 THE KID
                        I don’t know what’s worse... the 
                        coward who offers up his cash or 
                        the crooked man who takes it.

                                 SHERIFF JOHN
                        What was that, little boy?
                             (walks closer)
                        Was that you askin’ for attention?

                                 THE KID
                        I don’t ask for nothin’.

           A tense moment. Clay watches from the dark.

                                 SHERIFF JOHN
                        Where’s your bills?

                                 WILL (O.S.)
                        John, I got fifteen right here.

                                 SHERIFF JOHN
                        Hold on Will. I can’t take all your 
                        profits, that wouldn’t be fair. We 
                        got a business arrangement.

           The Kid just stares in his eyes. Mary is still on his lap.

                                 SHERIFF JOHN
                        You gonna get up, girl?

           She scurries away.

                                 SHERIFF JOHN (CONT’D)
                             (to the Kid)
                        You know, solicitin’ whores ain’t 
                        looked upon too kindly in Lincoln 
                        County. We gotta lotta workers on 
                        that dam we’re tryin’ to keep 
                        wholesome. And I look at you, I see 
                        a corruptor.
                             (beat)
                        So, we can do this one of two ways.
           The kid sees Sheriff John’s gun, worn at the hip. And we can 
           see just the butt of THE KID’S GUN in his inside breast 
           pocket, asking to be taken out. But the kid opens his jacket, 
           hiding the gun as he does... humiliated. Sheriff John shoves 
           a hand in the kid’s pocket, comes out with a HANDFUL OF CASH. 
           More than we, or Sheriff John, expected.

                                 SHERIFF JOHN
                        Well, what’s this? What you doin’ 
                        with all this money? Seems like a 
                        burden, dunn it?

           He tosses a bill back to the kid for the ride home.

           And turns -

           Clay can’t hide his eyes quickly enough. He’s just a hat and 
           slumped shoulders now, but still... it’s too late.

           The air goes stale. These men go back a long way. Sheriff 
           John didn’t notice him before, but now, not even seeing his 
           face... he knows the man in the hat. And it’s been a while.

           He approaches. Stops right in front of the table.

                                 SHERIFF JOHN
                        Howdy, Clay.

           He sees the bandage wrapped around Clay’s fist. Like he’s 
           been in a fight. Clay’s eyes are burning a hole in the table.

                                 SHERIFF JOHN
                        Startin’ trouble again?

           No answer. Sheriff John kneels a bit to look in Clay’s eyes.

                                 SHERIFF JOHN (CONT’D)
                        I can see by that look on your 
                        face, maybe life on the outside’s 
                        startin’ to bore ya.
                             (beat)
                        Been makin’ any money since you 
                        been back? Keep your hands on the 
                        table now.

           He digs into Clay’s pockets. Clay’s eyes. Ice cold hate. 
           Rummaging... his thick hands emerge with -

           A golden LOCKET. Annie’s.

                                 SHERIFF JOHN
                        Very ladylike of you.
           He turns the locket in his hand. It catches the light. And 
           when Sheriff John sees Clay’s burning face, he smiles -

           And puts the locket in his pocket.

           Clay makes eye contact with Will. Will’s eyes say: “Please. 
           Please don’t do anything.”

           And so Clay doesn’t. Sheriff John turns -

           SARAH. Fifteen years old, a beautiful girl despite having not 
           bathed in more than a week. She’s just come down the stairs, 
           a bucket in her hand, ready to be filled. She freezes.

           Sheriff John’s yellow smile seems anything but friendly.

                                 SHERIFF JOHN (CONT’D)
                             (to Will)
                        She hookin’ yet?

                                 WILL
                        No... she’s fifteen.

                                 SHERIFF JOHN
                        Her mommy was a good one. She gonna 
                        mop up around here til she’s dried 
                        up? That’d be a waste.

           He puts a foot up on the bottom rung of the chair next to 
           him. Smiles at Sarah suggestively.

                                 SHERIFF JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Well, maybe next time, you boys 
                        don’t have enough money... I might 
                        accept other forms of payment.

           CRACK!

           Clay’s foot kicks out the chair, Sheriff John goes down -

           THUD! His chin hits the table, sickening, lip splitting 
           blood.

           He’s on the ground now, hyperventilating, red-black blood 
           covering his mouth, looking up in Clay’s eyes -

           He pulls his REVOLVER on Clay.

           Everyone freezes.

                                 CLAY
                        Are you gonna shoot me, John?
           DEAD SILENCE falls on the room at the sound of Clay’s voice.

           Sheriff John looks around the room. The Kid, Jack, Will all 
           watching him for his next move. He’s shaking.

           Sheriff John keeps close to the wall, his gun on Clay.

                                 SHERIFF JOHN
                        I ain’t gonna shoot you. Get up.

           Clay obliges. Just stands there. Still.

           Sheriff John fumbles a pair of handcuffs from his belt. He 
           tosses them toward Clay.

           They THUD to the ground.

                                 SHERIFF JOHN
                        Put ‘em on.

                                 CLAY
                        I can’t do that.

                                 SHERIFF JOHN
                        PUT ‘EM ON!

           Clay still won’t budge -

           So Sheriff John points the revolver at MARY, who’s scared, 
           back pressed up against the wall by the Kid.

           Sheriff John cocks the hammer on his pistol. Mary is 
           terrified, Sheriff John’s finger tenses at the trigger...

           Clay, still.

           Sheriff John walks up to Mary, presses the gun to her temple.

                                 SHERIFF JOHN
                        Come here.

           His finger. The trigger. Blood sliding down his lip and over 
           his chin. Mary’s CRYING. SHE’S ABOUT TO DIE.

           She starts to piss herself.

           And Clay looks soft for the first time...

           Clay picks up the handcuffs, starts putting them on.
           EXT. STREET

           Sheriff John leads Clay down the porch steps. Constantly 
           looking over his shoulder.

           They walk briskly to the car. Sheriff John opens the back 
           door of the Chevy - pushing Clay in.

           INT. SHERIFF JOHN’S CAR

           Sheriff John gets in. Regaining his confidence...

           He starts humming as he starts the car:

           Do you know the muffin man, the muffin man, the muffin man; 
           Do you know the muffin man who lives on Drury -

           BANG!

           BLOOD AND TISSUE EXPLODE out the side of Sheriff John’s head.

           Clay ducks. Looks up -

           The driver’s side window is shattered. Sheriff John is 
           slumped over, making a faint gurgling sound.

           Through the window: THE KID is at the bottom of the steps, 
           holding his REVOLVER.

           Will hurries out of the door. Garrett right behind him.

           The kid walks quickly to the car -

           BANG! Shoots Sheriff John again.

           Reaches through the shattered window, and pulls his cash out 
           of Sheriff John’s pocket.

           The men just watch in horror.

           The kid tosses the handcuff keys to Clay in the backseat.

           Clay fumbles, undoes a handcuff. Looks at Sheriff John: dead. 
           He gets out of the car. Looks at the kid in disbelief.

                                 THE KID
                             (re: the sheriff)
                        Fuckin’ coward. Fuckin’...

           The kid is running high on emotion, kicks the car door shut.
           INT. OUTHOUSE - SAME

           It’s dark in the outhouse. Just quick breathing. The door 
           opens, letting in the blinding light -

           It’s A DAM WORKER (late 20s), taking a shit, dirty jeans 
           around his ankles. He slowly gets up, from here he can see -

           EXT. STREET

           The kid is counting cash, hands some to Will -

                                 THE KID
                        What he take from ya? Ten?

           THE SOUND OF RUNNING FOOTSTEPS ON DIRT. The kid turns.

           The dam worker is running from the outhouse to -

           A dirty BLACK FORD COUPE parked by the post office. The kid’s 
           eyes follow as the man hops in, starts turning the engine -

           The kid hurries over.

           BANG! He fires.

           VROOOOOM! The car finally reverses -

           BANG! Another shot - the rear window shatters.

           K-VROOOOM! And the car tears off, chewing dirt. Driving 
           erratically. The kid, reloading quickly. BANG! The kid fires 
           again. No luck.

           The car is fast becoming a speck on the horizon.

                                 WILL
                        Jesus Christ, kid.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - BOULDER CITY, NV - NIGHT

           TOM PICKETT, 39, in a weathered brown coat and dark hat, is 
           sunken into a Chinese restaurant booth. Alone.

           He’s stuffing chop suey in his mouth as he looks across the 
           restaurant at -
           FOUR BOULDER DAM WORKERS, scarfing cheap Chinese in their 
           still dirty jeans and work shirts. Hungry from a long day.

           Tom regards the page two newspaper article in front of him:

           MORE IMMIGRANTS NO JOBS.

                                 A MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Mr. Pickett?

           Tom looks up at a twenty-something man in a mid-priced suit, 
           looks like a politician. He’s Governor Griswold’s AIDE.

                                 THE AIDE
                             (extending his hand)
                        Daniel Lewis.

           Tom shakes his hand without looking up from his chop suey.

                                 TOM
                        I’ve been here an hour.

                                 THE AIDE
                        I know, I’m sorry. Unexpected 
                        incident at city hall.

                        Somebody get a new haircut?

                                 THE AIDE
                             (sitting)
                        A sheriff was shot.

                                 TOM
                        No kidding?

                                 THE AIDE
                        No, I’m afraid not. A man was 
                        killed in Fire Valley. Tried to 
                        shoot the dam worker who saw it, 
                        too.

                                 TOM
                        Fire Valley? This really is the 
                        West, huh?
                             (taking off his hat)
                        Is Griswold gonna keep giving me 
                        the brush off and send his friends 
                        to meet me or can I get home to see 
                        my wife before my skin dries out?

           The CHINESE WAITER puts a menu on the table for the aide.
                                 THE AIDE
                        Thank you.

           The aide looks over the menu, consciously taking his time.

                                 THE AIDE (CONT’D)
                        Strange the paper didn’t schedule 
                        an interview before sending you all 
                        the way out here. How’d they know 
                        you’d get one?

           Tom puts his fork down. This will be a polite little fight.

                                 THE AIDE
                        Slow news week in Hollywood?

                                 TOM
                        Something like that. Look, I’m just 
                        here to ask some questions about 
                        the dam and what the extra 
                        electricty means for your average 
                        fifth grade graduate Californian. 
                        It’ll be quick and painless. And 
                        then we’ll both be out of each 
                        other’s hair.

                                 THE AIDE
                        Well, the Governor’s a very busy 
                        man.
                             (flips over the menu)
                        He returns to Carson Friday.

                                 TOM
                        That’s wonderful.

                                 THE AIDE
                        I could schedule an interview 
                        tomorrow, provided it’s after he’s 
                        returned from his visit to the dam 
                        and before city hall closes. It’s a 
                        small window of opportunity.

                                 TOM
                        When would that be, if you had to 
                        guess?

                                 THE AIDE
                        Mmm, it’s hard to guess.

           Tom just looks at the aide, waiting.

                                 THE AIDE (CONT’D)
                        Five o’clock?
                                 TOM
                        Five. I’ll be there.

           Tom puts his hat on. Stuffs the newspaper in his coat.

                                 THE AIDE
                        What’s that you had?

                                 TOM
                        Chop suey.

                                 THE AIDE
                        Looks messy.

                                 TOM
                             (standing)
                        It’s yours.

           He walks out.

           EXT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - STREET

           Tom exits onto an empty street. It’s nine o’clock. The town 
           is tiny, quiet. Dead. Not Tom’s pace at all.

           He sees a BOTTLE on the sidewalk, kicks it hard -

           It SMASHES just shy of a big expensive-looking yellow and 
           black car parked at the curb. He begins to walk -

           An OLD WOMAN stands in the way - she’s seen him all along.

           Tom smiles politely, clutches his coat closed against the 
           cold and walks toward a SMALL INN across the street.

           INT. BROTHEL - NIGHT

           The dim amber of oil light fills the bar. Clay, Jack, Will 
           and Garrett sit around a table, hands folded.

           The Kid sits at a bar stool, facing the others, gun in hand.

                                 WILL
                             (to the Kid)
                        How’d you get here if you got no 
                        car?

           As Will speaks, Garrett watches him nervously.
                                 THE KID
                        I don’t think it’s any of your 
                        business how I got here or where I 
                        been or where I’m goin’.

                                 WILL
                        Jesus Christ. Why’d ya shoot ‘im? 
                        You got rocks in your head?

                                 THE KID
                             (points the gun)
                        Would you like ta go where he went? 
                        Just sit pretty, fat man.

           Quiet.

                                 JACK
                        John was a son of a bitch... I was 
                        beginning to entertain the thought.

           Jack looks at the kid. Everyone looks at Jack, it’s a 
           violation, talking about the recently deceased so vulgarly.

                                 WILL
                        I wasn’t.

                                 CLAY
                        Kid.
                             (the kid turns)
                        Take his car. Take the money. No 
                        one knows your name.

                                 THE KID
                        How’m I supposed to take his car I 
                        ain’t never drove one before?

                                 CLAY
                        We’ll teach you.

                                 THE KID
                             (suspicious)
                        Yeah... that’s funny, isn’t it. 
                        You’ll teach me. Next thing I know 
                        you got me speedin’ at a brick 
                        wall.

                                 WILL
                        Jesus, kid.

                                 THE KID
                             (genuine)
                        You shouldn’t take the lord’s name 
                        in vain.
           Clay and Will share a look. This kid’s nuts. The Kid stands 
           up, walks to the door and looks out.

                                 THE KID
                        You live in a real shithole, you 
                        know that? Ain’t a single damn 
                        light in town. You’d think nobody 
                        lives here.

           The Kid looks at the four men in front of him. Something on 
           their faces has him suddenly feeling alone, suddenly nervous.

           He’s beginning to get the sense that he’s stranded here.

                                 THE KID
                        Where is everyone?

           Nobody answers him.

                                 THE KID (CONT’D)
                        What’s’a matter, you all shy? I 
                        said where is everyone?

                                 CLAY
                        Do you know how to read?

                                 THE KID
                        What’s that supposed to mean?

                                 CLAY
                        See that sign? On the door.

           The Kid squints at the “ORDER TO VACATE” sign.

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        You know what it says? It says 
                        you’re not standing in a bar. It 
                        says you’re standing at the bottom 
                        of a lake. The government bought up 
                        this town and paid two-hundred 
                        dollars to anyone who’d take it for 
                        givin’ up their homes. That’s how 
                        come no one lives here. Cause’a 
                        Boulder dam. They’re gonna fill 
                        this valley with water.
                             (beat)
                        We’re alone. And you’re stuck here 
                        unless you wanna start walkin’. Or 
                        unless you wanna learn to drive.

           The kid’s eyes narrow. Still not trusting. He steps back and 
           settles onto his bar stool. Gun pointing, as always, from his 
           hip. Will lets out a sigh. There’s no talking sense to him.
                                 GARRETT
                        It’s snowin’.

           They all look outside. A light snow flurry descends at the 
           edge of the light’s reach.

                                 WILL
                        We should move him. It looks bad if 
                        they come and he’s still laying out 
                        there with his teeth on the seat.

           EXT. STREET

           A light dusting of snow covers Sheriff John’s Chevy. Will and 
           Clay approach the dark shape in the driver’s seat. The kid 
           watches from the amber-lit bar inside.

           They open the car door.

           Dried blood everywhere.

           EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Clay and Will drag the heavy body toward the porch, his feet 
           carve two jagged lines through the snow and dirt.

           They sit him upright and lean him back against the pillar -

           He BREATHES.

           They jump back.

           Clay stares at Sheriff John: nothing.

           He presses on Sheriff John’s chest -

           Another BREATH.

           Just an effect of the compression of the lungs.

                                 WILL
                        Jesus.

           Will and Clay sit in the snow. Their hearts racing.

           Will starts laughing. Clay watches him.

           Clay straightens up Sheriff John’s jacket and wipes snow from 
           his face, hat and coat. He takes the LOCKET from Sheriff 
           John’s pocket, stuffs it in his own.
                                 WILL
                        Right now, you’d be in jail and 
                        John would be sitting down to eat 
                        with his wife. Probably stuffing 
                        his face with potatoes and gravy.

                                 CLAY
                        He got married?

                                 WILL
                        Who you think made him sober up?

                                 CLAY
                        I didn’t know he had a wife.

                                 WILL
                        Lot can happen in a year.

           Will and Clay both look at the empty street. The dead town. 
           And Will can see now that Clay is looking back inside at the 
           kid, gears turning in his head.

                                 WILL
                        He’ll undo himself.

           Clay eases. Looks at Sheriff John. They sit in silence -

                                 CLAY
                        You ever seen somebody shot before?

                                 WILL
                        No.

                                 CLAY
                        Me neither.

           Will seems surprised. Clay sees the REVOLVER in Sheriff 
           John’s holster. He wants to take it, but he doesn’t even need 
           to look at Will this time to know what his response will be.

           Quiet.

                                 CLAY
                        He was an ugly son of a bitch. 
                        How’d he get a wife? I can’t keep a 
                        hooker in town.

           INT. BROTHEL - DOWNSTAIRS - LATE NIGHT

           Late now. Seems everyone is asleep in the bar.
           The kid is sitting on the stool, his eyelids heavy. They 
           start to drop shut but snap back open a bit -

           Clay is still awake. Watching the kid. Gonna be a long night.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. BROTHEL - UPSTAIRS - MORNING

           Upstairs in the brothel at dawn. Sarah is asleep in her bed.

           INT. BROTHEL - DOWNSTAIRS - SAME

           Will, Jack and Garrett are asleep at the table. An empty gin 
           bottle sits on its side.

           And the Kid is asleep too, slumped in a chair with the pistol 
           in his lap. Clay sits, eyes shut, seemingly sleeping.

           The “BARBER” sign SWINGS in the breeze across the street.

           Clay’s eyes slowly crack open...

           The sound of an APPROACHING CAR.

           EXT. STREET

           TWO BLACK ‘31 CHEVIES are slowly coasting into town.

           INT. BROTHEL - DOWNSTAIRS

           The Kid’s eyelids flutter, still groggy. He can hear the 
           crunching of dirt and rock under tires -

           And leaps to his feet and to the door.

           Garrett and Jack wake to the commotion. Will’s out cold. And 
           the Kid is at the door, pistol readied.

           The cars come to a slow stop outside, just behind Sheriff 
           John’s car.

                                 THE KID
                        Oh shit. Aw, there’s a lot of ‘em.

           And now Will’s awake.
           EXT. STREET

           The policemen are hesitant to approach the porch...

           Where Sheriff John sits propped up like an omen, like a head 
           on a stake.

           INT. BROTHEL

           The Kid is pacing now, shaking. He has NO PLAN.

           He hurries to the back door, looking like a boy who’s about 
           to pee his pants. He looks outside.

           Just desert and rock. Nowhere to run.

           The Kid hurries back to the front of the brothel and looks 
           out at the police:

           One stands out amidst the group, he is the DEPUTY.

           EXT. STREET

           The Deputy holds his gun at the ready and watches the brothel 
           windows for movement.

           The door to the brothel cracks open.

           The police flinch collectively. Impossible to see inside.

           The “BARBER” SIGN swings.

           INT. BROTHEL

           A GIN BOTTLE lies on its side by a loose pile of cards on 
           Garrett’s table. It rolls back and forth, perilously close to 
           the edge.

           The Kid points his gun at Clay. Motions for him to walk over.

           He nods toward the Sheriff’s gun on the chair.

                                 THE KID
                        Pick it up.

           Clay hesitates, but with that gun pointed at his head...
                                 THE KID
                        Hold on! I’m comin’ out!
                             (to Clay)
                        Go on.

           Clay picks up the Sheriff’s gun. Almost tempted to point it 
           at the Kid, but instead, he follows the Kid’s direction.

           Toward the door. The Kid hides to the side as he pushes the 
           door open a bit for Clay, keeps the gun pointed at the back 
           of his head.

                                 THE KID
                        Don’t say nothin’, don’t be wise.

           I/E. BROTHEL/STREET

           Clay is in the doorway, exposed before five police officers 
           with pistols drawn.

                                 DEPUTY
                        Throw down your gun!

           Clay takes a tentative step forward, drops the gun. THUD.

                                 DEPUTY
                        Now come down here, easy.

           What follows unfolds excruciatingly slowly:

           The breeze stops.

           Clay descends the first few steps, wood creaking, while -

           INT. INSIDE

           The gin bottle wobbles on it’s side, split seconds from 
           rolling off the table with a crash.

           The Kid changes his aim from Clay’s back, to the Deputy 
           waiting 20 paces away from him. Will stares at the Kid.

           EXT. STREET

           The police wait, fingers itching at triggers. An OFFICER 
           takes a step forward, handcuffs in hand, waiting for Clay. He 
           looks excited to get Clay locked up, ready to rough him up.

           The Deputy looks in Clay’s eyes. He has a funny feeling.
           He looks at the doorway -

           INT. INSIDE

           The Kid tries to control his breathing.

           The gin bottle rolls slightly, hangs at the edge...

           Slowing as it nears the precipice...

           But, slips -

           SMASH!

           OUTSIDE

           BANG!

           A police officer FIRES.

           WOOD SPLINTERS -

           CLAY FALLS and rolls off the side of the stairs -

           THUMP. Into the dirt.

           INSIDE

           Quiet.

           Will, Garrett and Jack try to peek out the window. They can’t 
           see much.

           The Kid leans against the door, scared, building up courage -

           Then, points the gun out the opening and -

           FIRES blindly at the police -

           BANG! BANG! BANG!

           OUTSIDE

           The officers start FIRING at the building -

           CLOSE on Clay. He’s alive, face in the dirt and the wind 
           knocked out of him from hitting the deck.

           BANG - BANG - BANG - BANG!
           Clay holds onto the ground for dear life while a barrage of 
           deafening bullets crack through the air -

           INSIDE THE STATION

           The Kid runs across to the window and points the gun outside -

           FIRES three times -

           A police officer crumples to the ground.

           The Kid starts reloading frantically. Glass shatters nearby, 
           cutting his forearm. Will takes the opportunity:

                                 WILL
                        HOLD UP! EASY!

           OUTSIDE - CLAY’S LOOKING UP NOW

           The firing lets up a brief moment.

           Will stands, hands raised...

           Meanwhile, the Kid loads the last bullet in his gun, sneaks 
           an eye by the corner of the window, aiming, a cop sees him -

           BANG - BANG - BANG -

           The barrage is back and the cops are shooting and one of them 
           sees Will moving, so he aims - BANG!

           Will’s stomach ERUPTS BLOOD. He falls and -

           OUTSIDE

           Clay hears a loud THUD on the floorboards above him.

           He can see the GUN on the porch. And now the cop twenty feet 
           away is looking right at him.

           INSIDE

           The Kid, blasting all six rounds through the shattered glass.

           Jack and Garrett, looking at Will bleeding over there -
           BACK OUTSIDE

           The OFFICER watching Clay scurry up the porch snaps out of it 
           and - FIRES. Clay clamors for the gun he dropped.

           IN THE BROTHEL

           Now Jack’s up and moving. He runs to the back of the room, 
           leaving Garrett, who is ducking behind the table -

           Jack’s going for the hunting rifle behind the bar.

                                 GARRETT
                        I can shoot it.

           Jack ignores him, takes the rifle, rushes to the window.

           Looks down at Will, who’s hyperventilating. And aims outside.

           OUTSIDE -

           Clay grabs the pistol and turns around to see the officer 
           pointing a gun right at him -

           BANG! The officer misses.

           Clay steels himself, and in that moment, his heart hardens.

           He pulls the trigger:

           BANG!

           IN THE BROTHEL

           Jack raises the rifle and -

           BANG!

           He misses, hitting the front tire on Sheriff John’s car -

           PSISSSSS - It deflates.

           BANG! BANG! BANG! The four cops still standing start shooting 
           in Jack’s direction.

           Jack hides, then aims again - BANG!

           An officer’s head BURSTS RED.
           Two of the officers quickly run behind the cars for cover.

                                 THE KID
                             (to Jack)
                        Get ‘em all! Don’t let ‘em get 
                        away!

           The Kid runs out the door and -

           BANG! The Kid falls. Shot in the head. Dead in an instant.

           THE PORCH

           The pillar nearest Clay splinters wood across his field of 
           vision.

           Clay squints, splinters flying at his eyes. He fires back. 
           Eerily confident and determined.

           IN ONE OF THE CARS

           The DEPUTY slides into the car, shuts the door.

           K-BANG! The door handle is blown off by a bullet coming 
           through the other side.

           He starts the engine and drives as fast as he can.

           IN THE BROTHEL

           Jack can’t get the bolt action to work, it’s jammed -

           He sees the car pulling away. He forces the bolt -

           CHIK-CHIK.

           He leans back to the side of the window and takes aim -

           OUTSIDE

           The last police officer, abandoned, aims a rifle at Clay from 
           behind a car.

           Clay lowers his gun. His eyes say DON’T SHOOT.

           The officer hesitates, trains his rifle on Clay -

           Clay raises the pistol, squeezes the trigger:
           CLICK.

           The officer squeezes his:

           CLICK.

           No more bullets for him either.

           The officer reaches into his coat -

           IN THE BROTHEL

           Jack slides a bullet into the rifle, tries sliding the bolt 
           action. No luck, it’s stuck again.

           Frustrated, he hurries away from the window -

           OUTSIDE

           Clay is staring helpless at -

           The officer, who is searching his coat for bullets - shaking, 
           trying to get them out in time.

           Clay sees Jack, coming through the door twenty feet away, a 
           rifle in his hands.

           Jack -

           Storming toward the officer, trying to slide the bolt back.

           Getting closer -

           The officer, sliding a bullet into the chamber -

           Jack -

           CHIK-CHIK, the bolt works -

           The officer turns, raising the loaded rifle at Jack’s face -

           BANG!

           THE OFFICER DROPS. DEAD WEIGHT.

           He’s still trying to breathe.

           Jack looks down the road:

           The DEPUTY’s car tearing away. He slides another bullet into 
           the rifle, tries sliding the bolt.
           STUCK. Tries again. STUCK.

           He drops the rifle to his side.

           It’s quiet...

           The “BARBER” sign swings in the chill breeze. The FLAG 
           FLUTTERS on the Post Office.

           Inside, Garrett stands up slowly, shaken.

           Clay looks across the porch at...

           -

           The Kid. BLOOD EVERYWHERE.

           INT. BROTHEL - MOMENTS LATER

           Will breathes erratically, clutching his gut. Clay, Jack and 
           Garrett stand above him, overwhelmed.

           Until Clay finally kneels, pulls up Will’s shirt.

                                 WILL
                        AGGHH!

           Clay sees the wound. Will’s words are barely comprehensible, 
           desperate, the cry of a boy who wants his mommy:

                                 WILL
                        I’m gonna die.

           Clay looks on helplessly, no idea what to do. He looks up -

           SARAH. She’s at the bottom of the stairs. Staring.

                                 CLAY
                        Get a cloth.

           He pulls a DIRTY SERRATED KNIFE off the bar.

                                 CLAY
                             (to Will)
                        Is the metal in there?

           Will nods, hyperventilating.

                                 JACK
                             (re: the knife)
                        What are you gonna do with that?
                                 WILL
                        AGGHH! It hurts! It - ffff hurts!

                                 CLAY
                             (to Garrett)
                        Do we gotta get the bullet out?

           Garrett is just staring.

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        Garrett!?

                                 GARRETT
                        I dunno.

                                 CLAY
                        I thought you were in the war!

                                 GARRETT
                        Yeah! I wasn’t no doctor!

                                 WILL
                        I’m bleeding! Look how much I’m 
                        bleeding.

           Clay pulls up Will’s shirt even more. He turns to take the 
           mostly clean rag from Sarah.

           He dabs at Will’s wound until he can see -

           Torn flesh, fresh blood. Impossible to see much in there. He 
           holds the cloth down until it soaks with blood. Hopeless.

                                 WILL
                             (crying)
                        I’m gonna die. I can’t breathe...

                                 JACK
                        Shut up, Will, goddammit.

           And Clay SNAPS, grabbing at Jack - Garrett pushes him back.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        We need to get in one of them cars! 
                        They’re comin’ back. The kid shot 
                        John how long’d it take? How long’d 
                        it take!? You don’t remember? 
                        Less’n a day. Look at ‘im now.

           THE KID’S BODY. In a pool of blood.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        People hanged for less.
                                 WILL
                        Clay?

                                 JACK
                        We gotta get ‘im to a doctor.

           A long silence.

                                 WILL
                        Clay?

           EXT. THE PORCH - LATER

           Clay, Garrett and Jack CARRY WILL. It’s a great effort 
           getting Will down the stairs and toward the car.

                                 GARRETT
                             (quietly)
                        Clay.

           Clay turns, sees what Garrett is looking at:

           A police officer - THE SURVIVOR - sits propped up against the 
           patrol car. He has a gun at his hip, pointed at them.

           The survivor is pale, out of breath, blood-caked and sitting 
           in the dirt. Even the rising and falling of his chest is a 
           labor. But all he has to do is pull the trigger.

                                 CLAY
                        Are you alright?

           The survivor doesn’t seem too capable of speech. Just the 
           stare of a dying dog.

                                 CLAY
                        You need water?

           Clay is sweating under Will’s weight.

           EXT. BEHIND THE BROTHEL

           Sarah tries her hardest to pump water from the hand-pump well 
           behind the brothel.

           The water trickles into a wooden bucket. Which Sarah carries 
           away.
           EXT. IN FRONT OF THE BROTHEL - CONTINUOUS

           Sarah comes around the brothel carrying the bucket, some 
           water sloshing out as she does.

           She approaches the survivor carefully, sets the bucket down 
           beside him.

           I/E. SHERIFF JOHN’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Will is in the back of Sheriff John’s car, more blood than 
           before. He watches Sarah and the survivor outside while -

           Jack is sitting in the driver’s seat, hand on the starter. 
           They’ve all been waiting here for a while.

           Garrett has his head under the hood, tinkering with the 
           engine.

           EXT. SHERIFF JOHN’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Clay is leaning against the car outside. The rifle’s at his 
           side. He watches Sarah help the survivor to drink.

           He looks at the brothel. The second floor window: Mary. She 
           looks at him, afraid... and closes the blinds, disappearing.

           Clay looks in the car, at Will, sprawled on the seat:

                                 CLAY
                        You want water?

           Will shakes his head ‘no’.

                                 CLAY
                        We’re gonna get you fixed. Alright? 
                        It won’t be long.

           Will nods.

                                 GARRETT (O.S.)
                        I think I got ‘er! Try her!

           Jack twists the starter.

           CLICK - CLICK - CLICK. No good.

                                 GARRETT
                        Put your foot on the pedal.
           Jack tries again: CHIK-CHIK-VROOOOOOOMMMMMM...

           The Chevy sputters to life. Garret drops the hood down with a 
           CLANG. The survivor looks up, water dribbling down his chin.

                                 JACK
                        Get in!

           Garrett hurries around the car, hops in the front with Jack, 
           almost excited.

           Clay moves slowly, dragging the rifle with him. He looks 
           around at his town.

           The post office. Abandoned.

           The general store. Abandoned.

           The mine. Abandoned.

           An entire town. Abandoned.

           And there’s Sarah. Sitting alone on the brothel porch.

           About to be abandoned too.

           Clay opens the back door of the Chevy.

           Sarah stands, watches as he drops the rifle in the backseat 
           and climbs in.

           The engine RUMBLES WEAKLY as Jack pushes the accelerator. The 
           flat tire under the driver’s seat flubbing in the dirt - K-
           THUMP, K-THUMP, K-THUMP...

           The Chevy steers around the Sheriff’s car, and continues 
           away. Headed into oblivion.

           But...

           Just as it seems we’re about to cut away -

           The car turns, circles back.

           K-THUMP, K-THUMP, K-THUMP...

           Coming closer, it pulls to a stop between Sarah and the 
           survivor.

           Clay points the rifle out the window at the survivor. Garrett 
           hops out of the front seat, runs around to the survivor, and 
           carefully plucks his pistol from the ground.
           He hurries back to the car, which idles sickly with a 
           constant, wheezing rumble.

           Clay looks out at Sarah, she is all puppy dog eyes.

                                 WILL
                             (wincing)
                        I can’t leave her. I’m all she’s 
                        got. Been ten years since her mommy 
                        left, Clay.

           Jack and Garrett look to Clay for a decision.

                                 CLAY
                             (to Garrett)
                        Get the girl.

                                 JACK
                             (out the window at Sarah)
                        Kid!

           Sarah gives the old “who, me?” look.

           She makes her way down the steps, a little too slowly.

           HONK! Jack lays on the horn and she picks up her step as 
           Garrett gets out to let her in the middle of the front seat.

           With the door closed, and Sarah sandwiched snugly between 
           Jack and Garrett, the car sputters to speed again.

           K-THUMP, K-Thump, k-thump...

           Fading away until -

           The survivor is all alone. Just him, a Chevy, four bodies and 
           a bucket of water.

           And the sound of that BARBER’s sign squeaking.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BOULDER CITY - “CITY HALL” - NIGHT

           Tom Pickett sits in the hallway of Boulder City Hall. 
           Makeshift, dim, messy. A hastily assembled building to 
           administer the large amount of workers at Boulder Dam.

           Tom checks his watch:

           5:45
           Down the hall, FOUR MEN come walking into the building.

           They walk quickly. Whatever they’re here for, it’s important. 
           Their boots echo down the long hallway, an approaching storm.

           They have REVOLVERS, all worn in a holster at the hip. All 
           dressed in shades of black. POLICE.

           One of them looks particularly dirty, tired and roughed up. 
           He is the deputy, and he’s just been to hell and back.

           They stop right in front of Tom, right in front of the office 
           he’s waiting to be called into.

           Tom sits up as -

           KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK. They take their hats off respectfully.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Come in.

           The men open the door and walk in. Tom gets a fleeting 
           glimpse of GOVERNOR GRISWOLD at the desk inside.

           The DOOR CLOSES. Tom is alone in the hall again.

           He stands up. Leans against the office door and listens...

           And listens...

           INT. BOULDER CITY  - “CITY HALL” - MOMENTS LATER

           Governor Griswold’s Aide exits the office, looking for Tom.

           But Tom is gone. The seat outside the office is empty.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BOULDER CITY POLICE STATION - NIGHT

           Tom talks quickly into a metered phone outside the tiny 
           police station, he’s practically out of breath.

           A SHOT-UP BLACK ‘31 CHEVY is parked behind him.

                                 VOICE (PHONE)
                             (just picking up)
                        Yeah.

                                 TOM
                        Frank.
                                 VOICE (PHONE)
                        Tom?

                                 TOM
                        Seven cops killed in Lincoln 
                        County.

                                 VOICE (PHONE)
                        What?

                                 TOM
                        Seven cops killed in Lincoln 
                        County.

           Silence on the other end.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Frank?

                                 VOICE (PHONE)
                        That’s great.

                                 TOM
                        Do you want a photograph?

                                 VOICE (PHONE)
                        What sort of question is that?

                                 TOM
                        Do you want an exclusive, Frank? Or 
                        should I go to someone else?

           Silence again.

                                 VOICE (PHONE)
                        You work for us.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        I want that column we talked about. 
                        I want my own. I don’t wanna write 
                        filler copy anymore. Frank? I’m 
                        gonna get you an exclusive, Frank.

                       VOICE (PHONE)
           You’re getting a big head -
                                                           TOM
                                              You remember Dillinger? How 
                                              many papers that son of a 
                                              bitch sold?

                                 VOICE (PHONE)
                        You remember Gomez?

                                 TOM
                        Gomez?
                                 VOICE (PHONE)
                        Victor Gomez. He killed two cops in 
                        Recita last March. They caught him 
                        the next morning. Don’t work 
                        yourself up. This could be over 
                        before it starts and then you’re 
                        back here on obituaries. And I 
                        won’t forget this conversation.

           CLICK.

           Tom drops the phone back on the hook.

           I/E. THE CHEVY - PARKED/ROADSIDE - NIGHT

           It’s the dead of night.

           Blood covers Will from chest to knees in the backseat, it’s 
           slick on the leather seats. The car is parked, Will’s awake 
           but exhausted. Clay watches him from across the back seat.

           Sarah is asleep in the front seat. Jack’s gone somewhere.

           And Garrett is walking toward the car from where he just took 
           a piss outside.

                                 GARRETT
                        Clay. Can we talk?

                                 CLAY
                        What is it?

                                 GARRETT
                        Can you...

           Clay gets up out of the backseat as if it’s a burden.

           EXT. ROADSIDE - CONTINUOUS

           Clay and Garrett talk in the dark.

                                 GARRETT
                        I’m real tired...
                             (beat)
                        Are you worried about her? You 
                        think she’s scared? I would be, I 
                        mean if I was a girl, y’know.

                                 CLAY
                        I guess I would be too.
                                 GARRETT
                        Yeah... you think anyone’s lookin’ 
                        for us?

           Garrett seems uncommonly shaky, he’s nervous, red-faced.

                                 CLAY
                        I’d say there’s a slight chance. 
                        Let’s get Will fixed. Then we’ll 
                        fix the rest.

                                 GARRETT
                        I didn’t kill no one. If we got 
                        arrested, I mean, they wouldn’t 
                        hang me.

           A silence. Clay looks in Garrett’s eyes, trying to find his 
           exact meaning, suspicious.

                                 GARRETT (CONT’D)
                        Right?

                                 CLAY
                        No... You didn’t kill no one.

           Someone WHISTLES LOUDLY in the distance. Clay looks at the 
           road, and follows it to the horizon:

           HEADLIGHTS APPROACHING.

           He seems reluctant before picking up the rifle.

           EXT. THE ROAD - SAME

           Jack is standing by the road, playing the part of a 
           hitchhiker or a distressed motorist. Clay approaches, but 
           stays in the dark. Garrett falls back.

           The car gets nearer, the sound replacing the silence. The 
           headlights cast an amber glow over Jack.

           Jack waves his hands, the car pulls over... A nice-enough 
           looking SALESMAN and his seven year-old SON.

                                 SALESMAN
                        Are you alright?

           Jack is quiet, which puts the salesman a bit on edge.

                                 SALESMAN (CONT’D)
                        Where’s your vehicle?
           Clay steps forward, pointing the rifle at the salesman.

                                 SALESMAN
                             (hands up)
                        Oh dear God.

                                 CLAY
                        Get out of the car, please.

           Clay makes eye contact with the boy, who looks dumbstruck. 
           Jack hurries around, pulling the salesman out -

                                 JACK
                        C’mon.

                                 SALESMAN
                        Don’t shoot, please, my boy!

                                 CLAY
                        We’re not gonna shoot. Hey!

           The salesman is on his knees, his face in the dirt, drooling.

                                 SALESMAN
                        Please!

                                 CLAY
                        Jack!
                             (Jack lets go)
                        Hey! Sir! Stand up!

                                 SALESMAN
                        No, no, no, no...

           Clay puts down his rifle and puts a hand on the salesman’s 
           shoulder.

                                 CLAY
                        Get up now, come on, it’s alright. 
                        Come on.

           He helps the man to his feet.

                                 CLAY
                        See? You’re alright.
                             (beat)
                        Now we just need your car. We’re in 
                        some trouble got nothing to do with 
                        you or your boy.

           The man is still silently sobbing.
                                 CLAY
                        That your son?

           The man nods.

                                 CLAY
                        Think you could ask him out?

           This lasts a while. The boy is not so much scared as frozen 
           in place, almost petulant:

                                 SALESMAN
                        George. George, come on now. Come 
                        on George. They’re not going to 
                        hurt you. George?

                                 JACK
                        George, get out of the goddamn car.

           George is startled and opens the door, stepping out gingerly.

           EXT. ROADSIDE - LATER

           Jack walks behind the salesman and his son, pointing a 
           revolver at them as they’re marched to the shot-up Chevy, 
           which we now see is all but a smoking, gasless wreck. All the 
           while, Jack shoots a cautious eye back at the road.

           Clay walks alongside them with the rifle.

           Garrett is waiting by the other car as they approach.

                                 GARRETT
                        Girl, get up.

           Sarah stirs awake and see’s the man and boy as -

           The salesman and his son see WILL in the back. Soaked with 
           blood. The boy is mesmerized by the violence. For a moment, 
           Sarah and the salesman’s son make eye contact - two kids on 
           opposite tracks. Clay pokes his head in the back:

                                 CLAY
                             (to Will)
                        Can ya move?

           Will’s response is a tired stare.

                                 CLAY
                             (to the salesman)
                        Is there a doctor ‘round here?
           The salesman just stares blankly at Will.

                                 CLAY
                             (suddenly harsh)
                        Hey. Don’t stare at him.

                                 SALESMAN
                        I -

                                 CLAY
                        That nearby?

           He nods.

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        Is there a doctor?

                                 SALESMAN
                        Yes.

                                 CLAY
                        Where?

                                 CLAY
                        A sign?

                                 SALESMAN
                        It says Lennock, it’s not far.

                                 CLAY

                        In Lennock.

                                 CLAY
                        Where’s he live in Lennock?

                                 SALESMAN
                        Church street. It’s a yellow house, 
                        with a porch.
                             (beat)
                        He’s got grandkids.
           Clay opens the driver’s side door, the salesman gets in and 
           slides across to the front passenger seat.

                                 SALESMAN
                        Georgie?

                        Get in, kid, be quiet.

           The boy gets in behind his father and Clay shuts the door. He 
           looks the salesman in the eye.

                                 CLAY
                        No hard feelin’s. My name’s Clay.

           He extends his bandaged hand to the salesman.

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        Sleep here til morning, a’right?

           The salesman shakes Clay’s hand, wary of the bloody bandage. 
           Clay moves to the back, to Will:

                                 CLAY
                        Hey cousin.

                                 WILL
                             (with difficulty)
                        Hey cousin.

           Clay, Garrett and Jack move to the back doors and open them. 
           Will falls partially out, but Jack catches him.

           They heave him out from the backseat.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN CHICAGO - FBI OFFICE - EARLY MORNING

           The second and third floors of a steel and cement building 
           serve as the Chicago field office of the Bureau of 
           Information (BOI) which only six months from now will be 
           given the immortal acronym, FBI.

           It’s a cold, gray end to November in the Windy City.

           INT. CHICAGO FBI OFFICE - SAME

           Here, the frontline war on organized crime is fought by chain-
           smoking young men in white shirts, dark coats and suspenders. 
           They work with their sleeves rolled up and their hair hastily 
           combed aside. 
           They work with less sleep than the average American, into the 
           dark hours, returning home on the last running rail cars just 
           before nine.

           These FBI AGENTS sit at desks, by telephones and telegraph 
           machines. They read and they type.

           The remnants of two day old ticker tape hang from a few pipes 
           along the ceiling. There was a celebration here last night.

           INT. AN OFFICE - CHICAGO FBI OFFICE - SAME

           An empty office seen in close-up. A desk placard reads:

           M. PURVIS

           A hand-drawn banner hangs partly out of a trash can that’s 
           filled with discarded ticker tape:

           ...NGRATULATIONS MEL!...[illegible]... NELSON!

           On the desk is the front page to the November 29, 1934 
           Chicago Herald Examiner. The headline reads:

           DYING U.S. AGENTS KILL ‘BABY FACE’ IN BATTLE!

           One of the room’s two windows is blocked by a filing cabinet.

           A DEEP GLASS FRAME sits on the cabinet. Inside is a .357 
           CALIBER REVOLVER, below the gun, a small plaque which reads:

           JOHN DILLINGER - THE BIOGRAPH, 1934

           The frame has a light accumulation of dust on its glass.

           A cigarette is still smoking in the ashtray.

           And the office is empty because...

           INT. BATHROOM - CHICAGO FBI OFFICE - SAME

           MELVIN PURVIS (31) - a slight, intelligent, southern man with 
           dark hair - washes his hands at the bathroom sink. A voice 
           comes through the bathroom door:

                                 A MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Mr. Purvis?

           Melvin looks at the door as it opens. An AGENT walks in, a 
           TELEGRAPHED PAPER in his hand.
                                 MELVIN PURVIS
                        I’m in the bathroom.

                                 AGENT
                        A wire from Nevada, they said it 
                        was for you.

                                 MELVIN PURVIS
                        What is it?

                                 AGENT
                        Six police were shot and killed in 
                        Boulder City.

           He hands the paper to Melvin.

                                 MELVIN PURVIS
                        Nevada? Do you know why they didn’t 
                        give this to San Antonio?

                                 AGENT
                        No sir. Maybe they thought it was 
                        too big for them.

           Melvin starts reading the paper.

                                 AGENT
                        Are you going out for lunch?

                                 MELVIN PURVIS
                             (re: the telegraph)
                        We don’t have a description?

                                 AGENT
                        I don’t think so.

                                 MELVIN PURVIS
                             (re: lunch)
                        Why, are you going to Franny’s?

                                 AGENT
                        Sure.

                                 MELVIN PURVIS
                        Get me a beef dip.

           Melvin finishes reading, then looks up, noticing the agent is 
           still there. He hands the paper back to the agent.

                                 MELVIN PURVIS
                        Put out a two-thousand dollar 
                        reward for information leading to 
                        an arrest.

                        radio and in the papers. See what 
                        you can find out, get a name from 
                        the badges down there.

                                 AGENT
                        Mel?

           Melvin looks at the agent, waiting for him to continue.

                                 AGENT (CONT’D)
                        Can I be on this one?

                                 MELVIN PURVIS
                        I don’t catch your meaning.

                                 AGENT
                        I started here in June, before you 
                        got Dillinger, and I was running 
                        the telegraph then. Then, we had 
                        our daughter in the fall, when you 
                        went for Pretty Boy Floyd. And 
                        Esther had complications, you know. 
                        And... I missed Baby Face, I felt 
                        like I was s’posed to be there.

                                 MELVIN PURVIS
                        You and I, both. You know two men 
                        died.

                                 AGENT
                        I knew Hollis.

                                 MELVIN PURVIS
                             (a rhetorical question)
                        Did you know his son?
                             (beat)
                        Listen, I talk straight. I don’t 
                        know the next time we’re going out 
                        for somebody, but I can tell you, 
                        it takes a certain type of man to 
                        fire a gun at another man and risk 
                        his life out of righteousness. You 
                        understand? It takes an entirely 
                        different type of man to follow a 
                        superior into the bathroom to ask 
                        for a promotion.
                             (beat)
                        Do you want to be in the newspaper? 
                        Answer me. Do you wanna be in the 
                        newspaper? I believe you want to be 
                        in the paper the way I was when we 
                        got Dillinger, is that wrong?
                                 AGENT
                        I do.

                                 MELVIN PURVIS
                        Well, I don’t trust men with 
                        ambition.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ROAD - DAWN

           A WIDE OPEN ROAD at the early blue hours. Nothing but desert.

           Until -

           A BLACK FORD comes over a hill and out of the dark.

           VROOOOM - CUT TO:

           Traveling away from us now. Quickly.

           Until it comes upon something up ahead...

           A SHOT-UP CHEVY, parked twenty yards off the road.

           The Ford slows to a stop, across the road from the Chevy.

           A quiet breeze.

           The door opens, the driver gets out:

           TOM PICKETT.

           He approaches the shot up Chevy, his feet crunching on 
           pavement, sand and rock. The sun is waking quickly.

           K-CHUNK! A rock bounces off the road and into Tom’s leg.

           As Tom grabs his shin, he sees the SALESMAN’S SON, skipping 
           out from behind the Chevy and laughing to himself.

           Tom approaches carefully, stepping between the rocks like 
           he’s crossing a narrow rope bridge.

           He sees a shape in the driver’s seat, THE SALESMAN, who’s 
           awake, looking at Tom, his shirt salt-stained from panic.

                                 TOM
                        Hello.
                             (...)
                        My name’s Tom Pickett. I’m a 
                        reporter.

                        What’s your name?

                                 SALESMAN
                        Jerome.

                                 TOM
                        Nice to meet you Jerome. Are you 
                        hurt?

                                 SALESMAN
                        They took my automobile.

                                 TOM
                             (dry, looking at the 
                              bloody shot-up car)
                        You mean this isn’t yours right 
                        here?

                                 SALESMAN
                        No sir.

                                 TOM
                        Who is they exactly, who took your 
                        car?

                                 SALESMAN
                        There was three of them. The fat 
                        one was bleeding, he was shot.

           Tom sees the dried blood covering the back seat.

                                 TOM
                        Looks like you had quite a night. 
                        You must be shaken up.

                                 SALESMAN
                        There was a little girl.

                                 TOM
                        A girl. Huh. Where’d they go?

           The salesman looks east. His son is playing among the rocks.

                                 TOM
                        That way?

                                 SALESMAN
                        I told them how to get to Lennock.

                                 TOM
                        Lennock? Where’s that?
                                 SALESMAN
                        Are you gonna follow ‘em?

                                 TOM
                        Well, I don’t know, Jerome. I’m a 
                        reporter. It’s my job to be 
                        curious, I guess.

                                 SALESMAN
                        Lennock’s just east. There’s a 
                        sign.

                                 TOM
                        What kind of sign?

                                 SALESMAN
                        It says Lennock.

                                 TOM
                        Is that your son?

                                 SALESMAN
                        That’s George.

           George is in his own world: he throws a rock at a boulder, 
           spastic and hyperactive. Not like his quiet, shaken father.

           EXT. ROADSIDE - LATER

           The salesman sits stone-faced in the driver’s seat, looking 
           at something off-screen.

           CLICK.

           Tom’s camera takes a photo from it’s wooden tripod. Tom folds 
           up the legs and puts the camera over his shoulder.

                                 TOM
                        Goodbye Jerry.

                                 JEROME
                        Where are you going?
                             (Tom’s still walking)
                        You got any water?

           Tom puts the camera in his backseat. Closes the door.

                                 TOM
                        I’m sure there’ll be someone along.

           He starts up the car and pulls away into a U-turn, leaving 
           the salesman and his son in the soon-to-be-scalding desert.
           INT. COLONIAL HOUSE - MORNING

           Will lies whimpering, bloody and pale on a doctor’s 
           examination table in a small home practice office.

           THE DOCTOR is in his early seventies. He hovers crudely over 
           Will’s torn abdomen with forceps and a fine blade.

           Clay watches, his eyes heavy and sleep-deprived. Garrett is 
           in a chair, stuffing his mouth with bread and jam.

                                 THE DOCTOR
                        Steady, now.

           The doctor nods at Clay nervously. Clay holds Will still by 
           the shoulders. The blade lowers -

                                 WILL
                        AGGGGHHHHHHH!!!!!!

                                 THE DOCTOR
                        Hold him.

           Will: deep fast breaths, then again -

                                 WILL
                        AGGGGGGHHHHHHHHH!!!!!

           A bloody sliver of shattered rib is removed from the wound.

           Will stops suddenly.

           It’s quiet. Clay and the doctor wait. Jack, Garrett and Sarah 
           watch from the walls.

                                 CLAY
                        Will?

                                 GARRETT
                        He’s passed out.

                                 JACK
                        Will?

           We notice for the first time that Jack has his revolver 
           trained on someone sitting in the corner of the room: THE 
           DOCTOR’S WIFE, an old woman with a perpetually worried 
           face... especially right now. But Garrett’s right -

           Will is unconscious, his mouth agape, still breathing. Blood 
           trickles out of him. Garrett looks at the half-eaten bread 
           and jam in his hand, suddenly less hungry.
           Sarah watches in shock.

                                 CLAY
                        Keep going.

                                 THE DOCTOR
                        He’s going to die.

           The room is stilled.

                                 CLAY
                        Hey doc, look at me.
                             (beat)
                        He’s gonna live. Y’understand?

           Jack looks at the doctor’s wife, his gun pointed at her gut.

                                 THE DOCTOR
                        He’s bleeding inside. I’d have to 
                        cut into him, I could kill him.

           The doctor is shaking, nearly crying, terrified.

                                 CLAY
                        Look, I’m not gonna hurt ya if he 
                        dies, okay? Ya gotta try... cause 
                        I’m gonna hurt ya if ya don’t.

                                 THE DOCTOR
                        I need ether.

                                 CLAY
                        You don’t have ether?

                                 THE DOCTOR
                        Across the street at Brown’s... 
                        He’s a good man. He’s my friend.

           INT. COLONIAL HOUSE - THE DOCTOR’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Clay bends down to talk to Sarah, he hands her a REVOLVER.

           Sarah looks up at him expectantly.

                                 CLAY
                        Did Will ever show you one of 
                        these?

           She just looks at the gun quietly. He looks her in the eye.
                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        Keep it pointed at them. But don’t 
                        pull this. Got it?

           Her voice is even softer than we might expect:

                                 SARAH
                        I got it.

           Clay leaves with no more thought on it. And the gun sits in 
           her hand, cold and heavy and powerful.

           Sarah cocks the gun, uncocks it.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. LENNOCK STREET - DAY

           Clay and Jack stand on the street. Coats and shirts buttoned 
           up over blood stains, hands washed but still marred by blood, 
           revolvers mostly hidden in their belts.  They cross the 
           street from the doctor’s house.

           A respectable BUSINESSMAN walking out of the shoe shop stops 
           in his tracks to stare at the men. Clay pulls his sleeve a 
           bit, hiding the dried brown blood.

           INT. DOCTOR’S HOUSE - DOCTOR’S OFFICE - SAME

           Will. Unconcious. Sweat beaded on his bone white face. The 
           doctor checks the strength of Will’s pulse, making sure he’s 
           still clinging on. But something is bothering him:

           Sarah sits backwards on a chair, knees on the seat, aiming 
           the revolver right at him. It’s just her, the doctor and his 
           wife in the room.

                                 THE DOCTOR
                        Where’s your parents?

           Sarah points the gun right at his face.

                                 SARAH
                        You know you look scared.

                                 THE DOCTOR’S WIFE
                        You must have parents. Who raised 
                        you?

                                 SARAH
                        Nobody raised me. I raised myself.
           She looks at Will on the table. Nearly bloodless.

                                 GARRETT (O.S.)
                        What’s this?

                                 THE DOCTOR
                        What?

           INT. THE DRAWING ROOM - SAME

           Garrett looks down curiously at something in the other room.

                                 GARRETT
                        This big, fat thing.

                                 THE DOCTOR (O.S.)
                        Haven’t you seen a radio?

           CLOSE ON: A hand reaches for the radio’s volume knob, and 
           turns it clockwise. The SOUND FADES UP:

           INT. PHARMACY - SAME

           We tilt up to reveal that it is MR. BROWN, a spectacled, vest-
           clad pharmacist, who has just turned up the volume on a radio 
           broadcast that’s taking the better half of his attention from 
           an egg-salad sandwich:

           And as the announcer changes the subject to Hollywood...

           KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.

           Mr. Brown turns -
           EXT. LENNOCK STREET - CONTINUOUS

           It’s Clay and Jack, just outside. They look out of place at 
           best. Mr. Brown points to the sign on the door glass:

           “CLOSED... SORRY!”

           Clay KNOCKS again. Mr. Brown looks up at him sourly -

                                 MR. BROWN (MUFFLED, THROUGH GLASS)
                        Closed, sorry.

                        Just need one thing.

           Mr. Brown simply points at the sign again and bites into his 
           sandwich to show how busy he is.

           KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. Louder now because -

           Jack is knocking. Mr. Brown looks up.

           Jack has a revolver pointed right at him.

           Mr. Brown stares... blood stained cowboys. Panic drips over 
           his heart. The sandwich starts to slip apart.

           INT. PHARMACY - LATER

           Mr. Brown sweats as he places a bottle of ether in a paper 
           bag...

                                 CLAY
                        I’m sorry we got no money.

           Mr. Brown looks in his eyes. Burning them into memory before -

           EXT. PHARMACY - SAME

           Clay and Jack hurry out of the pharmacy. Jack’s holding a 
           bottle of rubbing alcohol in one hand, stuffing the gun in 
           his belt with the other. Clay leads the way.
           INT. PHARMACY - SAME

           And Mr. Brown reaches for his telephone, watching them cross 
           the street through the mostly-glass door.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DOCTOR’S HOUSE - LATER

           As the doctor operates, we travel the room:

           Jack looks at Clay across the operating table -

           Clay watches the doctor -

           Sarah sits in the corner - admiring the gun, her mind on 
           herself, not the life at stake.

           Garrett watches Clay and Jack for their reactions, trying to 
           figure out how he should be reacting.

           The doctor’s wife is hoping that her husband succeeds.

           AND WILL.

           Lies passed out from the ether. Cold metal tools pry into his 
           bleeding abdomen, searching between his blood-slick organs.

           The doctor is sweating, working as if before a raging fire.

           Until...

           He looks up at Clay apologetically. Clay doesn’t understand 
           why until he looks at Will’s wound -

           A reservoir of blood rises up within, filling slowly to the 
           brim before spilling over Will’s side and onto the table. The 
           renal artery is severed inside.

           Will’s eyes are shut. Motionless.

           NO SIGN OF LIFE.

           Everyone is still. Somehow even Sarah can feel it -

           She puts the gun down and looks up at Will. Dead.
           EXT. CHICAGO STREET - DAY

           HOOOOOONK! A fat Ford Model A goes blaring through an 
           intersection. The street is congested, cars trying to 
           navigate through pedestrians.

           INT. CHICAGO FBI OFFICE - SAME

           Melvin Purvis watches from a third story window. Lost in the 
           silent commotion below. He absentmindedly twists a wedding 
           band in a slow circle around his ring finger.

                        Mel.

           He turns to see a go-getter of an agent, CONRAD HALL (24), 
           hair slicked back, a young face and a mouthful of gum.

                                 CONRAD HALL (CONT’D)
                             (talking a mile a minute)
                        Lennock, Nevada. Two men with guns 
                        just held up a pharmacy. The 
                        pharmacist says they were covered 
                        in blood. Looked nervous. He’s 
                        pretty sure it’s them.

                                 MELVIN PURVIS
                        They held up a pharmacy? What’d 
                        they take?

                                 CONRAD HALL
                        Just ether.

           We can see Melvin’s gears turning. And he figures out pretty 
           quickly why they might need ether.

                                 MELVIN PURVIS
                        Where’s Lennock?

                                 CONRAD HALL
                        I don’t know.

                        Get me a map of Nevada.

           The agent makes ready to leave.

                        There is no local law enforcement.

           ONE CONTINUOUS TRACKING SHOT, IN PROFILE:

           Tom Pickett is sitting in the driver’s seat of his parked 
           Ford. He pops a mint in his mouth.

           He collects his camera, opens the door and steps out.

           We continue moving with Tom as he walks out from under the 
           shade of a beautiful oak tree, revealing scorched land 
           beyond. Where Tom keeps walking...

           Past a MAN IN A HAT, who is staring at something ahead.

           After a few more feet,

           Tom passes THREE PEOPLE, all looking in the same direction...

           Then a LARGER GROUP.

           Until it’s clear that Tom is -

           EXT. DOCTOR’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Outside the doctor’s house. The gathering has the air of a 
           town picnic, the grade school has let out for the day, young 
           children watching with the schoolteacher. A beautiful day, 
           everyone here to watch a show - just a little more blood and 
           violence expected than on your average, say, Fourth of July.

           And a few CURIOUS ONLOOKERS peer into the black car parked 
           across the street.

           Tom approaches, looks inside. Dried blood on the backseat. He 
           snaps a picture.

           The doctor’s house stands before him. And he turns to see -

           THREE MEN HOLDING RIFLES standing at the head of the group. 
           Tom extends his upturned palm to the CHUBBY MAN on his right.
                                 TOM
                        Chocolate mint?

           And Tom pops a mint in his own mouth as the chubby man 
           deliberates before eagerly taking one.

                                 CHUBBY MAN

                        I’m a neutral party. No shooting 
                        yet?

                                 CHUBBY MAN
                        Naw, not yet.

           Without looking, Tom offers another chocolate mint. The 
           chubby man takes it. Like feeding a lapdog.

                                 TOM
                        Who’re they?

                                 CHUBBY MAN
                        That’s Branson Long.

                                 TOM
                        He’s the sheriff?

                                 CHUBBY MAN
                        Branson’s Branson. But I guess 
                        you’d know that if you live ‘round 
                        here.

                                 TOM
                        I guess. Thanks, bub.

           And Tom walks away from the chubby man, maneuvering closer. 
           He looks eager, the rifles almost a turn on. And he watches 
           the gunmen quietly, studying...

           EXT. 50 FT. AWAY - SAME

           BRANSON LONG (33), the oldest of the three men and the clear 
           leader, wears a wide-brimmed hat. Tall and wide and gifted 
           with natural strength and a disarming face.

           The man to his right is WENDELL (30), unshaven and nervous.

                                 WENDELL
                        You think it’s them?

           The doctor’s house looms before them.
           INT. DOCTOR’S HOUSE

           Inside, everyone sits in silence. Heads hung low, the air is 
           thick with suffocating hopelessness. Everyone alone.

           Clay hides beneath his hat, slumped on a sofa.

                                 GARRETT
                        Clay?
                             (...)
                        Clay? What are we gonna do?

                                 JACK
                        Who made him boss?

                                 CLAY
                        Nobody.

           His voice sounds different. Colder, dryer.

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        You all just like to follow.

                                 JACK
                        Well then, where’re we goin’ now?

           Clay looks down at the locket clutched in his fist. It is 
           tender and precious and something to be protected.

           He sees now: the blood pooled under the operating table, the 
           guns in his friend’s hands. In Sarah’s hand.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        You’re so smart, what do we do now?

                                 CLAY
                        Jack. Look me in the eye.

           Jack looks him in the eye. Seconds pass. His glare fades.

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        You know where I’ve been?

                                 JACK
                        Yeah.

                                 CLAY
                        You know why I went there?

           No answer. Just Jack’s eyes, afraid of Clay’s.
                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        Do you remember when we used to 
                        work the mine together? When we 
                        were young, you remember that?

           Jack softens now. Clay’s eyes are all cold determination.

                                 JACK
                        Yeah.

                                 CLAY
                        I want that again.

           Jack and Garrett look at Clay. They want the same.

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        Now I got one place to go.

           Clay sits a moment. And now he’s up and moving. He looks out 
           the back window. Turns to the doctor.

                                 CLAY
                        Doc.

           The doctor is slope-shouldered now, heavy with guilt.

                                 CLAY
                        Can you do us a favor? Think you 
                        can hold your tongue a few minutes?
                             (approaching the doctor)
                        We’re like you, you understand? We 
                        come from a very small town.

           The doctor isn’t quite sure what he means.

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        Now, I’m gonna want ya to count to 
                        a thousand.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. DOCTOR’S HOUSE

           Tom squints in the blinding sun. He looks tired. An abnormal 
           shadow is cast across his face. And we see now that he’s 
           squatting in the inadequate shade offered by his camera, 
           which is mounted on a tripod. He’s watching -

           Branson, Wendell and their silent associate take cover behind 
           Wendell’s DODGE TRUCK...
                                 WENDELL
                        They been just sittin’ there ten 
                        minutes now. Ain’t nuthin’ goin’ 
                        on.

           In the front windows of the doctor’s house, the doctor and 
           his wife sit motionless in chairs, facing out at the crowd.

           Branson wipes his face. He looks down and checks the bolt on 
           his rifle. The bullet is lined up nice-and-clean.

                                 BRANSON
                        We talkin’ ‘bout a two-thousand 
                        dollar reward. That’s awful big, 
                        split or no, don’t ya think?

                                 WENDELL
                        Yeah, but what if it ain’t them?

           Branson can see that Wendell’s nervous as hell.

                                 BRANSON
                        Either way, I don’t know ‘bout you, 
                        but I don’t tolerate no crime 
                        against no old man and woman. Y’all 
                        wanna go, I’ll take the two 
                        thousand myself.

                                 WENDELL
                        Nah.

                                 BRANSON
                        What about you, Bill?

                                 BILL
                        Nah.

           And Branson looks at his two friends, slides the bolt home 
           and stands.

           THE DOOR to the doctor’s house opens.

           It’s the doctor. Standing alone in the doorway.

           Branson approaches, his men trailing reluctantly. Branson’s 
           eyes scan the second story, the inside. Seems the doctor is 
           all alone with his wife. And as Branson reaches the porch -

                                 BRANSON
                        What happened?

           The doctor looks nervous, debating inside his head.
                                 BRANSON (CONT’D)
                        Where’d they go?

           Tom is watching. This isn’t how it’s supposed to happen.

           And the doctor moves out of the way, letting Branson walk 
           into the house. Where he sees:

           An empty room. A door is cracked open a bit, Will’s body 
           visible on the table inside. And something else...

           He walks toward the back of the house...

           The back door is wide open. A swath of tall grass is trampled 
           down by footprints. Branson is a man betrayed -

                                 BRANSON
                        Why didn’t you say nuthin’?

           Wendell and Bill finally enter, noticing the dead body before 
           anything else. But now they see the open door...

                                 BRANSON
                             (to Wendell)
                        Get your truck.

           The half-trampled grass blows in the spare breeze.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. DESERT

           A BLACK 1929 DODGE PICKUP comes roaring toward us from the 
           town of Lennock in the near distance. It sends plumes of 
           desert dirt up from its wildly spinning wheels.

           It’s after the men like a bat out of hell.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. LENNOCK STREET - TOM’S CAR

           Tom’s camera is hastily dropped on the passenger seat as Tom 
           sits behind the wheel. He twists the ignition. The engine is 
           being fussy, but after a couple more tries -

           He guns the engine and the car TEARS FORWARD.

           But HE JERKS TO A BRAKING STOP -
           INT. BATHROOM - THE DOCTOR’S HOUSE - MOMENTS EARLIER

           A SCENE SHOWN IN SUPER TIGHT CLOSEUPS:

           Clay sits on the sill of the bathtub, watching the bathroom 
           door. The rifle sits propped in his hands, dead-set on the 
           door. It’s stuffy upstairs, suffocating.

           Footsteps approach the door. Eeek... eeek...

           The door opens. The doctor.

                                                               BACK TO:

           EXT. LENNOCK STREET - BACK IN TOM’S CAR

           Tom has stopped because right in front of him...

           Three dirty, blood-mottled men are carrying a body down the 
           steps of the doctor’s house.

           The Ford’s engine grumbles.

           Tom stares on in disbelief.

           He gets out without even turning off the engine.

           EXT. DOCTOR’S HOUSE - SAME

           The recently-dispersing crowd around the doctor’s house is 
           transfixed as Clay, Jack and Garrett struggle with Will’s 
           bloodless body.

           Tom takes a step forward and says something that will 
           surprise even him:

                                 TOM
                        You need a hand?

           Clay catches Tom’s eyes and holds them. Like a wolf, Clay’s 
           eyes betray nothing but wary mistrust. Tom freezes, because -

           Sarah has the revolver pointed right at his chest.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Easy... easy...

           That gun isn’t moving.
                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        They cut your tires.
                             (beat)
                        You need a car? Hold on.

           Tom backs up slowly, and when he deems he won’t be shot, runs 
           back to his idling car. He hops in, drives forward, right up 
           to the front of the doctor’s house. And gets out as the men 
           near the car, arms straining under Will’s weight.

                                 TOM
                             (to Clay)
                        It’s a Ford Model A, three months 
                        old. I can get you pretty far. 
                        What’s your name?

           Clay scans the crowd. And as he looks at people, each one 
           backs up as if repelled by his gaze. But not this one...

                                 TOM
                        My name’s Tom. I figure you need a 
                        hostage, if you wanna get anywhere.
                             (smiling)
                        Isn’t that how it works?

                                 CLAY
                        Open the door.

                                 TOM
                        Wait.

                                 CLAY
                        Open the door.

           Tom opens the back door to his car.

                                 TOM
                        You got a sheet or a something?

           Too late. Will’s bloody mass is being laid on the clean seat. 
           Garrett makes his way to the driver’s seat.

                                 TOM
                        Hold on!
                             (beat, softer)
                        Now I’ll drive you wherever you 
                        wanna go. I know my way around 
                        here. You can’t take my car. Don’t 
                        you wanna know who I am? I’m Tom 
                        Pickett. I’m a reporter.
                             (to Sarah)
                        What’s your name, little girl?
                                 SARAH
                        I’m not a little girl.

           Sarah starts to step into the car.

                                 CLAY
                             (to Jack)
                        She’s not comin’.
                             (beat, off Jack’s look)
                        What good we gonna do her?

                                 JACK
                        We just leave her?

                                 CLAY
                        Yeah.

           Sarah sits in the car and shuts the door behind her.

                                 CLAY
                        Sarah, get outta the car.

                                 SARAH
                        No. I’m not gettin’ out!

                                 CLAY
                             (to Jack)
                        Pull her out.

                                 SARAH
                        Pull me out yourself! I ain’t 
                        going!

           Clay opens the door -

           She starts kicking the dashboard -

           Tom winces with each kick to his beloved car -

           Clay drags her out by her underarms and she struggles, 
           clawing at his hands as she’s dragged backwards -

                                 CLAY
                        Don’t you wanna go to school!? Just 
                        be a goddamn normal kid!

           Sarah is kicking in the dirt, fighting back, as Clay now has 
           her by the hair -

                                 SARAH
                        NO! I’m not a normal kid!! I don’t 
                        wanna be normal! I got no one! What 
                        am I s’posed to do!?
                                 CLAY
                        You little cunt, we all got no one!

           She lies defeated in the dirt.

           The air is still.

           Jack and Garrett look at Clay. They’re embarrassed. Tom 
           watches them all. He didn’t expect them to be like this.

                                 CLAY
                             (to her)
                        We’re not comin’ back from where 
                        we’re goin’, ya get it?

           A distant GRUMBLING in the distance. The men turn.

           It’s growing louder, closer...

           A DODGE PICKUP comes rumbling out around the corner shop 150 
           yards away. It stops in the middle of the road, facing Clay 
           and the others... WENDELL’S TRUCK.

           Clay stands still, squinting at its distant windshield.

           GRMMMM... the engine rumbles.

           IN WENDELL’S TRUCK

           Branson glares at Clay, Jack and Garrett. All holding guns. 
           Branson - CLICK - cocks the hammer on his rifle.

           Townspeople who haven’t cleared out already start to back 
           away from the road. But they’re still watching, because it’s 
           surely about to get interesting.

                                 BRANSON
                        Let’s get ‘em.

           BACK WITH CLAY

           The hunted watch as -

           VROOOOOOOOOOMMMMMM! The Dodge starts tearing toward them.

           Clay is immobile as Jack raises his revolver - 

           Garrett’s frozen in the driver’s seat. And -

           BANG! Jack fires at the Dodge.
           I/E. SPEEDING CHEVY

           Wendell drives, Branson in the passenger seat with his rifle.

           Branson aims out the window as the Dodge slows, nearing them:

           BANG!

           EXT. STREET

           Tom ducks behind the open back door.

           Jack hurries behind the car -

           BANG! Fires again just before getting in -

           Jack reaches over Will and pulls Tom inside -

                                 GARRETT
                        Clay!

           Clay gets into the front seat and SHUTS THE DOOR ON SARAH 
           OUTSIDE. Wendell’s truck accelerates toward them...

           Garrett guns it forward, toward the quickly approaching 
           Dodge, and makes a dirt-kicking U-turn - with Sarah in the 
           middle of all of it.

           SHE RUNS for the turning car as it comes back her way, hops 
           onto the runners, clinging onto the passenger side door, her 
           hands clasping Clay’s shirt, nearly falling off -

           IN TOM’S CAR

                                 SARAH
                        LET ME IN!

           She slips - but Clay pulls her in through the window, her 
           legs kicking outside, the world spinning, as -

           BANG! - Someone from the Dodge takes a shot, it plunks into 
           the metal of the car somewhere.

           Tom cowers in the backseat, heart pounding. He sees his 
           camera sitting on the floor.

           IN WENDELL’S TRUCK

           Branson aims out the window, looking like a sharpshooter -
           BANG!

                                 BRANSON
                        That’s two-thousand dollars, 
                        Wendell!

           Wendell floors it.

           IN TOM’S CAR

           The Dodge is catching up as they tear out of town - the 
           buildings becoming a fading memory in lieu of the bumpy dirt 
           road and the quickly approaching highway.

           Sarah clings to Clay, he holds her -

           BANG! Jack takes a shot out the window -

           The car swerves, nearly sliding off the road -

           BANG! Another shot from Branson.

           Tom reaches as his camera rolls away from him -

           Jack ducks, reloading, then leans out the window. He’s 
           hanging out, not very stably, pointing the gun back.

           BANG!

           The gun goes off unintentionally, his finger bumping on the 
           trigger.

                                 GARRETT
                        Oh Jesus...

           With a heavy bump, they hit the highway - a rough switch from 
           packed dirt to pavement. The car swerves right, catching 
           traction on the road.

           Clay, Jack and Sarah look back as the Dodge turns onto the 
           road too, just as -

           SLAM!

           A truck hits the Dodge, sending two packed trunks and bags of 
           supplies flying forward and nearly cleaving the car in two.

           Garrett continues driving as the Chevy fades from being real, 
           dangerous and close to a distant speck - a sideshow accident.

           Clay holds Sarah close to him.
                                 GARRETT
                             (quiet, genuine)
                        You think they’re alright?

                                 CLAY
                        I’m not too sure.

           CLOSE ON CLAY... LOOKING AHEAD.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CREEDE, COLORADO - OUTSKIRTS - DAY

           Snow covers the town of Creede. Nestled under the massive 
           Rockies mountains, Creede is a cloister, the people warmed 
           only by struggling stone hearth fires and sheepskin coats.

           EXT. RIO GRANDE RAIL DEPOT - CREEDE, COLORADO - DAY

           A HORSE’S HOOF presses into the snow - the snow grinds, 
           creaking under the weight.

           The horse snorts, its breath cloudy in the cold. It’s tied up 
           outside a small STABLE and looking at -

           ANNIE. She stands on the platform of the Rio Grande rail 
           depot, her trunk is at her side as a train leaves the 
           station, continuing on from Creede. Annie looks down the 
           street at -

           CREEDE. A bustling mining town. Workers, proprietors, the 
           occasional child or teen. This is what a mining town should 
           look like. The antithesis of what she’s used to in Nevada.

           The RAIL DEPOT WORKER (20) next to her loads a heavy cart 
           with her TRUNK and BAG.

           DING... DING... DING... the town clock tower rings.

           EXT. THE HOME - TAVERN - LATER

           The depot worker following behind her, Annie opens the door 
           to “THE HOME” -

           INT. THE HOME - TAVERN - CONTINUOUS

           A RAUCOUS BAR with dirty, work-a-day MINERS, liberal-minded 
           UNMARRIED WOMEN and several PROSTITUTES. 
           Local brews and whiskey are the town drinks. As Annie steps 
           through the door, trunk in tow, the men react:

                                 THE MEN
                        OOOHHHHHHHHHH!!!

           They laugh and drink, a couple of the men looking long at 
           Annie, others shyly averting their gaze.

           A YOUNG WOMAN (25) playing cards at a back table makes eye 
           contact with Annie and her face lights up. The young woman 
           nudges the MATRON (50) next to her.

           Both women excuse themselves with the MEN at the table and 
           come to greet Annie.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THE HOME - BEDROOM - LATER

           A bedroom in “The Home”. It’s mostly red, soft, warm. The 
           matron has a smoky voice - aged and hoarse.

                                 THE MATRON
                        You’re going to have to do things 
                        you may not want to do.

                                 ANNIE
                        What might I not want to do?

                                 THE MATRON
                        Honey, I could be your mother. I’m 
                        old enough and I’ve seen enough. 
                        And so long as you’re here, I am 
                        your mother. That means I’m in 
                        charge. When I say you’re going to 
                        have to do things you may not want 
                        to do, that means you smile and 
                        wait for me to finish talking.
                             (beat)
                        You’ll make a great deal of money 
                        here. And I will make more. If you 
                        take issue with that, I suggest you 
                        keep it to yourself or seek 
                        employment elsewhere. Now I’m going 
                        to tell you how to bring in money: 
                        you meet a man at the bar. You 
                        don’t proposition the man. The man 
                        propositions you. These are yours.

           She holds up two cloth napkins. One RED, one WHITE.
                                 THE MATRON (CONT’D)
                        You leave them at the bar.
                             (holds up the red)
                        This means you’ve taken a man 
                        upstairs and he’s fuckin’ you. This 
                        is so we tell your customers you 
                        aren’t here. You’re red. Your 
                        friend Lila is violet, other girls 
                        got other colors. The last thing a 
                        loyal customer wants is to hear 
                        that his girl’s fuckin’ another 
                        man, whether she’s a whore or not, 
                        so you always leave your color. 
                        That way we tell them, ‘well, you 
                        aren’t here right now’.
                             (holds up the white)
                        This is your white flag. You show 
                        this, it means you need help. And I 
                        mean, you show this, it means you 
                        need help. You use this wrong, and 
                        you will need help. Our customers 
                        don’t get out of line unless they 
                        pay for the privilege.
                             (off Annie’s expression)
                        You alright honey?
                             (beat)
                        We give you makeup, we give you a 
                        bedroom, we give you money. You 
                        give us everything else.

           She brushes aside the hair hanging over Annie’s brow.

                                 THE MATRON
                        Welcome to the Home, honey.

           Annie is visibly disgusted to have a woman tell her what to 
           do, let alone touch her. The matron leaves. Annie regards the 
           room, guessing what it holds in store for her. And she looks 
           out the window, a sadness in her face.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CHICAGO FBI OFFICE - DAY

           CLOSE ON: A CAST IRON RADIOFAX MACHINE. 

           The drum on the radiofax rotates slowly, a stylus swiping 
           back an forth like a metronome as an image is unfurled on the 
           photo paper wrapped around the barrel.
           A MAN pulls the paper out of the machine, we track behind him 
           as he carries it with him down the hall and into -

           INT. THE MEETING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The photograph is placed in front of Melvin Purvis, who sits 
           on the wide side of an expansive oval-shaped table.

           SIX AGENTS are with him in the room, among them Conrad Hall.

           Melvin Purvis looks at the photo, studying...

           A MUGSHOT. CLAY DERING. BLURRY AROUND THE EDGES.

           “CARSON CITY”, “10587” - says the placard around his neck.

           In the picture, Clay looks tired, defeated, and a little 
           younger. Melvin suddenly looks up -

                                 MELVIN PURVIS
                        Who’s smoking?

           The AGENT (27) at the far end of the table has just lit up a 
           cigarette. Now he looks like he was just caught pants down.

                                 MELVIN PURVIS
                        Don’t ever smoke in this room. If 
                        you have to destroy evidence, do it 
                        at home.

           The agent stubs the cigarette into the back of his matchbook. 
           And Melvin dismisses the man who brought him the picture -

                                 MELVIN PURVIS
                        James, thank the good men in 
                        Nevada.
                             (to the task at hand)
                        So... there is a history of 
                        violence here, isn’t there?

                                 AN AGENT
                        He spent fourteen months in Carson. 
                        But I say if he got caught in the 
                        middle of nowhere, he can’t be very 
                        good.

                                 MELVIN PURVIS
                        Maybe he’s just learning the ropes, 
                        so let’s not jump to conclusions.

           The agent nearest Mel takes a look at the mugshot.
                                 ANOTHER AGENT
                        Why’d they shoot the sheriff in the 
                        first place?

                                 CONRAD HALL
                        Hoover’s flooding their town to 
                        finish the dam -

                                 AN AGENT
                        Certainly finds ways to make 
                        himself popular, doesn’t he?

                                 CONRAD HALL
                        The Boulder City Sheriff was 
                        assigned to help vacate. Maybe they 
                        were opposed to leaving home. Kinda 
                        quaint.

           Conrad chews his gum. There’s a small pause before -

                                 MELVIN PURVIS
                        I want to find out what kind of 
                        gears he’s got up here.
                             (he taps his own skull)
                        Wherever he’s running to next, 
                        we’re going to be there waiting. 
                        Now that we’ve got his name, I want 
                        it on the radio, nationwide. I want 
                        it heard in every living room, 
                        stores, bars. I want his picture in 
                        the papers. Let’s shake Clay up a 
                        little bit. If he’s scared he’ll be 
                        easy to catch.

                                 CONRAD HALL
                        We’re just gonna rely on tips from 
                        good samaritans, huh?

                                 MELVIN PURVIS
                        There are some out there.

           INT. THE CAR - DAY

           Tom is in the backseat. Will is dead next to him. Really 
           dead. He’s pale, festering, petulant. And Tom’s right 
           shoulder is stained with Will’s dried blood now.

           Tom’s infected with the air of death - quiet, morose - not 
           his usual self. Throughout the scene, Tom is framed with the 
           dead body next to him...
                                 TOM
                        You know what a reporter is, right?
                             (beat)
                        What’s your name?
                             (a longer beat)
                        I could write about you.

                                 CLAY
                        What d’you wanna write about?

           Tom looks around: the blood, the rifles, the fifteen year-old 
           girl, the dead man next to him. “What do you want write 
           about?” is a pretty insipid question given the circumstances.

                                 TOM
                        Well, for example... What d’you do 
                        next? Rob a bank? That’s popular.
                             (a long beat)
                        ...So no banks?

                                 JACK
                        We ain’t robbers. We’re miners.

           The information hits Tom like cold soup.

                                 TOM
                        But you have a brothel?

                                 CLAY
                        Garrett, pull over.

           Garrett pulls to the side of the road.

           EXT. ROADSIDE - AMONG DIRT AND DRY GRASS - CONTINUOUS

           Everyone sits in the stopped car:

                                 TOM
                        Is something wrong?

                                 CLAY
                        Yeah. You.
                             (beat)
                        How d’you know about us?

                                 TOM
                        I listen.
                             (off Clay’s glare)
                        I met a man and his young boy 
                        stranded in the desert. Someone had 
                        left them to die, with no food or 
                        water.
           This has the effect Tom intended. Clay is momentarily weak.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        They were very scared. I can write 
                        your story how you want it. You’ll 
                        be in every paper from Los Angeles 
                        to New York, in your own words.

           Garrett and Jack look instantly overwhelmed.

                                 CLAY
                        What makes you think we care about 
                        your city paper?

                                 TOM
                        You should care. My newspaper’s 
                        gonna keep you alive tomorrow. It 
                        could make you a hero or it could 
                        make you a villain. And either one 
                        would be the truth. Cause my 
                        newspaper only prints the truth. 
                        Without me, you’re just a big, fat 
                        two-thousand dollar reward.

           The car idles like a hungry stomach. Jack looks at Clay, the 
           guy’s right.

                                 TOM
                        They killed your friend. They 
                        murdered him in cold blood. Don’t 
                        you want me to print that?

           Just then, a loud, buzzing HOUSE FLY lands on Will. It sits 
           on Will’s forehead, tip-toeing along his hairline, glistening 
           and black and filthy.

           Garrett watches it walk. Transfixed by the morbid grime.

                                 JACK
                        We need a shovel.

           EXT. STANDARD OIL OF CALIFORNIA “SOCAL” FILLING STATION - DAY

           The car pulls into a SOCAL filling station, parks far from 
           the gas pumps, on the edge of the lot.

           This is Eureka County, Nevada - the young winter brings a 
           faint dusting of frost from which the grass sprouts defiantly 
           and a brittle chill hangs in the air.
           I/E. TOM’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Everyone watches as -

           THE ATTENDANT (40) approaches in the rear view, carrying a 
           smile and holding his hat to his head as the wind kicks up.

                                 CLAY
                        Get out and talk to ‘em.

           Garrett gets out, Sarah following. Jack bristles, though -

                                 JACK
                        Is that an order?

                                 CLAY
                        I don’t know, ask me again.

           Jack gets out, pissy. Tom is still in the back. Clay looks at 
           him in the rear view, cold eyes -

           And Tom hurries out of the car. Clay watches them all go, 
           Jack saying something to the attendant, the attendant leading 
           them back to the station. No one is looking.

           Just Clay... and Will.

           Clay begins to cry.

           EXT. STANDARD OIL OF CALIFORNIA “SOCAL” FILLING STATION

           Sarah looks back toward the car, Clay is shaking in the front 
           seat, his back to her. No one else seems to see it...

           EXT. A FIELD - LATER

           The clouds have come in to cast a darkness over the great 
           expanse as Tom puts his eye to his camera’s ground-glass. He 
           secretly snaps a photo - what will be a black and white, a 
           lifeless still of a burial scene. Because before his eyes:

           Standing many yards from the car - now parked in cold grass 
           and dirt - Clay, Jack and Garrett finish digging with shovels 
           and hoes while Sarah watches.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Will lies in a shallow pit.
           The men look on at their dead friend. Clay kneels by the 
           grave’s edge, holding a handful of clotted, cold dirt. He is 
           unable to let go, the dirt seeping between his clasped 
           fingers. But finally, he releases...

           They are still, no one wanting to pick up the shovels to 
           begin the hardest part.

                                 GARRETT
                        I told ‘im we were burying a dog.

           Jack and Clay are silently put off by the odd comment.

                                 GARRETT (O.S.)
                        You think they’re gonna notice?

           Clay turns, sees the station a field away. Sarah sits on her 
           own, picking grass, sneaking glances at Clay. And Jack sits 
           down quietly next to him.

                                 JACK
                        The gas man says we can stay in the 
                        barn. Lotta migrants do. No one 
                        lives there now.

                                 CLAY
                        Everyone’s been driven from their 
                        homes. Whether by force or by 
                        fear...

           The barn stands as a rasping monument to a dying way of life.

                                 GARRETT
                        You think there’s somethin’ to eat 
                        around here? I’m hungry.

           And it becomes apparent now just how tired Clay, Jack and 
           Garrett are. Sleepless, the adrenaline slipping away.

           Tom watches them, the notepad in his hand reads:

           CLAY. JACK. SARAH. GARRETT?

           And he sees Jack turn around. They make eye contact, Jack 
           looking suspicious. Tom pretends he was looking at the sky.

           EXT. AT THE WOODS’ EDGE - NIGHT

           A fire is reflected in Clay’s still eyes. The group sits 
           around a burning pile of forest tinder. The world is ink 
           black beyond the flickering orange.
           Tom watches the others. Studying primates.

                                 JACK
                        You still set on our destination?

                                 CLAY
                        I am.

                                 JACK
                        If it’s just you wanna lay down 
                        with your old cooze, she’s already 
                        busy humpin’ sheepherders for 
                        change. You should keep your mind 
                        where it belongs - on yourself.
                             (beat)
                        I say that as a friend.

           Jack offers the rubbing alcohol to Clay. He doesn’t take it.

           But Sarah reaches over and takes it instead. She tilts back 
           the bottle and takes a gulp. Clay thinks to stop her. But 
           after all this, she’s entitled to get drunk.

                                 CLAY
                        Sit down, reporter.

           Tom is standing, stretching his legs on the other side of the 
           fire. On Clay’s command, he sits. Right next to Garrett.

                                 TOM
                        Look, you’ve had me sitting quiet 
                        for going on eight hours. 
                        Eventually a man’s gotta take a 
                        shit.

           But Clay’s eyes are focused intently off in the distance:

           A small light is bobbing in the darkness. Coming toward them.

           Jack reaches for his gun, keeping it hidden but ready. The 
           light, an oil lamp, approaches. The edge of the fire’s glow 
           illuminates the face of a wrinkled, PORTLY WOMAN (60).

                                 PORTLY WOMAN
                        Good evening.

                                 JACK
                        Hello ma’am.

                                 TOM
                             (dry)
                        Howdy.
                                 PORTLY WOMAN
                        My son neglected to tell me we had 
                        guests at the barn tonight.

                                 CLAY
                        Who are you lady?

                                 PORTLY WOMAN
                             (hurt, offended)
                        Oh. We live at the filling station. 
                        I was hoping to ask if you’d join 
                        us for a late supper?
                             (beat)
                        I can’t bear to see a child go 
                        hungry... Please.

           Clay immediately seems sorry. He looks at Sarah. She does 
           look famished, as do they all. They wait for Clay’s answer.

                                 CLAY
                        Thank you.

                                 TOM
                             (an announcement)
                        I’m about to explode.

           Tom smiles sideways. Clay looks at Garrett, sitting by Tom.

                                 CLAY
                        ...Garrett.

           Garrett looks up.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. IN THE WOODS - MOMENTS LATER

           Garrett escorts Tom through the woods, walking a careful 
           length behind him. The twigs crack beneath them.

                                 TOM
                        What’s your name? Garrett? I had an 
                        uncle named Garrett.

           Tom turns, extending his hand.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Tom.

           Garrett hesitates... then reluctantly shakes hands.
                                 GARRETT
                        Garrett.

                                 TOM
                        You know what I admire, Garrett? 
                        You’re very calm and collected. 
                        Your friends are a little, they’re 
                        great. I just wonder if they’re 
                        handling the situation the right 
                        way. You see what I mean?

           Garrett is a blank stare.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        What’s Clay’s girl’s name? Annie?
                             (beat)
                        Right?

                                 GARRETT
                        Annie.

                                 TOM
                        Where’s Annie?

           Tom stops walking, facing Garrett.

                                 GARRETT
                        I don’t think I should tell you 
                        that.

                                 TOM
                        They don’t treat you right, do 
                        they? See, look. They went to go 
                        eat a nice, hot meal and they left 
                        you to watch me take a shit. How 
                        does that make you feel?

           Garrett’s eyes shift.

                                 TOM
                        I don’t know why they don’t want me 
                        to help you. I mean, I could get 
                        you out of this pretty easily, 
                        you’d never have to go to jail. Or 
                        maybe you don’t want out. Maybe you 
                        want to be brave... and famous. You 
                        know, I could arrange that, 
                        Garrett. I just need you to help me 
                        help you.

           Cracks appear in Garrett’s surface. Tom pulls out a flask, 
           unscrews the top -
                                 TOM
                        So what’s your story? You look very 
                        confident with a gun, Garrett.

                                 GARRETT
                        ...I was a private. First class.

                                 TOM
                        No kidding. Really?
                             (takes a swig)
                        You fight in the big one? Well tell 
                        me about it. See, right now, out 
                        there, they don’t know you’re a war 
                        hero.

           Garrett looks in his eyes. War hero... that sounds nice.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        I just wanna tell your story.

           He offers the flask to Garrett, who takes it.

                                 GARRETT
                        Don’t you have to shit?

                                 TOM
                        It’s working it’s way.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THE FILLING STATION HOUSE - NIGHT

           A cramped room in the home adjoining the filling station.

           Clay, Jack and Sarah sit at a small table with the filling 
           station ATTENDANT, his mother the portly woman and a ONE YEAR-
           OLD BABY GIRL. Everyone eats stew and bread - but Jack and 
           Sarah eat greedily, alternating sips of milk from tin cups.

           Clay is looking out the window until -

                                 PORTLY WOMAN
                        When’s the last time you ate? Why 
                        you must’ve been positively 
                        starving.

                                 ATTENDANT
                        Ma, leave ‘em be.

                                 PORTLY WOMAN
                        I’m just askin’ a question.
                                 CLAY
                        I thank you for the meal.

                                 ATTENDANT
                        It’s nothing. We seen all them 
                        Okies comin’ through, just wantin’ 
                        work, down on their luck. There 
                        isn’t a whole heck of a lot to hold 
                        on to these days.

           His mother nods in agreement. The young baby girl watches 
           everyone else, just about as complacent as your average 
           American living through this great depression.

           Clay sees the look on Jack’s face, and follows his eyes -

           BLOODBATH IN LINCOLN COUNTY. The headline on the Eureka 
           County Sentinel newspaper that’s sitting by the door.

                                 ATTENDANT
                        Where you headed on your journey?

           And the attendant turns, sees what they’re looking at.

                                 ATTENDANT
                        You heard about that?

                                 CLAY
                        About what?

                                 ATTENDANT
                        You heard about Clay Dering?

           Clay just holds the tin cup of milk, he was about to take a 
           sip. But now... frozen.

                                 ATTENDANT
                             (proudly)
                        Nevada’s got her own public enemy 
                        now. Nobody knows what he looks 
                        like but he’s a cold killer.

                                 PORTLY WOMAN
                        Oh, Sam. I wish you wouldn’t 
                        subscribe to that movie gangster 
                        garbage.

                                 ATTENDANT
                        It’s on the radio all day. They 
                        killed ten police in cold blood, no 
                        problem. They were in Lennock 
                        yesterday. Bet it’s on right now.
           He reaches over and turns on the radio.

           FLETCHER HENDERSON’S HENDERSON STOMP is playing. Just about 
           the last thing Clay or Jack wants to hear. The baby CRIES.

                                 PORTLY WOMAN
                        Turn that down, it’s supper.

           He does. It plays quietly while he coos to his baby girl.

                                 PORTLY WOMAN
                             (to Clay)
                        So where were you saying you were 
                        headed?

                                 CLAY
                        ...Texas.

                                 PORTLY WOMAN
                        Texas? For work? You’re goin’ the 
                        wrong direction. Haven’t they been 
                        hit by the dust?

                                 CLAY
                        We got family there. Far south.

                                 ATTENDANT
                             (re: Sarah)
                        She’s very pretty.

                                 CLAY
                        Yes she is.

                                 JACK
                        I’m sorry, I don’t mean to 
                        interrupt. But this would all be 
                        much livelier with a drink in my 
                        hand, don’t you think?

                                 ATTENDANT
                        Oh, we got a dry house here. Ever 
                        since Mary departed, I try to live 
                        right by her.

           The attendant’s mother looks on at her son proudly. And the 
           attendant respectfully turns the radio off. It’s quiet.

                                 JACK
                             (dry)
                        That’s very admirable.
                                 ATTENDANT (CONT’D)
                             (to Clay)
                        When you lose the woman you love, 
                        you know, all you feel is hurt and 
                        alone... but you’re not alone, you 
                        got family, that’s what matters.

                                 MOTHER
                        Amen.

                                 JACK
                        Amen.

           Clay nods, gulps some milk. And looks out the window -

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. AT THE WOODS’ EDGE - LATER

           Clay, Jack and Sarah crunch through the brittle grass back to 
           dying embers. No one around the fire.

                                 JACK
                        Should we look for ‘em?

                                 CLAY
                        Nah.

                                 JACK
                        What if they got caught?

                                 CLAY
                             (looking out at the woods)
                        They didn’t.

           INT. BARN - NIGHT

           It’s dark in the barn. The dead of the night.

           Quiet at first. Then some light scuffling noises.

           A shape sleeps under a wool blanket on a sparse bed of dried 
           grass. And Sarah approaches the shape, tip-toeing.

           She lays out a blanket next to the lump.

           Lays down.

           Slides closer to the shape - closer to Clay.

           She’s near enough to breathe his sleeping breaths -
           But Clay looks at Sarah, he’s been awake this whole time. 
           Sarah looks into his eyes, searching for something. This 
           conversation plays out slowly and quietly.

                                 SARAH
                        I saw you cry. I don’t ever cry. 
                        You know that? Were you crying 
                        cause Will’s dead?

                                 CLAY
                        Go to bed.

                                 SARAH
                        I don’t have any friends. Now 
                        you’re like me.
                             (beat)
                        Why’d you say I’m pretty?

                                 CLAY
                        I didn’t.

                                 SARAH
                        Yeah you did, you said I’m pretty.

                                 CLAY
                        The gas station man said that.

                                 SARAH
                        He said, “She’s very pretty.” And 
                        you said, “Yes she is.” Did you 
                        always think I’m pretty?

           She slides closer to him.

                                 CLAY
                        Yes I did.

                                 SARAH
                        Even when you were with Annie?

           He looks at her. Not wanting to answer that.

                                 SARAH
                        Do you think...

                                 CLAY
                        Do I think what?

                                 SARAH
                        Do you think we’re all gonna die?

                                 CLAY
                        Yes.
                                 SARAH
                        I mean do you think we’re gonna die 
                        soon? Cause the police’ll come 
                        after us, and try to kill us?

                                 CLAY
                        Probably sooner than later.

                                 SARAH
                        I think I might like that. I wanna 
                        die young. You know I never done it 
                        with anyone, though. This floor’s 
                        rough. It’s hard sleeping without a 
                        pillow.

           She comes closer to him, they are touching now.

                                 SARAH
                        Brr. You weren’t really going to 
                        leave me.

                                 CLAY
                        Why are you talkin’ now? You ain’t 
                        talked for three days...

                                 SARAH
                        Cause now we both got nobody.

           Her chin is on his chest. She looks up at him.

           A dark shape is under another blanket in the corner. JACK. 
           He’s not moving and is hard to see from here.

           Sarah looks in Clay’s eyes, a long, meaningful, anxious, 
           oppressive silence.

           K-CHUNK!

           The barn door opens -

           Sarah spins quickly away from Clay and pretends to be asleep.

           Tom and Garrett stumble in, boots scuffling on the dirt.

           INT. BEDROOM - CHICAGO TENAMENT - DAWN

           Melvin Purvis sits up in bed, his wife asleep beside him. 
           Through the cold window, he watches the outside world, 
           wondering what it holds in store for him today.
           INT. PRINTING PRESS - LOS ANGELES - EARLY MORNING

           It’s before dawn in the Los Angeles Examiner printing press.

           A WORKER walks into the room, he flicks on the light. He sets 
           down a set of plates by the machine.

           The printing press TOWERS over the room, its potential for 
           action awe-inspiring. It has the power to change policies, to 
           affect politics, business, family life -- and all of that 
           power is pregnant in its stillness.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Several workers set the plates into the machine. The presses 
           are started.

           They print the cover page:

           A NEW PUBLIC ENEMY!

           And beside it, LARGE, is CLAY’S MUGSHOT.

           EXT. THE FILLING STATION - DAWN

           The pale morning sun climbs over the hills of Eureka. The 
           filling station is not yet open.

           INT. BARN - MOMENTS LATER

                                 CLAY (O.C.)
                             (quietly)
                        Garrett -

           Garrett is fast asleep on the barn floor, a thin wool blanket 
           clutched beneath his chin. Clay prods at his shoulder.

                                 CLAY (O.C.)
                        Garrett. Wake up.

           Garrett rouses, he casts a suspicious, sleepy eye on Clay. 
           Who pushes a tin can of beans toward him. Clay whispers very 
           quietly and Garrett follows suit:

                                 CLAY
                        Where’d you go last night?

                                 GARRETT
                        Last night? Nowhere.
                                 CLAY
                        Nowhere? He took an awful long 
                        shit.

                                 GARRETT
                        I got lost, I didn’t wanna yell.  
                        Where’s the reporter?

                                 CLAY
                        He’s sleeping.

                                 GARRETT
                        You talk to him?

                                 CLAY
                        He don’t carry his half of a 
                        conversation too well with his eyes 
                        shut.

                                 GARRETT
                        I’ll wake him.

           Garrett starts to get up. Clay puts a hand on his chest.

                                 CLAY
                        We’re gonna leave him here.

                                 GARRETT
                        Here? In Eureka? We’re not gonna 
                        take him?

           Clay just looks curious. Garrett, a fidgeting liar.

                                 GARRETT (CONT’D)
                        That’s good, I guess. He seemed, 
                        last night, he was saying things - 
                        I don’t know if I trust him, 
                        y’know?

                                 CLAY
                        He said things? What’d he say?

                                 GARRETT
                        He said things like, like he was, 
                        well he didn’t say anything, 
                        actually. You just get that 
                        feelin’, where you can’t trust 
                        somebody?

           Clay watches Garrett, who continues on, nervously -

                                 GARRETT (CONT’D)
                        Are you gonna wake him?
                                 CLAY
                        Eat up.

           Garrett looks down at the beans. He starts greedily stuffing 
           them into his mouth, like it might be his last meal.

           Tom sleeps on the other side of the room.

           CLOSE ON TOM:

           Sleeping, Tom looks sickly and cold, a hangover pounding at 
           his skull. He wakes and turns on his side.

           THE BARN IS EMPTY. We realize now that it is much later than 
           the previous scene - the sun has moved a great deal.

           Just the flask sitting on the floor before Tom, like a 
           farewell offering. He picks it up as -

           He jumps to his feet, runs out of the barn. He pulls on his 
           shoes - untied and barely clinging to his feet.

           EXT. OUTSIDE THE BARN - CONTINUOUS

           The car is gone, tire tracks leading away in the grass.

           Tom starts running for -

           INT. THE FILLING STATION

           Tom bursts into the filling station office.

                                 TOM
                        Where’d they go?

           The attendant’s mother looks up at him from the rocking chair 
           in the corner. The baby is in her lap.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Where did they go!? The men, the 
                        girl, the fucking dopes with guns! 
                        They buried a man in your backyard - 
                        Lady! Where did they go? Jesus 
                        Christ.

           The baby is crying now.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Lady!
           She looks terrified, cupping the infant’s ears.

           CRASH! In a rage, Tom swipes the oil cans off the counter and 
           they clatter over the floor. The baby screams its head off. 

           The attendant enters from outside -

                                 ATTENDANT
                        What the hell’s goin’ on here?

                                 TOM
                        Where’d they go?

                                 ATTENDANT
                        You gonna pick that up?

                                 TOM
                        Look, the men who stayed here last 
                        night. They’ve killed many people, 
                        they’re bad men. They’re running 
                        from the police and you let them 
                        go. You understand? I need to know 
                        where they’re going, right now.

                                 ATTENDANT
                        You’re sayin’ they killed people?

           Tom grabs a newspaper off the stack by the door -

                                 TOM
                        You see that?

           He shoves the “BLOODBATH” headline in the attendant’s face.

                                 ATTENDANT
                        Yes I do.

                                 MOTHER
                        They’re goin’ to Texas!

                                 ATTENDANT
                        Ma!

                                 TOM
                        Texas? That’s it?

                                 MOTHER
                        They just said Texas. That’s all!

                                 TOM
                        Your dress looks like a picnic 
                        table.
           He exits.

           EXT. THE FILLING STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Tom walks out into the empty front lot. Looks east. Looks 
           west. No hints of where the car might’ve gone.

           He walks to the roadside. Not a car in sight. Stranded.

           He reaches into his pocket but something makes him grimace. 
           There is a mess on his hand, he tries to wipe it off but 
           suddenly realizes -

           He takes the metal flask back out of his pocket. On its back, 
           written by finger dipped in MESSY BEANS, is part of a word:

           ‘CPFEDE’

           Tom traces his finger back across where his own hand smudged 
           it, and recreates what was originally written...

           ‘CREEDE’ - scrawled in a crude hand. Garrett’s.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ALLEY - CHICAGO - DAY

           A shadowed Chicago alley. Fire escapes and trash cans.

                                 A YOUNG BOY
                        BANG! BANG! Stop running I got you!

                                 A GAP-TOOTHED BOY
                        No you didn’t!

           The gap-toothed boy runs to the edge of the alley where -

           THUD!

           EXT. HOT DOG CART - CHICAGO - CONTINUOUS

           He bumps into Melvin Purvis at a sidewalk hot dog cart. 
           Melvin sees the wooden toy gun in the boy’s hand.

                                 MELVIN PURVIS
                        Uh oh. Are you a police officer?

                                 A GAP-TOOTHED BOY
                        Freeze!
           Melvin plays along, putting up his hands.

                                 A GAP-TOOTHED BOY
                        Hand it over. I’m Clay Dering!

           Melvin drops his hands, play time’s over. Conrad Hall smirks 
           as Melvin pays the HOT DOG VENDOR.

                                 MELVIN PURVIS
                        Go play somewhere else, son.

                                 CONRAD HALL
                        Everyone knows ‘em. Forget bein’ a 
                        movie star, just rob a bank, kill a 
                        couple cops. Say aren’t you worried 
                        you might be feeding the beast?

                                 MELVIN PURVIS
                        You gotta feed the beast before you 
                        kill it.

           Conrad receives his hot dog, they start walking.

                                 MELVIN PURVIS
                        Hoover wants my job. The man says 
                        I’ve become a liability.

                                 CONRAD HALL
                        You think that’s maybe true?

                                 MELVIN PURVIS
                        If he wants my job he can come take 
                        it from me.

           EXT. CHICAGO FBI OFFICE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           Just as Melvin is about to open the door to the Chicago field 
           office building, another AGENT bursts out -

                                 THE OTHER AGENT
                        Mel! You got a phone call.

           They lock eyes. The agent is out of breath.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CHICAGO FBI OFFICE - PHONE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Melvin sits at a desk, the receiver gripped tight to his ear, 
           he looks across at the AGENT who mans a huge REEL TO REEL 
           WIRE RECORDER. Melvin waits a moment, the agent RECORDS...
                                 MELVIN PURVIS
                        Hello?

           EXT. FILLING STATION - SIMULTANEOUS

           Tom Pickett is on a wood-mounted payphone outside the filling 
           station. We INTERCUT between Purvis and Tom as they speak:

                                 TOM
                        Hello.

                                 MELVIN PURVIS
                        Who’s this?

                                 TOM
                        Is this Melvin Purvis?

                                 MELVIN PURVIS
                        Who’s this?

                                 TOM
                        This is Tom Pickett.

                                 MELVIN PURVIS
                        What’re you calling about, Tom?

                                 TOM
                        Well, Mel, if I’ve got you on the 
                        line you must know what I’m calling 
                        about already.

                                 MELVIN PURVIS
                        ...Where are you calling from?

                                 TOM
                             (dry)
                        A phone booth.

           Melvin pauses. He doesn’t much like talking with asses, but 
           he does like outsmarting them. Tom listens close -

           ...  the recorder hums and grinds as the reels spin  ...

                                 TOM
                        You want me to sing a song?

           Melvin looks at the agent at the wire recorder, he points at 
           the man’s coat, the man looks confused... 

           Finally Melvin grabs his own coat off the seat back, hands it 
           to the agent and indicates to him that he should -
           COVER THE MACHINE WITH THE JACKET. He does. Tom just hears 
           silence on the line.

                                 MELVIN PURVIS
                        Mr. Pickett. What are you calling 
                        for?

                                 TOM
                        I know where Clay Dering’s going.

                                 MELVIN PURVIS
                             (yeah right)
                        Is that right, where’s he going?

                                 TOM
                        It sounds like you don’t believe 
                        me. I mean, it’s a bit like a boy 
                        telling his father he doesn’t 
                        believe in Santa Claus and then 
                        asking, “Where are the presents?”

                                 MELVIN PURVIS
                        I think you should consider whether 
                        you want to waste my time right 
                        now.

                                 TOM
                        Clay Dering has three accomplices: 
                        two men and a teenaged girl. One’s 
                        drunk, one’s crazy, one’s fifteen. 
                        He has pale eyes; a strong chin 
                        that’s a little cleft; thick 
                        eyebrows; straight dirty hair; he’s 
                        got a scar on his neck about as 
                        wide as a pinky, he also has a dark 
                        birthmark just below his right eye. 
                        Yesterday he was in Lennock, 
                        Nevada, he killed three men who 
                        wanted your reward very badly. You 
                        can stop recording now, I’m really 
                        not going to tell you anything you 
                        don’t already know.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Mel, how quickly can you have some 
                        of these backwood cops pick me up 
                        and take me to a train station?

           Melvin looks around the room: Conrad Hall, a few agents. The 
           air is thick and stale, hard to breathe.
                                 MELVIN PURVIS
                        I don’t know, Tom. I’m not sure the 
                        police want to be your car service.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        That’s too bad. Cause once I’m on 
                        that train, you’ll know where I’m  
                        going.

                                 MELVIN PURVIS
                        And I suppose you want the reward?

                                 TOM
                        Well, I’m not gonna laugh at two-
                        thousand dollars. But I want to be 
                        there for the shootout. I want 
                        exclusive photographs. And I assume 
                        you’ll give me an interview as 
                        well, is that right?

           Tom pops a mint in his mouth. He watches a mangy dog walk 
           into and out of the road. No cars in sight just now.

                                 MELVIN PURVIS
                        You could tell me where they’re 
                        going now and I’ll meet you there.

                                 TOM
                        Let’s not ruin the surprise, Mel. 
                        I’m at the Socal gas pumps off 
                        Squire Road in Eureka, Nevada.

                                 MELVIN PURVIS
                        I’ll see you soon, Tom.

                                 TOM
                        See you soon, Mel.

           Click.

                                                                CUT TO:

           I/E. TOM’S CAR - ON THE ROAD TO CREEDE - LATE IN THE DAY

           The car is lightly rumbling on the road. Sarah’s asleep in 
           the backseat, next to Clay. Clay looks out at the Rockies.

           A majestic sight. Nature abounds. Great distant stone peaks 
           towering over an untouchable expanse of white. Clay is close 
           enough to taste it.
           Jack drives. Garrett stares at the dashboard, lost inside.

                                 CLAY (V.O.)
                        Garrett... Garrett.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           I/E. TOM’S FORD - PARKED OUTSIDE AN INN - EVENING

           It is dusk. Garrett is asleep in the front seat. Everyone 
           else is getting out of the parked car.

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        Garrett.

           He wakes.

                                 CLAY
                        Get us a room, alright?

                                 GARRETT
                             (groggily)
                        You could say please once in a 
                        while, y’know.

                                 CLAY
                        Just get a room with some beds. And 
                        take Sarah with you. Don’t give ‘em 
                        your name.

           Garrett stares at Clay, an icy disobedience.

                                 SARAH
                        Where are you going?

                                 CLAY
                        I’m goin’ someplace I don’t want 
                        you to go.

           Before them:

           CREEDE at dusk. A lightly frosted street, dangling electric 
           lights begin to glow, and the street is full of activity.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. INN - NIGHT

           Garrett and Sarah walk into the small inn, Garrett hides the 
           rifle behind his back as he stutters in.
                                 GARRETT
                        We need a room.

           The INN KEEPER (55) behind the desk looks at Garrett with a 
           judging eye - after all, it looks like a nearly forty year-
           old man is bedding an adolescent.

                                 INN KEEPER
                        Two?

                                 GARRETT
                        What are you makin’ faces about? 
                        How much is it?

                                 INN KEEPER
                        Five dollars a night.

                                 GARRETT
                        We’ll pay you in the morning.

           The inn keeper is noticeably unhappy about that arrangement, 
           but the glimpse of the rifle and the wild glint in Garrett’s 
           eye keep him in silent agreement.

                                 GARRETT
                        Key?

           The Inn Keeper slides him a key.

                                 INN KEEPER
                        Upstairs, first on your left.

           Garrett waits for Sarah to walk, then follows her upstairs. 
           The inn keeper watches suspiciously.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THE HOME - TAVERN - BAR

           Clay and Jack are at the bar in THE HOME - Annie’s new 
           workplace. The room is rowdy, smoke-filled and loud. Pale 
           thighs hiding behind short skirts, flirtatious smiles...

                                 CLAY
                        I’m lookin’ for Annie.

           The BARTENDER (30s) is sweaty, unshaven, looks like he’s been 
           working since dawn.

                                 JACK
                        Whiskey sour.
           The bartender pours as he talks -

                                 BARTENDER
                        Annie? Remind me.

                                 CLAY
                        Dark hair, she’s got a pretty face.

           And Jack starts eagerly drinking the whiskey sour.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Well, that could describe just 
                        about anyone. All we got is pretty 
                        faces, half of ‘em got dark hair.

                                 CLAY
                        She’s half-indian.

           A flash of recognition. The bartender looks down at the bar 
           for an untraceable instant -

                                 BARTENDER
                        Nah, she i’nt here. Can I get ya a 
                        drink?

           Clay looks down at the RED HANDKERCHIEF on the bar.

                                 CLAY
                        What was that?

                                 BARTENDER
                        Nothin’.

           The bartender turns to walk away, but Clay lunges out and 
           grabs him by the shirt. Drunks at the bar turn to look.

           Clay just looks the man dead in the eyes.

                                 JACK
                        Clay, he don’t know ‘er.

                                 CLAY
                        I’m in a very delicate state.

                                 A WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        You’re looking for Annie?

           Clay turns to see THE MATRON behind the bar. He releases his 
           deathgrip. The matron’s smoky voice is a slow poison.

                                 THE MATRON
                        She’s not here.
                                 CLAY
                        Where is she?

                                 THE MATRON
                        I don’t know, honey. The fact is, 
                        Annie never came. All I got was a 
                        letter saying she’d decided to look 
                        elsewhere and would in fact not be 
                        coming to Creede.

           Clay’s heart sinks.

                                 THE MATRON (CONT’D)
                        I guess she felt life had bigger 
                        things in store for her.
                             (beat)
                        ...There are some quieter bars 
                        across the street.

           Jack downs the rest of his drink.

           Clay looks around the room. The people seem alien, from some 
           place where it makes sense to smile and laugh and be merry.

           LILA, the girl who enthusiastically greeted Annie when she 
           first arrived, watches from afar.

           And now Clay has fixated on the GRANDFATHER CLOCK. It’s 
           pendulum goes -

           TICK... TICK... TICK... the sound continues over:

           INT. TRAIN - RIO GRANDE LINE - NIGHT

           A SLOW ZOOM ON: Tom. Sitting on the train. Eager and content. 
           His camera sits next to him, his only friend.

           INT. CHICAGO FBI OFFICE - NIGHT

           TICK... TICK... TICK... is all we hear as:

           Melvin rounds up his men, giving orders. Agents are putting 
           on coats. It’s night, but the day is just beginning.

           INT. A POOL HALL BAR - CREEDE - NIGHT

           WE MOVE SLOWLY IN ON: A man’s back at the lively Creede bar. 
           His shoulders drooped, his coat dirty.
           It’s Garrett. He looks shiftily about at the people having a 
           grand time around him. An untouched whiskey in front of him. 
           And he watches the radio, its glowing, pulsing light.

           TICK... TICK... TICK...

           He holds the gun tight at his waist, and a drunk PATRON bumps 
           into him. We can see the patron’s mouth move:

                                 PATRON (SILENT)
                        Watch where you’re goin’, asshole.

           Garrett is a kettle about to boil. TICK... TICK... TICK...

           And then SILENCE.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. INN - LATE NIGHT

           Midnight. Jack stumbles up the stairs, Clay sober behind him. 
           Jack is five drinks past oblivion.

           He slugs from a METAL FLASK as they reach the top of the 
           stairs. But Clay has stopped several steps behind.

                                 JACK
                        What’s a matter?

                                 CLAY
                             (re: the flask)
                        Where’d you get that?

                                 JACK
                        Pawned it off the bar.

                                 CLAY
                        Let me see it.

           Jack hands Clay the flask. Clay looks at it, tips it back, 
           and drinks. Not stopping... drinking like a camel.

                                 JACK
                        See, you don’t need no cunt. You 
                        got your friends. And we’re gonna 
                        survive all this together.

           Clay lumbers up the final few steps. Jack looks at the doors, 
           not sure which is right. He stops by the door nearest him.

                                 JACK
                        Garrett?
           For good measure, he grabs the door knob. It opens with ease.

           INT. BEDROOM - THE HUMBLE INN - CONTINUOUS

           The room is dark. Empty.

                                 JACK
                        Wrong room.

           He’s about to close the door, when he hears something:

           CRYING.

           There is a dark shape in the corner, by the wall. Clay flicks 
           on the light.

           SARAH IS ALONE IN A CHAIR AGAINST THE WALL.

                                 CLAY
                        Where’s Garrett?

           No answer.

                                 CLAY
                        Sarah.

           She turns to look at him. Her right eye is bruised badly. 
           Clay’s face goes mean in an instant.

                                 CLAY
                        Where’d he go?

                                 SARAH
                        I don’t know.

                                 CLAY
                        He take the guns?

                                 SARAH
                        I don’t know.

           Clay comes and puts an arm around her, she clings to him.

                                 CLAY
                        What he do to you?
                             (beat)
                        It doesn’t matter.

                                 SARAH
                        You smell like whiskey.
           He turns his face away from her and looks at Jack, who is 
           staring dumbfounded from across the room. Sarah’s hair is 
           soft beneath Clay’s chin, it feels good to hold a young woman 
           so close. Then, faintly, from downstairs they hear -

           A DOOR OPENING.

           Clay stands up and walks to the door.

           FOOTSTEPS COMING UP THE STAIRS.

           Garrett comes up into the hall.

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - THE HUMBLE INN - CONTINUOUS

           Clay confronts him outside the room. Garrett seems wired.

                                 GARRETT
                             (a cheshire grin)
                        We’re on the radio.

                                 CLAY
                        Where you been?

                                 GARRETT
                        Don’t you wanna know what they 
                        said? We’re Public Enemy Number 
                        One. Walter Winchell called us a 
                        gang!

           Garrett starts to walk toward the room. Clay puts a hand up 
           to block him. And Garrett begins a confession:

                                 GARRETT
                        Clay... I’m in trouble.

                                 CLAY
                        Are ya?

                                 GARRETT
                        I got into a scrap.

           Garrett shows Clay his hand, his knuckles are bleeding.

                                 CLAY
                        Is that it?

                                 GARRETT
                        Yeah, hey, could I sit down?

           Garrett takes a step but Clay grabs him by the collar and 
           shoves him backward til he HITS THE WALL HARD.
                                 GARRETT
                        Alright! What gives? Don’t push me!

                                 CLAY
                        Don’t push you!?

           As he talks, Clay shakes Garrett, shoving him against the 
           wall twice more.

           Garrett pulls the REVOLVER and points it in Clay’s face. Clay 
           glares at him - all trust lost. CLICK - he pulls back the 
           hammer.

           The door opens down the hall. An INN CUSTOMER (40) comes out 
           of his room dressed in a night gown, ready to complain, that 
           is until he sees the gun in Clay’s face and promptly slinks 
           back in his room, LOCKING THE DOOR.

                                 GARRETT
                        I said don’t push me.

                                 CLAY
                        Some pal.

                                 GARRETT
                        They wouldn’t believe me. They 
                        wouldn’t believe it was my gang. 
                        You know what they called us? The 
                        Dering Gang. The Clay Dering Gang. 
                        How do you think that makes me 
                        feel?

                                 CLAY
                        Pull the trigger. You fuckin’ 
                        coward.

           For a good long while, Garrett holds the gun under Clay’s 
           nose and for a good long while, Clay stares at Garrett.

           Until Garrett lowers the gun, losing courage.

           Clay takes it.

           A tense silence.

                                 CLAY
                        What you do to Sarah?

           Garrett’s clueless. Clay searches his eyes. Sarah watches as -

           Clay CLOCKS Garrett in the face with the gun. BAM! Again and 
           again - Garrett falls back to the ground, bleeding.
           Clay is still on him, hitting him.

                                 CLAY
                        You don’t touch her, y’understand!?

           Garrett catches Clay across the face, Clay bats him away -

                                 GARRETT
                             (catching his breath)
                        I didn’t touch her!

           Clay raises the revolver again, pointing at Garrett -

                                 GARRETT
                        Clay!
                             (beat)
                        I didn’t touch that girl, Clay! Who 
                        d’you think I am? She was actin’ a 
                        bitch, so I shut her in and told 
                        her to stay put.

                                 CLAY
                        That’s all you did, huh?

                                 GARRETT
                        She said you was gonna get married. 
                        She was actin’ a bitch, Clay. She 
                        said I was too stupid to keep with 
                        you.

                                 CLAY
                        So you struck her? Fifteen year old 
                        girl?

           Garrett looks genuinely confused.

                                 GARRETT
                        I didn’t struck her.

                                 CLAY
                        You got that bloody knuckle.

                                 GARRETT
                        I got into a bad scrap, I told ya!

           Clay looks back into the room at Sarah. She looks away, 
           caught lying. He stands, letting go of Garrett and the gun.

           Garrett feels the blood flowing from his nose. It’s slick and 
           inky on his fingertips. He looks at the gun on the floor, all 
           by itself.
           Clay collects his senses, picks up the gun and walks back 
           into the room.

           Garrett gets up, shaky on his feet and walks in the door.

           As he does, Jack offers him the flask. He doesn’t take it. 

           Clay stands next to Sarah, puts his hand on her face, he 
           thumbs at the bruise beneath her eye. It smudges.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BEDROOM - THE HUMBLE INN - LATER

                                 GARRETT
                        I hit ‘em. I hit ‘em with the gun. 
                        I hit ‘em with my fists. And I kept 
                        hittin’ ‘em til I couldn’t see no 
                        face no more. On account of the 
                        blood and his nose was broke, I 
                        think. Some of his friends was 
                        watching, but I think maybe they 
                        didn’t wanna come on, cause I had 
                        the gun.

           Clay sits in a chair by the window, his head in his hands. 
           Garrett sits on a trunk, hands folded, while Jack leans 
           against the wall and Sarah hugs her knees on the bed.

                                 CLAY
                        How many friends did he have?

                                 GARRETT
                        The place was mostly full.

                                 CLAY
                        You tell ‘em all you were in a 
                        gang?

           Garrett looks down. The answer is yes. Clay gulps the metal 
           flask again. He’s getting drunk.

           He looks at Sarah. She looks away.

                                 GARRETT
                        Where’s Annie?

           Garrett looks from Clay to Jack, who shakes his head.

                                 CLAY
                        Sun’s comin’ up. I ain’t even 
                        tired.
           It’s quiet.

           The pale, haunting light of a winter dawn creeps over the 
           street outside. Everyone allows Clay quiet to think.

           THE SOUND OF THE INN DOOR OPENING DOWNSTAIRS. SEVERAL HEAVY-
           BOOTED FOOTSTEPS.

           Clay is alert. The footsteps grow in number. Clay opens the 
           revolver’s chamber, checking the bullets. But something 
           catches his attention:

           One of the bullets has been fired. Clay pulls out the empty 
           casing and looks over at Garrett, piecing it together. He 
           gets up, crosses the room and reaches into Jack’s coat.

           He fishes out some bullets. Puts some in his pocket and pops 
           one in the revolving chamber.

           The empty casing drops to the ground.

           The footsteps are getting louder - and there’s WHISPERING.

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - THE HUMBLE INN - DAWN

           Clay sneaks to the top of the stairs. As he gets there -

           A MAN WITH A BEARD (30s) is stepping onto the bottom steps, 
           he looks up and makes eye contact with Clay -

           Clay points the gun -

           The man quickly backs off the stairs and out of sight -

           THE FOOTSTEPS AND WHISPERING STOP.

                                 CLAY
                        Who’s there?

           Quiet...

           INT. DC 3 AIRPLANE - MIDAIR - DAY

           A MAN in a ruffled black wool suit sits on a shakey DC-3 
           airplane. The plane is shaking like a tin can. The man’s leg 
           twitches, antsy. In the seat behind him:

           Melvin Purvis. Melvin is serene in comparison. He looks out 
           the window, just a cloudy fog. There is a gun in a holster on 
           the seat next to him.
           K-THUMP! The wheels touch ground, every other agent is 
           clutching his seat in terror. Melvin has been through it 
           before. He waits.

           The cockpit door opens.

                                 MELVIN PURVIS
                        Alright men. You’re all alive. But 
                        despite how you may feel, this was 
                        not the most dangerous part of 
                        trip.

           The agents laugh nervously.

                                 MELVIN PURVIS (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go get ‘em.

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - THE HUMBLE INN - SAME

           Clay looks down the stairs, the revolver clutched in his 
           trigger hand.

                                 CLAY
                        I said who’s there?

                                 A MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Who’s askin’?

                                 CLAY
                        This is Clay Dering.

           DEAD QUIET.

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        You know who I am?

           EVEN QUIETER.

           Jack, Garrett and Sarah watch him... Clay slowly sets his 
           foot on the first step of the staircase. It CREAKS.

           He steps again -

           THE SHUFFLING OF FEET DOWNSTAIRS.

           Pointing the gun, he comes down several more steps, and peeks 
           around the corner. He sees legs, boots, he peeks further...

           SEVEN MEN in the lobby. ONE of them looks bruised, battered.

           A POSSE.
           The men hold rifles and shotguns.

           Clay comes around the corner, the gun down at his side -

           INT. LOBBY - THE HUMBLE INN - CONTINUOUS

           He faces them directly. They don’t fire. Or move.

           ONE AT A TIME, WE SEE THE MEN DOWNSTAIRS IN CLOSE UP:

           They are shaky, sweaty, anxious. Barrel-chested men of strong 
           working stock. The beaten one has a swollen jaw and scabbing 
           lips, his nose is broken. He looks at Clay through bloodshot 
           green eyes.

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - THE HUMBLE INN - SAME

           Jack is in the hallway now, quietly watching Clay below.

           And Garrett and Sarah watch Jack from the room, Sarah’s heart 
           beating like a jack rabbit’s.

           INT. LOBBY - THE HUMBLE INN - SAME

           Clay speaks slowly.

                                 CLAY
                        You don’t know the first thing 
                        about death. But you’re all scared 
                        of it.

           Clay steps down off the stairs, and walks slowly...

                                 A BEARDED MAN
                        Stay where you are!

           Clay keeps walking... to the beaten man.

                                 CLAY
                        You angry?

           The man glares. Yes. Angry.

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        Me too.

           Clay looks around the room at the men, making eye contact 
           with them. Their hands are on their guns. Twitchy, nervous. 
           He has their fear and respect.
           BANG! The beaten man crumples forward toward Clay - his knee 
           has been shot out. Clay grabs him, holding him up - he digs 
           the revolver into his gut. The man is SCREAMING IN AGONY.

                                 CLAY
                        Do you want me to kill him or do 
                        you wanna leave?

                                 ONE OF THE MEN
                        Let ‘em go!

                                 CLAY
                        I can’t do that. Put down your guns 
                        if y’all don’t wanna die. Put ‘em 
                        down.

           He starts walking toward the men, pushing the beaten man. One 
           by one, the men put their guns down and file out backwards.

                                 CLAY
                             (to the screaming man)
                        You’re gonna be alright.

           He walks him toward the open door, helps him to sit down 
           outside. He points the gun at the posse on the street.

                                 CLAY
                        Get back!

           He quickly stalks back in, shutting the door.

           The inn keeper, still in pajamas, peeks carefully out of the 
           door behind the lobby desk. He makes eye contact with Clay 
           and shuts the door.

           INT. THE HOME - BEDROOM

           Annie finishes peeling last night’s makeup from her face. She 
           looks in the mirror, and yet can’t seem to see herself.

           INT. THE HOME - TAVERN

           Annie descends the steps into the parlor. The room is a husk 
           of what it was last night. And Annie approaches Lila, who 
           sits alone, looking puffy, a mug of hot chocolate in her 
           hand. Lila looks at Annie without even saying good morning:

                                 LILA
                        He was here last night.
                                 ANNIE
                        Who was here last night?

                                 LILA
                        Clay Dering.

           And Lila flips the newspaper in her hand.

           Clay’s sour face in black and white.

           I/E. DODGE TRUCK - MOVING - MORNING

           Melvin Purvis sits in the backseat of a sturdy 1934 Dodge. 
           Four other agents in the truck. He looks out at the buildings 
           as the car pulls into Creede. There is an anticipation in the 
           air, nobody talking, but everyone’s mind racing.

           The car slows to a stop. Melvin looks ahead.

           There is a man in the street. Blood flowing down his leg, 
           soaking into the snow at his feet. TWO MEN are helping him 
           away from the door of THE HUMBLE INN. ANOTHER FOUR MEN watch 
           and walk alongside. After a moment’s hesitation:

                                 MELVIN PURVIS
                        Hide your guns.

           Melvin gets out of the car, the other agents with him. The 
           driver stays behind and parks a few feet ahead.

           EXT. STREET - CREEDE - CONTINUOUS

           Melvin and company carry their RIFLES and TOMMY GUNS at their 
           sides, hidden behind long coats. They cross to the corner 
           shop, casing the bloody man and his six friends.

           As TWO KIND CITIZENS rush out of a building to the bleeding 
           man’s aid, Melvin realizes the man’s not one of the killers.

           Melvin looks at inn. The blood stained snow in front of it.

                                 MELVIN PURVIS
                        The Humble Inn.

           EXT. RIO GRANDE RAIL DEPOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Tom walks down the train platform with his camera, typewriter 
           case and a bag. He looks at -
           The horse tied to a post by the stable, staring back at him. 
           Tom braces himself against the cold. And walks.

           It’s beginning to snow. Already four inches on the ground.

           EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           As Tom walks, he sees the SHERIFF’S STATION across the 
           street. A MAN IN A COAT smokes casually outside. Good. Tom 
           hasn’t missed anything.

           EXT. THE HOME - SAME

           Annie steps out of the home wrapping a scarf around her neck. 
           The snow is falling. A gentle, cascading dance of fat, 
           descending flakes. Beautiful. But the beauty is lost on her.

           She hurries down the street. Passing right by a bridal shop.

           A WEDDING DRESS in the window.

           INT. THE HUMBLE INN - SAME

           Clay’s face is mean. He’s sitting by the door staring at the 
           pot-bellied stove in the corner of the room. A glowing ember 
           is dying inside, coal gray at the edges, but a fiery heat at 
           its heart, the will to remain alight.

                                 CLAY
                        We should’ve never left home. 
                        That’s where Will would’ve wanted 
                        to be buried.

           Jack. Garrett. Sarah. Staring at him. The gun in his hand.

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        I don’t care who we have to kill. 
                        Nobody’s gonna tell me where I can 
                        and can’t live. Or what I can and 
                        cannot have. I’ll settle in 
                        Oklahoma, where men have nothing 
                        and are happy for it. We’re 
                        entitled to our way of life. And I 
                        will take others’ to keep it.

           The bloody stain in the middle of the room.

           Clay stands, puts the revolver in his coat and picks up one 
           of the discarded rifles on the ground. Garrett picks up 
           another rifle. Glad to finally have one.
           EXT. STREET - OUTSIDE THE INN - SAME

           The agents have fanned out on the street. One breathes clouds 
           of vapor into the air as he leans against a shop window, his 
           eyes on the inn. Another leans against the wall of the 
           building next to the inn, hand on his gun.

           The snow falls silently...

           Melvin stands behind the car, now parked in front of the 
           closed saloon across the street. He pretends to read a 
           newspaper. He looks up as he sees -

           Tom walks down the eerily empty street. He sees a trail of 
           blood ahead, leading from a big crimson stain outside THE 
           HUMBLE INN to the buildings across the street. A few men in 
           black coats stand suspiciously in the vicinity. Tom sees -

           Annie rounding a nearby corner and turning onto the same 
           street. She’s in a hurry on the other side of the street. But 
           she slows and looks in horror at the blood stains.

           And Tom’s smile fades as this is all becoming real. Not 
           content and eager now but anxious, tense.

           The agents’ hands all itch at their guns.

           INT. THE HUMBLE INN - SAME

           Jack looks out the lobby window. Through the warped glass he 
           can see:

           An empty street, a parked car, a man reading a newspaper.

                                 JACK
                        Nobody, Clay.

           Clay opens the door...

           EXT. STREET - OUTSIDE THE INN

           Melvin watches. Tom and Annie look at the inn.

           The door opens...

           Clay steps out first -

           Eyes open. Guns up. Clay sees motion across the street.
           Tom and Annie register his face - IT’S CLAY. But he doesn’t 
           see them as -

           BANG! RAT-A-TAT-A-TAT!

           First a rifle and then a Tommy gun fire from Clay’s left. 
           Clay ducks and aims the rifle back through falling snow -

           BANG!

           He falls back inside, Jack shutting the door behind him.

           Annie runs toward the inn, a scream trying to come out.

           INT. THE HUMBLE INN - SAME

           Jack and Sarah immediately hurry to Clay’s side. Clay touches 
           his chest, his stomach, checking to see if he’s been shot.

           His leg is bleeding all over the floor, a bullet torn into 
           his calf. Sarah clutches him, kissing his forehead.

           He gets up on his bad leg and hurries to the back of the inn, 
           Jack ahead of him. Panic has set in.

           MEANWHILE, OUTSIDE

           An agent runs alongside the house toward the backyard. He 
           carries a shotgun.

           INSIDE

           Jack opens the back door, stepping out.

           OUTSIDE - CONTINUOUS

           He sees the agent coming around the building on his right, 
           raises the handgun -

           BANG! BANG!

           The agent falls into the snow - KA-BOOM! His shotgun fires 
           into the air.

           A woman looks out of her bedroom window from across the way.
           EXT. STREET - OUTSIDE THE INN

           Annie runs along the sidewalk, trying to look into the 
           backyard.

                                 ANNIE
                        CLAY! CLAY!

           Tom watches her run, his eyes taking in everything: the 
           agents, Annie, the pedestrians further down the street.

           Melvin Purvis meanwhile runs alongside the buildings, trying 
           to flank and catch Clay’s gang on the other side.

           INT. THE HUMBLE INN

           Garrett has frozen in place in the inn. He watches Clay, Jack 
           and Sarah run off in the snow. He is breathing rapidly, 
           shocked. He turns around and walks back through the inn.

           It is oddly quiet.

           The inn owner is at the bottom of the stairs, finally having 
           come out of his room to look around. He stops at the sight of 
           Garrett, blood and five rifles laying on the lobby floor.

           DING... DING... DING... the town clock tower rings out in the 
           distance...

           EXT. BEHIND THE BUILDINGS - SAME

           DING... DING... DING...

           Clay turns as he trudges through the snow. No one behind 
           them. Garrett is gone. He continues running and they come to 
           a wooden fence.

           They must run alongside it...

           DING... DING... DING...

           The clock tower stops. Quiet now.

           They turn, running along the back of the fence, toward a side 
           street ahead. Jack is well ahead now, Clay still dragging a 
           bleeding, shot-up calf. Sarah stays with Clay, trying 
           desperately to drag him along.

                                 SARAH
                        Come on!
                                 JACK
                        Clay!

                                 CLAY
                        Go on! GO ON!

           The snow is collecting in Clay’s hair. His face has gone pale 
           and cold. Jack considers stopping for a moment but runs on, 
           leaving Sarah and Clay.

           ALONGSIDE THE BUILDING

           Jack turns left to run along the small space between two 
           buildings. Up ahead, in the street, he spots -

           TOM PICKETT.

                                 JACK
                        Hey!

           He raises his revolver. Tom freezes.

           EXT. STREET - OUTSIDE THE INN

           Garrett walks out the front door of the inn. No one around to 
           see him. He’s in no great hurry to get away. He moves slowly, 
           numb like a battered dog.

           EXT. BEHIND THE BUILDINGS

           Clay and Sarah move through the backyards. Clay’s breathing 
           is labored, every step is agony. She turns to him -

           About to tell him to hurry, but instead her eyes go wide -

           Clay turns as an AGENT rounds the fence behind them -

           BANG! Clay fires.

           The agent ducks against the fence, not wanting to fire with 
           the young girl there. Clay can sense this.

                                 CLAY
                        Get down, Sarah.

           Sarah ducks in the snow. Clay aims -

           The agent raises the tommy gun -

           BANG!
           The agent is hit in the thigh.

           RAT-A-TAT-A-TAT! He fires wildly, peppering the house nearby -

           BANG! Clay shoots again. The agent crumples in the snow. The 
           falling flakes already starting to build a blanket for him.

           He pulls the trigger again - CLICK.

           EXT. STREET - OUTSIDE THE INN

           Garrett is standing in the middle of the street. Two agents 
           approach him, guns drawn.

           Garrett turns and starts running, the agents give chase -

                                 THE FIRST AGENT
                        Freeze!

           And Garrett’s foot catches on the curb hidden under the snow, 
           he trips, the rifle pointed up, right at his chin and -

           BANG!

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. STREET

           Jack approaches Tom, pointing the revolver. He grabs Tom by 
           the scruff of the neck and starts walking him forward, a 
           hostage.

                                 JACK
                        You think I need a hostage this 
                        time?

                                 TOM
                        I think you need more than a 
                        hostage.

           ON A SIDE STREET

           Clay runs with Sarah close behind him, just the revolver in 
           his hand. They emerge onto a side street.

           Clay spots a heavily snow-covered car ahead and runs for it.

           He reaches forward and wipes the snow -

           Revealing the window underneath.
           He wipes away more, finds the handle, tugs at it.

           Frozen. He tugs again... a third time -

           CRACK. It opens.

                                 CLAY
                        Get in.

                                 SARAH
                        No.

                                 CLAY
                        Get in!

           He pushes her inside the car.

           She looks in his eyes: desperate, afraid.

                                 CLAY
                        Stay in the car, Sarah.
                             (short of breath)
                        Stay in the car.
                             (beat)
                        Sarah... You are pretty.

           He shuts the door. She looks out at him.

                                 SARAH
                        No!

           Clay bangs at the door handle with the butt of his handgun. 
           He hits it again and again until it BENDS -

           Sarah tugs desperately at the door, it won’t budge.

                                 SARAH (MUFFLED)
                        I don’t wanna stay in the car! 
                        Clay! Let me out! I don’t wanna 
                        stay in the car!

           Leaning against the door, Clay fishes bullets from his 
           pocket.

           His fingers are nearly too frozen with cold to slide them 
           into the chamber. But he does. The snow falls all around him, 
           burying everything in sight.

           He looks down, his boot filling with blood.

                                 ANNIE (O.S.)
                        CLAY!
           Clay perks up. His heart flooding.

           EXT. HOUSES

           Jack walks Tom forward at a fast clip. Tom’s camera swings in 
           his hand.

                                 JACK
                        How’d you find us?

                                 TOM
                        I’m good at what I do, Jack, and 
                        that makes one of us. I can get you 
                        out of here.

                                 JACK
                        Yeah? I heard that before.

                                 TOM
                        I’m your only way out. You have to 
                        trust me.

                                 JACK
                        Where are we supposed to go?

                                 TOM
                        Turn around.

           Tom leads Jack back in the other direction.

           I/E. THE SNOW-COVERED CAR

           Sarah tugs at the car door, it won’t give. She’s sobbing -

           EXT. THE STREET

           Clay is dozens of feet away, limping through the snow.

                                 CLAY
                        Annie!

           Silence.

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        Annie!

                                 ANNIE (O.S.)
                        Where are you!?
           EXT. ANOTHER STREET

           Annie drags herself forward through the heavy snow, her hair 
           a mess, her clothes soaked.

                                 ANNIE
                        Clay?

           EXT. BETWEEN BUILDINGS

                                 CLAY (O.S.)
                        I’m here!

           Melvin Purvis hears Clay’s voice and changes his course. He’s 
           out of breath, his lungs burning in the icy air.

           EXT. SIDEWALK

           Tom looks anxious as he leads Jack along the sidewalk. Jack’s 
           eyes are darting every which way. They’re approaching a snow 
           covered rocking chair ahead.

                                 TOM
                        Go in here.

           They turn right, open the door -

           INT. SHERIFF’S STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Tom and Jack walk right into the Sheriff’s station that Tom 
           passed earlier.

           The SHERIFF is inside, throwing on a coat, his DEPUTY beside 
           him - looking right at Tom and Jack.

           Jack turns but -

           The OFFICER by the door already has a revolver aimed at him.

           Jack drops the rifle and puts up his hands, glaring at Tom. 
           Tom wears a shit-eating grin.

           EXT. THE STREET

           Clay stumbles forward through the deluge of snow.

                                 ANNIE (O.S.)
                        Clay!
           He holds the revolver with a weakening grip.

           I/E. THE SNOW-COVERED CAR

           Sarah kicks the door -

           She pulls at the handle again, and while holding it back, 
           KICKS again.

           She’s stuck. She starts to cry.

           EXT. THE STREET

           Clay collapses against the side of a building. He leans 
           against it, sitting on his ass in the snow outside a small 
           grocery store.

           He holds his bleeding leg. His hand is covered in the blood.

           CRUNCH... CRUNCH -

           Approaching footsteps -

           Clay turns, pointing the gun -

           BANG!

           He fires -

           A POSTAL DELIVERY MAN falls in the snow, clutching the wound 
           in his gut. Clay looks at him in shame. Just an innocent man 
           on his way to work.

           CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH -

           Hurried footsteps approaching from the other direction. But 
           Clay doesn’t take his eyes off the mailman for a second...

           The approaching footsteps belong to -

           ANNIE. She sees the blood-stained snow around Clay, hurries 
           to him, drops to her knees and embraces him.

           THE STREET

           Annie caresses Clay’s face. He stares, exhausted, into her 
           eyes, at her fingertips and her lips. He’s weak in every way.

                                 ANNIE
                        Get up.
                                 CLAY
                        You smell good.

           She kisses him. Starts to help him up, he can barely stand.

           THE STREET

           Annie and Clay round the corner onto the side street. She 
           supports his weight as he limps along as quickly as he can.

           Sarah watches from inside the car as they pass her, tears 
           staining her red face.

           THE STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Melvin Purvis and AN AGENT round the corner moments after Annie 
           and Clay have walked off.

           They spot -

           The CAR with the window wiped clear.

           They stalk toward it, guns raised.

           As Melvin is about to fire, he can see a girl’s hair through 
           the window.

           Sarah is laying against the window, sobbing. Not at all what 
           Melvin was expecting.

           He peeks inside, sees that Sarah’s alone in there.

           And he follows the footsteps that lead from the car.

           OUTSIDE THE STABLE

           Annie helps Clay drag himself toward the stable next to the 
           Rio Grande train station.

           INSIDE THE STATION

           The large stable door opens as Annie and Clay enter.

           THREE HORSES sleep inside - including the horse that watched 
           Annie and Tom arrive at the station.

           Annie hurries around the room, searching for something -
           She grabs a wool horse blanket off the workbench and wraps it 
           around Clay’s shoulder.

                                 ANNIE
                        Hold this, hold it.

           She heaves a saddle onto one of the horses. Looks at Clay, 
           who looks tired, just watching her.

                                 ANNIE
                        You help now. You don’t give up.

           She points him to another saddle, hanging over a bench.

           He gathers his strength, picks it up, puts it on the horse. 
           He fastens the saddle to the horse as Annie fastens the other 
           saddle to her horse.

           Clay picks up the horse blanket he’s dropped and hugs it 
           tight around his shoulders.

                                 CLAY
                        I’m cold. Let’s just lay here.

                                 ANNIE
                        Get on that horse.

           She helps him up onto the horse, goes to open the stable 
           door, keeping an eye on the street outside.

           THE STREET OUTSIDE THE STABLE

           Melvin runs. The stable is far down the street ahead.

           IN THE STABLE

           Clay watches as Annie climbs onto the other horse.

           She readies her horse by the door, waiting for Clay to go.

                                 CLAY
                             (to the horse)
                        C’mon now. Git.

           The horse lopes lazily over to the stable door, not really 
           listening to Clay so much of moving of its own accord.

           Clay pushes the revolver deeper into his belt, so it sticks 
           close to him and won’t fall out. He holds the reins in one 
           hand, the blanket in the other.
                                 CLAY
                             (to the horse)
                        Alright, you filthy animal.

           OUTSIDE

           And Melvin is almost to the cracked open stable door...

           INSIDE

           Clay nudges the horse with his boot. It won’t move.

           He raises his boot, and gives it a good, HARD KICK -

           The horse takes off out of the stable -

           Annie kicks her horse and follows -

           OUTSIDE

           SLAM! The door blasts opens, the horse’s body beating it 
           hard. It swings toward Melvin, kicking up snow and -

           BANG!

           Melvin fires into the door, Clay and Annie flying out on 
           horseback.

           BANG!

           Melvin fires again as they gallop away. He runs around the 
           door, trying to get a better shot.

           And they’re already fifty yards away.

           EXT. RAIL LINES/SNOW

           Clay and Annie ride away along the snow-covered rail lines. 
           The snow trickles away...

           EXT. STREET - LATER

           Until the snowing has stopped completely.

           Garrett’s body lies nearly frozen, his head just a 
           splattering of blood and tissue, half-buried in snow.

           CLICK.
           Tom Pickett snaps a photo from his tripod.

           A TRIO OF CHILDREN run through the street bundled in winter 
           clothing, dragging sleds behind them.

           PEOPLE stand in snowed-in doorways, looking out.

           I/E. THE SNOW-COVERED CAR

           Sarah holds herself in a ball on the car seat as -

           An agent tears open the door on the other side.

           EXT. CREEDE, COLORADO - MORNING

           The sun shines on Creede, melting away the snow and ice.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ROADSIDE DINER - DAY

           A grease-pan diner. Eggs and pancakes served all day.

           In bold white, a title appears at the bottom of the screen:

           TOPEKA, KANSAS

           Clay and Annie are eating a breakfast of pancakes and maple 
           syrup. Clay wears sunglasses as he smiles at Annie.

           Annie puts a hand to his face, feels his cheek. She’s wearing 
           a RING on her ring finger.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Coffee?

                                 ANNIE
                        No thank you.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Sir?

                                 CLAY
                        I’m alright. Excuse me.

           Clay gets up, taps the waitress on the shoulder before she 
           gets too far.

                                 CLAY
                        Bathroom?
           She points down the restaurant, where a short hall leads 
           around a corner.

           Clay walks toward the hall.

           He looks outside as he walks. Two BLACK FORD MODEL A CARS 
           parked at the GAS PUMPS outside.

           He pays them no mind, rounds the corner.

           As he does -

           The BACK EXIT opens in front of him and a MAN DRESSED IN 
           BLACK walks in. He makes eye contact with Clay.

           Clay knows.

           He turns, looks at Annie -

           She’s being spoken to by TWO MEN DRESSED IN BLACK.

           Clay turns back -

           BANG! BANG!

           Two shots. One hits him in the chest, one in the gut, 
           piercing his liver. Other DINERS cry out in shock -

           Clay falls back against the cigarette machine.

           Annie leaps to her feet but is detained by the agents. She 
           SCREAMS - unable to move, unable to be near Clay as -

           Clay stares blankly forward. He breathes slowly, each breath 
           coming further and further apart...

           Until he breathes his last.

           Melvin Purvis stands next to the OWNER of the diner, watching 
           Clay die.

           INT. CLASSROOM - COLORADO SPRINGS - DAY

           Sarah sits in a classroom in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

           She sits, disinterested, as her OTHER CLASSMATES answer the 
           TEACHER’s questions about the Revolutionary War.
           INT. LOS ANGELES EXAMINER - DAY

           Tom Pickett walks past several desks in the Los Angeles 
           Examiner building. Heads turn as he -

           Walks into his new, corner office. He sets his things down on  
           an impressively-sized desk. He sits, breathes in, and looks 
           out over Los Angeles. New and big and great.

           INT. THE BROTHEL - NEVADA - DAY

           The brothel looks much as we last saw it, the front door is 
           open. The window’s glass is broken where it was shot out.

           Blood stains the floor where Will was shot.

           The sign on the door still reads “ORDER TO VACATE”.

           But then, something mystical happens -

           Water begins to flow into the bar.

           Slowly at first...

           It cascades across the wood floors, wiping them clean of dirt 
           and dust...

           The water picks up a bottle, bringing it floating along.

           The chairs shift, moved by its increasing force... and the 
           bar is slowly enveloped by water -

           As Lake Meade fills the bar, drowning the past.

                                                                   END.
