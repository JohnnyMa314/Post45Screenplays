                              based on several true stories

                MANAGEMENT:

                310-274-3440
                                                  OVER BLACK:

           MUSIC: A lone woman's voice sings Handel's Cara Sposa from 
           the opera Rinaldo. A mournful, heart-broken aria...

           ... The story of a brave Crusader who sets off to fight the 
           Muslim infidels but falls under the spell of a beautiful 
           enchantress. His call to duty and thirst for blood prove too 
           strong for love. And he abandons her. 

           ... The song builds to a fevered passion and continues over:

           EXT. DESERT COUNTRYSIDE, AFGHANISTAN - DAY

           Scorched, blackened fields imprisoned by gray mountains. An 
           oppressively bright day.

           A light wind shifts. The only sign of disturbance in what 
           feels like a world turned to stone and silence. And then...

           The crackle of BARE FEET against loose rocks. Bandaged. 
           Bleeding.

           KATE LICHT, 25, covered in a black dupatta, or long shawl. 
           Kate looks straight at the sun and does not to blink.

           A GLOVED HAND pushes her forward. Roughly. 

                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. DESERT COUNTRYSIDE, AFGHANISTAN - DAY

           Kate, hair matted against her face with sweat, sucks in the 
           dry air for relief. Feels the energy drain from her body, and 
           falls...

                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. DESERT COUNTRYSIDE, AFGHANISTAN - DAY

           Could be a second later. Or ten minutes. Time no longer 
           matters. 

           Kate pushes her face deeper into the black dirt. 

           A SHADOW falls over her. She feels the presence, and shivers. 
           But she does not look up. Won't let herself face who's there.

                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. DESERT COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

           Kate, now kneeling. Her face bears the mark of the earth.
           TWO AFGHANI INSURGENTS, faces obscured by thick turbans and 
           beards, hold AK-47 knockoffs at their sides. These guns make 
           their mark one out of every two shots. On a good day. 

           Kate comes face to face with THE LEADER. A lean, beardless 
           Afghani man in his thirties. Wears clean trousers and shirt. 
           A man who looks like he belongs in a classroom, a hospital, 
           an office. Anywhere but here.

           An Insurgent raises his gun and points it at Kate. 

                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. DESERT COUNTRYSIDE, AFGHANISTAN - DAY

           Kate. The dupatta now covers her face completely. She has 
           become a shadow.

           MUSIC abruptly ends... 

           Allowing us to hear Kate SCREAMING. The type of scream we 
           hope never to hear in our lifetime. A scream to stop a 
           beating heart.

                                                  SLOW DISSOLVE:

           EXT. DESERT LANDSCAPE - DAY

           Vast plain of ragged desert plants and jagged hills. Looks 
           similar to where we've been before. But...

           A MANGY BROWN DOG.

           Struggles in the heat. Limps on to a single-lane interstate 
           road and plops down. Pathetic.

           TITLE: "Southern California"

                                 A.C (O.S.)
                        I'm tired, man.

           INT. DINER, SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA - DAY

           Bright, harsh day bleeds through diner windows, offering the 
           forgettable locale a spiritual aura.

           JEFFREY HIGHSMITH, forties, a face made interesting, even 
           handsome, by deep lines and searing eyes that notice 
           everything but give nothing. He wears a button-up shirt with 
           a nice sheen. Expensive. Even in the middle of nowhere he 
           presents well.
           Jeffrey faces PRIVATE FIRST CLASS A.C BORDEN, twenty-one, 
           crew cut, baby face. A.C nervously drums a lit cigarette 
           against the rim of a full ashtray.

                                 JEFFREY
                        You're the one who said you wanted 
                        to wash your hands clean. 

                                 A.C
                        It's the right thing, ain't it? 

           Jeffrey almost sneers at him.

                                 JEFFREY
                        When the story comes out, your 
                        military buddies are going to know 
                        it's you who fingered them. And 
                        it's going to be the worst day of 
                        your life. You're thinking about 
                        what that means. Don't. Because you 
                        have no idea.

                                 A.C
                        You think I don't know that? 

                                 JEFFREY
                        You don't. You'll get a 
                        dishonorable discharge from the 
                        army, go back to your home town 
                        where even your mother won't be 
                        able to look you in the eye. Words 
                        like traitor, un-American, coward 
                        will be part of your everyday 
                        vocabulary. Start getting used to 
                        them.

           A.C slams his fist on the table. His coffee spills.

                                 A.C
                        I just want people to know. What 
                        really happened there.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Are you sure you know what 
                        happened?

                                 A.C
                           (quiet desperation 
                           simmers)
                        You have to write it. It's the only 
                        thing left I have to count on.
                                 JEFFREY
                        I can write it.
                           (beat)
                        But it's just words. Words of a 
                        high school drop out with the 
                        reading skills of a fourteen year 
                        old claiming one of the most 
                        venerable institutions in this 
                        country is abusing terrorists 
                        suspects. The operative word is not 
                        abuse. It's terrorist.

           A.C blows on his coffee, thinking. He looks so young. So 
           pathetic. Jeffrey almost gives him a break. 

                                 JEFFREY
                           (standing)
                        Let me know how the hero thing 
                        turns out.

                                 A.C
                           (quiet)
                        I have photos.

           A wet flicker in his eyes that he tries to swallow back. Be a 
           man.

           A.C has trouble lighting another cigarette. His hands 
           shaking. Jeffrey takes the lighter and lights the cigarette. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        Where are they?

           A.C digs into his pocket and pulls out a cell phone. Pushes 
           it to Jeffrey...

           YUSIF AGHA. Bloody. Beaten. Dead with no tongue.

           Jeffrey looks at A.C. Cigarette dangling helplessly from his 
           fingers. Staring out the window...

           The Mangy Brown Dog lying in the middle of the road. He is 
           done.

           INT. JEFFREY'S CAR, DESERT ROAD - LATER

           Jeffrey, eyes masked with sunglasses, revs down the road at 
           80 miles per hour. The only change in scenery is the power 
           lines zigzagging against blue skies. 

                                 JEFFREY
                           (into cellphone)
                        Get me a non-stop to D.C. 
                        And then get me the last flight 
                        back tonight... See you in the 
                        morning.

           A.C's cell phone sits on the passenger seat. 

           The heat outside makes the near horizon ripple like a dream.

           Loud DRILLING...

           INT. KATE'S BEDROOM, KABUL - DAY

           ... Wakes up Kate. A sweet, plain face that looks years 
           younger than her real age. The girl one always liked in the 
           moment but forgets when she's out of sight. 

           Kate sits up in her bed. Pushed against the only window in 
           the small room cluttered with unpacked boxes.

           She stretches her hands outside in the scorching air, 
           hungrily swallows this strange new world with her eyes... 

           Morning rush down a newly constructed street crowded with 
           cars, bicycles, foot traffic and carts dragged by donkeys. A 
           vibrant, moving world of people in western and traditional 
           clothing. 

           A new modern apartment building going up a few blocks away, 
           the source of the drilling sound, stands next to decrepit 
           buildings. A city that's held on through clenched teeth.

           A STREET VENDOR looks up and spots her. Kate ducks back into 
           her room. 

           INT. BAR, WASHINGTON, DC - NIGHT

           Upscale, oak-paneled bar. An unimaginative after-work choice. 
           Jeffrey sits at the bar. He's hardly touched his drink.

                                 MICK (O.S.)
                        You trying to get my wife to leave 
                        me?

           Jeffrey turns and sees MICK TAYLOR, the guy who's on the 
           inside but tries not to show it. Everything about him is big. 
           Everything about him screams Texas.

                                 MICK
                        I haven't been home for dinner in a 
                        month now. 

           Mick motions to the bartender and points to Jeffrey's drink. 
                                 MICK
                        Good thing you don't have kids. 
                        You'd have one guilty conscience.

                                 JEFFREY
                        I have enough ex-wives for that.
                           (to the point)
                        I need corroboration.

           The drink arrives.

                                 JEFFREY
                        This is the last one-

                                 MICK
                        For a news man, you're a shitty 
                        liar.

                                 JEFFREY
                        I trust you. If you say it, then I 
                        know it's a go.

           Mick laughs. It's more like a bellow. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        I have someone from the inside.

                                 MICK
                        You using his name?

                                 JEFFREY
                        And his pictures.

                                 MICK
                        There are all sorts of pictures-

                                 JEFFREY
                        I just need someone from State to 
                        confirm that this was more than 
                        just a couple of bad seeds.

                                 MICK
                        D.O.D know what you have?

                                 JEFFREY
                        I sent them my notes. Haven't heard 
                        back.

                                 MICK
                        Means they're not too interested. 
                        Doesn't that tell you something?
                                 JEFFREY
                        Well they should be.

                                 MICK
                           (shrugs)
                        Or maybe they know Americans don't 
                        really want to know what their 
                        military is doing. So a few brown-
                        skinned boys get roughed up? The 
                        unfortunate cost of what it takes 
                        to keep the country safe. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        I'm going to make them care.

           Mick bellows again.

                                 MICK 
                        I wish you believed that, Jeffrey. 
                        You're a smart guy. Hell smarter 
                        than I am. But when it comes to 
                        seeing everything at once? Shit. 
                        You don't even know how big the 
                        canvas is. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        Mick-

                                 MICK
                        I never understood why people like 
                        to meet in dark places. Here, all 
                        of Washington sees me having drinks 
                        with you. They know what you do. 
                        They know what I do. But since 
                        we're out in public, we can't 
                        possibly be talking dirty. The key 
                        is to clean up the dirt as nice as 
                        you can.

           Mick lifts his drink, clangs Jeffrey's glass and winks. 

                                 MICK
                        I'm here to have a drink with my 
                        friend. One drink. Then I'm going 
                        to go home, have dinner with my 
                        family, and screw my wife. Gotta 
                        live the American dream. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        Three deaths.

           Mick drinks.
                                 JEFFREY
                        The commanding officer got 
                        promoted.

           Mick drinks.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Secretary of Defense?

           Mick drinks.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Vice-President? President?

           Mick does not drink.

                                 MICK
                           (serious)
                        Don't write that story. The Times 
                        tried six months ago but scrapped 
                        it when they realized they couldn't 
                        pull it off.

                                 JEFFREY
                        I can.

                                 MICK
                        Don't.

           Mick swallows the rest of his drink and stands up.

                                 MICK
                        Well, Jeffrey. Good luck to you. 
                        And I really do mean it this time 
                        when I say I hope I never see you 
                        again.

           Mick pats Jeffrey on the back and walks away. Stops at a 
           table and greets some DOUR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. His laughter 
           travels through the bar. 

           But Jeffrey's not looking. Because he's enjoying his drink. 
           Smiling.

           INT. WORLDCARE CONFERENCE ROOM, KABUL - DAY

           The conference room is too small to seat the THIRTY STAFF 
           MEMBERS -- a Benetton ad of different races. Kate stands in 
           the back with a few others. Taking copious notes.

           JULIE MERTAIN, twenties, a striking French girl with sunken 
           cheeks that will look bad in thirty years but looks so damned 
           sexy now.

                                 JULIE
                        Guns have no place in the clinics.

           TOM GURNEY, forties, stands at the front of the room. He's 
           trying to stay calm but it's hard in the heat.

                                 TOM
                           (stammering)
                        I understand some of you feel a 
                        great deal of conviction on this, 
                        but-

           EMILY DOYLE, British, slightly overweight, rolls her eyes.

                                 EMILY
                        We've been over it at every fucking 
                        meeting for the past three months! 
                        They're not leaving. Live with it!

                                 JULIE
                        Emily, I so wish you would go home 
                        and live out your miserable Bridget 
                        Jones existence-

                                 TOM
                           (warning)
                        Julie.

                                 JULIE
                           (passionate)
                        Tom, I know you agree with me, but 
                        you've turned into a bureaucrat. 

           JOANNA, a fresh-faced American, raises her hands.

                                 JOANNA
                        I'm glad they're here. It makes me 
                        feel safer.  And they got rid of 
                        the Taliban.

                                 JULIE
                        I trust the Taliban more than 
                        George Bush.
           This gets a reaction from the room. Angry whisperings, though 
           clearly some people agree with her.

                                 TOM
                           (trying to regain control)
                        We are here as aid workers. We're 
                        not political. WorldCare is showing 
                        the people of Afghanistan that 
                        compassion will prevail over bombs. 

           Kate's eyes shine watching Tom. This is why she came to 
           Kabul.

                                 TOM
                        And girls. Head scarves are now 
                        mandatory for all WorldCare female 
                        employees. 

           Julie's cheeks flush. But she doesn't argue back. Kate 
           watches her, fascinated.

           HONK...

           INT. CORPORATE TOWN CAR, NEW YORK CITY - DAY

           Morning rush hour traffic. 

           Jeffrey, settled in the back seat against plush leather 
           seats. Lost in the morning paper. Completely out of sync with 
           the daily grind. 

           The TOWN CAR weaves into an illegal spot in front of an 
           apartment building. 

           Jeffrey opens the door.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Kevin!

           KEVIN JORGEN, a few economic check boxes down from Jeffrey, 
           climbs into the car. Jeffrey nods to his DRIVER and the car 
           breezes back into traffic.

                                 KEVIN
                        God, this is a good way to start 
                        the day. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        One of the first things I made the 
                        lawyers write in the contract.
           Kevin laughs with a slight edge. Looks at Jeffrey. His good 
           suit. Nice briefcase. Then he decides to shake the feeling 
           off. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Hear you're working on the detainee 
                        story.

                                 JEFFREY
                        So were you. What happened?

                                 KEVIN
                        Couldn't get anyone to speak on the 
                        record. Just enough careful 
                        insinuations and double speak to 
                        make you think you're going crazy. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        But you have enough people talking 
                        off the record- 

                                 KEVIN
                        Wish The Times could see it that 
                        way. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        Kevin, you missed out. This is big.

                                 KEVIN
                           (edge coming back into his 
                           voice)
                        Really.

           INT. TOM'S WORLDCARE OFFICE - LATER

           The big man's office. Tiny. Could even be mistaken for a 
           closet. 

           Kate sits in front of Tom at his desk. He sets a piece of 
           paper in front of her.

                                 TOM
                        By signing this contract, you are 
                        committing yourself to two years. 
                        Here. In Kabul. 

           Kate nods.

                                 TOM
                        Kate. Let me be frank. 

           Kate, holding the pen in her hand, looks up. 
                                 TOM
                        You have no business being here. 
                        Coming to a place like this with 
                        only one year of field work is 
                        grossly negligent. I made this very 
                        clear to London. But. You seem to 
                        be the exception.

                                 KATE
                           (her very first words)
                        I want to be here. 

                                 TOM
                        Right. And you have some very good 
                        friends.

           Kate picks up the papers and signs. 

                                 MITCHELL (O.S.)
                        This looks like a cover to me.

           INT. MITCHELL'S OFFICE, NEW YORK - NIGHT

           The corner office with glass panes looking out into an open 
           work room where MAGAZINE STAFF bustle. The office is a cool 
           oasis of power and influence. Large glossy posters of THE 
           WORLD covers proudly line the walls. This is big, corporate 
           news magazine culture.

           MITCHELL WALKER, sixties, holds up a blown up photo of Yusif 
           Agha with no tongue. DEPUTY EDITOR ED LEVIN, aside, reads a 
           proof of the story. 

           Jeffrey waits calmly. A man who enjoys moments like this.

                                 MITCHELL
                        You get a confirmation from your 
                        source in the state department?

                                 JEFFREY
                        Confirmed. 

                                 ED LEVIN
                        Off the record?

           Jeffrey throws him a dismissive glance.

                                 JEFFREY
                           (at Mitchell)
                        You had no problem using him on the 
                        bribery story.

           Mitchell spreads the photos around his desk. 
                                 MITCHELL
                        How much do I owe you?

                                 JEFFREY
                        Three hundred.

                                 MITCHELL
                        Jesus.

           Mitchell takes out his wallet and counts out some bills.

                                 MITCHELL
                        You would think I would have 
                        learned my lesson by now. How'd you 
                        know he had something?

                                 JEFFREY
                        I could say something that 
                        demonstrates my keen insight into 
                        the human psyche but I'd rather not 
                        gloat.

           Mitchell laughs loudly. He looks at Jeffrey with something 
           like a father's admiration.

                                 ED LEVIN
                        We can't run this part about the 
                        President.

                                 JEFFREY
                        You're not touching it.

                                 ED LEVIN
                        We can't go off the record on 
                        something like that. We need paper 
                        trail.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Presidents don't leave paper 
                        trails.

                                 MITCHELL
                        You run this by your source?

           Jeffrey tosses his head. It's almost a nod.

                                 JEFFREY
                        You're looking at my third 
                        Pulitzer.

                                 ED LEVIN
                        We need it on the record.
           Mitchell weighs his options. Takes a good look at Jeffrey. 
           Who stares back. His confidence is hard to argue with.

                                 MITCHELL
                        Ed. Get this to legal. If we can't 
                        get sued, run it.

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY NEWSTAND - DAY

           A NEWSSTAND OWNER shelves the latest issue of THE WORLD. 

           Yusif Agha's dead face looks out at the passing CROWDS. The 
           bold, yellow title reads TONGUE TIED: DETAINEE MURDERS 
           REVEALED. Date of the magazine reads April 22, 2004.

                                 CHRIS KLEIN (O.S.)
                        The photos are so haunting...

           INT. NEWS STUDIO, WASHINGTON, D.C - DAY

           ON AIR red signal.

           CHRIS KLEIN, the host presides over a round table. The 
           comforting mug of coffee sits in front of his notes. Also at 
           the table: SENATOR ARMAND COTTER,"ah shucks" accent soothes 
           the voice of ambition, and Jeffrey sit under glaring studio 
           lights.

           Off stage, MATT BYLER, thirties, watches intently.

                                 CHRIS KLEIN
                        Could you describe some of the 
                        thoughts that went through your 
                        head when you first saw them?

                                 JEFFREY
                           (somber)
                        Well Chris, I'm a journalist and 
                        words are my trade, but I must 
                        admit words failed me at that 
                        moment. 

                                 THE HOST
                        And your source, Private Borden. He 
                        was carrying all these photos on 
                        his cell phone? 

                                 JEFFREY
                        Yeah, you can say he had some heavy 
                        pockets. 
                           (beat)
                        I'd like to say a few words about 
                        A.C. 
           INT. A.C BORDEN'S LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Small trailer park living room littered with dirty laundry, 
           pizza boxes, beer cans.

           A.C, slumped on the sofa, drinking a beer. He looks terrible, 
           his eyes glazed over from the joint he holds in his hand. 

           He watches a television playing the broadcast from Jeffrey's 
           studio interview.

                                 JEFFREY
                           (on TV)
                        We got to be quite close throughout 
                        the investigation, and something I 
                        tried to emphasize in my piece is 
                        that the orders for systematic 
                        abuse came from high up and went 
                        down the food chain. The dirty work 
                        fell on those who had the no 
                        recourse to speak out. Those who 
                        were with the prisoners in the 
                        detainee camps. But A.C felt 
                        compelled to speak out. It was not 
                        easy for him. 

           A.C's face registers no emotions.

           INT. CONTROL ROOM - LATER

           Matt Byler - the network wonder kid. He brought the news 
           division to number one and kept it there.

           Jeffrey leans against the control window looking out at the 
           studio floor. 

                                 MATT
                        Itching for a move?

                                 JEFFREY
                        Depends on how far the move is.

                                 MATT
                        You can stay in New York-

                                 JEFFREY
                        I'm not talking about that kind of 
                        move.
                                 MATT
                        You're a legend among the news and 
                        beltway crowd but how about 
                        grabbing some of that primetime 
                        spotlight?

                                 JEFFREY
                        I don't do entertainment.

                                 MATT
                        I know. Hard hitting journalism. 
                        Your way.

                                 JEFFREY
                        There's no public for that.

                                 MATT
                        There is. Something's in the air. I 
                        don't know how long it's going to 
                        hold, but we need to get on it now. 
                        For the first time since Watergate, 
                        news is back. 

                                 JEFFREY
                           (excited)
                        I have a contract-

                                 MATT
                        I'll buy it out.

           INT. MITCHELL'S OFFICE, NEW YORK - DAY

           Mitchell eats a sandwich at his desk. All the major dailies 
           spread out in front of him. This is relaxation.

           His phone BEEPS.

                                 MITCHELL
                           (into speakerphone)
                        Yeah?

                                 ASSISTANT (O.S.)
                        I have Ken Myers from the Times on 
                        the phone.

           Mitchell puts down his sandwich. 

                                 MITCHELL
                        Put him through

           The phone beeps again.
                                 MITCHELL
                           (into speakerphone)
                        Ken.

                                 KEN (O.S.)
                        Mitchell, how's everything?

                                 MITCHELL
                        Good. The usual. You guys there?

                                 KEN (O.S.)
                        Good. The usual.
                           (beat)
                        I want to give you a heads up on a 
                        story we're running for tomorrow's 
                        paper by Kevin Jorgen. It's about 
                        Jeffrey's piece. I just emailed you 
                        the article.

                                 MITCHELL
                        Did you just ruin my day, Ken?

                                 KEN (O.S.)
                        Call me when you've read it.

           INT. TOM'S WORLDCARE OFFICE - DAY

           Julie, short-sleeved and khaki pants, storms in and drops a 
           heavy key set on Tom's desk. On top of a file left open. 
           Kate's photo sticks out.

           Julie looks back to make sure no one's watching. Picks up the 
           file and scans the pages quickly.

           INT. MITCHELL'S OFFICE, NEW YORK - DAY

           Ed Levin and PHIL HOPPER, the head of legal, face Jeffrey who 
           sits on a sofa. Mitchell stands with his back to them, 
           looking out the window. A man who can't face his surrogate 
           son's disgrace.

                                 JEFFREY
                        I don't understand how this is 
                        happening-

                                 ED LEVIN
                        It's happening because you pushed 
                        too hard. You didn't follow the 
                        process. You lied.

                                 JEFFREY
                        I did what most journalists have to 
                        do to get the story-
                                 ED LEVIN
                        No, you made the story-

                                 PHIL HOPPER
                        Excuse me. I'm sorry if I don't 
                        feel like sitting here while the 
                        two of you debate the ethics of 
                        your trade. We have a serious 
                        problem. As we speak, Private First 
                        Class Borden is testifying to a 
                        closed door hearing. Apparently 
                        he's changed his story. Yusif 
                        Agha's death was not murder. 

                                 JEFFREY
                           (exploding)
                        Did you see those pictures? How can 
                        anyone refute that?

                                 PHIL HOPPER
                        You have a bigger problem tomorrow. 
                        Several people from state are being 
                        called in. They're trying to narrow 
                        in on your source. Is there 
                        anything I should know?

           EXT. JUSTICE DEPT. STEPS - DAY

           CROWD OF REPORTERS chase down A.C, in military uniform, and 
           his LEGAL TEAM as they descend the wide stone steps. 

           A.C, hunched over, fixes his gaze on the ground. His lawyers 
           lead him through the crowd.

           TV cameras push into his face.

                                 REPORTER 1
                        A.C. Are you now claiming that 
                        Yusif Agha attacked the other 
                        guards-

                                 REPORTER 2
                        -and then tried to escape?

                                 REPORTER 3
                        Are you considering legal actions 
                        against Mr. Highsmith?

           A.C descends the last step and sees a sedan waiting for him. 

                                                  CUT TO:
           INT. CAR - SAME

           A.C slides to the window. Trying to get as much space between 
           him and what he just did. 

           He leans his head against tinted windows. He does not see the 
           Washington Monument. Jutting tall into the grey clouded sky. 
           And the American flag waving violently against heavy gusts. 

           INT. STATE DEPT. LOBBY - DAY

           Jeffrey storms up to the front desk. The ATTENDANT, a serious-
           faced woman, looks up. 

                                 ATTENDANT
                        Please sign in. Who are you here to 
                        see?

                                 JEFFREY
                        Mick Taylor. Undersecretary for 
                        International Affairs.

                                 ATTENDANT
                        One moment.

           The attendant speaks quietly into her headset. At one point, 
           she looks up at Jeffrey. Nods and whispers back into the 
           phone.

                                 ATTENDANT
                        Mr. Highsmith. Mr. Taylor is not in 
                        at the moment. But his assistant 
                        can help you.

           She motions to a phone on a table nearby. Jeffrey walks over 
           to the phone. It rings.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Hello?

                                 ASSISTANT (O.S.)
                        The secretary is on a call right 
                        now-

                                 JEFFREY
                        Tell him this is important.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        And then he's walking across the 
                        street for his next appointment-
                                 JEFFREY
                        I don't think you're listening to 
                        me-

                                 ASSISTANT
                        In fifteen minutes he walks to his 
                        next appointment.

                                 JEFFREY
                           (getting it)
                        Thank you.

           EXT. STATE DEPARTMENT BUILDING - LATER

           Jeffrey, sitting on a bench, watches TOURISTS stroll the 
           pretty tree-lined street. 

           Mick walks out, flanked by TWO SUITED MEN. Mick looks around 
           casually. Spots Jeffrey. Pats one of the Men on the back, and 
           says his good-byes. Without ever breaking his Texas smile.

           Mick joins Jeffrey on the bench. The smile is no longer on 
           his face.

                                 MICK 
                        You must have lost your head. 
                        Coming here, calling me from the 
                        front desk-

                                 JEFFREY
                        I couldn't get you on the phone. 
                        Are you testifying?

                                 MICK
                        You shouldn't be here.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Don't screw me over.

                                 MICK
                        No, your source screwed you over. 
                        I've just been asked to dig it in a 
                        little deeper.

                                 JEFFREY
                        I need you to back me up on this-

           Mick laughs. Then gets serious very quick.

                                 MICK
                        I warned you. But I should have 
                        known you wouldn't listen. 
           Mick gives a hand wave to someone he sees across the street. 
           Easy smile returning.

                                 JEFFREY
                        I wrote the truth.

                                 MICK
                        You know better than to say 
                        something like that to me.
                           (change in tone)
                        Funny word. Legacy. Makes you think 
                        about the order you leave things. 
                        Bet you're thinking a lot about 
                        that right now. Well, I've been 
                        thinking too. I thought I'd made my 
                        climb, reached the final peg on the 
                        totem pole. I've tried to be 
                        satisfied with the view I got. But 
                        wouldn't it be nice to take a 
                        breath of cleaner air?

           INT. CLINIC, KABUL - EARLY EVENING

           White, antiseptic clinic. Looks like any clinic in America. 
           Which is why it stands out in Kabul.

           Armed INTERNATIONAL SECURITY FORCE GUARDS keep a watchful eye 
           on the room. Stone faced, disciples of order.

           Kate, coat and bag in hand, about to call it a day. Looks up 
           at an old TV monitor attached to the wall. Tuned to CNN. 
           Volume off, titles on.

           ON TV: Photo of Jeffrey next to an image of the magazine 
           cover. Captions read: "JOURNALIST IN HOT SEAT."  

           CUT TO: Jeffrey, in sunglasses and suit, rushing past 
           reporters and into THE WORLD building.

                        Walking home?

           Kate looks up and sees Julie waiting for her.

           EXT. RIVER STREET, KABUL - LATER

           Julie and Kate wander slowly down a crowded street alongside 
           the river. VENDORS hawk their brightly colored goods. A Blue 
           Mosque hovers in the near distance. 

           An AMBITIOUS TEENAGER hawks copies of pirated Jean-Claude Van 
           Damme DVDs. Eye the foreign girls. Especially Julie.
                                 KATE
                           (trying to laugh it off)
                        Everyone expects me to pack up and 
                        go home. I don't understand what it 
                        is about me that inspires so little 
                        confidence.

                                 JULIE
                        You can't worry about people like 
                        Tom. You're here for the right 
                        reasons. I can see it.

                                 KATE
                        Really?

           Julie smiles. And it makes you fall in love with her.

                                 KATE
                        Are you here for the right reasons?

                                 JULIE
                        I hope so. 
                           (beat)
                        Will you do me a favor, Kate? 

                                 KATE
                           (flattered)
                        Anything.

                                 JULIE
                        Will you cut my hair tonight? 

                                 KATE
                        Me? I can't cut hair-

                                 JULIE
                        Please. 

           INT. JEFFREY'S OFFICE, NEW YORK - NIGHT

           Dark office lit by ambient skyline and spill-over from center 
           work space.

           Jeffrey, in his chair, stares out at frenzied REPORTERS. 
           Coming to terms with the fact that he may no longer be a part 
           of them. And the thought of it makes him...

           Pick up the phone and dial a number.

                                 A.C (O.S.)
                        You got me. Leave a message and I 
                        might call you back.
           BEEP.

           Jeffrey slams the phone down, the vein in his neck pulsing. 

           EXT. KATE'S GUEST HOUSE ENTRANCE/STREET, KABUL - NIGHT

           Julie and Kate exit the gate, laughing. Julie, hair shorn 
           short, looks even more stunning without the disguise of hair. 
           She links her arm with Kate's.

           TWO PRIVATE SECURITY GUARDS on duty at the gate. Eyeing 
           Julie. Kate notices.

                                 KATE
                        I'm hungry.

                                 JULIE
                        What about that place.

           Julie points to a small restaurant down the street. A counter 
           really with some tables and mats on the floor. A group of 
           BEARDED MEN, eating their meals, lost in conversation.

                                 KATE
                        We can't go there. Let's go to one 
                        of the places on Chicken street.

                                 JULIE
                        I can eat pizza and Chinese food 
                        anywhere in the world. This place 
                        looks perfect.

           Julie lets go of Kate's arm and walks toward the restaurant.

                                 KATE
                        We're not accompanied by men-

                                 JULIE
                        Kate. What are they going to do to 
                        us?

           Julie takes a seat at the counter. The bearded men look up 
           and take her in -- her short hair, her figure seen through 
           the short-sleeved blouse. That sense of self-assurance only 
           some people can pull off convincingly.

           Kate stands in the street. Unsure. Julie smiles back at her 
           and sticks out her tongue. 

           INT. CLINIC HALLWAY, KABUL - DAY

           Kate, holding a corded phone in hand, leans against the wall. 
                                 KATE
                           (into phone)
                        Mom?

           Crackled, static-heavy connection. 

                                 JO (O.S.)
                        What's all that sound? Is that 
                        gunfire?  

                                 KATE
                        No, the connection's really bad - 

           Another conversation crosses in - a man and woman speaking in 
           Arabic, hushed tones. Feels like you're listening in on a 
           secret. And you don't want to stop.

                                 JO (O.S.)
                        Kate? Are you still there?

                                 KATE
                        I think our lines are getting 
                        crossed-

           Kate stretches the tangled phone cord. The static evens out. 
           The second conversation silenced.

                                 KATE
                        They had to re-lay the telephone 
                        wires in the neighborhood so it's 
                        been a little patchy.

                                 JO
                        Jesus. Is this the return to the 
                        natives thing you were looking for? 

                                 KATE
                        Mom.

                                 JO
                        After all, you wouldn't want to be - 
                        what was that word you used? 
                        Conventional?

                                 KATE
                           (helpless)
                        I don't want to fight, mom.

                                 JO
                        Those stupid stories your father 
                        told you-
                                 KATE
                        Don't.

                                 JO
                        It's driving me crazy. The thought 
                        of you over there-

           Kate lets the phone cord tangle again. Static intrudes. The 
           voices come back.

                                 JO (O.S.)
                        Kate? 

           Kate hangs up the phone.

           INT. CLINIC OFFICE - SAME

           Julie talking with Tom, going over some papers.

           Kate rushes out of the hallway, past Julie and Tom. She 
           doesn't see them. 

           Julie turns to Tom, but he just shrugs.

           EXT. STREET, KABUL - LATER

           Kate walks aimlessly down a wide boulevard. Past a brand new 
           "mall" selling mostly knock-off designer wares. 

           A PERFUME girl smiles as Kate passes. Spritzes perfume on 
           her. 

           Kate crosses the street. Looks up and sees...

           THE INTERNATIONAL MAYTON HOTEL. A large, modern building with 
           imposing surrounding gates.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER

           Kate opens her hotel room and walks in. Stands in front of 
           the massive king sized bed with thick red covers against 
           pristine white walls.

           She goes to the air conditioner against the window and shuts 
           it off. It's now quiet. Expensively quiet.

           Kate looks down at a large swimming pool, half-full with 
           foreign DIGNITARIES swimming laps and WEALTHY VISITORS in 
           chic one piece bathing suits. Tall trees crowd out the view 
           of the rest of the city. 

           Kate pulls the curtains closed. The room goes dark.
           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           A loud BOOM rocks the room.

           Kate wakes up, on top of the covers. She still wears her 
           shoes. It takes her a moment to realize where she is.

           Sirens WAIL...

           EXT. CLINIC STREET, KABUL - NIGHT

           DEMONSTRATING RIOTERS fill the street, chanting angrily. They  
           carry signs ("They killed one of us," "Death to America") 
           with Yusif Agha's face - the picture used on the cover of THE 
           WORLD.

           Kate rushes down the sidewalk, through CROWDS cheering in 
           support of the demonstrators. 

           Military vehicles and International Security Guards try to 
           move the building crowd back. But they're not moving. 

           Kate sees Tom and Julie outside the clinic gates.

                                 JULIE
                        Where have you been?

                                 KATE
                        I didn't feel well. What's 
                        happening?

                                 JULIE
                        There's been suicide attacks all 
                        over the city. A car ran into a 
                        military truck on the next block.

           Julie points to the smoke and fire spewing close by. 
           Blackening the sky. 

                                 CROWD
                           (in Dari)
                        This is just the beginning. We will 
                        take our vengeance.

           The demonstrators face the International Guards, hurling 
           rocks. The guards raise riot-gear shields. The stuff cable 
           news television eats up and replays every thirty minutes.

                                 TOM
                        Casualties will be coming in.
           INT. CLINIC, KABUL - LATER

           Chaos. The clinic is overcapacity. Wounded bystanders on 
           tables, on the floor. 

           Kate and Tom stand over a PREGNANT WOMAN. Her skirt covered 
           in blood. Their work space is tight. Working elbow to elbow 
           with another casualty just a few feet over.

                                 TOM
                        Patocin.

           Overhead fluorescent lights FLICKER.

                                 TOM
                        The power's going down.

           The power cranks down. Sputters. Then goes dark. Patients CRY 
           out. What more can go wrong for them?

                                 TOM
                        The generator should be kicking in.

           The pregnant woman bangs her head against the table.

                                 TOM
                        Damnit!  Where are the lights?

           Generator engines CHUG. Half the lights come back on. Casting 
           an eerie glow.

                                 PREGNANT WOMAN
                           (seeing Tom with needle)
                        No! No!

           The pregnant woman grabs Kate's arm, screaming in pain. She 
           kicks at Tom. Kate, instead of pulling free, freezes. Takes 
           in the chaos. And can't move.

           Julie rushes in, grabs the pregnant woman's chest and holds 
           her down. The pregnant woman lets go of Kate's hand. 

           Kate snaps back to the moment. She moves to the other side, 
           trying to hold the woman's hand.

                                 TOM
                        Get out, Kate. There's not enough 
                        room.

           Kate looks up at Tom. But he's not thinking of her anymore.

           Kate releases the woman's hand. She steps aside.
           EXT. STREETS, KABUL - NIGHT

           Hushed, somber streets. Heavy winds blow the hot night air. A 
           gray city. As if drained of all its color.

           Kate turns down a narrow street that gives her a clear view 
           of the Blue Mosque. The blue more vibrant against the 
           drabness of the night.

           She notices a house behind the mosque. Barely standing. Next 
           to the house is a tree, leaning sharply at an angle, as if 
           growing against the sun. 

           Kate stares longingly at that tree. At that moment it looks 
           the way she feels -- off kilter.

           Suddenly, the sky opens and rain pours down. 

           Kate runs, hurrying under awnings. She turns a corner...

           A shadowed figure jumps out at her.

           Kate SCREAMS.

           A HOMELESS BEGGAR. Missing a leg and an eye. One of hundreds 
           of war vets haunting the city. Taking shelter underneath a 
           closed store doorway. 

           He pushes Kate out.

           INT. JEFFREY'S OFFICE, NEW YORK  - DAY

           Jeffrey sits at his desk, staring out at the city's skyline. 
           It's drizzling. 

           A KNOCK on the door. Mitchell.

                                 MITCHELL
                        You look like shit. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        Thanks.

           Mitchell takes a seat across the room. By the door. Jeffrey 
           perceives this. And he braces himself.

                                 MITCHELL
                        Jeffrey, there's no question that 
                        you're a brilliant journalist-

                                 JEFFREY
                        Spare me the elocutions.
                                 MITCHELL
                        The White House is asking for a 
                        formal retraction. There's been 
                        riots all over the Muslim world. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        Don't do it.

                                 MITCHELL
                        I shouldn't have run the article. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        We don't have the luxury of should 
                        haves and should nots in our line 
                        of work.

                                 MITCHELL
                        We let the easy slaps on the back 
                        sway our sense of reason. You're 
                        too good of a reporter to have let 
                        this happen.

           Jeffrey hangs his head. He can't believe this is happening.

                                 JEFFREY
                        When you were trying to get me to 
                        join the magazine, you told me a 
                        story. Do you remember?

                                 MITCHELL
                        Jeffrey-

                                 JEFFREY
                        You were starting out as a junior 
                        editor at the Washington Post. And 
                        these two reporters say they have a 
                        hunch about a burglary. And you 
                        didn't like it.

           Mitchell nods.

                                 JEFFREY
                        You said you never wanted to doubt 
                        your reporters' instinct ever 
                        again. Well, what the hell are you 
                        doing now?

                                 MITCHELL
                        I'm trying to save the magazine.

           Mitchell gets on his feet. 
                                 MITCHELL
                        And Jeffrey, don't bullshit me. You 
                        didn't sign till I made you the 
                        highest paid print journalist in 
                        the country. I'm not going to feel 
                        too bad for you. I hear you've been 
                        talking to the networks.

           EXT. MARKET, KABUL - LATE AFTERNOON

           Busy outdoor market. Narrow walkways lined with stands 
           selling fruits, nuts, textiles. SHOPPERS packed tight. 

           Julie, at one of the stands, looks through a pile of apples. 
           She's still not wearing a head scarf.

           Behind her, Kate. In conservative western clothes and a short 
           head scarf. She's sweating. Her skin pale. Something's wrong.

           FEMALE SHOPPERS eye her suspiciously. Nearby, a group of 
           CHILDREN point at her. One of the boys runs up to Kate, 
           touches her skirt, and runs back. But Kate's having trouble 
           focusing.

           Kate turns back to Julie. 

           But she's gone.

           Kate looks around, trying to focus. But the world starts 
           spinning...

           Kate falls against a vendor stand. Falls forward...

           Someone grabs her from behind. 

                                 JULIE
                        Kate?

           INT. TAXI, KABUL - LATER

           Kate takes a long drink from her bottled water. Color slowly 
           returning back to her cheeks.

           The TAXI DRIVER glances at them through his rearview mirror, 
           worried Kate's going to be sick in his car. He doesn't see a 
           TEENAGER on a scooter pull tight in front. 

           The Taxi skids...

           A beat up BLACK NISSAN cuts in. The Taxi Driver waves his 
           hand angrily out the window. The black Nissan STOPS. The taxi 
           brakes.
           Four MEN pile out of the black Nissan. Hooded.

           The driver REVERSES...

           SCREECH. Another BEAT UP CAR locks them in from behind.

                                 DRIVER
                           (accented heavily)
                        Down!

                                 KATE
                        What's happening-

           MEN WITH BLACK HOODS jump out of both cars. Storm towards the 
           taxi with their guns raised. 

           The bustling CROWD outside scramble... Disappear.

           GUNFIRE. Glass pours all over Kate and Julie. Julie grabs 
           Kate's hand.

           More GUNSHOTS. So close by it's deafening. The taxi driver 
           slumps forward, draining blood so quick that red's all you 
           think you can see.

           Kate screams.

           A door opens.

           They pull Julie out. Kate holds on to her hand. But her door 
           opens...

           EXT. MARKET STREET - SAME

           Kate lands on the ground. Dragged...

           She looks at the sun -- buildings blur into sky into ground -- 
           time comes undone.

           INT. BEAT UP NISSAN - SAME

           One of the kidnappers shoves Kate inside the car. Drapes a 
           loose black hood on her head.

           DARKNESS.

           EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT, NYC - NIGHT

           Jeffrey watches his DRIVER place boxes on the curb.

                                 DRIVER
                        It was a pleasure, Mr. Highsmith.
           The driver offers his hand. Jeffrey looks at it, unmoved.

                                 JEFFREYY
                        How long have you been with me?

                                 DRIVER
                        Four years.

                                 JEFFREY
                        And in those four years did I ever 
                        ask how your day was? What you did 
                        on the weekends? What you hope to 
                        accomplish with your life?

                                 DRIVER
                        I-I don't think so.

                                 JEFFREY
                        I didn't. So was it really a 
                        pleasure driving me around? No. It 
                        was your job.

           The driver backs off, unsure whether to tell Jeffrey off or 
           just walk away. 

           The driver gets back in the car. Speeds off.

                                 A.C (O.S.)
                        That's a hell of a way to say good-
                        bye.

           A.C steps out from the shadows. It's been a rough couple of 
           days on him and it shows.

                                 JEFFREY
                        What are you doing here?

                                 A.C
                        I don't know.

           INT. JEFFREY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Soft beige room with expensive, subtle furniture gives the 
           room a hotel feel. Cold comfort.

           Jeffrey pours A.C a drink. He doesn't pour one for himself.

                                 A.C
                        I don't know how you people live in 
                        the city. Seems like it would be 
                        kinda hard to get your thoughts 
                        strung together.
                                 JEFFREY
                        I don't have any trouble stringing 
                        my thoughts together.

                                 A.C
                        No, I suppose you don't.

           A.C tries to smile. But starts to cry instead. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        I don't want to see you cry.

                                 A.C
                           (trying to pull himself 
                           together)
                        You warned me, man. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        You said you wanted to be a hero. 
                        Remember?  

           A.C starts pacing. He can't calm down.

                                 A.C
                        Hey man, I need a smoke.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Open the window.

           A.C opens the window. The cold air seems to calm him down.

                                 A.C
                        I saw you on TV. On that news show. 
                        At the time did you mean what you 
                        said about me?

                                 JEFFREY
                        No.

                                 A.C
                        I can't sleep. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        I really hope you didn't come here 
                        from some redemption-

                                 A.C
                        I can't get him to go away. He 
                        won't stop screaming. I just want 
                        him to shut up!
                                 JEFFREY
                           (slowly)
                        I thought you said you weren't in 
                        the room?

                                 A.C
                           (to himself)
                        I thought if I talked the screaming 
                        would stop.  

           Jeffrey stands. He's careful but trying to inch closer to 
           A.C.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Were you in the room?

           A.C doesn't hear him. He's somewhere else. In his thoughts. 
           In a cell back in Guantanamo. 

                                 JEFFREY
                           (soothing)
                        What were you supposed to do? Tell 
                        the Unites States military to go 
                        fuck itself? You're just a kid. 

           A.C looks at Jeffrey, remembering he's in the room too.

                                 JEFFREY
                        And that's how they got you to say 
                        I made you lie. Because you didn't 
                        just come in when it was all over. 
                        You could have stopped them.

           Then it hits Jeffrey. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        You were part of it.

                                 A.C
                           (standing)
                        Don't come closer!

                                 JEFFREY
                           (seeing the story come 
                           back to life)
                        Tell me what happened. A.C, you can 
                        still be that hero.

                                 A.C
                        It's too late! 

                                 JEFFREY
                        No, it isn't.
                                 A.C
                        Who's going to believe me?

                                 JEFFREY
                           (pushing)
                        I will. But you have to tell me 
                        what really happened. Tell me what 
                        you did to him? 

                                 A.C
                        You want to know what happened?!?

                                 JEFFREY
                        Yes!

                                 A.C
                        You want to know what I did?!?

                                 JEFFREY
                        Yes!

                                 A.C
                        I beat him with a cattle prod. I 
                        cracked his knees. His ribs. He 
                        couldn't stand anymore. I did that 
                        to him!

           A.C flops back down on the window sill, sobbing. Just a kid 
           that grew up too fast. 

                                 A.C
                        At the end he would just mumble to 
                        himself. About his family. His 
                        country. He said he wanted to see 
                        his village once more. Godah. Like 
                        a prayer, he would say Godah.
                        Godah.

           A.C looks at Jeffrey. Desperate.

                                 A.C
                        Do you think the screaming ever 
                        goes away?

                                 JEFFREY
                           (brutal)
                        I don't think so.

           And in that brief moment clarity hits A.C.'s eyes. And A.C., 
           the boy lost, looks like he's found himself. He stands 
           slowly...

           And hurls himself out of the window. Off the fire escape.
           CRASH... CAR ALARM BLASTING. 

           Jeffrey runs to the window. A.C's bleeding body on top of a 
           car. Blood and glass everywhere.

           Jeffrey throws up on the fire escape.

           EXT.  LICHT HOME - FAIRFIELD, CT. - SAME

           Tree-lined street dotted with large, stately homes with wide 
           green lawns and trimmed hedges. This is not new money but 
           money that's been around and rolled in for generations.

           SWARM OF JOURNALISTS crowd outside closed gates of a white 
           Colonial. 

           A LUXURY SEDAN divides swarm. Drives through open gates to 
           the front of the house.

           JO LICHT, an attractive woman in her forties with tasteful 
           highlights and a well-structured face, steps out of the car. 
           Makes a convincing job of acting as if the crowd is not 
           there. In front of her house. Making her prime-time news.

           Reporters SCREAM questions through the gates.

                                 REPORTER 1
                        - any word from the kidnappers?

                                 REPORTER 2
                        When was the last time you spoke to 
                        your daughter-

           SUSAN IVERS. Jo's sister, with the same patrician nose and 
           disciplined four miles a day figure, waits with the door 
           open.

           Jo runs to the door. Slams the door shut.

           INT. JO'S BATHROOM - LATER

           Dark slate bathroom straight out of a design magazine. Soft 
           light dapples in through tree branches. That's been carefully 
           planned.

           Jo sits on her toilet, shaking. She unwraps a pack of 
           cigarettes and pulls one out. The sizzle of a match making 
           contact. A lone stream of smoke.

           Jo coughs slightly. It's been a while since she's had her 
           last smoke.
                                 FEMALE ANCHOR (O.S.)
                        ... abducted yesterday just outside 
                        a busy market in the center of the 
                        city...

           INT. JEFFREY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Dark. With the exception of a plasma screen TV permanently 
           set to CNN. Sound low. TV lights flicker shadows across the 
           walls.

           Jeffrey faces the ceiling. He's still in his day clothes. 
           This is not routine for him. But then again, nothing's been 
           routine for the last few days.

           Jeffrey raises one arm, slowly. Then he lets the arm fall. 
           THUD. On his chest. He raises the other arm. Lets it fall. He 
           repeats, slowly. THUD, THUD.

                                 FEMALE ANCHOR (O.S.)

                        Mertain, age 33...

           Jeffrey is not paying attention -- misses the photograph of 
           Kate at her high school graduation.

           Phone RINGS. 

           On TV: Jo's black sedan entering the gates. Jo running into 
           the house. The news camera zooms in on her face. And freezes.

           RING. 

                                 JEFFREY
                           (on answering machine)
                        Please leave a message.
           BEEP.

                                 JO
                        Jeffrey, it's Jo. I need your help.

           INT. ROOM, COUNTRYSIDE AFGHANISTAN - DAY

           Door flings open into a dark room.

           Two MASKED MEN dump a body on the floor and rush out. Door 
           slams shut.

           The body coughs...

           Kate, still hooded.

           She sits up and pulls the hood off. Orients herself to the 
           room, sees a tiny sliver of light...

           A small window, boarded with thick wood. 

           Exhausted. Frightened. Cold. Kate curls up against the wall -- 
           touches her face to make sure she's really there. And 
           realizes her nose is bleeding.

           INT. STATE DEPT. PRESS ROOM, WASHINGTON D.C - DAY

           Jo, fitted black suit, stands at the podium. The State 
           department seal hangs on blue drapes. Next to the American 
           flag.

           At her side --

           DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE JANET PIERSON, fifties, with that 
           glimmer in her eyes that reads as cold ambition but in men 
           read as charisma.

           MAJOR GENERAL THATCHER, sixties, distinguished, fills his 
           uniform with the right blend of ruggedness and duty.

           SENATOR MIKE BISHOP, once a presidential hopeful now trying 
           to stay in the spotlight as long as possible. 

           Jo faces REPORTERS in assigned seats. A packed house.

                                 JO          
                           (eloquent)
                        Kate is a very sweet, gentle girl. 
                        Kate joined WorldCare one year ago 
                        and was so moved by her experience 
                        that she asked to move to 
                        Afghanistan. She wanted to help 
                        those most in need. 
                        Kate is generous to a fault, 
                        smarter than she lets on, and so 
                        much more gracious than she 
                        sometimes should be.

           Jo takes a drink of water. 

                                 JO           
                        Her captors have not identified 
                        themselves but they reassure us 
                        that Kate is in good health. At 
                        this point, they have not listed 
                        any demands. I would like to thank 
                        the State department and the White 
                        House for their support. We are all 
                        praying for Kate's safe return.

           INT. STATE DEPT. HALLWAY - LATER

           Jo, Senator Bishop, and Major General Thatcher walk briskly 
           through a hallway away from the press room. 

                                 MAJOR GENERAL THATCHER
                        Aircraft jets are surveying the 
                        hills around Kabul with heat-
                        sensory detection systems. But it's 
                        a lot of territory to cover. It's 
                        going to take time.

                                 JO
                        I can log online and look at 
                        satellite photos of my own 
                        backyard. I hope you're not trying 
                        to tell me that the internet may 
                        have better technology to find my 
                        daughter than the United States 
                        military?                                     

                                 SENATOR BISHOP
                        I don't mean to sound glib but 
                        we're not talking Fairfield, 
                        Connecticut-

           Jo stops abruptly and turns to Senator Bishop. 

                                 JO
                        Let's get this straight, Mike. I 
                        hope you will excuse me if I skip 
                        the formalities but it seems we're 
                        beyond that now. I hope you don't 
                        take me for a cookie-baking, Range 
                        Rover driving, upper class suburban 
                        housewife. 
                        I met my husband at Harvard where I 
                        beat his 3.6 GPA with a 3.9. I've 
                        seen my husband deal with people 
                        like you. And when I mean people 
                        like you, I mean people who will do 
                        and say just about anything to make 
                        sure they use this tragedy as a re-
                        election point. I'm going to be god-
                        dammed sure that my daughter comes 
                        home in spite of the stupid 
                        mistakes you and people like you 
                        are sure to make. 

           And without skipping a beat, Jo walks off. Her heels digging 
           into the carpet. 

           Senator Bishop looks to Major General Thatcher. Who returns 
           the favor by walking away. Bishop checks a glance at the 
           STAFFERS. Trying to look busy but it's clear from the way 
           they avoid his eyes that they heard everything. May even 
           agree with what she says. Even if she is a bitch.

           EXT. RIDING TRAILS, FAIRFIELD, CT. - DAY

           Jeffrey sits on a bench surrounded by thick trees. Well 
           groomed horse trails run along fenced edges. Private.

           CLICK CLACK of horse hooves. Jo emerges from a turn on 
           horseback and rides up to the bench. 

           Jeffrey stands.

                                 JO
                        Hello Jeffrey.

                                 JEFFREY
                           (voice tight)
                        Jo.

           Jo dismounts in a smooth elegant move. She doesn't sit. 
           Instead, holds the rein and smooths down her horse. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        Strange place to meet.

                                 JO
                        I don't want to be seen talking to 
                        you.
                           (beat)
                        I hear you've gotten into some 
                        trouble.

           Jeffrey almost laughs. She makes it sound so slight. Then 
           realizes it is for her.
                                 JEFFREY
                        I'm sorry about Kate.

                                 JO
                        I don't need your condolences yet.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Then tell me what I'm doing here.

                                 JO
                        I need a free agent.

                                 JEFFREY
                        I'm a journalist, Jo.

                                 JO
                        Not anymore. Unless you want to go 
                        take a shot at Topeka, Kansas. I 
                        hear they have a nice paper.

           Jeffrey doesn't appreciate her sense of humor. He sets a hard 
           stare on her. And she doesn't flinch.

                                 JO
                        It's your lack of situation that 
                        makes you useful to me. I need 
                        someone who can access sketchy 
                        parties.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Sketchy parties?

                                 JO
                        People the government try to find 
                        but just can't seem to. You're good 
                        at finding those people.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Does the State department know 
                        you're talking to me?

                                 JO
                        No.

                                 JEFFREY
                        I suggest you let them handle the 
                        situation.

                                 JO
                        Is that what you would do if she 
                        was your daughter?

           Jeffrey's silence answers her question.
                                 JO
                        Go to Kabul under the pretenses of 
                        investigating the kidnapping as a 
                        story. Find the people who have 
                        Kate and work out a release plan. 
                        The US government does not condone 
                        payment to kidnappers but I do.

                                 JEFFREY
                        This may be a serious crime.

                                 JO
                        I can't take my chances and trust 
                        them to do what's best for Kate. 
                        I've made some enemies.

                                 JEFFREY
                        What makes you think the kidnappers 
                        will negotiate with me?

                                 JO
                        Everyone negotiates. They just 
                        don't admit it. You know that 
                        better than anyone.

                                 JEFFREY
                           (ignoring that last shot)
                        Listen, I want to help you but I 
                        just can't do this now-

                                 JO
                        I can make your problems go away. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        How?

                                 JO
                        You need to pull a rabbit out of a 
                        hat. I have the means to make 
                        something appear out of thin air.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Magic?

                                 JO
                        Magic. Documents confirming the 
                        chain of command. 
                           (beat)
                        From inside the White House.

           Jeffrey looks at her.
                                 JO
                        I also made some good friends when 
                        Robert was alive.

           INT. JEFFREY'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Jeffrey, phone in hand, avoids looking out the window.

                                 MATT
                           (on telephone)
                        Sorry about keeping you on hold.

                                 JEFFREY
                        No worries. So Matt, I've been 
                        thinking about the offer and I'd 
                        love to consider it further.

                                 MATT
                        You can't be serious?

                                 JEFFREY
                        I'm very serious.

                                 MATT
                        Jeffrey, you're being investigated 
                        by the Justice department. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        They're dropping the charges. The 
                        mazagine's doing a formal 
                        retraction.

                                 MATT
                        Listen, I can't possibly sell you 
                        to the networks right now.

                                 JEFFREY
                        You are the network.

                                 MATT
                        Let's talk in a year and see where 
                        we are. Good luck. 

           The phone clicks dead. 

           ROARING GUST of a plane's engines...

           INT/EXT. MERCEDES TAXI, KABUL - DAY

           ...Flying over dust blown streets of Kabul. Afghanistan.

           Jeffrey in the backseat of a 1970s diesel Mercedes taxi, 
           engines PURRING. 
           Outside, construction cranes fill the skyline. The car passes 
           a newly built house -- gated Spanish villa with creeping 
           vines of bougainvillea.  

           Just a few feet away, an off-street plunges into a massive 
           crater. A missile's bulls-eye turned swimming pool for LOCAL 
           KIDS.

           INT. INTERNATIONAL MAYTON HOTEL LOBBY, KABUL - DAY

           Elegant, European-style lobby. Plush carpeting, ornate wall 
           moldings, heavy curtains shield the room in a luxurious haze. 
           Outside: third world country. Inside: Venice.

           The reception MANAGER hands Jeffrey his room key card.

                                 JEFFREY
                        That will be faxed to you.

                                 MANAGER
                        Would you like us to forward it on 
                        to the consulate?

                                 JEFFREY
                        Yes, thank you.

           Jeffrey turns and sees A WOMAN lingering by the entrance, 
           watching him. 

           He walks towards her. Studies her all-American, sun-kissed 
           blond hair under a head scarf. The opposite of glamour, but 
           still alluring. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        I wasn't sure you'd come.

           SUSIE HOPKINS. And as he comes closer, she stiffens. Her 
           armor in place. 

                                 SUSIE
                        I was in the neighborhood.
           She points to seats. Jeffrey follows her, takes her in -- 

                                 SUSIE
                        I'm with the UN offices for project 
                        services. We keep on eye on aid 
                        spending.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Some would call it running away.

           They lock stares. Years pass between them. Susie finally 
           smiles. 

                                 SUSIE
                        Hello Jeffrey.

                                 JEFFREY 
                        Susie.

                                 SUSIE
                        You're covering the kidnappings?  
                        Not your usual beat, Jeffrey. 
                        You're not a field reporter. 

                                 JEFFREY
                           (trying to charm)
                        I'm always looking to broaden my 
                        horizons.

           Susie's trying to figure out his angle.

                                 SUSIE
                        Kidnappings are becoming daily 
                        news. I don't see where the story 
                        is in that. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        It's a story when one of the girls 
                        is linked to a powerful political 
                        dynasty. You know anything?

                                 SUSIE
                        Consensus says it's Taliban trying 
                        to rally back to relevance. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        But you're not convinced.

           Susie takes a quick look around. 

                                 SUSIE
                        It doesn't fit their profile. They 
                        target locals. 
                        Sell-outs to foreign influence. 
                        These two girls don't make sense.
                           (beat)
                        There are whispers about an off-
                        shoot group who thinks the Taliban 
                        went too soft. Odds don't look good 
                        for the girls if it's them.

                                 JEFFREY
                        What do you know about the girls?

                                 SUSIE
                        On paper, they were aid workers. 
                        But the NGOs aren't very popular 
                        now. And like you said, there's 
                        extenuating details. Why these two 
                        girls? Why now? 

                                 JEFFREY
                        So you don't think it's a wrong 
                        place, wrong time?

                                 SUSIE
                        This whole country is wrong place, 
                        wrong time. 

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET, KABUL - LATER

           Traffic barely moves down a busy street. Jeffrey and Susie in 
           the back seat of a cab. The air conditioning blows loudly but 
           does little to bat away the heat.

           LOCAL CHILDREN approach, knocking on the window. Susie waves 
           the cab over.

           The cab stops. Jeffrey and Susie get out, flanked by children 
           grabbing at their clothes. Jeffrey reaches in his pocket.

                                 SUSIE
                        If you give them money, we'll have 
                        a hundred more chasing us through 
                        the day. This isn't Washington.

           Jeffrey takes his hands out of his pockets. Empty. And we 
           realize that Jeffrey's not in his element. He's used to the 
           hushed corridors of corporate hallways, Congress chambers. 
           Not used to getting his nice shirt wet with sweat. 

           Susie yells something to the kids in Dari, leading Jeffrey 
           away. 

                                 SUSIE
                        Here.
           Jeffrey looks around. The corner looks familiar. He's seen it 
           before...

           And now this common street looks different -- more 
           threatening...

           MEN huddled in cafes, drinking coffee, smoking cigarettes... 
           eyeing them.

           Susie points out a sharp skid on a wall. One of the vehicles 
           slammed into the wall, hard.

                                 SUSIE
                        Military officials questioned some 
                        witnesses but there wasn't much to 
                        go on- 

           A small stone pelts Jeffrey in the neck. He turns and sees a 
           nine year old STREET KID laughing at him.

                                 JEFFREY
                        The kids love me here.

           Another pelt.

           Susie yells something at the kid. His youthful swagger 
           clipped by hearing a blond woman speak his language. He yells 
           something back to her. 

                                 SUSIE
                        He says he saw the whole thing.

           Susie beckons the kid over. The kid shakes his head no.

                                 SUSIE
                        He wants money.

           Jeffrey pulls out some coins. The kid approaches easily and 
           takes the money. 

           Susie talks with the kid. Who's enjoying the moment.

                                 SUSIE
                           (translating)
                        There were two cars. Four guys in 
                        one, three in the other. Only half 
                        of them had guns. Someone called 
                        the driver a traitor and shot him 
                        in the head. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        Where was the kid standing?
           The kid points up. Jeffrey and Susie follow his finger - the 
           apartment building right above the street.

           Susie takes out a small camera from her pocket and steps 
           closer to the kid. He mugs for the camera, giving a thumbs up 
           sign. The kid says something to her, and she laughs.

                                 JEFFREY
                        What'd he say?

                                 SUSIE
                        Says he wants to move to America 
                        and be a basketball player. Says 
                        Allah would be pleased. 

           The kid tells her something else. Susie's face changes.

                                 JEFFREY
                        What?

                                 SUSIE
                        He says we should find the 
                        videotape.

           EXT. STORE, KABUL - LATER

           Jeffrey watches Susie speak with the STORE OWNER. Who doesn't 
           like talking to a woman. He responds to Jeffrey.

                                 SUSIE
                           (translating)
                        He thinks the camera was new. The 
                        man using it didn't seem too 
                        familiar with how to use it. 

           Jeffrey takes out a piece of paper and jots down a note. 
           Hands it to the Store Owner.

                                 JEFFREY
                        If he sees that man again. Tell him 
                        to call me. There's a reward.

           Susie translates.

           Jeffrey positions himself in the place of the camera man. 
           Looks across the street. It's a good line of vision.

           INT. KATE'S GUESTHOUSE DOOR, KABUL - NIGHT

           WARNING and DO NOT DISTURB tape over the door. Jeffrey cuts 
           through it.
           A CREAK. They turn and see the door across the hall slightly 
           ajar. Dark eyes watching them. Susie takes a step to the 
           door, but it shuts closed.

                                 JEFFREY
                           (not too concerned)
                        We'll say we found it open. 

           Jeffrey pushes his weight on the door. But the door's too 
           thick.

           Susie holds up a nail file. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        So you do miss it.

                                 SUSIE
                        What?

                                 JEFFREY
                        Being a reporter.

           INT. KATE'S ROOM, KABUL - LATER

           Closet. Nothing remarkable about the clothes. Nothing that 
           says much about the person wearing them.

           Jeffrey turns away. Glances at -

           Susie. On the made bed, flipping through Kate's books. 
           Covered with post-it notes:"Repeat back what they say;" "Do 
           not confuse we and them;" "Smile. They are a friendly 
           people."  Susie smiles. 

           Jeffrey moves to Kate's desk. He picks up a framed photo of 
           Kate, Jo and ROBERT LICHT. Kate leans closer to her father.

           Jeffrey takes the photo out of the frame...

           Slides the photo in his jacket.

           INT. ROOM, COUNTRYSIDE AFGHANISTAN - NIGHT

           Kate. Opens her eyes, realizes she's on a mattress.

           Someone's moving in the next room.

           INT. COMMON ROOM, COUNTRYSIDE AFGHANISTAN - SAME

           An OLD WOMAN sings to herself in a scratchy, half-there 
           voice. 
           The room is both kitchen and living room. Perhaps once a 
           happy home to a family, but now it's pretty bare with just a 
           table and a few tattered chairs.

           Kate opens her door and walks into the room. The Old Woman 
           does not look up.

                                 KATE
                           (in Dari)
                        Hello?

           Still no reaction from the Old Woman. It's clear from the way 
           she moves and sees that the Old Woman is not blind. 

           And then Kate sees it. The front door. Half open.

           EXT. COUNTRY VILLAGE - SAME

           Kate pushes the door open wide. Turns back to the Old Woman. 
           Who still does not respond. Can she just walk out? 

           But. A GUARD, stationed at the door, pushes her back in the 
           house. He shouts something at the Old Woman. Who dismisses 
           him with a tired wave. The Guard slams the door in Kate's 
           face.

                                 HOTEL MANAGER (O.S.)
                        Mr. Highsmith?

           INT. HOTEL LOBBY, KABUL

           The Hotel Manager rushes towards Jeffrey. 

                                 HOTEL MANAGER
                        My apologies for disturbing you but 
                        we have not received your press 
                        credentials. We need to have our 
                        guests purpose of visit accounted 
                        for.

                                 JEFFREY
                        I'm sorry. I'll get someone from 
                        the magazine on that right away.

           Jeffrey rushes past him. To Susie waiting by the entrance.

                                 JEFFREY
                        How about a tour of the 
                        countryside?

           INT. ROOM, COUNTRYSIDE AFGHANISTAN - DAY

           A knock at the door. Kate looks up.
           The Leader. HAMID HADID.

                                 HAMID
                           (faint British accent)
                        Hello Kate. My name is Hamid. Would 
                        you like to stretch your legs?

           INT/EXT. CAR - DAY

           A battered SUV bumps along a dirt off-road, up a steep 
           hillside. Kabul, spread out in the background. 

           Ahead, mountains that run forever.

           Susie and Jeffrey in the backseat. 

           Their DRIVER, a wide man with a heavy beard, smokes out the 
           window and steers with one arm. His face partially obscured 
           by a hat.

           EXT. VILLAGE, COUNTRYSIDE AFGHANISTAN - LATER

           Kate shields her eyes, adjusting to the overwhelming 
           sunlight. Hamid leads her through the village. Now just a 
           handful of adobe walled huts, rotting slowly back to dust. 

           An old, limping BLACK DOG follows him loyally. The dog sniffs 
           at Kate's feet.

                                 HAMID
                        I understand the circumstances are 
                        not as you wish. But for the time 
                        being, we can play the role of a 
                        host and a guest. 

           Hamid doesn't acknowledge Kate's incredulous stare. 

           A weary VILLAGE MAN passes, carrying a large stack of chopped 
           wood on his back. He could be fifty or a hundred years old. 

           Hamid nods his head in a respectful greeting. The Man does 
           not look at Kate. 

                                 KATE
                        They don't see me?

                                 HAMID
                        They don't want to see you.

                                 KATE
                        Is it that easy?
                                 HAMID
                        This village once had four hundred 
                        people. But then the Soviets 
                        invaded, and it began a slow death. 
                        There's only a handful of people 
                        left. And they're tired of seeing 
                        everything.

           Hamid walks her to the edge of a field. Scorched. We've been 
           here before.

                                 HAMID
                        My father sold off all his 
                        livestock to pay for my passage out 
                        of the country. He had eight 
                        children and he could only afford 
                        to get a few of us out.
                           (beat, looking out at the 
                           fields)
                        He did not want us to die fighting 
                        an enemy we would never see again. 
                        When I came back, my father was 
                        dead. This is how I found my 
                        village. You've already met my 
                        mother. 

           Kate squints her eyes to see him against the sun.

                                 HAMID
                        I know all about you, Katherine 
                        Licht. Your upper class upbringing, 
                        private schools, good American 
                        university. And now you know what 
                        you need to know about me. 

           Hamid bends down and pats the dog. 

                                 KATE
                           (quiet)
                        Where is Julie?

                                 HAMID
                        Your mother has been on television.
                           (beat)
                        Would you like to send her a 
                        message?

           INT/EXT. ROADBLOCK, KABUL - LATER

           The car slows down in front of a security checkpoint. THREE 
           AFGHANI SOLDIERS come to attention.
                                 SUSIE
                        You sure you know what you're 
                        doing?

           Jeffrey, calm, pulls an envelope out of his pocket.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Yes.

           The first soldier approaches the car. The driver rolls down 
           his window. They speak in low voices. 

           The soldier looks back at Susie and Jeffrey. Jeffrey avoids 
           eye contact. 

           The soldier motions to the back of the car. The other two 
           soldiers take a look. The first soldier stays in place, 
           doesn't take his eyes off Susie. He leans in and whispers 
           something to the Driver, grinning. 

           CLACK! The back door closes. 

           Jeffrey leans forward and hands the Driver the envelope. Who 
           hands it to the Soldier. The soldier opens the envelope, 
           counts the money. He takes his time. Relishing the control he 
           has. 

           Finally, the soldier nods. 

           The gates lift up.

           EXT. DIRT ROAD, AFGHANISTAN - LATER

           The SUV passes a truck on the narrow road, revealing...

           Lush, colorful poppy fields. Heroin. Beautiful.

           EXT. ROCKY HILLS, AFGHANISTAN - LATER

           The SUV stops. The Driver turns around. Half his face is 
           covered with tiny scars. A tortured face. 

                                 DRIVER
                           (heavy accent)
                        I stop here.

                                 JEFFREY
                           (to Susie)
                        We walk the rest of the way.

                                 SUSIE
                        Walk? Where?
                                 DRIVER
                        They will find you.

                                 SUSIE
                        Who?  

                                 DRIVER
                        Half a mile. Not much.

                                 SUSIE
                        Jeffrey. Please tell me what's 
                        going on.

                                 JEFFREY
                        I'm meeting a contact. He's not a 
                        visible person. Understand? 

                                 SUSIE
                           (indicating the driver)
                        How can we be sure he'll be here 
                        when we get back?

                                 JEFFREY
                        We don't. If you don't feel 
                        comfortable, you can stay in the-

                                 SUSIE
                           (trying to control 
                           herself)
                        I'm not staying here by myself. 
                        Jeffrey, the risks you take...

           Her lips tremble.

                                 JEFFREY
                        I promise everything will be okay.

           Susie looks at him. He's a rock.

           The driver pulls out a gun and offers it to Jeffrey. Jeffrey 
           considers it, but shakes his head no. He gets out of the car.

           Susie looks at the driver. At the mountains around them. She 
           takes the gun.

           EXT. COUNTRYSIDE, AFGHANISTAN - LATER

           Jeffrey and Susie trekking over a low hill. They sense they 
           are being watched...
           EXT. COUNTRYSIDE, AFGHANISTAN - LATER

           ... A fork in the path. Barely noticeable. They can no longer 
           see their car. 

                                 SUSIE
                        What next?

                                 JEFFREY 
                        Someone will-

           BANG! A gunshot misses them by a few feet. Susie screams. 
           Jeffrey grabs her and falls to the ground. He scans the 
           landscape.

           AN INSURGENT FIGHTER, turbaned and holding a machine gun 
           older than his age, jumps out from behind the rocks and waves 
           them forward.

           EXT. CAVE ENTRANCE - COUNTRYSIDE, AFGHANISTAN - LATER

           The brightness from outside shields the cave's entrance in 
           pitch darkness. The Fighter frisks Jeffrey and then Susie. He 
           finds the gun in Susie's jacket and takes it. Jeffrey almost 
           smiles.

                                 JEFFREY
                        You took the gun?

                                 SUSIE
                        I was supposed to just trust you?

           The fighter pushes them inside. 

           INT. CAVE - COUNTRYSIDE, AFGHANISTAN

           Jeffrey and Susie's eyes adjust to the darkness, discover 
           AZIZ RUHEL, late twenties, sitting on the ground. Thick 
           beard, intense fair eyes, and a week's grime on his clothes 
           and skin. 

                                 AZIZ
                        Please sit.

           Jeffrey and Susie sit across from him, keeping one eye on  
           The Fighter crouched at the cave's entrance, gun aimed at 
           them. 

           Another YOUNG FIGHTER stands a few feet behind Aziz. Dark 
           eyes that have forgotten life's little pleasures.

                                 JEFFREY
                        You must be an important man now.
           Aziz's stone cold face cracks a smile. Jeffrey laughs with 
           him. Susie looks between the two men -- what the hell is 
           going on?

           Aziz offers his hand. Jeffrey shakes it warmly.

                                 AZIZ
                        Professor.

                                 JEFFREY
                           (to Susie)
                        I taught a course at Yale. Aziz 
                        should have been my best student. 
                        But he didn't like deadlines. 

                                 SUSIE
                        You went to Yale?

                                 AZIZ
                        They like diversity at your 
                        American schools. 

                                 SUSIE
                        How did you end up back here?

           Aziz looks at Jeffrey.

                                 AZIZ
                        Let's just say I saw opportunities, 
                        my friend.

                                 JEFFREY
                        You said you wanted to help build a 
                        democracy in this country. Not join 
                        the Taliban.

           Susie looks at Aziz. Uncomfortable.

                                 AZIZ
                        The leadership is changing and we 
                        want to legitimize our power. We've 
                        learned from our mistakes.  

                                 JEFFREY
                        Are you behind the kidnappings?

                                 AZIZ
                        When the Americans came and chased 
                        us out, the group fractured. Most 
                        of the groups have now come back 
                        together to build a stronger, 
                        smarter Taliban. 
                           (off Susie's look)
                        You don't like the sound of that?

           Susie doesn't respond. Aziz continues to smile.

                                 AZIZ
                        A few splinter groups chose not to 
                        come back. One of them calls 
                        themselves the Order of the Faith. 
                        They raised a little money from 
                        Pakistan. Al-Qaeda. And their money 
                        drew better leaders. I believe they 
                        are your kidnappers. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        Do you think they will kill the 
                        girls?

                                 AZIZ
                        I can't speak for them, my friend. 
                        But I can tell you the Taliban do 
                        not target aid workers. They are 
                        here to help, and we respect that.

                                 SUSIE
                           (boldly)
                        But what about reports that the 
                        Taliban is responsible for the 
                        latest political assassinations?

           Aziz laughs, waving her off. 

                                 AZIZ
                           (too dismissive)
                        Look at these boys. Do they look 
                        like political assassins to you? 
                        They just want to feel like they 
                        have some control of their lives. 
                        We give them that. 

                                 SUSIE
                        I see why you're the propaganda 
                        official.

           Aziz loses his smile. But he's not angry, just thinking.

                                 AZIZ
                        You call it propaganda when you 
                        don't agree with the message. Who's 
                        really the one with the agenda?
                        Ask them yourself. I don't speak 
                        for them. 
                                 SUSIE
                        You want me to ask them if they're 
                        cold-blooded killers?

                                 AZIZ
                        I have nothing to hide.

           Susie turns to Jeffrey. Realizes there's something she's not 
           getting. But stands and walks to the Insurgents.

           Jeffrey moves to the cave's mouth. Aziz follows him.

                                 JEFFREY
                           (low voice)
                        I need to get in touch with the 
                        people who have the girls. 

                                 AZIZ
                        I'm curious what capacity you are 
                        looking for that information?

                                 JEFFREY
                        I'm doing some private consulting 
                        work.

                                 AZIZ
                        I bet you are, my friend. By the 
                        way, I read the article. I'm sorry 
                        it's proven to be your Achilles 
                        Heel.

           Jeffrey blinks. He doesn't want to talk about that.

                                 JEFFREY
                        I can pay for that information. In 
                        exchange for reliable information, 
                        you and your organization... or 
                        just you, if you like, will get a 
                        one-time fee of one million 
                        dollars.

                                 AZIZ
                        I like Americans. So willing to 
                        make friends with everyone. 
                        I will get back to you. 
                           (beat)
                        We shouldn't keep your beautiful 
                        friend waiting.

           Aziz waves over at Susie. Who's been watching them.
                                 JEFFREY
                        I remember your weakness for 
                        blonds.

           Aziz laughs.

           INT. SUV, COUNTRYSIDE - EARLY EVENING

           The day starts to fall and the sky opens in a violent shade 
           of orange.

           The car treks back. Jeffrey stares out the window. A 
           weariness haunts his face. Susie, asleep, on Jeffrey's 
           shoulder.

           Out the window, he sees an Old Woman carrying a heavy basket 
           on her back. 

           The car passes. 

           ... Hamid's mother. And she walks toward a desolate, hopeless 
           village.

           INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT, KABUL - NIGHT

           New restaurant on touristy Chicken Street. Red and white 
           checkered tablecloths and tea candles dot small tables. 
           Clientele of WEALTHY AFGHANI PATRONS and FOREIGN JOURNALISTS 
           enjoy passable Italian pasta.

           Susie looks over the short menu. 

           INT. BATHROOM CORRIDOR, RESTAURANT - SAME

           Jeffrey, holding his cell phone with one hand and a public 
           phone in the other. Sees Susie in the dining room talking 
           with a WAITER. She points to him. He waves.

                                 JO
                        Hello?

                                 JEFFREY
                        It's Jeffrey.

                                 JO
                        You're not supposed to contact me-

                                 JEFFREY
                        I need a press credential.

                                 JO
                        I don't care what you need. Don't 
                        call me here.
           She hangs up. 

           INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT, KABUL - NIGHT

           Jeffrey picks up his menu. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        What looks good?

           He feels Susie's questioning eyes on him.

                                 SUSIE
                        What was so important you couldn't 
                        wait to get back to the hotel?

                                 JEFFREY
                        I was hoping to catch someone at 
                        the magazine. I need a press 
                        credential.
                           (Smoothly)
                        Do you think you can get me a 
                        temporary one till they get their 
                        act together?

                                 SUSIE
                        How am I supposed to do that?

                                 JEFFREY
                        UN people always know the right 
                        people.

           AMERICANS at a table nearby. The old boys network with a few 
           new faces.

                                 SUSIE
                        Strange how people traveling on 
                        business take liberties they would 
                        never take at home. They buy the 
                        most expensive bottle of wine, 
                        charge it to their Islamic 
                        countries and say it was for their 
                        business partners. You can't 
                        control the infidels but you can 
                        still make money with them.

                                 JEFFREY
                           (gently)
                        Susie, you've been here too long. 

                                 SUSIE
                           (bitter smile)
                        Maybe.
                                 JEFFREY
                        You didn't have to leave the 
                        magazine.

                                 SUSIE
                        You were right. I wasn't willing to 
                        do whatever it takes. 
                           (beat)
                        I would have only been staying for 
                        you. And you made it clear that was 
                        not in my best interest.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Where are they going?

                                 SUSIE
                        They're being taken to the military 
                        base in Bagram for questioning. 
                        Most of them will be released. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        And the others?

                                 SUSIE
                        They'll be flown to the detainee 
                        camps.

           INT. HOMELAND SECURITY INFORMATION SERVICES, D.C - DAY

           Windowless room filled with rows of blinking computers. 
           AGENTS wearing headsets, looking for the needle in the 
           haystack.

           AGENT LAWLER pulls up a flagged conversation on her computer.

                                 JEFFREY (O.S.)
                        You need to get someone to issue me 
                        a-

                                 JO (O.S.)
                        I don't care what you need. Don't 
                        call me here.

           Agent Lawler picks up the phone.

                                 KATE (O.S.)
                        You have four days.
           INT. KATE'S ROOM, COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

           Kate, wearing a long head scarf which partially covers her 
           eyes, looks directly into the camera.

                                 KATE
                           (reading)
                        ... to release two hundred and six 
                        prisoners awaiting transportation 
                        to the detainee prison camps. We 
                        will not consider any other 
                        options.  

           Kate glances up. Someone just behind the camera is speaking 
           to her. 

                                 KATE
                        I do not know where I am. And I 
                        have been warned that any actions 
                        taken to discover my whereabouts 
                        will lead to...
                           (voice breaking)
                        ... to serious repercussions. 

           INT. STATE DEPT. ROOM - NIGHT

           ON TV MONITOR: satellite feed of Kate.  She looks frightened. 
           Vulnerable.

           Jo watches the footage, her face difficult to read. Behind 
           her, Janet Pierson and Major General Thatcher.

                                 KATE
                           (on monitor)
                        Mom, I'm okay. Please don't be 
                        scared.

           The video feed ends. STATIC.

           Jo clenches her jaw.

                                 JO
                        Are we even considering the release 
                        of those prisoners?

                                 JANET PIERSON
                        That is not an option.

                                 JO
                        What's next then?

           Janet moves to the table. Major General Thatcher stays still.
                                 JANET PIERSON
                        In most of these cases with foreign 
                        kidnappings, the abductees are 
                        released. Especially if they're 
                        women. 

                                 JO
                        So we should wait on precedence?

                                 JANET PIERSON
                        Of course not. I'm just saying that 
                        the odds look hopeful.

                                 JO
                        Hopeful. I hate that word. It means 
                        you have nothing better to say.
                           (beat)
                        I'm going to Kabul.

                                 JANET PIERSON
                        What do you think you can do that 
                        we can't?

           Jo stands, ignoring the question.

                                 JANET PIERSON
                        Why don't you tell us about Jeffrey 
                        Highsmith.

                                 JO
                        Did you really think I was going to 
                        just stand by and wait for you guys 
                        to fuck up?

                                 JANET PIERSON
                        No. I was warned about you. But 
                        tell me how turning to an ex-
                        boyfriend helps you? Doesn't seem 
                        your style. 

                                 JO
                        Don't underestimate me.

                                 JANET PIERSON
                        I don't. We should start working 
                        together.

           EXT. HOTEL, KABUL - DAY

           Jeffrey walks out the hotel entrance. A HOTEL ATTENDANT 
           directs him to a waiting taxi.
                                 DRIVER (O.S.)
                        Mr. Highsmith.

           Also waiting, the driver with the scars.

                                 DRIVER
                        I'm to take you to your 
                        appointment.

           Jeffrey motions for the waiting taxi to go. He walks over to 
           the driver.

                                 JEFFREY
                        I didn't know I had an appointment.

           Without answering, the driver jumps into his car. Starts the 
           engine. Jeffrey considers his options. Then gets in. The car 
           drives out the hotel gates...

           Passing a bullet-proof US consulate sedan -- Jo in the 
           backseat with Thatcher.

           EXT. POOR NEIGHBORHOOD, KABUL - DAY

           The car drives quickly through side streets. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        Can we slow down?

                                 DRIVER
                        We're late.

           The car BRAKES to a sudden stop. On reflex, Jeffrey tenses. 

           But it's only a LINE OF BICYCLES crossing the street. Jeffrey 
           notices the Driver checking him out in the rearview mirror. 

           The driver honks his horn. Has little effect on the cyclists. 
           They pass, and the car continues. Gaining speed. 

                                 JEFFREY
                           (gripping door handle)
                        I asked you do slow down.

           The car speeds up.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Do you understand-

                                 DRIVER
                        Someone is following us.
           Jeffrey looks out the back window. A beat up car follows. The 
           windows tinted too dark to get a good view.

           The driver turns the wheel sharply, squeezing into a tight 
           alleyway. 

           SCREECH. The beat up car does a quick reverse and follows.

           Jeffrey's car leads the chase -- through winding streets -- 
           that get narrower -- less graveled.

           The other car stays on course...

           Follows up a steep driveway...

           The other car gains some distance. But the Driver spins his 
           wheel and does a sharp 180-turn -- in the middle of a crowded 
           plaza. People get out of their way.

           The other car follows...

           Into shanty towns. Apartments and tents packed tightly 
           together. Some with no roofs. 

           The Driver makes a last minute U-turn that moves the car back 
           down the hill. 

           The beat up car attempts to do the same move.

           HONK! An open truck swerves -- about to hit Jeffrey's car --  
           but his Driver maneuvers out of the way. 

           The open truck blocks the other car in.

           Jeffrey leans back. His heart still racing. He looks over at 
           the driver and sees that he's twitching with relief too. That 
           feeling when adrenaline's still pumping but your heart's 
           telling your body to calm the hell down.

           Jeffrey's car makes a few more turns -- drives deeper into a 
           shanty neighborhood -- pulls into an abandoned lot. Next to a 
           barely standing building.

           The driver gets out of his car -- opens Jeffrey's door. 

                                 DRIVER
                        We're late.

           INT. BROTHEL - DAY

           Christmas lights pulse to the trance-dance music. A room the 
           size of a small bar with curtained side rooms. Filled with 
           cigarette smoke. 
           CHINESE PROSTITUTES. Young girls in bras and underwear, stand 
           at attention as the door opens. 

           Jeffrey walks in. And it's clear this is not what he 
           expected. The prostitutes grab at him, putting forward their 
           best faces. Their best body parts.

           The Driver pulls the girls off Jeffrey and leads him towards 
           the back. 

           A DOOR.

           INT. BROTHEL BACK ROOM - DAY

           Jeffrey follows the Driver into a long, narrow room. 

           WORKERS lean over a low table. Carefully unpacking plastic 
           bags. They ignore the visitors.

           Jeffrey covers his nose. Something's killing the air.

                                 AZIZ (O.S.)
                        Professor!

           Aziz stands in the back, in his turban and long robes. His 
           two Guards not too far away.

           The Driver keeps watch at the door. Jeffrey walks over to 
           Aziz. 

           Workers open plastic containers. Careful. DRIED POPPY BUDS. 
           Nimble hands use a blade to cut into the buds. 

                                 AZIZ
                        One millimeter. Or nature is not 
                        very forgiving. If the blades cut 
                        too deep, the liquid will spill out 
                        too quickly. But if you cut too 
                        little, then the substance will 
                        harden in the pod. 

           Jeffrey, nose still covered, watches experienced hands scrape 
           out a semi-liquid ooze. 

                                 AZIZ
                        Your government burned one thousand 
                        acres of my fields last month. 

           The men gather the liquid into vials. 

                                 AZIZ
                        I know where the American girl is 
                        being held.
                                 JEFFREY
                        You work fast.

                                 AZIZ
                        Money is a better incentive than 
                        grades. Instead of paying the 
                        kidnappers you will pay me. This is 
                        a better arrangement. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        Better arrangement for who?

                                 AZIZ
                        Did you know that kidnapping is a 
                        $500 million dollar global 
                        business?

                                 JEFFREY
                        You said you weren't behind this.

                                 AZIZ
                        No. But it doesn't mean I can't 
                        profit from it. I make up for lost 
                        profits and your government kills 
                        those who have her and rid the 
                        Taliban of our pest problem. You 
                        leave with a clear conscious.

                                 JEFFREY
                        We have very different definitions 
                        of a clear conscious.

                                 AZIZ
                        That's what my brothers said to me. 
                        But I'm not so sure about that, my 
                        friend.

           The Old Woman sleeps sitting in a chair, mouth open. She 
           snores with every other breath.

           Kate watches her. Willing her to wake up.

           Lights FLASH through the room. Sounds of TIRES crack the dirt 
           roads, stop.

           Kate walks over to the window. A GUARD, even younger than the 
           last one, stands watch outside Kate's house.

           A truck idles twenty feet away. Hamid leans against the 
           passenger window. Talking quickly. He's upset. THREE SHADOWED 
           FIGURES sit in the car. 
           Hamid steps away, trying to calm down. He looks up and 
           catches Kate's eye. She steps out of his line of sight. 

           Hamid helps a WOMEN IN BURKHA get out and walks her into 
           another home.

           Kate turns back to the Old Woman...

           Eyes open wide. Focused on Kate. The Old Woman stands. 
           Whispering quickly, full of anger. She walks up to Kate. 
           Pushes her against the door...

           EXT. VILLAGE HOUSE - SAME

           The guard stands alert and raises his gun. Kate backs away 
           from him, out of the house. He yells something at her. But 
           his voice betrays that he's probably just as scared as she 
           is.

           Kate points to the old woman. Still muttering.

           The rebel guard splits his attention, and gives Kate the 
           break to run off. 

           He SCREAMS after her. Shoots into the air...

           EXT. VILLAGE, COUNTRYSIDE AFGHANISTAN - SAME

           Kate running fast...

           Past houses. Past dry canals that once irrigated the fields. 
           Past the generator that's long stopped working.

           EXT. FIELDS, COUNTRYSIDE AFGHANISTAN - SAME

           ... Into the fields. Kate's feet scrape against the rocky 
           dirt. 

           She turns back. Sees the village get further away. And no one 
           coming after her. 

           Kate looks ahead of her. Towering mountainsides. 
           Impenetrable. 

           There's no need for anyone to hurry. There is nowhere to go. 

           She drops to the ground. Panic and fear make way to fury. She 
           pounds the ground with all the strength she has.

                                 KATE
                           (screams, helpless)
                        Please, someone help me!
           Exhaustion overcomes her... She lies down on the cold earth. 
           Closes her eyes. 

           Now FOOTSTEPS running towards her. Getting closer...

           INT. HOTEL BATHROOM, KABUL - NIGHT

           Steam travels across the bathroom.

           Jeffrey leans against the tiled wall as water pours on him.

           INT. JEFFREY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           RINGING PHONE.

           Jeffrey, wrapped in a towel, opens the bathroom door. A trail 
           of steam pillows out. He runs to the phone.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Hello?

                                 TELEPHONE MAN (O.S.)
                           (rough English)
                        I told to call. You looking.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Who is this?

                                 TELEPHONE MAN
                        You want videotape?

                                 JEFFREY
                        Yes. Do you have it?

                                 TELEPHONE MAN
                        My friend. But he not speak 
                        English. I call. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        I need that tape.

                                 TELEPHONE MAN
                        We can meet.

           INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE, KABUL - NIGHT

           A taxi pulls up in front of a deserted warehouse. 

           Jeffrey  steps out. Followed by Susie. As he pays the driver, 
           she looks around. At the poorly lit, desolate street. Lined 
           with tented sheets and cardboard boxes. Kabul's skid row.
                                 SUSIE
                        Maybe we should wait till morning.

                                 JEFFREY
                        I don't want him changing his mind.

           Jeffrey grabs her hand and leads her through the entrance.

           INT. WAREHOUSE FLOOR, KABUL - NIGHT

           Half-renovated office building. Looks like whoever wanted to 
           fix it up changed his mind. And left quickly. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        Hello?

           His voice echoes. 

                                 SUSIE
                        I don't like this.

           Footsteps CLACK above them. 

           INT. STAIRWAY, KABUL - NIGHT

           Jeffrey and Susie wait at the bottom of the stairs. Susie 
           looks like she's going to pass out. Jeffrey looks a shade 
           better.

                                 TELEPHONE MAN (O.S.)
                        No move.

           Jeffrey and Susie look up and see stairs zigzagging up dark 
           floors. 

           A MAN'S FACE pops over several flights above them. 

           Susie flinches on instinct. 

           The telephone man. Somewhere in his fifties. It's difficult 
           to see his eyes in the darkness.

                                 TELEPHONE MAN
                        We talk here.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Is your friend here? 

           The Telephone Man turns and speaks to someone next to him. A 
           FIFTEEN YEAR OLD BOY looks down at them.

                                 TELEPHONE MAN
                        This is my son.
           The son whispers to his father. The telephone man nods 
           reassuringly.

                                 TELEPHONE MAN
                        We don't want police. My son did 
                        not buy camera. He stole.

           The son doesn't look too chastened. He seems to be having 
           fun.

                                 TELEPHONE MAN
                        Don't want trouble.

                                 JEFFREY
                        We don't work with the police. We 
                        won't tell them anything about 
                        this.

                                 TELEPHONE MAN
                        We feel bad about girl. Don't like 
                        kidnapping. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        The videotape may help us. 

                                 TELEPHONE MAN
                        You bring money?

                                 JEFFREY
                        Yes.

           Jeffrey shows him an envelope. Flicks his fingers over the 
           bills.

                                 TELEPHONE MAN
                        Okay. Give money to woman. I send 
                        son. They meet in middle.

                                 JEFFREY
                        No. I want to come.

                                 TELEPHONE MAN
                        Must be woman.

                                 SUSIE
                           (not sure)
                        I can do it.

                                 JEFFREY
                        I shouldn't have brought you here-

                                 SUSIE
                        I can do it.
                                 JEFFREY
                           (up at the man)
                        Show me the tape first.

           The son hands something to his father. The man shows them the 
           tape. 

                                 SUSIE
                        It can help us. 

           Susie takes the envelope out of Jeffrey's hands and starts 
           walking. Before Jeffrey has a chance to say anything. 
           Footsteps descend from above.

           Jeffrey tries to keep Susie in view, but once she's reached 
           the landing above, he loses sight of her.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Susie, walk along the side. I can't 
                        see you.

           Susie comes into view. She peers down at him. 

           He sees her walk up another flight of stairs. Then disappears 
           out of view.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Susie!

           A beat. Jeffrey decides whether to run up. 

           She comes back into view, leans over, and shows him the 
           videotape.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Come on down.

           Her footsteps run down the stairs. Quickly. Susie falls into 
           Jeffrey's arms.

           INT. JEFFREY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Jeffrey opens his hotel room. An HOTEL ATTENDANT wheels in an 
           old VCR.

                                 ATTENDANT
                        This is the only one we were able 
                        to find, Sir.

                                 JEFFREY
                        That's fine.
           The attendant looks over at Susie, sitting on the bed with 
           her shoes off. Smiles knowingly at Jeffrey.

                                 JEFFREY
                           (handing him tip)
                        Thank you.

           The attendant leaves, taking a last look at Susie.

           Jeffrey connects the VCR to the TV in his room. He gets a 
           signal. And pops in the tape.

           Jeffrey takes a seat next to Susie. His shoulders squared 
           next hers. She throws him a quick look. But he's handling the 
           remote.

           Jeffrey pushes play.

           SHAKY VIDEO FOOTAGE. Through the eyes of someone just 
           learning how to use the camera -- random zoom ins and outs --
           frantic movements.

           SCREECH... 

           A smooth patter of GUNSHOTS.

           The camera jerks around. Boy holding camera drops to the 
           floor. He remembers his camera, focuses his lens across the 
           street... 

           A black Nissan cross parked in front of the taxi -- taxi 
           tries to reverse -- another dark car blocks the other side. 
           Crowds run to safety. 

           Masked men rush out of both cars -- shoot out the windows -- 
           at the driver. 

           Kate -- crouching in her seat -- holding on to Julie. Her 
           eyes wide with fear. The door opens... 

           Kate and Julie herded into different cars. Tires burn. The 
           cars hurry out.

           And the tape goes BLACK.

                                 SUSIE
                        You think you get used to seeing-
                           (off Jeffrey's look)
                        What's wrong?

           Jeffrey, steel focus in his eyes, rewinds the tape...
           EXT. KABUL STREET - DAY

           Heavy clouds move quickly, strangely over the street. 

           Kate stands alone. Looks around, but no one is there. The 
           ground starts shaking... Something is coming.

           VOICE CHANTING. Getting louder. More desperate. Closer. 

           And then she sees them...

           A LARGE WAVE OF WOMEN -- covered in matching blue burkas -- 
           flood the streets. They move like a wave across the ocean's 
           sand -- hands raised to the heavens -- beseeching their God 
           for relief. 

           They push past Kate. They don't see her. 

           But someone stops. Turns slowly, and stares right at her...

           Julie. Wearing a burka. But we see that she is smiling.

           INT. BEDROOM, COUNTRYSIDE, AFGHANISTAN

           TITLE: "3 DAYS LEFT"

           Kate tries to wake up. She's feverish, pale. 

           She passes out again.

                                 JO (O.S.)
                        Can we trust him?

           EXT. HOTEL SWIMMING POOL -  DAY

           Jo, wearing a pantsuit too hot for the weather and sunglasses 
           that hide her eyes, smokes a cigarette. Jeffrey sits on a 
           lounge chair across from her. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        I've known him for ten years. He's 
                        a good business man. 

                                 JO
                        So I wire him the money. Then?

                                 JEFFREY
                        He hands over the coordinates.

                                 JO
                        Then?
                                 JEFFREY
                        You use your influence to get a 
                        special forces team to do a 
                        recapture mission.

                                 JO
                        That's not going to be that easy to 
                        negotiate.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Everyone negotiates. They just 
                        don't know it. 

                                 JO
                           (smiling tightly)
                        They're going to want to know how I 
                        got that information.

                                 JEFFREY
                        It's not illegal to buy 
                        information.

                                 JO
                        And if the kidnappers find out?

           Jeffrey does not answer.

           Jo fixes her eyes on the perfect blue reflection in the pool, 
           weighing her options. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        They are not going to release those 
                        prisoners. 

                                 JO
                        You know better than to talk to me 
                        like an idiot.

           Jo stubs out her cigarette. 

                                 JO
                        Go ahead and make the deal.

           INT. HOTEL LOBBY, KABUL - SAME

           Susie walks up to the reception desk.

                                 SUSIE
                        Excuse me. Could you call Mr. 
                        Highsmith's room. Tell him Susie's 
                        down in the lobby?
                                 CONCIERGE
                        Yes, ma'am.

           The concierge picks up the phone.

           Susie turns and looks out a large window that faces the 
           backside pool area.

           She sees Jeffrey and Jo, seated on lounge chairs, speaking 
           intimately, seriously. It's clear they've met before. Jeffrey 
           leans in and lights another cigarette for Jo. 

                                 CONCIERGE 
                        I'm sorry. There's no answer.

                                 SUSIE 
                           (can't take her eyes off 
                           them)
                        I have his press credentials.

           EXT. TRAVEL AGENCY, KABUL - DAY

           Jeffrey stops in front of a storefront. KABUL ONE TRAVEL. He 
           looks down at the note in his hand. Scribbled: "Mr. 
           Highsmith, your ticket is waiting for you at Kabul One 
           Travel."

           Jeffrey walks in.

           SOMEONE is watching him from across the street.

           INT. TRAVEL AGENCY, KABUL - DAY

           Tiny space covered with glossy travel posters. A pretty 
           AFGHANI TRAVEL AGENT, reading a magazine, looks up. She seems 
           surprised to see someone come in. 

           Underneath her short head scarf, she wears glossy lipstick 
           and mascara. She chews bubble gum.

                                 JEFFREY
                           (speaking slowly)
                        Excuse me. I'm here to pick up my 
                        ticket to Istanbul. I understand 
                        there is a ticket waiting for me?

           The girl smiles flirtatiously at him.

                                 TRAVEL AGENT
                           (poor English)
                        Yes?  Ticket. Name?
                                 JEFFREY
                        Sherlock Holmes.

           The girl's eyes widen.

                                 TRAVEL AGENT
                        Sherlock Holmes.

           She disappears behind dark curtains. Jeffrey looks outside. 
           It's a busy shopping district and SHOPPERS and PEDESTRIANS 
           stroll along. 

           The girl comes back with a ticket book in her hand.

                                 TRAVEL AGENT
                        This.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Thank you. 

           Jeffrey puts the ticket away safely underneath his jacket. 

           EXT. TRAVEL AGENCY, KABUL - SAME

           Back on the street, Jeffrey looks in both directions before 
           choosing to turn left. 

           A pair of eyes hold on him. And starts to follow.

           Jeffrey stops in front of a bookstore. He looks like he's 
           looking at the books on display. But he's actually looking at 
           the reflection in the glass. A WOMAN IN BURKHA stands a few 
           feet behind him. Looking at him. He can't see her face.

           Jeffrey turns and enters the crowds.

           Whoever's watching him tries to keep up. But he's walking too 
           fast. His head bobs in and out of the sea of heads.

           Then he disappears... 

                                 JEFFREY (O.S.)
                        Why are you following me?

           Jeffrey stands behind a WOMAN IN BURKA. He grabs her hand, 
           and pulls aside the slit covering her eyes. It's only a 
           teenaged girl. Light skinned. She looks at him, frightened. 
           Holds up a piece of paper.

           Jeffrey takes the paper. It's his note. "Kabul One Travel."

           Several people in the crowd watch them. Suspicious. Wondering 
           what this foreigner is doing to a woman.
           Jeffrey backs away.

                                 JEFFREY
                        I'm sorry.

           The girl runs away. 

           From the middle of the crowd, Susie watches Jeffrey try to 
           collect himself. 

                                 MAJOR GENERAL THATCHER (O.S.)
                        We both know I don't need to be 
                        here.

           INT. AFHANISTAN DEFENSE MINISTRY OFFICE - DAY

           Jo and Major General Thatcher face Defense Minister ABU 
           MASSAD. A military man who only learned to wear a suit two 
           years ago. Because he chose the right side. 

                                 ABU MASSAD
                        Thank you for the consideration.

                                 MAJOR GENERAL THATCHER
                        I don't like the options but it's 
                        the only one we have right now.

           Massad nods, acknowledging Thatcher's honesty. Two military 
           guys who understand one another.

                                 ABU MASSAD
                        It should be a joint effort. Your 
                        American troops and the newly 
                        trained Afghani military.

           Jo's lips tighten. She doesn't like the sound of that. 
           Thatcher throws Jo a look. Let me handle this.

                                 MAJOR GENERAL THATCHER
                        Because of the sensitivity of our 
                        intelligence, we are not 
                        comfortable working with outside 
                        forces. We're talking about a 
                        limited special ops team.

                                 ABU MASSAD
                        Our men have proven capable in 
                        previous operations.

                                 MAJOR GENERAL THATCHER
                        We want to minimize attention to 
                        this. 
                           (beat)
                        It's not on the books.

                                 ABU MASSAD
                        I see. So you're here asking me to 
                        sign off on a mission that does not 
                        exist?

           Thatcher nods.

                                 ABU MASSAD
                        The US military has a policy of not 
                        getting involved in civilian 
                        kidnappings. Why now?

                                 MAJOR GENERAL THATCHER
                        There are special circumstances.

                                 ABU MASSAD
                        So am I to understand that this 
                        girl is special?

                                 JO
                        The deadline is a little less than 
                        72 hours away. We don't have much 
                        time.

                                 ABU MASSAD
                           (to the General)
                        The rich really are different, 
                        aren't they?

                                 JO
                           (she's had it)
                        If you don't give us permission to 
                        go in and save my daughter, and she 
                        dies, I will spend the rest of my 
                        life talking about how the 
                        Afghanistan government, 
                        specifically you, Mr. Abu Massad, 
                        are responsible for the murder of 
                        my daughter. Then I will pay 
                        someone to kill you. You will be 
                        looking over your shoulders for the 
                        rest of your life. Because you 
                        won't know when it will happen. 

           Massad leans back in his tall leather chair and fixes a tight 
           stare on Jo. Major General Thatcher shifts uncomfortably. 

           But Jo remains cool.

           Massad breaks into a half-smile.
                                 ABU MASSAD
                        Whoever says that women lack the 
                        thirst for blood has severely 
                        underestimated your sex, Ms. Licht. 

                                 JO
                        I hope so.

                                 ABU MASSAD
                        Fine. But I would like something in 
                        return. Jeffrey Highsmith. 
                           (off Jo's surprised look)
                        We've been tailing Mr. Highsmith 
                        since his arrival. We've even 
                        protected him. If people find out 
                        that he authored the story on the 
                        detainee deaths, he will be a 
                        target. He may never make it out of 
                        this country alive.

                                 JO
                        What do you want with him? He's 
                        just a reporter.

           Abu narrows his eyes. He doesn't like being played for a 
           fool.

                                 ABU MASSAD
                        We know that Mr. Highsmith is 
                        working with Aziz Ruhel. Mr. Ruhel 
                        is a high level Taliban propaganda 
                        official. We want him.

                                 JO
                           (beat)
                        Fine. I will make sure Mr. 
                        Highsmith is available to you for 
                        questioning.

           Jo stands. 

                                 ABU MASSAD
                        And the French girl? Does she have 
                        a price?

           INT. TOM'S WORLDCARE OFFICE - DAY

           Tom moves a box off a chair. Jeffrey squeezes in. 

           Things are coming to an end here. STAFF hurry to pack the 
           last of their things. 
           Tom has lost his stiff upper lip. He's just trying to keep 
           things together.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Not losing any time getting out of 
                        here, are you?

           This was not the thing to say to Tom. But Jeffrey knew that.

                                 TOM
                        You have ten minutes.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Why the French girl?

                                 TOM
                        Excuse me?

                                 JEFFREY
                        Kidnapping Kate by herself would 
                        have sufficient. She's the more 
                        valuable hostage-

                                 TOM
                        You think you can value one life 
                        over-

                                 JEFFREY
                        Let's do a reality check. Kate 
                        makes this a big story. Not Julie. 
                        So why would the kidnappers take a 
                        chance in going for two girls at 
                        once? It's messy.

                                 TOM
                        Julie was a very outspoken girl. 
                        She attracted a lot of attention. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        She was attractive.

           Tom tries to control his anger.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Which is a dangerous thing for a 
                        woman to do in Kabul.

                                 TOM
                        I tried warning her-

                                 JEFFREY
                           (pushing buttons)
                        Were you in love with her?
                                 TOM
                           (furious)
                        Where the hell do you get off- 

                                 JEFFREY
                        You take one girl who does her best 
                        to make sure no one noticed her. 
                        And put that together with someone 
                        who made sure everyone noticed. 
                        Something sound strange to you 
                        about that?

                                 TOM
                        Maybe Julie was the target and Kate 
                        the mistake.

                                 JEFFREY
                        I dont think so. It's like they're 
                        tying to make everyone forget about 
                        Julie...

                                 TOM
                           (off Jeffrey's look)
                        What?

           Jeffrey rushes out of the office.

                                 TOM
                        What the hell is going on?

           INT. JEFFREY HOTEL BEDROOM, KABUL - NIGHT

           Jeffrey presses play on the videotape. Susie watches, 
           standing. 

           ON TV: Slow motion. Footage zoomed in, difficult to see...

           Kate dragged out of the car -- pushed into the front car. 
           Another kidnapper grabs Julie. But lets her walk. Julie gets 
           in the car -- looks over at Kate. Worried. 

           Kate is now being hooded. But Julie is not.

                                 SUSIE
                        Julie. She wasn't kidnapped.

           INT. BEDROOM, COUNTRYSIDE AFGHANISTAN - NIGHT

           Kate opens her eyes. Her feet are now bandaged. 

                                 JULIE (O.S.)
                        Hello Kate.
           Julie leans over Kate. Head covered in a long scarf. She 
           looks softer. More feminine.

                                 KATE
                        Julie.

           Kate throws her arms around her. Julie rocks her gently. Kate 
           notices the headscarf. She pulls away.

                                 KATE
                        You're with them.

                                 JULIE
                        Kate, I can explain-

           Kate slaps her. Hard. 

                                 JULIE
                        We just want to send a message. 

                                 KATE
                        Then send me home now.

                                 JULIE
                        Not yet.

                                 KATE
                        You chose me.

                                 JULIE
                        Yes. I saw your file on Tom's desk. 
                        Saw your family connections. It was 
                        like a sign.

                                 KATE
                        You hate that scarf.

                                 JULIE
                        No. I needed to make sure I got 
                        noticed. Look like a target. 

                                 KATE
                        Why are you doing this?

                                 JULIE
                        The world has a funny way of 
                        listening when they see the face of 
                        a sweet white girl. I didn't make 
                        the world the way it is.

                                 KATE
                        Yes you do.
           Julie stands.

                                 JULIE
                        You should rest.

                                 KATE
                        You could have staged your own 
                        kidnapping.

                                 JULIE
                        There's a file on me. It would have 
                        looked too suspicious. 

           INT. JEFFREY'S HOTEL ROOM - SAME

           Jeffrey combs through piles of papers gathered on his bed. He 
           hands a piece of paper to Susie.

                                 JEFFREY
                        This is some of the intel on Julie 
                        Mertain. Files that go back years. 
                        Radical revolutionary activities in 
                        Paris. Here. 

           Susie looks over the papers. Sees the classified stamps on 
           the documents.

                                 SUSIE
                        How did you get these files?

                                 JEFFREY
                        A friend owed me a favor.

                                 SUSIE
                        A friend?

           Susie goes to the bed. Picks up another stack of paper. More 
           classified CIA documents. 

                                 SUSIE
                        Just faxed you classified 
                        intelligence documents?

           Susie throws the papers on the bed. She's had it.

                                 SUSIE
                        I know you're not with The World
                        anymore. They fired you.

                                 JEFFREY
                        They didn't fire me. 
                                 SUSIE
                        Why are you here Jeffrey? How do 
                        you know Jo Licht? I saw the two of 
                        you.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Kate's her daughter-

                                 SUSIE
                        How do you know her? 

                                 JEFFREY
                        She's someone I knew a long time 
                        ago.

           Susie moves towards the door. Jeffrey charges after her.

                                 JEFFREY
                        It's not like that-

                                 SUSIE
                        Please, tell me something -- 
                        anything -- I can believe. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        I watched Kate grow up. At least 
                        the first few years of her life-

           Susie opens the door... 

           Jo. She looks between Jeffrey and Susie. Senses the tense 
           moment. Susie -- face to face with the woman she can't help 
           but consider a rival. And she hates herself for that.

                                 JO
                        I didn't mean to interrupt. 

           Jo turns to leave. But sees Kate's face on the TV -- paused.

           INT. ARMY COMMAND CENTER, KABUL - DAY

           TITLE: "TWO DAYS LEFT"

           Jeffrey and Jo look up at electronic maps displayed across 
           several large screens. One screen zooms in on an area about 
           fifty miles outside of Kabul.

           First Lieutenant MARK KENTRIDGE walks up. Salutes. Thatcher 
           waves him down.
                                 KENTRIDGE
                        The team is in prep. They should be 
                        ready to deploy in thirty minutes, 
                        Sir.

           EXT. MOUNTAINS, AFGHANISTAN - DAY

           Two CHOPPERS fly in rotation over mountains. Across a still 
           blue sky. 

                                 CHOPPER SOLDIER (O.S.)
                        Coordinate set. Estimated time of 
                        arrival 0900.

           INT. ARMY COMMAND CENTER, KABUL - DAY

           Major General Thatcher point out two moving dots on a map to 
           Jeffrey and Susie. 

                                 MAJOR GENERAL THATCHER
                        Two choppers are in air scouting 
                        the location before the ground 
                        troops move in. They have 
                        instructions to hang outside of a 
                        ten mile radius so as to avoid 
                        detection.

           Lieutenant Kentridge, standing a few feet behind, wearing a 
           headpiece, speaks softly into his mic. Thatcher looks up at 
           him.

                                 KENTRIDGE
                        Grounds troops on the move, Sir.

                                 MAJOR GENERAL THATCHER
                        The deal is that both of you wait 
                        in the temporary command center 
                        with me. You're not going anywhere 
                        near that village until it's 
                        cleared. Understand?

           Kentridge looks up. Surprised. This is not protocol. The 
           general sees his reaction. 

                                 MAJOR GENERAL THATCHER
                        Yes. I'm going too.

           EXT. MILITARY BASE JUST OUTSIDE KABUL - DAY

           About THIRTY SPECIAL FORCES SOLDIERS from the 1st battalion 
           run in line towards CONVOY VEHICLES. 
           In the near distance, two more CHOPPERS take off. Blowing 
           heavy gusts. 

           The vehicles drive out in formation.

           INT/EXT. ARMORED MILITARY TRUCK - DAY

           Jo and Jeffrey strapped inside the truck. 

           The General sits in the row ahead. A large GPS screen with 
           blinking lights play on a monitor at the drivers side.

           The truck drives behind the moving Convoy vehicles ahead.

                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. ARMORED MILITARY TRUCK - DAY

           The trucks veer off-road. Kicking dust into the air.

                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. ARMORED MILITARY TRUCK - DAY

           Busy activity as the General and First Lieutenant get live 
           updates from Chopper troops. Everyone seems to be talking at 
           once. Everyone except Jo and Jeffrey.

           On the road, Jeffrey sees a FIVE YEAR OLD GIRL and her EIGHT 
           YEAR OLD SISTER sitting by the road, selling sodas underneath 
           the desert sun. Jeffrey looks around. There's no one or 
           nothing for miles. 

           Jo breathes deep.

                                 JO
                           (not looking at Jeffrey)
                        Do you remember Robert telling us 
                        about being in Afghanistan when he 
                        was a boy? 

           Jeffrey tries to nod.

                                 JO
                        Kate loved hearing those stories. 
                        She would have him tell the same 
                        stories over and over.
                           (beat)
                        We had a difficult relationship.

           Jo finally turns to Jeffrey.
                                 JO
                        And she came here to get away from 
                        me.

           INT. COMMON ROOM, COUNTRYSIDE AFGHANISTAN - DAY

           Kate sits at the table, eyes empty. She's starting to 
           disappear. Lose hope. 

           Julie watches her. Concerned.

           INT/EXT. ARMORED MILITARY TRUCK - DAY

           The truck bounces roughly along rocky roads. A village comes 
           into view. 

           The truck swerves sharply and comes to a halt. About a mile 
           outside the village.

           Some SOLDIERS have already set up an outdoor command center. 

           A MEDIC truck pulls up behind them. It's pretty impressive 
           with how they made a patch of desert become something.

           INT. COMMON ROOM, COUNTRYSIDE AFGHANISTAN - DAY

           Sounds of a car approaching. Fast.

                                 JULIE
                        Don't move.

           Julie goes to the window. From underneath her robes, she 
           pulls out a handgun.

           EXT. VILLAGE, COUNTRYSIDE AFGHANISTAN - DAY

           Convoy trucks fan the village. Special Ops. Soldiers (S.O.S) 
           pile out. Coordinate into smaller teams of three. Divide the 
           houses. 

           One team breaks down a door and move in. 

           Choppers circle above...

           INT. VILLAGE HOUSE, AFGHANISTAN - DAY

           An S.O.S keeps watch at the door while the other two comb 
           through the two room house. It's deserted.

                                 S.O.S 1
                           (into headset)
                        Secure.
           INT/EXT. ARMORED MILITARY TRUCK - DAY

           Jeffrey and Jo wait inside their truck. Watching the 
           commotion outside. 

           Jo opens the door. 

           An S.O.S blocks her way from getting outside.

                                 S.O.S 2
                           (to General)
                        Sir.

                                 JO
                        I can't sit in this car. 

           General nods.

                                 MAJOR GENERAL THATCHER
                           (to S.O.S 2)
                        Watch her.

           INT. ANOTHER VILLAGE HOUSE, AFGHANISTAN - DAY

           A team breaks down another house door. Quietly move into the 
           house with guns raised.  

           Sounds of someone SHUFFLING in the second room.

           An S.O.S inches forward, cautious. Alert. Motions to his two 
           other teammates. They flank behind him. He knocks down the 
           door.

           A large table flies at him.

           He shoots...

           EXT. ARMORED MILITARY TRUCK, AFGHANISTAN - DAY

           SHATTERING GUN FIRE.

           Everyone looks up. Jo darts toward the village. S.O.S 2 
           chases after. And tackles her down to the ground. Jeffrey 
           reaches them and helps Jo up. She's shaking.

           INT. ANOTHER HOUSE, COUNTRYSIDE AFGHANISTAN - DAY

           More S.O.S pile into the small village house. Look into the 
           second room and see A VILLAGE MAN and his WIFE dead. Riddled 
           with gunshots. 
           INT. COMMON ROOM, COUNTRYSIDE AFGHANISTAN

           Julie's face breaks out into a big smile. She puts her gun 
           back underneath her robe and runs out the door.

           Out the window, Kate sees Julie embrace Hamid. He looks at 
           her tenderly. They unload Hamid's truck of food and water.

           Julie looks up and sees Kate watching her. Julie almost looks 
           embarrassed. But happy.

           EXT. COUNTRY VILLAGE, COUNTRYSIDE AFGHANISTAN - DAY

           S.O.S soldiers finish the search of the last house. About 
           TWENTY VILLAGERS, rounded up and gathered in the center 
           square, hold on to one another. Frightened.

           The Armored Military truck drives in. The First Lieutenant 
           approaches and opens the door for the General.

           Some S.O.S drag the dead couple out of the house. The herded 
           Villagers' cry louder. 

                                 FIRST LIEUTENANT
                           (to General)
                        She's not here.

           General looks at the dead bodies. 

                                 MAJOR GENERAL THATCHER
                        Shit.

           Inside the car, Jo looks at the dead bodies. 

           EXT. FIELDS, COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

           Hamid walks quickly through the scorched fields. Holding a 
           gun. Julie and Kate try to keep up, Julie pulling Kate by the 
           hand. The rebel guard and the old black dog follow.

                                 JULIE
                        Where are we going?

           Hamid doesn't answer.

                                 JULIE
                        Hamid?

           Hamid looks back. Not at Julie, but the village. He stops, 
           satisfied.

                                 HAMID
                        This is good.
           Julie and Kate reach Hamid. The rebel guard lingers behind.

                                 JULIE
                        For what?

           Hamid looks at Kate.

                                 HAMID
                        This was once our family's 
                        vineyards. It is no longer well 
                        known, but Afghanistan was one of 
                        the leading wine-makers of the 
                        area. 

           Hamid has a strange look on his face. As if seeing something 
           that is no longer there. A memory that comes alive, even if 
           it's only for a fleeting moment.

                                 HAMID
                        My brothers and I used to help my 
                        father with the harvest. We hated 
                        it. Our fingers would be sore. But 
                        my father. He loved these fields. 

           Julie steps forward and puts a hand on Hamid's shoulder. He 
           brushes her hand off. Julie cringes. 

                                 HAMID
                        The Soviets came and took control 
                        of the vineyards. When they left, 
                        the Taliban came. And burned them 
                        all down. And like a curse, these 
                        fields remain black. 

           Hamid has a hard look on his face. He turns to Kate.

                                 HAMID
                        I saw your house on the television. 
                        Such a big house. For so few 
                        people.

           Hamid offers her the gun.

                                 HAMID
                        Here. 

           Kate looks at the gun. Isn't sure what he wants.

                                 HAMID
                        Take it.

           Kate shakes her head.
                                 HAMID
                        Take it!

           Kate takes the gun. Her hands shaking. She's never held a gun 
           before.

                                 HAMID
                        It's heavier than you thought.

           Kate nods.

                                 HAMID
                           (pointing to the dog)
                        Shoot him.

                                 JULIE
                        Hamid!

                                 HAMID
                        Kate, shoot the dog. 

                                 KATE
                           (frightened)
                        Why?

                                 HAMID 
                        You think it's easy to shoot 
                        someone? Even a dog? You think that 
                        the gun makes the man a murderer? 

           Hamid steps closer to Kate. She steps back, but finds the 
           rebel guard suddenly behind her. 

                                 HAMID
                        You think what we do is easy?

                                 JULIE
                           (worried)
                        Please, Hamid. Stop.

                                 HAMID
                        Shoot!

           He takes another step closer. He's now directly beside her. 

                                 HAMID
                           (loudly, into Kate's ears)
                        Shoot!

           Kate looks at Julie. Who shakes her head. She doesn't know 
           what to do.
                                 HAMID
                        Don't look at her. She can't help 
                        you. I said shoot!

           Kate raises the gun. She doesn't know what to do.

                                 KATE
                        I don't know-

                                 HAMID
                        Shoot!

           Kate shoots. BANG! The power of the release throws her back, 
           and she drops the gun. She missed hitting the dog. Who 
           cowers, whimpers.

           Kate, crying, turns to Julie. Who looks at Hamid with fear. 
           No longer knowing who this man is.

           Hamid picks the gun up.

                                 HAMID
                           (gently)
                        Thank you.

           Hamid bends over and pets the dog affectionately. The dog 
           follows him back to the village.

           INT. JO'S HOTEL BEDROOM, KABUL - NIGHT

           Jo curled up on her hotel bed. She watches the digital clock.

           INT. SUSIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Jeffrey knocks on the door.  His clothes covered from the 
           day's dirt.

           Susie opens the door. She is surprised to see him. And not 
           that sure she wants to see him.

           INT. BEDROOM, COUNTRYSIDE, AFGHANISTAN - NIGHT

           Kate sits by the door. Her ears pressed to the door. Voices 
           from the next room.

           Julie and Hamid arguing.

                                 JULIE (O.S.)
                        That's not what we planned-

           Hamid WHISPERS something back to her.
                                 JULIE (O.S.)
                        You're not a murderer.

                                 HAMID
                        Maybe it's time I became one. Two 
                        innocent people. Dead. For that 
                        girl in there? I'm not the one who 
                        weighed her life against theirs. 

                                 JULIE
                           (heart breaking)
                        I believe in you.

                                 HAMID
                        I never asked you to do that.

           Kate pulls away from the door.

           INT. SUSIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Susie hands Jeffrey a drink. He takes a gulp and gags. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        What is that?

                                 SUSIE
                        Local whiskey.

           Jeffrey shudders, but finishes it in one swallow. Susie hands 
           him the bottle. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        I'm leaving in the morning.

                                 SUSIE
                        What about Kate?

                                 JEFFREY
                           (a little too steady)
                        She's going to die. 

                                 SUSIE
                        Don't say that.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Susie-

                                 SUSIE
                        Call Aziz. See what went wrong. 
                        Maybe he can get you another 
                        location-
                                 JEFFREY
                        The kidnappers know that we had 
                        information. They're going to go 
                        completely off grid. Do you 
                        understand?

                                 SUSIE
                        They can't disappear-

                                 JEFFREY
                        These people can! 

                                 SUSIE
                        I want to stop being angry at you. 
                        I want to stop caring about you.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Susie-

                                 SUSIE
                        Please let me finish.  You have to 
                        look back sometimes. You have to 
                        see how one point in your life 
                        connects to another point. 
                           (frustrated)
                        I don't know what I'm saying.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Yes, you do.

                                 SUSIE
                        I understand she's going to die. 
                        But I'm asking you to see this 
                        through. That girl deserves more 
                        than your words.

           INT. COMMON ROOM, COUNTRYSIDE AFGHANISTAN - SAME

           Hamid at the table with a basket of apples and a bowl of 
           sliced apples. The black dog, his loyal friend, sleeps on the 
           floor.

           Kate walks out of her room. Julie is not there. 

                                 KATE
                        Where is she?

                                 HAMID
                        We sent her back to her hiding 
                        place. 

           Hamid holds a paring knife. He peels an entire apple in one 
           elegant spiral. 
                                 HAMID
                        Your mother is a determined woman.

           Hamid pulls out a newspaper. On the front page, a large photo 
           of Jo. Screaming at Jeffrey. 

           Kate tries to control herself.

                                 HAMID
                        Do you see yourself in your mother? 
                        Or are you more like your father?

                                 KATE
                        I'm not sure. I don't think I'm 
                        like either of them.

                                 HAMID
                        Were you close with your father?

           Kate nods.

                                 HAMID
                        It hurts. Knowing that the only 
                        thing left of him is you.

           Kate doesn't respond.

                                 HAMID
                        I am baking an apple pie. You like 
                        apple pie?
                           (beat)
                        I had an apple pie for the first 
                        time in London. I wish I could find 
                        a word that could describe that 
                        moment. It was like nothing I have 
                        tasted before.

           Kate watches him peel another apple, mesmerized.

                                 HAMID
                        My first pie came out a disaster. I 
                        didn't trust the sweetness of the 
                        apple and used too much sugar. And 
                        so I learned.

           He gives Kate another slice.

                                 HAMID
                        For my second pie I did not use 
                        enough butter for the crust so it 
                        fell apart. And so I learned. My 
                        third pie was perfect.
                                 KATE
                        Are you going to kill me?

           Hamid stops peeling but does not look at Kate. He looks like 
           he's about to say something, but changes his mind. He 
           continues peeling.

                                 HAMID
                        Have you ever made an apple pie?

           Kate shakes her head limply.

                                 HAMID
                        Really? Never? 

                                 KATE
                        No. We just buy our pies.

                                 HAMID 
                        You want to know why you're here? 
                        Why I am doing this?
                           (beat)
                        I would like every family to be 
                        able to pay thanks to Allah without 
                        a gun in their hand. I would like 
                        to pay tribute to my brother's 
                        life. He was a brave man. And he 
                        was murdered by your soldiers in 
                        the detainee camp. 
                           (beat)
                        And I would like for the daughter I 
                        hope to have to have a chance to be 
                        like you. 

           Hamid offers Kate a slice of an apple. 

           FIRE ALARM SIRENS... 

           INT/EXT. HOTEL STREET - DAY

           ... WAIL.

           TITLE: ONE DAY LEFT

           CROWDS charging in one direction across a wide street. 
           INTERNATIONAL GUARDS and AFGHANI POLICE try to maintain 
           order. People abandon their cars on the road and move on 
           foot. They are afraid of something.

           Jeffrey, carrying his suitcase, sees the crowds. On instinct, 
           he drops the suitcase. Runs toward the center. 
                                 SUSIE (O.S.)
                        Jeffrey!

           Susie motions from across the street. 

           Jeffrey maneuvers through the crowds. Finally reaches her.

                        JEFFREY
                                                     SUSIE
           What's happening?
                                          You stayed.

           For a moment, they forget what's around them...

           But the sirens BLARE forces them back to reality.

                                 SUSIE
                        An unmarked car drove up to the 
                        plaza and dropped a package. Bomb 
                        squad just arrived.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Is there no way to get access?

                                 SUSIE
                        I have a plan.

           INT. APARTMENT DOORWAY - LATER

           Jeffrey reaches the last step of the landing.

           Susie at an apartment doorway, whispering to a YOUNG MOTHER 
           who holds a wailing BABY. THREE OTHER CHILDREN stand at her 
           side, watching Susie with awe. 

           The mother looks at Jeffrey, shakes her head. Susie pulls out 
           money. It's more money than the mother sees in a year. The 
           mother agrees, reluctant.

           She opens the door.

           INT. YOUNG MOTHER'S APARTMENT - SAME

           Susie and Jeffrey walk into the one room apartment. A 
           makeshift kitchen to one side, one large bed, and a line of 
           laundry cuts through the middle of the room. 

           The mother tries to calm the baby.

           Susie goes to the open window.

                                 SUSIE
                        I hope you're not afraid of 
                        heights.
           She climbs onto the edge of the window. Jeffrey holds on to 
           her hips as she finds a grip. Susie uses the top ledge as 
           support and pulls herself up. Her feet disappear.

                                 SUSIE (O.S.)
                        I have a view.

           Jeffrey looks down. Five floors down. Just enough to make a 
           fall look messy.

                                 SUSIE (O.S.)
                        If you get on the ledge, I can 
                        reach your hands.

           Jeffrey steps out.

           EXT. WINDOW LEDGE - SAME

           Jeffrey, hands gripping the window sides, wills himself not 
           to look down. 

           Susie's face peers out from the top, her hand extended.

           EXT. ROOF - SAME

           Susie finishes pulling Jeffrey up to the roof. Jeffrey stands 
           and looks out at rows and rows of rooftops. 

           Susie looks through binoculars. She can see into the plaza 
           square, about two hundred feet away. In the plaza, military 
           trucks and INTERNATIONAL FORCE SOLDIERS in battalion-gear 
           crowd the center.

           Susie hands the binoculars to Jeffrey. 

                                 SUSIE
                        I can't look.

           Jeffrey raises the binocular. Soldiers stand over something. 
           Jeffrey zooms in. Someone moves out of the way...

           A large rolled-up rug. A soldier bends down, begins to unroll 
           the rug. Careful. 

           Jeffrey zooms in. Because the zoom is so close, it's 
           difficult to keep the object centered. Another Soldier walks 
           into frame, blocking Jeffrey's view.

                                 SUSIE
                        What's happening?

                                 JEFFREY
                        I don't know.
           Jeffrey zooms out.

           The soldiers stand and call out to someone. A group huddles, 
           discusses something. 

           Jeffrey's hands shake slightly. He has to steady himself to 
           keep the image centered. 

           Something's happening. A commotion. Soldiers start fanning 
           out, motioning for the trucks to come over. 

           Jeffrey zooms in...

           A HAND. Covered in dried blood. A truck moves in, obstructing 
           his view completely.

           INT. JO'S HOTEL ROOM,  KABUL - EVENING

           Jo looks down...

           At photos. But we can't tell who it is.

                                 JO (O.S.)
                        Jeffrey. Can you come to my room. I 
                        need to talk to you.

           INT. HOTEL ELEVATOR, KABUL - EVENING

           Jeffrey in the elevator. He looks tired. 

           The elevator stops on floor three. Two men enter - AN AFGHANI 
           MAN IN SUIT and a COLONEL. 

           Jeffrey nods a greeting. 

           The men push a button for floor six. A button for floor seven 
           is already lit - Jo's floor. The elevator passes floor 
           four...

           Then five...

           Floor six...

           The doors open. 

                                 COLONEL
                        Mr. Highsmith. You will follow us.

           INT. FLOOR SIX HOTEL ROOM - LATER DAY

           Jeffrey sits across from Abu Massad. The Colonel and the Man 
           in the Suit stand a few feet away. 
                                 ABU MASSAD
                        Your information was not correct.
                        Any guess as to what happened?

                                 JEFFREY
                        My source was wrong.

                                 ABU MASSAD
                        You mean Aziz Ruhel.

           Jeffrey doesn't answer.

                                 ABU MASSAD
                        You choose to protect him?

                                 JEFFREY
                        I don't know what you're talking 
                        about.

                                 ABU MASSAD
                        Even after he betrayed you. 
                           (off Jeffrey's reaction)
                        Ah. You don't like thinking that. 
                        Not your star pupil. You've had 
                        quite a few betrayals lately. Maybe 
                        you should question your instincts. 

           Abu motions to the Colonel. The Colonel picks up a file off 
           the desk and takes out three photographs. Lays them on the 
           table -- Aziz, Hamid, Yusif.

                                 ABU MASSAD
                        Do you recognize these men?

           Jeffrey looks at Yusif's picture -- smiling for the camera. 
           He's almost unrecognizable from the photos that covered the 
           magazine.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Two of them.

                                 ABU MASSAD
                        Yes. You know Aziz. Yusif Agha. 
                        And this is Hamid Hadid. 
                           (beat)
                        The brothers.

           Jeffrey pales. 

                                 ABU MASSAD
                        Ah, you didn't know? People change 
                        their names. Believe they're going 
                        to become a new person. 
                        But they can't really escape who 
                        they really are.

                                 JEFFREY
                        I thought I knew him. 

                                 ABU MASSAD
                        Because he aired his dirty secrets 
                        to you? Told you he was Taliban and 
                        a drug trafficker? He is. But then 
                        he saw his brother's face on the 
                        cover of your magazine. And plotted 
                        revenge. Or maybe he just wanted 
                        the money. Who can tell with these 
                        animals.

                                 JEFFREY
                           (sickened)
                        He knew I would bite.

                                 ABU MASSAD
                        It pays to know the weakness of 
                        others.

                                 JEFFREY
                        A.C said Yusif talked about his 
                        family. 
                           (remembering)
                        And his village. Godah.

           Abu Massad looks over at his men. 

                                 ABU MASSAD
                        Godah.

           INT. BROTHEL - NIGHT

           Jeffrey stands in the dark room. Afghani SECURITY MEN carry 
           flashlights.

           The room is now empty with the exception of empty beer 
           bottles on the floor. A heavy haze of smoke cloud the air. 
           They left recently.

           Jeffrey walks to the back room. The Colonel watches him.

           INT. BROTHEL BACK ROOM - NIGHT

           Also empty. But the table is still there. And if you look 
           closely, you see dried resin from the buds. The wasted drips 
           that did not make it into the vials.
           INT. BEDROOM, COUNTRYSIDE, AFGHANISTAN - MORNING

           Kate sleeping.

           The door opens loudly. Kate jumps up. Her reaction quick. 
           She's learned to sleep with one eye open. Always alert.

           Aziz looks at her with very little emotion.

                                 AZIZ
                        Get up. 

           In the doorway, the Old Woman watches her. Frightened. Hamid 
           comes up behind her and gently pulls her away.

                                                  FADE TO BLACK:

           EXT. DESERT COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

           TITLE: "No days left"

           The scorched fields.

           A light wind shifts. The cackle of BARE FEET against loose 
           rocks. Bandaged. Bleeding.

           Kate focuses her eyes toward the sun and does not blink. 

           A Gloved Hand pushes her forward. Roughly. Kate walks 
           forward, but feels the energy drain from her body, and 
           falls...

           A Shadow falls over her. But Kate does not look up. Wills 
           herself not to look at that face.

           Aziz leans over her, pulls her up roughly. 

                                 AZIZ
                        Kneel.

           Kate kneels. Aziz takes out a video camera from underneath 
           his long shirt. Turns it on and aims it at Kate. The two 
           guards don matching hoods, and stand behind Kate.

           Kate looks past them. At Hamid. Who stands off to side. He 
           can't look at her. 

           Aziz pulls the dupatta down over her face. Kate starts 
           screaming. 

           The hooded rebel guards raise their guns and point it at her.

           Aziz presses record.
                                 AZIZ
                           (in Pashtun)
                        Ready.

                                 REBEL GUARD 1
                           (standing behind Kate, in 
                           Pashtun)
                        The deadline has passed and we have 
                        seen no action. You do not take our 
                        warnings seriously. You take us for 
                        fools. But do not make that 
                        mistake. We are very serious in our 
                        threats.

           The rebel guard continues speaking, but this is not 
           subtitled. His voice breaks into a loud, angry prayer.

           Kate shivers. The wait is agony.

           Then the guard stops speaking. And there's a long pause...

           Hamid steps forward.

                                 HAMID
                        That's enough.

           He steps to Kate, and lifts her dupatta. She looks at him, 
           confused. 

           Aziz, joking with his rebel guards, walk back towards the 
           village.

                                 NEWS ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        The footage came through the wires 
                        early this evening. 

           INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Empty restaurant, closed for the night. The CLEANING CREW try 
           their best to ignore...

           Jo. A plate of food hours cold in front of her. Her real 
           companions are a bottle of wine and an ashtray. 

           A portable television plays American news.

           ON TV: Kate kneeling. Imprisoned by mountains. Flanked by the 
           two Guards with guns pointed. It's the image that will sell 
           magazines and newspapers.
                                 NEWS ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        This comes on the heel of the 
                        murder of Frenchwoman Julie 
                        Mertain.

           Jo looks out the window out at a garden oasis. So green it 
           hurts your eyes. 

                                 NEWS ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        The kidnappers have extended the 
                        deadline for 24 hours. They promise 
                        that this is the last extension.

           Jo lights another cigarette.

                                 JEFFREY (O.S.)
                        Can I join you?

           Jeffrey pulls a seat at the table. They sit in silence for a 
           moment. Smoke from Jo's cigarette floating. Dissipating in 
           the space between them.

                                 JO
                        Could you please turn that off?

           Jeffrey pushes the off button on the TV. Jo pushes her dinner 
           plate away.

                                 JO
                        Any news on Godah?

                                 JEFFREY
                        No. Either A.C Lied or he heard 
                        wrong. But there is no Godah.

                                 JO
                        Where does that leave us?

                                 JEFFREY
                        It leaves us nowhere, Jo. 

                                 JO
                        So I'm waiting for my daughter to 
                        come home in a body bag?

           There is nothing for Jeffrey to say.

                                 JO
                           (softening)
                        Robert wanted more children. But I 
                        wanted to go back to work. Have my 
                        own career. 
                        And then he got a job in Berlin, 
                        and it was too good of an 
                        opportunity to turn down. Funny how 
                        they're always too good to turn 
                        down.

                                 JEFFREY
                        He appreciated it, Jo.

                                 JO
                        Yes, I know. But Kate... she never 
                        felt like I wanted her.
                           (voice cracking)
                        But that's not true. I was just so 
                        mad at myself. Angry at what I had 
                        let myself become. Feeling like 
                        time was always against me. 

           Jo's eyes fill with tears. Jo presses her eyes closed. And 
           lets the tears roll down.

           Jeffrey waits. Lets her have this moment. She needs it.

           The moment passes, and Jo opens her eyes. 

                                 JO
                        Thank you.

                                 JEFFREY
                        For what?

                                 JO
                        For not comforting me.

           Jeffrey looks like he's about to cry. So he looks away. 

                                 JO
                        You and I sitting here... After all 
                        these years. These past few days, 
                        I've wondered how my life would 
                        have turned out if I stayed with 
                        you just as much as I've thought 
                        about my daughter. Doesn't that 
                        sound awful?

           Jeffrey shakes his head sympathetically.

                                 JO
                        Who was the woman in your room?

                                 JEFFREY
                        Someone I used to care for. Perhaps 
                        still do.
                                 JO
                        You two look good together. 

           Jeffrey almost smiles. He's thought the same thing.

                                 JO
                        You would have liked her.

                                 JEFFREY
                        I know. 

           INT. BEDROOM, COUNTRYSIDE AFGHANISTAN - DAY

           Kate looks up and sees Hamid at the door. She turns back and 
           stares out the window. 

           Hamid enters the room, carrying a glass of water. He sits 
           down next to her, sets down the water on the floor. He looks 
           out the barred window. It looks out at a mud wall.

                                 HAMID
                        I apologize that the view is 
                        lacking.

                                 KATE
                        No, it isn't. 
                           (beat)
                        I see my mother's roses. And the 
                        swing set my dad built for me. 
                        Every year she talks about taking 
                        it down. But she doesn't. 

                                 HAMID
                        I wish I could see that place.

           Kate doesn't answer him. 

                                 HAMID
                           (soft)
                        Julie is dead. My brother thought 
                        she had become a liability.

           Kate sucks in her breath. She didn't expect it to hurt so 
           much. Even though she knew.

                                 KATE
                        No matter how softly you speak. Or 
                        how clean your shirt. It doesn't 
                        hide what you are. I know you 
                        killed Julie. You may not have 
                        pulled the trigger. But you killed 
                        her. Because she loved you.
                                 HAMID
                           (voice breaks)
                        Yes.

                                 KATE
                        You're a coward.

           Kate's stare bears into him. With such strong hatred. 
           Contempt. 

           Hamid realizes this girl has changed very much in his 
           presence. From that uncertain, meek girl to this. 

                                 HAMID
                        Perhaps. But if I gave you the 
                        choice. You or her. What would you 
                        choose?

           Kate does not answer. The answer is obvious.

                                 HAMID
                        I hope in the next life, we meet 
                        again. So we can start over.

                                 KATE
                        I hope in the next life I make you 
                        suffer.

           Hamid accepts this. He puts the glass on the floor. Takes out 
           a vial from his pocket. Kate watches him.

           Hamid opens the vial and mixes the solution in with the 
           water. Hamid picks up the glass, and offers it to Kate.

                                 HAMID
                        Well. To the next life.

           Kate takes the glass.

                                 HAMID
                        It is better this way.

           INT. JEFFREY HOTEL BATHROOM, KABUL - DAY

           Jeffrey lays awake, holding a sleeping Susie. They both have 
           their clothes on. He watches her chest cave in and out with 
           small breaths. He watches her goodness.

           The phone rings. Jeffrey, without letting go of Susie, picks 
           it up.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Hello?
                                 AZIZ (O.S.)
                        Hello my friend.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Aziz.

           There is a long silence on both sides.

                                 AZIZ (O.S.)
                           (finally)
                        I have a question that I would very 
                        much like an answer to, professor. 
                        Three boys. They start in this 
                        world from the same place. But time 
                        takes its course. One kills for 
                        politics. Another for money. And 
                        the third for vengeance. Tell me, 
                        professor, would you say we were 
                        more similar or different?

                                 JEFFREY
                        Murderers are murderers.

                                 AZIZ (O.S.)
                        Yes. And thus death is death.
                           (beat)
                        I fear this is the last time we 
                        will ever speak.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Aziz...

                                 AZIZ
                        I played a cruel trick on you. That 
                        car chase. Just wanted to scare 
                        you.

                                 JEFFREY
                        It worked.

                                 AZIZ (O.S.)
                        In college I read Shakespeare for 
                        the first time. And it was very 
                        difficult for me to understand. I 
                        did not like the coincidences. But 
                        now... Now I understand. You are in 
                        my country. And we are talking on 
                        the phone. But where is our modern 
                        Shakespeare who can put poetry to 
                        the chaos of our times? I had hoped 
                        you could be that person, 
                        Professor.
                                 JEFFREY
                           (it's hard for him to 
                           speak)
                        I'm sorry I disappointed you.

                                 AZIZ (O.S.)
                        Not at all, my friend. In my 
                        culture, we say goodbye with salaam 
                        aleikum, mandana bashi. Peace be 
                        with you.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Salaam aleikum, mandana bashi.

           CLICK. The phone goes dead. 

           Susie opens her eyes. Smiles at Jeffrey.

                                 SUSIE
                        Who was that?

           A LOUD KNOCK at the door. 

           INT. HOTEL LOBBY, KABUL - DAY

           Jeffrey and Susie charge across the deserted lobby.

           EXT. HOTEL, KABUL - DAY

           SOLDIERS and MILITARY VEHICLES crowd the hotel driveway. 

           Jo and Thatcher are listening to a SOLDIER explain something. 
           They look over at...

           A WHITE VAN. Parked across the hotel. Windows blacked out. 
           More soldiers keep people away at a twenty feet radius. 

           Jeffrey walks Susie over to Jo. Jo looks up, and tries to 
           smile. But her face is cracked in sorrow.

                                 THATCHER
                        Are you sure you don't want to wait 
                        inside?

           Jo shakes her head. 

           The BOMB SQUAD. Fan around the van.  

           The crowds watch with tense faces. They just went through 
           this with a rolled up rug. How much more can they take?

           A detonation EXPERT waves a detector around the van. It's 
           difficult to see through the crowds. 
           But it looks like he's pointing at something in the back of 
           the van. A line of soldiers flank his side, weapons raised. 

           The detonation Expert feels for the door. It's unlocked. He 
           turns it slowly.

                                 EXPERT
                        We have a body!

           Jo moves forward, but she's stopped by Thatcher.

           The Expert disappears into the van... He's in there for 
           awhile. 

           Jeffrey puts his arms around Jo. She's shaking. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        Jo. Go inside-

           Jo looks up at him. Her face just begging for more time. 

           Soldiers scurry around the van. The crowd cranes their neck 
           to see.

           The Expert crawls out. Carrying a body. A limp body.

           Jo gasps. And starts sobbing uncontrollably. She pounds 
           Jeffrey's chest. Wanting to make someone hurt as much as she 
           does.

           The Expert charges through the crowds. 

           Jo pulls away and goes to him. To her daughter. The expert 
           pauses briefly at Jo. Shows her Kate.

                                 EXPERT
                        She's alive.

           Jo almost stops breathing. And runs into the hotel with the 
           expert.

           Susie wipes the tears in her eyes. Jeffrey takes her in his 
           arms. 

           He looks up and see Abu Massad walking towards them. 

                                 ABU MASSAD
                        So there's a happy ending.

           Jeffrey nods.

                                 ABU MASSAD
                        We found Godah. It was renamed by 
                        the Soviets.
           EXT. COUNTRYSIDE: GODAH - DAY

           Afghan SOLDIERS search the village where Kate was once held. 

           The soldiers herd the remaining residents outside. They don't 
           put up any fight.

           The Colonel gets out of his truck. Followed by Jeffrey.

           INT. COMMON ROOM, COUNTRYSIDE AFGHANISTAN - DAY

           Jeffrey enters the common room. On the table: a freshly baked 
           apple pie. One piece missing. 

           The Colonel charges out of the bedroom, shaking his head. It 
           was optimistic to think they would still be here.

           Door KNOCK...

           INT. JO'S HOTEL BEDROOM, KABUL - DAY

           Jo opens the door. Jeffrey and Susie walk in. Kate, sitting 
           on the bed, still a little pale but smiling. 

                                 JO
                        Kate, this is Jeffrey and Susie.

           Kate stands, and offers her hand. Susie shakes it, tears in 
           her eyes. 

           Jeffrey looks at Kate for a long moment. He really is at a  
           loss for words. She's standing in front of him. A face he's 
           only seen on television screens and in pictures. Now in the 
           flesh. She looks beautiful

                                 KATE
                        My mother's told me everything you 
                        have done for me. Both of you. 
                        Thank you.

           Susie takes something out of her pocket. A post-it note. She 
           hands it to Kate. Kate smiles with recognition.

                                 KATE
                        It feels like a millions years have 
                        passed since I wrote this.

                                 JO
                           (to Jeffrey)
                        It looks like time is on our side 
                        again.

           Kate looks at her mom and nods.
                                 KATE
                        I almost forgot. I was asked to 
                        give you something.

           Kate goes over to a desk and picks up a piece of paper. She 
           hands it to Jeffrey.

           It's a photograph. Taken a long time ago. Faded. Of Aziz, 
           Hamid and Yusif. Standing in their father's vineyard. Hands 
           stained. Smiling.

           Sound of CHOPPERS flying overhead...

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

           A truck flies across a barely there road. Buried in a cloud 
           of dust.

           INT. SUV - DAY

           Aziz sits in the passenger side. Next to his two insurgent 
           rebels.

           He hears a DRONING sound from above. Sticks his head out and 
           sees...

           CHOPPERS circling above. Aziz orders the driver to stop.

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

           Aziz and the insurgents get out, guns strapped to their side. 
           They spread out into the vast countryside.

           The choppers let out a RING OF SHOTS. One of the insurgents 
           is taken down quickly. 

           Aziz takes cover against a rock. 

           Three more choppers circle above.

           In the haze of the horizon, a Convoy of military trucks 
           approach. 

           Aziz knows he's cornered. He whispers a prayer, bends down 
           and touches his nose to the ground. Then he sits up and opens 
           his eyes. He looks around him. At the mountain. The 
           landscape. He is home. 

           Aziz grabs his gun... 

           Charges out into the open space, shooting at the choppers 
           above.
           Bullets rain down on him. But he keeps shooting. 

           INT. HIDEAWAY - DAY

           Another village house. Somewhere else. 

           Hamid sits by himself at a table facing a television. And a 
           piece of apple pie.

           ON TV: Footage of Kate being rushed inside the hotel. Jo at 
           her side, holding Kate's hand. 

                                 NEWS ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        And this just in. Aziz Ruhel, 
                        former Taliban propaganda official, 
                        implicated in the kidnapping of 
                        Katherine Licht, was killed in a 
                        shoot out with Afghan and joint 
                        coalition troops. 

           Hamid drops his head. A SOB from behind...

           The Old Woman, watching her son die on TV.

           EXT. HOTEL ENTRANCE - DAY

           A TAXI DRIVER loads Jeffrey's bag in the trunk.

           Jeffrey stands facing Susie. 

                                 JEFFREY
                        You sure you don't you want to come 
                        back?

                                 SUSIE
                        It's tempting. But... You were 
                        wrong. I don't miss being a 
                        reporter.

                                 JEFFREY
                        I don't think I do either. 

                                 SUSIE
                        Why do I find that hard to believe?

                                 JEFFREY
                        Who knows? I might like teaching 
                        better. Might do some good this 
                        time around.

                                 SUSIE
                        I know you will. 
           Jeffrey leans in, and kisses her. 

           EXT. STREETS, KABUL

           Jeffrey looks at the passing city from his moving taxi...

           MUSIC: the Aria. Plays over MONTAGE:

           INT. GUESTHOUSE BEDROOM - FLASHBACK

           A long lock of hair falls to the ground. The lovely, ringing 
           sound of clippers. Snip. Snip... 

           A soft pile of hair gathers.

           And laughter. Two girls. 

                                 KATE (O.S.)
                        It's so short!

           Kabul's call to prayer...

           INT. BLUE MOSQUE - DAY

           Crowded with male AFGHANI worshippers. Offering their prayers 
           to Allah...

                                 JEFFREY (O.S.)
                        Why do you think he really let you 
                        go?

           INT. APARTMENT - DAY

           A MOTHER leans down with her FOUR CHILDREN. Head touching the 
           floors. Offering their prayers...

                                 KATE (O.S.)
                        As I was falling asleep, he told me 
                        he had hoped vengeance would taste 
                        sweet. 

           INT. BACK ROOM, STORE FRONT - DAY

           A weathered CLERK kneels. Offering his prayer...

                                 KATE (O.S.)
                        But he found it tasted too bitter. 
                        And he didn't want that taste in 
                        his mouth for the rest of his life. 
           INT. DIRT ROAD - DAY

           KIDS of all ages chasing around a soccer ball. On a dirt 
           field looking out at war torn buildings. Playing like all 
           kids play.

                                 KATE (O.S.)
                        He wouldn't be able to enjoy his 
                        apple pies.

                                                  FADE OUT...
