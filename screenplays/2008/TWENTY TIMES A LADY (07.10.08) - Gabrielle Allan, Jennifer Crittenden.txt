           INT. ALLY’S APARTMENT -- BEDROOM -- MORNING

           ALLY DARLING, (32) offbeat and adorable, wakes up next to her 
           boyfriend, RICK (35).  After making sure he’s still asleep, 
           she carefully slips out of bed and tiptoes to the bathroom.  

           INT. ALLY’S APARTMENT -- BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Ally combs the sex tangle out of her hair, puts on a little  
           makeup and adjusts her boobs.  She checks herself out in the 
           mirror and, satisfied with her just-woken-up-look, tiptoes 
           back to the bedroom.  

           INT. ALLY’S APARTMENT -- BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Ally slips back into bed and “wakes up” with Rick.  He smiles 
           at her, sleepily. 

                                 RICK
                        How come you always look so great 
                        in the morning? 

                                 ALLY
                        Just lucky I guess. 

           He jumps out of bed and disappears into the bathroom.  

           INT. ALLY’S APARTMENT -- KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM -- MINUTES LATER

           Ally cooks breakfast in her funky yet stylish East Village 
           apartment.  Rick enters, wearing a “Save The Fucking Earth” T-
           shirt and wearing a bicycle helmet.  

                                 RICK
                        I’m gonna--

                                 ALLY
                        I made tempeh sausage.  

           He surveys the perfectly set table and realizes he’d better 
           sit.  He takes of his helmet as Ally places breakfast in 
           front him and joins him.

                                 ALLY (CONT’D)
                        Hey so, I was thinking that maybe 
                        you’d like to be my date to my 
                        sister’s wedding.  There’s a 
                        vegetarian alternative, I already 
                        checked.

                                 RICK
                        Wow, meeting your parents, huh?  
                        That feels a little serious... 

                                 ALLY
                        Oh.  I’m sorry.  You just seemed 
                        serious last night when you were 
                        doing me from behind, but I 
                        couldn’t see your face, so...

           INT. ALLY’S APARTMENT -- DOORWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

           Ally shows Rick to the door.  

                                 ALLY
                        Take care, Rick.

                                 RICK
                        See you around, Ally.  Keep it 
                        green. 
                                 (then)
                        You know, you can call me if you’re 
                        ever in the mood to just--

                                 ALLY
                        Goodbye, Rick.

           Rick leaves.  She’s about to close the door behind him when 
           the door across the hall opens.  COLIN SHEA, (34), Ally’s 
           really handsome and slightly scruffy neighbor, steps out of 
           his apartment to grab his newspaper.  He’s naked except for 
           the dish towel he holds in front of his penis.  He catches 
           Ally watching him and gives her a wink.  Embarrassed, she 
           smiles and closes her door.

           EXT. DARLING FAMILY FANCY LONG ISLAND HOME -- FOYER -- LATER

           DAISY DARLING, (29) a classic beauty, talks on the phone 
           while directing a guy wheeling in rented tables and chairs.  

                                 DAISY 
                        I could have told you it wasn’t 
                        going to work out with that guy two 
                        months ago.

                                                                 INTERCUT WITH:

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET -- DAY

           Ally, late for work, runs, while talking on the phone and 
           wolfing down a hot dog.

                                                                  7-10-08    3.

                                 ALLY
                        Why? 

                                 DAISY
                        You love meat, you hate cyclists--

                                 ALLY
                        I do love meat--  

                                 DAISY
                        And to be honest, I was a little 
                        worried about the way he always 
                        wanted to do it... 
                                 (whispering)
                        doggie style.  

                                 ALLY
                        I’m sorry I told you about that. 

                                 DAISY 
                        Not as sorry as I am.  

                                 ALLY
                        Some people like that, you know. 

                                 DAISY
                        Nobody likes it.  Even the dogs are 
                        just waiting for it to be over.

                                 ALLY
                        I was going to bring him to your 
                        wedding.  No offense, but I can’t 
                        go through that alone. 

                                 DAISY 
                        You’ll meet somebody else.  You 
                        never have a problem meeting guys.  

                                 ALLY
                        Yeah, but why can’t I meet the 
                        right guy?  This is my third break 
                        up in six months.  How many 
                        assholes do I have to date? 

                                 DAISY 
                        What about dating someone who’s not 
                        an asshole? 

                                 ALLY
                        I’m sorry, you’re breaking up.  
                        Reception is terrible on your high 
                        horse.

                                 DAISY
                        Don’t be late to my engagement 
                        party. 

           INT. OFFICE / LOFT -- BULLPEN -- LATER

           Ally arrives at work to find a bunch of co-workers watching 
           Roger (38) their handsome and mildly charming boss, talk to a 
           woman, CORRINE, in his glass walled office.  Roger is in his 
           trade mark “thinking” pose which also looks a lot like he’s 
           smelling his fingers. 

                                 GENE WU
                        So, right now.  Thinking or 
                        smelling? 

                                 BRAD
                        No doubt.  Smelling.  

                                 MELISSA
                        He’s not smelling his fingers.  
                        He’s in a meeting with his boss and 
                        whatever she’s saying is thought 
                        provoking. 

                                 ALLY
                        That would be true if she were 
                        talking about what his fingers 
                        smelled like.  

           Corrine exits.  Gene Wu, Brad and Melissa quickly disperse.  
           Roger pokes his head out of his office. 

                                 ROGER
                        Ally? 

           INT. ROGER’S OFFICE

           Roger gestures for Ally to sit down as he takes a call.  She 
           sets down her bag, turns off her cell phone and takes off 
           layer after layer of winter clothes before sitting down.   

           Roger hangs up. 

                                 ROGER
                        Sweetheart, you’re fired. 

                                 ALLY
                        I could have kept my coat on for 
                        that.  
                     "20 Times"

                                 ROGER
                        As you know, we didn’t have a great 
                        year.  And as a result, we have to 
                        make some major cuts.  That’s why 
                        Corrine came down here. 

                                 ALLY
                        Oh.  So, who else is getting fired?

                                 ROGER
                        No one, just you.  And we’re going 
                        back to toxic cleaning supplies.  

           INT. SUBWAY -- LATER

           Ally sits with her cardboard box of office possessions in her 
           lap.  She takes out a potted plant and offers it to the 
           possibly homeless woman next to her.  

                                 ALLY
                        Do you want this plant?  

           The woman takes it.  Ally takes out her moleskine notebook 
           and opens it to a page where she’s written, “THOUGHTS:”  The 
           page is empty.  She turns to the next page where she’s 
           written, “GOALS:”  It’s also empty. 

           She turns to another page and, with enthusiasm, writes a new 
           heading, “JOB SEARCH:”  Beat.  She’s got nothing.    

           She tosses the notebook back in the box and takes out a 
           Glamour magazine.  She flips through until she lands on an 
           article called WHAT’S YOUR NUMBER?  Ooh, sex.  Her eye is 
           drawn to a graphic that reads, THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF LOVERS 
           WOMEN HAVE IN THEIR LIFETIME IS 10.5.  

                                 ALLY (CONT’D)
                        Holy fuck.  That can’t be right.  

           Plant woman reacts, annoyed.

                                 ALLY (CONT’D)
                        Sorry.  It just says here, that the 
                        average number of lovers women have 
                        in their lifetime is ten point 
                        five.  

                                 PLANT WOMAN
                        Yeah, that seems high. 

                                 ALLY
                        High?  No, that’s low.  10.5 is 
                        low.  
                     "20 Times"        
                                                                  7-10-08    6.

                                 PLANT WOMAN
                        Whatever you say. 

                                 ALLY
                        Well, I say it’s low, is what I 
                        say.   

           She turns her back to the woman, takes out her notebook and   
           writes on a new page, “PEOPLE I’VE SLEPT WITH: Nate Sterling. 
           Mike Miller.  Mountain Man.  She continues scribbling. 

           INT. ALLY’S APARTMENT -- LATER

           Ally opens her door, notebook still in hand, looks at the 
           clock then starts undressing as she runs to the bathroom.  

           INT. BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           From behind the curtain we hear...

                                 ALLY (O.S.)
                        Dan!

           Ally jumps back out of the shower, wet and naked, and adds 
           Dan’s name to her list.   

           INT. DARLING FAMILY LONG ISLAND HOME -- EVENING

           Daisy’s party has already started when Ally arrives at the 
           home of their mother, AVA, a well preserved sixty-five.  

           Ava spots Ally and gives her a hug, stabbing her with her 
           chunky, old lady jewelry.  

                                 ALLY
                        Hi, mom.  Ow.  Sorry, the train was 
                        late.  You look great. 

           There is a pause while Ally waits for Ava to return the 
           compliment.  Then Ally fills the silence, apologizing:

                                 ALLY (CONT’D)
                                 (blurting)
                        I’m growing out my bangs.

                                 AVA
                        How’s work? 

                                 ALLY
                        Great.

                                 AVA
                        What about Rick?  

                                 ALLY
                        He’s great too.  I should find 
                        Daisy.

           INT. DAISY’S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           Ally enters to find Daisy pulling on her dress and 
           immediately helps her with the zipper. 

                                 DAISY
                        Eddie’s mother came in and started 
                        rearranging the center pieces.  I 
                        almost had to sedate Mom. 

                                 ALLY
                        Well, Dad should be here soon, 
                        right?  So, she’ll have someone 
                        else to focus her hatred on.  

                                 DAISY
                        Dad’s not coming.  Mom wouldn’t let 
                        me invite him here.  So, don’t tell 
                        him about it, okay? 

                                 ALLY
                        Are you inviting him to the 
                        wedding? 

                                 DAISY
                        I don’t know.  

           Daisy puts her shoes on and checks herself out in the mirror 
           as Ally looks out the window at the neighbor’s house. 

                                 ALLY
                        Hey, do you remember the guy who 
                        used to live next door?  

                                 DAISY
                        You mean Creepy Puppet guy who was 
                        obsessed with me?  

                                 ALLY
                        He wasn’t obsessed with you.

                                 DAISY
                        He made a puppet of me.
                     "20 Times"        
                                                                  7-10-08    8.

                                 ALLY
                        That puppet could have been anyone.  
                        What was his name?

                                 DAISY 
                        Jerry Perry. 

                                 ALLY
                        Thank you.  

           Ally takes her notebook out and discreetly adds his name.  

                                 DAISY
                        What are you writing? 

                                 ALLY
                        Just some notes for my toast. 

                                 DAISY
                        Is it going to rhyme? 

                                 ALLY
                        That depends.  What rhymes with 
                        orgy?  

                                 DAISY
                        Just keep it under three minutes.  
                        Ready?

                                 ALLY
                        You look amazing.  Go ahead.  I’ll 
                        be down in a minute. 

           As Daisy leaves, Ally takes a deep breath and starts counting 
           the names on her list.

           INT. DARLING FAMILY LONG ISLAND HOME -- LIVING ROOM -- LATER 

           Ally downs one drink as the bartender, JULIE, hands her 
           another.
                     "20 Times"        
                                                                  7-10-08    9.

                                 JULIE
                        Here you go.  

                                 ALLY
                        How many people you’ve slept with?  
                        More than ten?

                                 JULIE
                        I should get more ice.  

           Ava glides to the front of the room clinking a glass.    

                                 AVA
                        Can I have your attention, please?

           The conversations stop as everyone turns to Ava. 

                                 AVA (CONT’D)
                        I am so thrilled to be celebrating 
                        the engagement of Daisy and Eddie.  
                        As many of you know, we’re a family 
                        that likes to toast each other-- 
                        and no, that’s not just because we 
                        like to drink.  Ally, you’re first. 

           Ally tries to walk in a straight line towards her mother.  
           When she gets there, she faces the crowd. 

                                 ALLY
                                 (getting her bearings)
                        Daisy.  When Daisy told me she was 
                        dating Eddie, I couldn’t believe 
                        it.  I said, Eddie Vogel the shmuck 
                        you went out with in high school?  
                        He was the biggest douchebag of 
                        them all.  You know how he broke up 
                        with her?  He started dating her 
                        best friend.  Who’s here tonight, 
                        by the way.  Sheila, stand up.  But 
                        when Eddie saw Daisy at their high 
                        school reunion, he realized what a 
                        big mistake he’d made.  No offense, 
                        Sheila.  And now, Eddie is amazing.  
                        You wouldn’t even know he’s the 
                        same guy.  Except that he looks 
                        exactly the same.  I wish I’d gone 
                        to my reunion but I was growing  
                        out my bangs.  I’m always growing 
                        out my bangs.  Don’t get bangs--

           Ava steps up.  
                    "20 Times"        
                                                                 7-10-08    10.

                                 AVA
                        Thank you, Ally.  Why don’t you get 
                        something to eat now? 

           The toasts continue as Ally wobbles back towards the bar.  
           Daisy intercepts her.

                                 DAISY
                        Ally?  Not that I didn’t love your 
                        toast, because I did, but are you 
                        okay?

                                 ALLY
                                 (loud whisper)
                        I’m a little drunk.  Shh.

                                 DAISY
                        No, no, I got that.  I mean besides 
                        that, you just don’t seem like 
                        yourself.

                                 ALLY
                        I’m great.  Really.  Can we talk 
                        later because I want to get ready 
                        for your toast.

           A group of Ally and Daisy’s friends, EILEEN, SHEILA, KATIE, 
           VALERIE and JAMIE, are watching Ally’s toast as it plays on a 
           computer monitor.

                        Eddie’s parents are tired, so we’re 
                        going to take them home.

                        You can’t go. 

                                 SHEILA
                        No offense, but this hasn’t been 
                        fun yet.  We need to have some fun.

                        Absolutely.  But which one?  What

           Ally waits as the bartender pours her fifteen shots of 
           tequila.  Roger approaches.

                                 (re: drinks)
                        Oh Ally, I had no idea you were 
                        going to take it this hard.

                                 ALLY
                        Oh, hello Firerererer.  These 
                        drinks aren’t all for me. 

                                 ROGER
                        I know that.  I was kidding. 

                                 ALLY
                        Yeah, well, I don’t have to laugh 
                        at your jokes anymore, you’re not 
                        my boss.  What are you doing here 
                        anyway? 

                                 ROGER
                        Just trying to meet some angry 
                        drunk women. 

           Ally laughs.

                                 ROGER (CONT’D)
                        So, that was a genuine laugh. 

                                 ALLY
                        You got me. 

                                 ROGER
                        Let me buy you those drinks.  I 
                        feel really bad about today. 

                                 ALLY
                        Great.  I can’t afford them anyway. 

           Roger looks at Ally in his trademark pose, fingers resting 
           just under his nose. 

                                 ROGER
                        But can I be honest with you?  

                                 ALLY
                        Not tonight. 

                                 ROGER
                        You never seemed to like marketing 
                        anyway. 

                                 ALLY
                        I liked it.  I just didn’t love it.

                                 ROGER
                        Then I guess I did you a favor.  
                        Now you can go find a job you love.

                        Sure.  

           Ally gives him a flirty smile and walks away with her drinks.

           Everyone writes on little pieces of paper. 

                                 ALLY
                        So, just write down the number of 
                        guys you’ve slept and put them in 
                        this glass.  Then we’ll pick out 
                        the numbers and guess who they 
                        belong to.  Daisy, you go first. 

           Daisy reaches in, takes a number and reads:

                        Who wasn’t going to guess Katie? 
                        She got married when she was 
                        twelve, I’m surprised she’s had 
                        that many.

                        Yes.  And don’t judge me, I’m twice

           Ally takes the glass and fishes around for her own number.  
           When she finds it, she coughs and discreetly rips the ONE off 
           her NINETEEN, throwing it on the ground.  She reads:

                                 ALLY
                        Nine.  That’s me, I drew myself.  
                        I’m a nine.  Game over.  

           Katie picks up Ally’s discarded “one”. 

                                 KATIE
                                 (to Ally)

                        No, that’s not mine.  I’m at nine.

           Daisy snatches the paper from Ally’s hand and takes the other 
           piece from Katie.  She holds them up, they fit together 
           perfectly.

                        who have had twenty or more lovers?

                        I’m saying it can.

                                 ALLY
                        Well, not to me.  I’m at nineteen 
                        now, that gives me one more chance.  
                        All right, I’m going to make a 
                        proclamation.
                                 (then, to next table over)
                        Shut up, I’m proclamating.  I’m not 
                        going to sleep with another guy 
                        until I’m sure he’s the one.  I’m 
                        not going to end up like Sheila’s 
                        going to.

           Ally stands on a table.

           INT. ALLY’S APARTMENT -- BEDROOM -- MORNING

           Ally sleeps soundly, wearing nothing but last night’s makeup 
           and tequila breath.  She wakes with a start when a man’s arm 
           flops across her chest.  Horrified, Ally investigates... The 
           arm is attached to Roger.   

                                 ALLY
                        Holy Fuck.  Oh no.  Oh no.

           She flies out of bed and dials the phone in a panic.  She 
           crouches in the hallway outside her bedroom, hiding from her 
           mistake.

                        I slept with my ex-boss.

                        No, this job.  The one I just got 
                        fired from.  

                                 DAISY
                        You got fired?

                                 ALLY
                        How could you let this happen?

                                 DAISY
                        When I tried to get you to leave 
                        the bar you spit on me.  But 
                        congratulations!

                        What do you mean?

                                 DAISY
                        You said twenty’s your husband.  I 
                        have to admit, I did not think it 
                        was going to happen this fast.  
                        It’s so exciting.

                                 ALLY
                        Fuck you.

                                 DAISY
                        Hey Eddie, Ally’s getting married!  
                        She found her husband.

                                 ALLY
                        You know, I know you’re just being 
                        a bitch but maybe he is my husband.    
                        Maybe it’s fate and now we have 
                        this great story to tell our 
                        grandkids.

           Ally surreptitiously watches Roger, who is now getting 
           dressed.

                                 ALLY (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know why I never considered 
                        him before... 

           Roger buttons his jeans then puts his hand down his pants to 
           adjust his package.  Ally watches as he brings his fingers up 
           to his nose, takes a deep whiff and smiles.  It’s now clear 
           that what he smells on his fingers all day long is the scent 
           of his own balls.

                                 ALLY (CONT’D)
                        He’s not my husband.

           INT. ALLY’S APARTMENT -- KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER

           Ally paces as Roger enters. 

                                 ROGER
                        Good morning.  

                                 ALLY
                        Morning. 

                                 ROGER
                        Did you make coffee? 

                                 ALLY
                        No.  There’s a Starbucks on your 
                        way to the subway station.

                                 ROGER
                        That’s okay, I can do without.  Do 
                        you get the paper? 

                                 ALLY
                        No.  No, I don’t.    

           There is a knock at the door.  Ally opens it to find Colin, 
           her neighbor, holding the newspaper. 

                                 COLIN
                        Here.  

                                 ALLY
                        That’s not mine.  

           She takes the paper and throws it down the hall.  Colin 
           enters without being asked and closes the door behind him.

                                                                 7-10-08    22.

                                 COLIN
                        I got locked out.  My phone, keys, 
                        everything is inside my apartment.  
                        Can I use your phone? 

                                 ALLY
                        Sure.  
                                 (then)
                        Roger, why don’t we talk later.  3C 
                        needs my help.

                                 COLIN
                        We have names.  

           Colin holds out his hand to Roger.  Ally cringes as she 
           watches them shake hands. 

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Colin. 

                                 ROGER
                        Roger.  Nice to meet you.  
                                 (to Ally)
                        What about dinner tonight?  

                                 ALLY
                        Dinner?  Uh--

           Colin, now hip to what’s going on, jumps in.

                                 COLIN
                        We have that tenants meeting 
                        tonight.  

                                 ALLY
                        That’s right, tenants meeting.  I’m 
                        so sorry.  

           She ushers Roger towards the door.  

                                 ALLY (CONT’D)
                        But call me and we’ll figure out 
                        another time to get together.   

           She opens the door for him.  Instead of leaving, he pulls her 
           entire body into his and kisses her hard on the mouth.  

                                 ROGER
                        Bye, babe. 

           He finally leaves.  Ally is about to close the door when she 
           sees a beautiful woman come out of Colin’s apartment.

                                 ALLY
                        Hey, do you think the woman coming 
                        out of your apartment could have 
                        helped you with the being locked 
                        out problem?  

                                 COLIN
                        Okay.  I was in a situation that I 
                        needed to get out of, not unlike 
                        your situation here, so I--

                                 ALLY
                        Lied to her and then lied to me?

                                 COLIN
                        I look at it is as trying to avoid 
                        hurt feelings. 

                                 ALLY
                        I look at it as gross.  What did 
                        you tell her, you had to get to the 
                        gym? 

                                 COLIN
                        No.  Work.

           Colin notices a papier mache diorama hanging on the wall.  
           It’s a funky, colorful depiction of various New Yorkers 
           riding the subway. 

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Hey, this is so cool.  Where did 
                        you get it?  

                                 ALLY
                        I made it.  

                                 COLIN
                        No shit?

                                 ALLY
                        Shit.  Now listen, I don’t want 
                        anything to do with your crusade to 
                        sleep with and fuck over every 
                        woman in Manhattan, they’re kind of 
                        like my sisters.  

                                 COLIN
                        Wow.  I thought you’d be cooler 
                        than this.  

                                 ALLY
                        Why?

                                 COLIN
                        I saw that toast you made at your 
                        sister’s engagement party on 
                        YouTube.  You seemed like you had a 
                        sense of humor.  

                                 ALLY
                        How did you see that already?  It 
                        just happened.

                                 COLIN
                        I have everyone in the building on 
                        google alert.

                                 ALLY
                        Google alert? 

                                 COLIN
                        My dad’s a cop.  It’s in my blood 
                        to dig up dirt.

           INT. WEDDING CAKE BOUTIQUE -- DAY

           Ally and Daisy sit at a cake tasting station surrounded by

                        Why?  No one’s ever going to see me 
                        naked again, I might as well enjoy 
                        myself.

                                 ALLY
                        I don’t have a choice.  I said I 
                        wasn’t going to go over twenty and 
                        now thanks to that finger smelling 
                        fuck, I’m at twenty.

                        No, a real person.  Do you remember 
                        Disgusting Donald?  Fat, hairy, 
                        lots of skin tags.  I dated him.

                        He was number thirteen.

                        Did I meet him?

                        Did you sleep with him?

                        Yes.  And he was so grateful, he 
                        sent me a thank you note.  I think 
                        that’s him.

           Ally makes her way across the room and hovers near Donald, 
           pretending to look at a cake.   Donald recognizes her. 

                                 DONALD
                        Ally?

                        I lost some weight. 

                                 ALLY
                        Yeah, and a million other things.

                        You, too. 

           It’s not nice to meet her.  She’s too pretty.

                        I’m just an engineer but he likes 
                        saying that because I don’t look 
                        like the normal--

                        I get it.

                        Just tasting some cake for my... 
                        wedding.  I’m marrying a molecular 
                        biologist.  He doesn’t look smart 
                        either.  I’m here with my sister 
                        because he’s being honored in 
                        Norway today.  

                                 DONALD

           EXT. STREET

           Ally and Daisy are walking.

                                 ALLY
                        He told her we were just friends, 
                        like I was the embarrassment.  He’s 
                        the reason I learned to cook.

                        A lot of men get better with age.  
                        You said yourself, Eddie used to be 
                        a total douchebag.  People change. 

                                 ALLY
                        You’re right, they do.  Daisy, 
                        you’re a genius.  I don’t have to 
                        be celibate or go over twenty.  

                                 DAISY
                        What do you mean?

                                 ALLY
                        Donald’s probably not my only ex 
                        who’s gotten better with age.  I’m 
                        going to start tracking them down. 

                                 DAISY
                        Is this like the time you decided 
                        to be British?

                                 ALLY
                        No, because this time I’m actually 
                        going to follow through.  One of 
                        those assholes has got to be Mr. 
                        Right.  

           INT. ALLY’S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           Ally sits at her computer with a glass of wine and her list.  

                                 ALLY
                        Here we go.  Nate Sterling. 

           She googles the name NATE STERLING.  There are 100,000 pages 
           of results.  

                                 ALLY (CONT’D)
                        Okay.  Nate Sterling, Manhattan.

                                 ALLY (CONT’D)
                                 (re: list)
                        Okay, what about you, Mike Miller? 

           She types “MIKE MILLER”.  Only 75,000 pages of results.  
           Narrowing the search further, she types...  

                                 ALLY (CONT’D)
                        Mike Miller, Creskill, New Jersey.  

           There are still more Mike Millers than she knows what to do 
           with.  Taking a sip of wine, she continues typing.  

                                 ALLY (CONT’D)
                        Okay.  Creskill, New Jersey, 
                        obsessed with Springsteen.  Big 
                        balls, tiny penis.  

           She taps the return key.  It’s all porn.  Ally finishes her 
           wine.  Just then, there is a racket outside her door.   

           She goes to the door and looks through the peep hole.  Colin, 
           and yet another date, this one in a bridesmaid’s dress, 
           stumble into his apartment, laughing.  Ally rolls her eyes.

           INT. ALLY’S APARTMENT -- NEXT MORNING

           Ally is passed out with her face on the keyboard.  She shifts 
           in her sleep waking the computer.  Suddenly, dancing on the 
           screen in front of her is a giant pair of animated balls and 
           a teeny, tiny penis.  The penis is singing Bruce 
           Springsteen’s, “The E Street Shuffle.”  Apparently, there’s a 
           website for everything.  

           Ally hears Colin’s door open and goes to her door.

           INT. ALLY AND COLIN’S HALLWAY -- DAY

           Ally enters, catching Colin once again half-naked, getting 
           his newspaper.

                                 COLIN
                        Morning 3C.

           Colin is about to go back into his apartment, but Ally stops 
           him.

                                 ALLY
                        I know you have company but I just 
                        want to ask you a quick question.  
                        Remember how you said you were good 
                        at digging up dirt?

                        Do you think I could maybe pay you 
                        to find some people for me?  

           She hands him a list of names. 

                                 COLIN
                        Why? 

                                 ALLY
                        No reason.  

                                 COLIN
                        Sweetheart, I can’t help you unless 
                        you give me a little information.  

                                 ALLY
                        Fine.  It’s just a list of guys 
                        that I’ve... dated.  

                                 COLIN
                        This is your sex list?  Why do you 
                        want to track them down?  Are you 
                        worried you might be pregnant from 
                        a guy you slept with in 1992?

                                 ALLY
                        No. 

                                 COLIN
                        Oh, you have herpes.  That’s not a 
                        fun call to make.  

                                 ALLY
                        I just think one of these guys 
                        might be worth a second look.  

           He hands her back the list.  

                                 COLIN
                        I’m sorry.  I can’t be an accessory 
                        to this kind of crazy.  These guys 
                        obviously broke up with you for a 
                        reason.  I need to protect them.  
                                 (mimicking her)
                        They’re kind of like my brothers.  

                                 ALLY
                        Why do you assume they all broke up 
                        with me? 

                                 COLIN
                        I can just tell.  You’re the kind 
                        of girl who tries to makes a bad 
                        thing work.

                                 ALLY
                        Some people call that optimism. 

                                 COLIN
                        Yeah, but most people call it 
                        crazy. 

                                 ALLY
                        I’m sorry I asked.  

           She crosses to her door.

                                 COLIN
                        Hey, don’t get so mad.  It doesn’t 
                        mean I won’t sleep with you. 

           Ally slams her door.

           INT. ALLY’S APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS

           Ally is fuming.  Suddenly she gets an idea.  She grabs her 
           jacket and purse and runs out of the apartment.

           INT. ALLY AND COLIN’S HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

           Ally pounds on Colin’s door..

                        Colin!  Open  up!  Colin!

           Colin opens the door and Ally pushes past him, into his 
           apartment. 

                                 ALLY (CONT’D)
                        We’ve got to go.  Mom fell in the 
                        shower.  

                                 COLIN
                        What?  

           The bridesmaid from the night before sleepily shuffles in 
           from the bedroom.

                                 ALLY
                        We have to go.  She’s in the 
                        hospital and she’s all... wet.  
                                 (to girl)
                        So sorry.  Leave your number, he’ll 
                        call you.  
                                 (to Colin)
                        Get your jacket.  
                    "20 Times"        
                                                                 7-10-08    31.

           Perplexed, Colin does what she says.  She then pulls him out 
           of his apartment across the hall and into hers.  

           INT. ALLY’S APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS

           Ally pushes Colin inside and closes the door behind them. 

                                 ALLY
                        You help me track down my exes, 
                        I’ll help you escape yours.  You 
                        can use my apartment whenever you 
                        want.  I’ll even give you a key.

                                 COLIN
                        What about protecting your sisters?

                                 ALLY
                        If those girls can’t see you 
                        coming, they deserve what they get. 

                                 COLIN
                        I charge seventy-five dollars an 
                        hour.  

                                 ALLY
                        Fine.

                                 COLIN
                        Really?  Cause that’s a lot. 

                                 ALLY
                        So was my severance package.

                                 COLIN
                        Meals are extra.  

           INT. JET FUEL COFFEE SHOP -- LATER

           Colin takes a giant bite of a giant sandwich.  Ally hands him 
           a piece of paper.

                                 ALLY
                        So, this is all the info I have on 
                        each guy.  Names, most recent phone 
                        numbers, addresses.  Find out who’s 
                        still alive, straight, and single.  
                        And in the tri-state area.  I’ll 
                        take a car or train but I won’t 
                        take a plane.

                                 COLIN
                                 (re: list)
                        Amy?  Who’s Amy?

                                 ALLY
                        College.  You don’t have to find 
                        her.

                                 COLIN
                        Oh, I’m finding her.

                                 ALLY
                        The one I’m really curious about is 
                        Nate Sterling. 

                                 COLIN
                        The one that got away?

                                 ALLY
                        Something like that.  

                                 COLIN
                        Anything you can tell me about him?

                                 ALLY
                        He had this really soft skin, but 
                        he was manly.  Really confident, 
                        without being cocky.  And he always 
                        smelled so clean, but not in an 
                        antiseptic way.

                                 COLIN
                        He sounds dreamy but what I meant 
                        was, anything I can use to actually 
                        find him.  Unless you’re happy to 
                        pay me seventy-five dollars an hour 
                        to go around smelling people.

                                 ALLY
                        His dad’s name is also Nate 
                        Sterling, he owns half of 
                        Manhattan, and we went to high 
                        school together.  If I knew more 
                        than that, I wouldn’t need you.  
                        So, off you go.

                                 COLIN
                        Can I finish my sandwich first?

                                 ALLY
                        Go ahead.
                    "20 Times"        
                                                                 7-10-08    33.

                                 COLIN
                        Why go to all this trouble?  Why 
                        not just meet a new guy?

                                 ALLY
                        No.  No more new guys.

                                 COLIN
                        Why?  What’s wrong with us?  New is 
                        always better than old.

                                 ALLY
                        Of course you’d think that.  The 
                        longest relationship you’ve ever 
                        had is with that sandwich.  Hurry 
                        up.

           Colin takes a long, languorous bite of the sandwich.

           INT. BRIDAL SALON -- LATER

           Ally holds up a simple bridesmaid dress and talks to Daisy 
           who’s in a dressing room.

                                 ALLY
                        It’s gorgeous.  Thank you for 
                        letting me look good at your 
                        wedding.

           Daisy pokes her head out.  

                                 DAISY
                        That’s mom’s.  That’s yours.

           Daisy points to a hanger full of bows and ruffles.

                                 ALLY
                        Bitch.

                                 DAISY (O.S.)
                        I’m sorry.  Mom picked it and I 
                        have to do everything I can to keep 
                        her happy.  I invited Dad to the 
                        wedding and he’s coming.

                                 ALLY
                        And you haven’t told Mom?

                                 DAISY (O.S.)
                        No.
                    "20 Times"        
                                                                 7-10-08    34.

                                 ALLY
                        That is not going to be fun.  Hey, 
                        for the first time, I’m glad I’m 
                        not you.

           Daisy steps out of the dressing room in her wedding gown.  
           She looks unbearably beautiful and happy.

                                 ALLY (CONT’D)
                        And now I’m back to wishing I was 
                        you.

           Ally’s phones beeps.  She looks at the incoming text: “IF YOU 
           WANT TO “BUMP INTO” LUKE HANSEN, GO TO THE INN TONIGHT.”

                                 ALLY (CONT’D)
                        Oh my god.  He found Luke Hansen.

                                 DAISY
                        Luke Hansen?  The magician who 
                        wanted to be an actor?

                                 ALLY
                        No, he was an actor who wanted to 
                        be a magician.

                                 DAISY
                        Wait, who found him?

                                 ALLY
                        Colin, my neighbor.  Colin’s 
                        finding all of them.

                                 DAISY
                        Are you actually going through with 
                        this?  Tracking down all the guys 
                        you’ve slept with?

                                 ALLY
                        I won’t have to find all of them.  
                        I’ll stop as soon as I fall in 
                        love.  Besides, there aren’t going 
                        to be that many.  Some of them are 
                        married.  I think one’s even dead.

                                 DAISY
                        Really?

                                 ALLY

                                 DAISY
                        Ally, shouldn’t you be looking for 
                        a job instead of ex-boyfriends.

                                 ALLY
                        I am looking for a job.  I’m 
                        setting up an interview right now.

                                 DAISY
                        You are?

                                 ALLY
                        Yeah.  Will you ask Eddie to get me 
                        an interview with the marketing 
                        department at Sheffield & Bloom.

           INT. THE INN BAR -- NIGHT

           Ally enters, looks around, and spots Luke Hansen tending bar.  
           He’s soap opera handsome.  She watches as he flirts with a 
           girl who clearly got in by using her fake ID.  Luke pulls a 
           quarter from behind the girl’s ear and she laughs.

           Ally rolls her eyes.  She’s seen him do this trick before.  
           She turns to leave.

           EXT. ALLY AND COLIN’S BUILDING -- NIGHT

           Colin is leaving as Ally returns home.

                                 COLIN
                        So, did you find Luke?

                                 ALLY
                        Yeah, and you could have told me he 
                        was a bartender.

                                 COLIN
                        I didn’t realize you had a problem 
                        with bar tenders.  

                                 ALLY
                        I have a problem with the fact that 
                        he’s still a bartender.   

                                 COLIN
                        Why?

                                 ALLY
                        Because it leads me to believe that 
                        he’s exactly who he was seven years 
                        ago.

                        An out of work actor who sleeps 
                        ‘til noon, bartends ‘til three, and 
                        goes home with a different girl 
                        every night.  No thanks.  

                                 COLIN
                        So, come out with me tonight.

                                 ALLY
                        Oh no.  If I was going to do that, 
                        I would have done it with him.

                                 COLIN
                        So why didn’t you?  What’s wrong 
                        with just having some fun for old 
                        times’ sake. 

                                 ALLY
                        He was fun.  But even if it doesn’t 
                        raise my number, I can’t afford to 
                        waste any more time on guys like 
                        him.

                                 COLIN
                        Wait.  That’s what this is all 
                        about?  You don’t want to raise 
                        your number?  That’s why you don’t 
                        want to sleep with me!  

                                 ALLY
                        There are a lot of reasons I don’t 
                        want to sleep with you.

                                 COLIN
                        I’m pretty sure that’s the only 
                        one.

                                 ALLY
                        Good night, Colin.

           INT. ALLY’S APARTMENT -- THE NEXT MORNING

           A sleepy Ally shuffles out of her bedroom to find Colin on 
           her couch with his laptop.

                                 ALLY
                        What are you doing?

                                 COLIN
                        Working.  Looking for guys you 
                        fucked.  I found Toe Fungus Dave. 
                    "20 Times"        
                                                                 7-10-08    37.

                                 ALLY
                                 (excited)
                        You did?
                                 (then, cautiously)
                        Does he still wear sandals?

                                 COLIN
                        I don’t know.  But I do know that 
                        he’s in real estate, he’s on Zoloft 
                        -- but a very low dose -- and every 
                        Friday he takes the five o’clock 
                        ferry to his lovingly restored 
                        1840’s cottage on Nantucket.

                                 ALLY
                        Nantucket?  I love Nantucket!  
                        But that probably means he’s still 
                        wearing sandals.  That’s okay, I 
                        can get past it.  Give me his 
                        number.

                                 COLIN
                        Wait, you’re just going to call 
                        him?  

                                 ALLY
                        Yeah. 

                                 COLIN
                        And say what?

                                 ALLY
                        I don’t know.  I hadn’t gotten that 
                        far. 

                                 COLIN
                        You don’t have a plan?  You need a 
                        plan.  

           EXT. FERRY DOCK -- ANOTHER DAY

           Ally waits for the ferry with her fellow Nantucketers.  She’s 
           dressed the part in a T-shirt and pink chinos.  She pretends 
           to read The Nantucket Independent, as she scans the crowd.  

           Her eyes land on a clean cut, athletic guy in his mid-
           thirties... Dave.  

           Ally tucks away her newspaper, and follows him onto the 
           ferry.  As the ferry is about to leave the dock, Ally takes a 
           deep breath and prepares to “bump into” Dave.
                    "20 Times"        
                                                                 7-10-08    38.

           Just then, a long haired natural beauty effortlessly leaps 
           onto the ferry and into Dave’s open arms.

           Ally is horrified but without skipping a beat she pivots away 
           from the happy couple, makes a bee line for the railing and 
           pretends to take in the view.

           EXT. FERRY -- LATER

           As the ferry lurches through the choppy water, Ally is 
           suddenly overcome with motion sickness and aggressively 
           vomits over the side.  In between heaves, she hears:

                                 DAVE (O.S.)
                        Ally?  Ally, is that you?  Are you 
                        okay?

           Ally sees a pair of sandaled, toe fungus, feet standing next 
           to her, she looks up and finds herself face to face with Dave 
           and the natural beauty, Lauren.  She starts to respond but 
           turns her head and vomits again instead.  Then, trying to act 
           casual:

                                 ALLY
                        Dave?  Wow.  Yeah, I’m great.  How 
                        are you?

                                 DAVE
                        Do you want to sit down?

                                 LAUREN
                        Can we find you some Dramamine?

                                 ALLY
                        No, I’m fine.  I’m fine.  Dave, 
                        it’s so good to see you.
                                 (to Lauren)
                        I’m Ally.

                                 LAUREN
                        Lauren.

                                 DAVE
                        Are you going to be okay?  Is 
                        someone meeting you on the island? 

                                 ALLY
                        No, I was, um, I was just going to 
                        look at some summer rentals.  
                        Rentals for me and my boyfriend.  
                        Fiancé really.

                                                                 7-10-08    39.

                                 ALLY (CONT'D)
                        God, I have got to get used to 
                        saying that, “fiancé.”  “I have a 
                        fiancé.”  Anyway, it’s no big deal, 
                        I’ll do it another weekend and take 
                        the next ferry back to Hyannis.

                                 LAUREN
                        I don’t think that’s a good idea.

                                 DAVE
                        Yeah, you really don’t look well. 

                                 ALLY
                        You guys, I’m fine, really. 

           Ally turns and throws up again.

                                 LAUREN
                        You’re staying with us.

           INT. DAVE’S NANTUCKET COTTAGE -- NIGHT

           Ally lies in a bed on the couch.  She angrily whispers into 
           her cell phone while petting a twenty pound cat.

                                 ALLY
                        Was single a prerequisite you 
                        decided to just forget?!  

                                                                 INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. COLIN’S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Colin lies in bed, as a naked woman cooks for him.  He talks 
           to Ally on the phone.

                                 COLIN
                        You threw up?

                                 ALLY
                        Yeah, which sucks because all I had 
                        was a salad for lunch.  If I’d 
                        known I was going to barf I would 
                        have at least had some cake or 
                        something.

           Colin laughs.  Lauren enters with a tray.  

                                 LAUREN
                        I brought you some tummy tamer tea.   
                        If you need anything at all, we’re 
                        right down the hall.                 
                    "20 Times"        
                                                                 7-10-08    40.

                                 ALLY
                        Thank you, Lauren. 

           Lauren exits.  

                                 COLIN
                        She sounds nice. 

                                 ALLY
                        She’s an angel.  

                                 COLIN
                        Maybe you made a new friend.

                                 ALLY
                        Shut up.  If you don’t start taking 
                        this more seriously, you’re fired.  

           Ally hangs up on him.  The cat jumps off her and runs away.  

                                 ALLY (CONT’D)
                        Spats!  Come back.   I’m not mad at 
                        you.   

           INT. ALLY AND COLIN’S HALLWAY -- THE NEXT NIGHT

           Ally trudges up the stairs with her overnight bag as Colin 
           comes out of his apartment, eating Chinese food.

                                 COLIN
                        Sorry about Nantucket.  You hungry?  
                        I over ordered.

                                 ALLY
                        Is it from Charlie Chang’s?

                                 COLIN
                        Of course.

                                 ALLY
                        Did you get the itty bitty spare 
                        ribs?

                                 COLIN
                        Who doesn’t?

           INT. COLIN’S APARTMENT -- LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS 

           Ally enters to find that Colin’s living room has been 
           transformed.  The walls are covered with surveillance 
           photographs, white boards, and an oversize map of Manhattan.
                    "20 Times"        
                                                                 7-10-08    41.

           She walks around the room taking it all in. 

                                 ALLY
                        Wow.

                                 COLIN
                        You told me to take it more 
                        seriously.  

                                 ALLY
                        Where did you learn how to do this? 

                                 COLIN 
                        My dad never took me to ball games, 
                        but we did go on a lot of stake 
                        outs. 

           She stops in front of a white board with her list on it.  
           LUKE is crossed off, TOE FUNGUS DAVE is circled, and there 
           are stars and arrows around “AMY FROM COLLEGE.”  Ally picks 
           up a marker and crosses Dave off the list.

                                 ALLY
                        What do you say about all this 
                        stuff when you bring women back 
                        here?  Don’t they think you’re some 
                        kind of stalker? 

                                 COLIN
                        No.  They think I’m part of a 
                        special task force staking out the 
                        apartment of the guy across the 
                        street who’s selling arms to 
                        Hezbollah.

                                 ALLY
                        They believe that?

                                 COLIN
                        Evidently, because last night I got 
                        a blow job while spying on some 
                        poor schlub watching TV.

                                 ALLY
                        Please don’t say anymore.  I’m 
                        afraid I’m going to get chlamydia 
                        just from talking about this.  
                        Who’s next? 

                                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

                                                                 7-10-08    42.

           INT. COLIN’S APARTMENT -- LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           Colin and Ally sit on the floor surrounded by photographs, 
           folders, an open laptop, and lots of beer and Chinese food.  

                                 COLIN
                        Mike Miller and Ethan Hamilton are  
                        married.  Oh, and so is Valerio, 
                        the guy you met in Italy.  

                                 ALLY
                        Yeah, I know.  He was married when 
                        we slept together. 

                                 COLIN
                        John Kimball is single and lives in 
                        Washington Heights.  Danny Forester 
                        is separated but soon to be 
                        divorced, which I know because 
                        their apartment is on the market. 

                                 ALLY
                        Oooh.  I liked Danny.  Let’s start 
                        with him.   
                                 (brainstorming)
                        Okay.  So, what’s my plan?  Guy 
                        getting a divorce.  I could find 
                        out who is lawyer is, I’m sure he’s 
                        going to the gym more now that he’s 
                        single--

                                 COLIN
                        Maybe you keep it simple and just 
                        go look at his apartment.

                                 ALLY
                        Oh, right.  Gotcha.  So, my aunt 
                        died and left me a ton of money. 

                                 COLIN
                        I think I’d better go with you. 

           EXT. UPPER WEST SIDE STREET -- DAY

           Ally and Colin walk.

                                 ALLY
                        Danny really loved my laugh, so try 
                        and get me to laugh.  

           Colin stops walking.

                                                                 7-10-08    43.

                                 COLIN
                        Hold up, hold up.  I think that’s 
                        our guy.

           Colin points to a guy getting out of a cab on the corner. 

                                 ALLY
                        Yes, that’s him.  

           Ally and Colin follow Danny towards his brownstone. 

                                 ALLY (CONT’D)
                        He looks good for a guy going 
                        through a divorce. 

           Danny passes a dog tied to a tree.  The dog barks at him.  
           Danny kicks the dog.

                                 ALLY (CONT’D)
                        Oh!  Oh!  He just kicked that dog.  
                        He’s a dog kicker.

                                 COLIN
                        I guess we don’t need to look at 
                        his apartment now.  

           EXT. RIVERSIDE PARK -- LATER THAT DAY  

           Ally and Colin jog.

                                 ALLY
                                 (worried)
                        I hope John’s happy to see me.
                        I didn’t know how to break up with 
                        him, so I just started acting 
                        crazy. 

                                 COLIN
                        How?

                                 ALLY
                        I’d show up where ever he was even 
                        when we didn’t have plans.  And 
                        then we when did have plans I just 
                        cried the whole time.  And then 
                        once, I think I cut his hair while 
                        he was sleeping. 

           They spot her target, John Kimball, up ahead.  

                                 ALLY (CONT’D)
                        There he is. 
                    "20 Times"        
                                                                 7-10-08    44.

                                 COLIN
                        Go. 

           She catches up to him and keeps his pace until he notices 
           her.  When he does, she smiles.  He smiles back, but then 
           suddenly recognizes her and sprints off.  Colin catches up to 
           her, she stops running and tries to walk off a side cramp. 

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Looks like he remembered the 
                        haircut.  

           INT. COLIN’S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           Ally and Colin are once again surrounded by photographs, this 
           time eating Indian.  Danny Forester and John Kimball’s names 
           are now crossed off Colin’s white board.  

                                 COLIN
                        So, we’ve got ten possibilities 
                        left.  Chris Halpern lives in 
                        Kansas or is dead.  I’m not sure 
                        which one yet. 

                                 ALLY
                        Either way, doesn’t matter. 

                                 COLIN
                        “Jay from Club Med Turkoise”.  I’m 
                        trying, but I’m going to need more 
                        to go on.  

                                 ALLY
                        I’m sorry.  It was spring break, 
                        his name might not even be Jay. 

                                 COLIN
                        Evan Slater lives in Los Angeles, 
                        so he’s out.  

                                 ALLY
                        Evan was pretty great.   I can have 
                        my friend, Christine, check him out 
                        for me.  She lives there.  

                                 COLIN
                        If you’re willing to consider L.A.  
                        what about Denver?  I found Chuck 
                        Philbin.  

                                 ALLY
                        Mountain Man?  
                    "20 Times"        
                                                                 7-10-08    45.

                                 COLIN
                        Yeah, and I know he’s 
                        geographically undesirable but he’s 
                        got a behind that might be worth 
                        relocating for.  Here he is in the 
                        Sierras. 

           Colin shows her a picture of the back of a well built man 
           scaling a mountain.  

                                 ALLY
                        Denver is out of the question and 
                        he was too outdoorsy for me anyway.  
                        He always wanted to breathe fresh 
                        air, it was annoying. 

           Colin puts Chuck’s file into the NO pile.

                                 COLIN
                        Okay, no Mountain Man.  What about 
                        Jerry Perry?  He’s a puppeteer so 
                        he’s single.  

                                 ALLY
                        I don’t want to go out with Jerry 
                        Perry.  What about Nate Sterling?   

                                 COLIN
                        He runs his family’s philanthropic 
                        foundation.  Right now he’s 
                        overseeing the construction of a 
                        school in Ethiopia.  Do you want to 
                        go to Ethiopia? 

                                 ALLY
                        No.

                                 COLIN
                        Can I ask you something?  If Nate 
                        was so perfect, why didn’t it work 
                        out in the first place?

                                 ALLY
                        It’s a long story but basically he 
                        went to school abroad for a 
                        semester and my “friend”, who 
                        wanted him for herself, told me 
                        that he had hooked up with a girl 
                        in France.  So I made out with his 
                        best friend.  When Nate came back, 
                        I found out he hadn’t cheated but 
                        the damage was done.

                                 COLIN
                        Sounds very high school.

                                 ALLY
                        It was high school.

                                 COLIN
                        Wait.  You’re still hung up on a 
                        guy from high school?

                                 ALLY
                        I know it’s ridiculous but he was 
                        so great, it’s been hard not to 
                        compare every guy since.  Anyway, 
                        when is he coming back? 

                                 COLIN
                        I’m not sure, but I’ll stay on him.  
                        In the meantime I’ve got Jerry 
                        Perry.  

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK -- DAY

           Ally walks through the park on the phone. 

                                 ALLY
                        Christine, it’s Ally. 

                                                                 INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. SHITTY HONDA -- LOS ANGELES

           Christine, almost thirty and almost beautiful, is in traffic 
           on an L.A. freeway.  She gets cut off by a big truck.

                                 CHRISTINE
                                 (to truck driver)
                        Fuck you, trucker! 
                                 (light)
                        Hey, Ally. 

                                 ALLY
                        Can you do you me a favor and check 
                        somebody out for me?  We used to 
                        date and I want to make sure he 
                        hasn’t turned into someone who 
                        keeps girls in his basement.  

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Sure, what’s his name?

           Christine, still driving and now drinking a giant soda, finds 
           a pen and begins to write. 

                                 ALLY
                        Evan Slater, he has a gallery at 
                        Bergamot Station.  

           Ally approaches a kid’s party in the park with a puppet show 
           in progress.  Colin is there with a six year old boy. 

                                 ALLY (CONT’D)
                        I’ll check in with you later, 
                        thanks. 

           Ally hangs up crosses to Colin.    

                                 ALLY (CONT’D)
                        Hi. 
                                 (sotto)
                        Whose kid is this? 

                                 COLIN
                        I don’t know.  I just grabbed him 
                        off the subway. 

                                 ALLY
                        What? 

                                 COLIN
                        You can’t show up to a puppet show 
                        without a kid, it’s creepy. 

                                 ALLY
                        Colin.

                                 COLIN
                        He’s my nephew.  Relax. 

                                 ALLY
                        I didn’t know you had a nephew. 
                                 (to kid)
                        It’s nice to meet you. 

                                 KID
                        Arg. 

                                 ALLY
                        What’s your name? 

                                 KID
                        Arg.

                                 COLIN
                        He’s a pirate.

                                 KID
                        Of course he is. 

           The show finishes to a smattering of a applause and a few 
           tears.

                        Okay, you’re up. 

                                 ALLY
                        Wish me luck.

           EXT. PUPPET THEATRE -- SAME

           Ally approaches as JERRY PERRY is packing up.  He carefully 
           lays a blonde puppet down in a velvet case. 

                                 JERRY
                                 (whispering)
                        Good night, sweet Daisy. 

           Ally backs away slowly. 

           INT. COLIN’S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           Ally and Colin sit on the floor eating pizza.    

                                 ALLY
                        ...And the puppet was wearing my 
                        sister’s scarf.  How did he get 
                        that?  You have to do better than 
                        Jerry Perry. 

                                 COLIN
                        Me?  You’re the one that fucked 
                        him.  

                                 ALLY
                        Can we just focus on the good ones?  
                        I’m running out of time, money and 
                        viable eggs.  What about Tom 
                        Fenton, I heard he’s in D.C.?  And 
                        Barrett Ingold?  He went to med 
                        school.  

                                 COLIN
                        Would you just relax?  I found 
                        Barrett Ingold.

                        And med school paid off because 
                        he’s a vagina doctor now. 

                                 ALLY
                        You mean a gynecologist?  

                                 COLIN
                        Yes.  In New Hampshire.

                        Doctor’s wife in New Hampshire.  
                        That’s better than being a 
                        puppeteers bitch.  

           She gets up to go.  

                                 ALLY (CONT’D)
                        Colin, I really appreciate all the 
                        work you’ve put into this. 

                                 COLIN
                        It’s no problem. 

           He cups her boob. 

                                 ALLY
                        What are you doing?  

                                 COLIN
                        Trying to end the evening with a 
                        bang?

                                 ALLY
                        You’re not on my list.

                                 (re: whiteboard)
                        So just erase the dead guy’s name 
                        and put me there.  

                                 ALLY
                        You really can’t hang out with a 
                        woman without fucking her, can you?

                                 COLIN
                        Sure I can.  It’s just not as much 
                        fun.

           Ally finds Daisy at a table.

                                 ALLY
                        Hey.  

           She notices the table is set for three.  

                                 ALLY (CONT’D)
                        Is Eddie coming?

                                 DAISY
                        No.  Mom.  Don’t go.

                                 ALLY
                        Uch.  I can’t have lunch with mom.  
                        I didn’t wash my hair. 

                                 DAISY
                        You can’t tell.  It looks great.  

                                 ALLY
                        You haven’t told Mom Dad’s coming 
                        to the wedding, have you? 

                                 DAISY
                        No.  

                                 ALLY
                        And that’s why I’m here. 

                                 DAISY
                        Yes. 

                                 ALLY
                        And my hair, doesn’t look that 
                        great. 

                                 DAISY
                        No.  I can’t tell her alone.  
                        Please stay. 

                                 ALLY
                        Fine.  Pass the bread.

                                 DAISY
                        It won’t be so bad.  We’ll order 
                        some wine, loosen her up, ease into 
                        it.  

           Ava joins them.

                        Ally and Rick broke up.

                        Dad’s coming to the wedding.

           Ally takes a large bite of bread.

                                 (to Daisy)
                        You invited your father?  How could 
                        you do this to me?

                                 DAISY
                        I’m not doing anything to you.

                        You’re not going to come to my

                        That makes sense, of course.  
                        Tracking him down is much more

                        He’s not the only person that threw 
                        up that weekend.  And I know my 
                        quest seems stupid to you but it’s

                        ago, wasn’t it?  Let’s see how 
                        things are going now.

           This is not going the way she planned.  Seeing no other 
           option, Ally sits back and puts her feet in the stirrups.  
           Dr. Ingold begins the exam, and upon seeing her vagina...

                        Ally!  Of course!  

           INT. RENTAL CAR -- LATER

           Ally is on the phone.

                                 ALLY
                        He recognized my vagina. 

                                                                 INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. COLIN’S LIVING ROOM -- SAME TIME

           Colin, on the phone, looks through binoculars at the guy in 
           the building across the street.

                                 ALLY
                        What’s going on down there?  I’m a 
                        little freaked out.  

                                 COLIN
                        I’d be happy to take a look for 
                        you.  But I may have to put my 
                        penis in it.

                                 ALLY
                        Forget it.  Just cross Ingold off 
                        the list.  Is there anyone else?  

                                 COLIN
                        Tom Fenton is in D.C.  And he’s the 
                        chief of staff to Congressman 
                        Adelman.

                                 ALLY
                        That crooked son of a bitch?  I’m 
                        kidding, I have no idea who he is. 

                                 COLIN
                        Apparently Fenton’s on the fast 
                        track to becoming a Senator. 

                                 ALLY
                        I don’t have anything a Senator’s 
                        wife would wear.  Uch.  I’m going 
                        to have to go to Ann Taylor. 

           INT. ALLY’S APARTMENT -- DAY

           Ally enters with an Ann Taylor shopping bag.  She’s surprised 
           to find Colin sitting on the couch playing guitar. He appears 
           to be naked.  

                                 ALLY
                        Jesus.  Tell me you’re not naked on 
                        my couch.  

           He lifts the guitar revealing his tighty whities.  

                                 COLIN
                        I could take these off.  I just 
                        wear them because the guitar gets 
                        cold against my penis. 

           She puts the shopping bag down and pulls out her new outfit.   

                                 ALLY
                        I’m really excited about Tom.  

                                 COLIN
                        Then why would you wear a pant 
                        suit? 

                                 ALLY
                        Because it’s the perfect outfit for 
                        a politician’s wife and I have a 
                        job interview tomorrow.  

                                 COLIN
                        Where?

                                 ALLY
                        Sheffield and Bloom.  It’s a 
                        marketing job my sister’s fiancé 
                        hooked me up with. 

           Colin picks up Ally’s iPod and scrolls through.

                                 COLIN
                        You don’t sound very enthusiastic. 

                                 ALLY
                        I’m not.

                                 COLIN
                        Then why are you going?  

                                 ALLY
                        Rent.  Food.  Pant suits.  

                                 COLIN
                        Have you ever tried selling your 
                        freaky little sculptures?  

                                 ALLY
                        They’re just a hobby. 

                                 COLIN
                        They’re really good.  I have a 
                        friend who puts art up in his 
                        coffeehouse.  I bet he’d love them.  

                                 ALLY
                        Is that my iPod?

                                 COLIN
                        Yeah, and you really like Lionel 
                        Richie.

                                 ALLY
                        Put it down. 

                                 COLIN
                        You actually took the time to buy 
                        and download five Lionel Richie 
                        songs.  

                                 ALLY
                        So I’m not up on the latest 
                        bands...

                                 COLIN
                        Latest bands?  You just made my 
                        grandmother seem cool. 

                                 ALLY
                        Just because you have greasy hair 
                        and claim to play the guitar 
                        doesn’t give you the right to look 
                        down on my musical taste.  Some 
                        artists are timeless.

                                 COLIN
                        Sure, maybe The Beatles or Bob 
                        Dylan.

                                 ALLY
                        Isn’t your lady friend gone yet?  

                                 COLIN
                        I’m sorry.  I guess this one’s a 
                        late sleeper.  

                                 ALLY
                        Can I ask you something?  Wouldn’t 
                        it be easier to just go to their 
                        apartment and leave in the morning, 
                        like every other guy?

                                 COLIN
                        No.  I once stayed in a 
                        relationship with a girl because of 
                        a picture she had by her bed of her 
                        on her fifth birthday holding a 
                        bunny. 

                                 ALLY
                        So? 

                                 COLIN
                        So, every time I tried to break up 
                        with her, I thought of that little 
                        girl and Flopsy and how she used to 
                        dress him up in a little sweater 
                        every time they visited her 
                        grandparents in Nova Scotia.  And 
                        that just made it too hard.  

                                 ALLY
                        So, you’re saying it’s easier for 
                        you to sleep with girls and never 
                        call again if you don’t know 
                        anything about them?  Like a serial 
                        killer?  

                                 COLIN
                        Yeah. 

                                 ALLY
                        This is ridiculous.  Give me your 
                        keys.  

           Colin tosses her his keys.  Ally picks up her shopping bag 
           and exits.  
                    "20 Times"        
                                                                 7-10-08    58.

           Ally opens Colin’s door.  

           INT. COLIN’S APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS

           Ally enters and casually tosses her keys on the table.  A 
           sleepy girl comes out of Colin’s bedroom.  

                                 ALLY
                        Who the fuck are you? 

                                 GIRL    
                        I-I-I- 

                                 ALLY
                        Oh my god.  He didn’t tell you he 
                        was engaged?

                                 GIRL    
                        No.  I had no idea.  I’m so sorry.  
                        I can’t believe when I told him I 
                        was engaged he didn’t say anything.  

           The girl grabs her stuff and runs out.  After a beat Colin 
           enters.  

                                 COLIN
                        Thanks. 

                                 ALLY
                        No problem.

                        I said something about what firm 
                        hand shake he had.  But I said 
                        “firm” really sexually.

                        I was hitting on him so I said I 
                        was married.

                                 ALLY
                        Then he started talking about his 
                        kids, I started talking about my 
                        kids.  And then I looked like a 
                        terrible mom because I didn’t have 
                        any pictures.  So, I don’t think I 
                        got the job but our kids have a

                        What’s that sound? 

                                 COLIN
                        Nothing.  If you miss him there, 
                        call me.  I’ll try and find out 
                        where he’s going next.  

           Ally hangs up.  After she settles in with a magazine, Ally’s 
           phone beeps-- she has mail.  She opens it to find a photo of 
           Colin grinning in her bathtub, up to his neck in bubbles.  

           The subject line reads: YOU’RE OUT OF BUBBLE BATH.

           She smiles and types back: GET OUT OF MY APARTMENT. 

           INT. MCLEAN’S RESTAURANT -- LATER THAT DAY

           Ally enters and scans the fairly busy lunch crowd, in search 
           of Tom Fenton.  Bingo.  He’s at a table in the back, eating 
           with a woman.  Ally approaches the maître d'.

                                 ALLY
                        Hi.  One for lunch.

           She follows him to a table for two. 

                                 ALLY (CONT’D)
                        Actually, can I sit over there?

           Ally indicates an empty table next to Tom.

                                 MAÎTRE D'
                        That’s a four top.

                                 ALLY
                        Oh, I forgot.  I’m waiting for 
                        three other people.  

                                 MAÎTRE D’
                        Then we’ll need to wait until your 
                        whole party is here.  

                                 ALLY
                        They’re parking and I’m pregnant. 

           The maître d' hands her four menus and walks away.  Ally sits 
           down and pretends to study the menu when her phone beeps 
           indicating another email:  Another picture of Colin.  This 
           time he’s wearing her bathrobe, eating scrambled eggs.  

           The subject line reads:  YOU’RE ALSO OUT OF EGGS.
                    "20 Times"        
                                                                 7-10-08    61.

           She writes back:  IF YOU’RE NOT WEARING UNDERWEAR, PLEASE 
           ACCEPT THE ROBE AS A GIFT.

           She looks at the menu as her phone rings.  She answers.

                                 ALLY (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 COLIN (V.O.)
                        Does that go for everything my bare 
                        ass has touched?  If so, thanks for 
                        the couch... And the TV.

           She hangs up and laughs, which catches Tom’s attention.  

                                 TOM
                        Ally?

                                 ALLY
                        Oh my god.  Tom?  

                                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. MCLEAN’S RESTAURANT -- A LITTLE LATER

           The lunch crowd has thinned out.  Tom and Ally are still at 
           their table, laughing and catching up.

                                 TOM
                        I was in New York a couple years 
                        ago and I was going to look you up.  
                        I still have your Texaco commuter 
                        mug.  I feel bad because I know how 
                        much you loved it.

                                 ALLY
                        It really was spill-proof.

                                 TOM
                        I know.  That’s why I haven’t been 
                        able to part with it.  So, are you 
                        still living there or are you here 
                        or where are you?

                                 ALLY
                        I’m still in New York, I’m just 
                        here on business.   

                                 TOM
                        What do you do?

                        a new... Gap... Kids... Body... 
                        Baby.  It’s a lot.

                                 TOM
                        Do you have dinner plans tonight?  

                                 ALLY
                        No.

                                 TOM
                                 (smooth)
                        You do now.  

           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT -- THAT NIGHT

           Tom transfers take out from cartons onto plates as Ally looks 
           on, sipping wine.

                                 TOM
                        I really appreciate you coming 
                        over.  I have to eat out so much 
                        for work, I love when I get to just 
                        stay home and relax. 

                                 ALLY
                        No, it’s nice.  I’m glad I got to 
                        see where you live.  You’ve come a 
                        long way.  
                                 (re: coffee table)
                        That is not from Pier One.

           Ally notices a picture on the mantle.

                                 ALLY (CONT’D)
                        Is that Schwartz?  

                                 TOM
                        Yeah, he’s got this cabin in 
                        Vermont and once a year everyone 
                        ditches their families and we hike, 
                        swim, and smoke some medicinal 
                        marijuana.  Schwartz is a doctor 
                        now. 

                                 ALLY
                        Good for him, he finally got his 
                        hands on some quality stuff.  I 
                        haven’t seen those guys since 
                        college.  They’re all married?

                                 TOM
                        Yup.

                                 ALLY
                        What about you?  How have you 
                        managed to stay single?

                                 TOM
                        I was engaged once but she felt 
                        like I was more in love with my job 
                        than her.  In the end she was 
                        right.  What about you?

                                 ALLY
                        Just waiting to meet someone as 
                        flawless as me.

                                 TOM
                        Well in the meantime, do you want 
                        to see me again?

                                 ALLY
                        Is this date over?  Because we 
                        haven’t eaten yet.

                                 TOM
                        No, my boss is hosting this black 
                        tie benefit tomorrow night and I’d 
                        love you to be my date.  If you can 
                        stay...

                                 ALLY
                        No problem.  I can just get a room 
                        at the Best Western or something.   

                                 TOM
                                 (sexy smile)
                        I have a better idea. 

           INT. FOUR SEASON’S SUITE -- MORNING

           Ally lounges on the bed in a fluffy white robe talking on the 
           phone. 

                                 ALLY
                        He put me up at the Four Seasons.  

                                                                 INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. ALLY’S APARTMENT -- LIVING ROOM -- SAME TIME

           Colin sits on Ally’s couch going through her TIVO. 
                    "20 Times"        
                                                                 7-10-08    64.

                                 COLIN
                        Where is he? 

                                 ALLY
                        At his house. 

                                 COLIN
                        He dropped you off at the Four 
                        Seasons and didn’t spend the night?  

                                 ALLY
                        Yeah.

                                 COLIN
                        Why?  Did you do something to turn 
                        him off? 

                                 ALLY
                        No.  He’s a gentleman.  That’s what 
                        gentlemen do.  

                                 COLIN
                        You wore that fucking pant suit, 
                        didn’t you? 

                                 ALLY
                        That pant suit is sexy!  It’s very 
                        Katherine Hepburn. 

                                 COLIN
                        Let’s just clear something up right 
                        now.  Men never thought Katherine 
                        Hepburn was sexy.  Audrey Hepburn 
                        was sexy.  Katherine Hepburn was a 
                        dude. 

                                 ALLY
                        Tom is just a good guy.  I have a 
                        really good feeling about him. 

           There’s a knock at the door.  

                                 ALLY (CONT’D)
                        Ooh.  Someone’s here.  Got to go. 

           Ally opens the door to a bell man holding a garment bag. 

                                 BELL MAN
                        Ally Darling?

                                 ALLY
                        That’s me.  
                    "20 Times"        
                                                                 7-10-08    65.

                                 BELL MAN
                        Then, this is for you.

           The bell man exits as Ally unzips the garment bag to find a 
           beautiful ball gown.  Oh my god.  She’s fucking Cinderella.  
           Her phone rings. 

                                 ALLY
                        Hello?

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        Did you get a delivery? 

                                 ALLY
                        Tom?  I...

           Ally is speechless. 

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        Ally?  Are you there?  Did those 
                        assholes not deliver the dress? 

                                 ALLY
                        No, no.  It’s here.  Sorry, I’m 
                        just overwhelmed, I don’t know what 
                        to say. 

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        Do you like it? 

                                 ALLY
                        It’s the most beautiful dress I’ve 
                        ever seen.  

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        See you in the lobby at seven.  

           INT. FOUR SEASONS LOBBY -- THAT NIGHT

           Tom waits for Ally.  Heads turn as she steps off the elevator 
           in her gown.  

                                 TOM
                        Wow.  You look--

                                 ALLY
                        I know.  I’ve never looked better. 

           He offers his arm to Ally, she takes it, and as they head out 
           her phone vibrates.  She she sees it’s Colin and ignores it.

           INT. BALLROOM -- LATER THAT NIGHT

           Ally and Tom make small talk with a group of very important 
           looking men.  One of them is Tom’s boss, Congressman Adelman.    

                                 CONGRESSMAN ADELMAN
                        Tom’s the only reason I co-
                        sponsored that health care bill.  
                        If he hadn’t been so goddamned 
                        tenacious I’d be in Aruba right 
                        now.  

                                 ALLY
                        I’m pretty sure his tenacity is 
                        also the reason our college dorm 
                        went coed.  

           The Congressman slaps Tom on the back as they all laugh.  Tom 
           smiles at Ally -- her charm has clearly won them all over.  

           Ally’s phone vibrates.  Once again, she ignores it. 

           INT. FOUR SEASONS SUITE -- LATER

           Ally and Tom drink wine while looking at the view. 

                                 TOM
                        The congressman really took a shine 
                        to you. 

                                 ALLY
                        And he was my favorite of the drunk 
                        old white guys.  

                                 TOM
                        Let’s polish this off. 

           He pours them more wine as Ally’s phone beeps.  It’s a text 
           from Colin:  It reads:  WHY AREN’T YOU ANSWERING YOUR PHONE?  
           I’M STARTING TO GET WORRIED.  

           She ignores it and returns her attention to Tom who is taking 
           a huge swig of wine.  He turns serious. 

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Ally.

                                 ALLY
                        Tom?
                    "20 Times"        
                                                                 7-10-08    67.

                                 TOM
                        Ally, this is going to seem really 
                        fast but when I saw you at the 
                        restaurant... I just knew... you 
                        were the one--  

                                 ALLY
                        What?      

                                 TOM
                        Wait.  Just listen.  You asked me 
                        the other night why I’m still 
                        single.  Well, the reason is that I 
                        haven’t found anyone I can really 
                        trust.  But with you, I feel safe.  
                        We have history.  And that’s the 
                        reason I want you to be my... 
                        beard.  I’m gay, Ally.   

                                 ALLY
                                 (shell-shocked)
                        You are?   

                                 TOM
                        Super gay.  

                                 ALLY
                        So, these dates have been sort of 
                        like a test?  

                                 TOM
                        In a way, yes.  Ally, my career is 
                        really taking off and I know if I 
                        put my mind to it, I could go all 
                        the way.  But, unfortunately, I 
                        don’t think America will ever be 
                        ready for a gay president.  

                                 ALLY
                        I’d love to help you, but I don’t 
                        think I’ll ever be ready for a gay 
                        husband.

                                 TOM
                        Are you sure?  It’s a pretty great 
                        offer for someone who doesn’t seem 
                        to have a lot of other options.  

           INT. FOUR SEASONS SUITE -- LATER

           Ally, still in her gown, sits on her bed, surrounded by 
           twelve dollar M&Ms and a teeny tiny bottle of wine.  
                    "20 Times"        
                                                                 7-10-08    68.

           Her phone beeps.  Another text from Colin:  NOW I’M WORRIED 
           AND ANGRY.  YOU BETTER BE DEAD. 

           She tosses it aside.  

                                 ALLY
                        Leave me alone.  

           Her phone rings.  She answers.  

                                 ALLY (CONT’D)
                        I said, Leave me alone.   

                                 COLIN (V.O.)
                        What happened? 

                                 ALLY
                        Nothing.  Can we just talk 
                        tomorrow?  

                                 COLIN (V.O.)
                        Did he try something?  

                                 ALLY
                        Yes, he did.  He tried to get me to 
                        live in the White House closet with 
                        him.   

                                 COLIN (V.O.)
                        What?  Ally, are you okay?  You 
                        sound more insane than usual. 

                                 ALLY
                        You know what I like about you?  
                        You’re not trying to trick anyone 
                        into thinking you’re anything other 
                        than a disgusting pig.  Good night, 
                        pig. 

           INT. FOUR SEASONS SUITE -- TWO HOURS LATER

           Ally, still in her dress, is asleep in front of St. Elmo’s 
           Fire.  There is a knock at the door.  She wakes and stumbles 
           to the door.  It’s Colin.  

                                 ALLY
                        Colin?  What are you doing here? 
                                 (then)
                        Wait a minute, I am not depressed 
                        enough to sleep with you.  
                    "20 Times"        
                                                                 7-10-08    69.

                                 COLIN
                        I just came here because you 
                        sounded a little bummed and I 
                        wanted to give you some good news 
                        in person. 

                                 ALLY
                        What? 

                                 COLIN
                        I found Amy from college.  She’s a 
                        man now.  And she’s single.  

           Ally slams the door on Colin. 

                                 COLIN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        What?  She’s cute.  She looks like 
                        Ralph Macchio.   

           Colin knocks again. 

                                 COLIN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Come on, open the door.  Let’s get 
                        room service and bill it to 
                        Congressman Cocksucker.  

           Ally opens the door. 

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Do you like caviar?

                                 ALLY
                        No, but let’s order a shit load of 
                        it. 

           INT. FOUR SEASONS SUITE -- A LITTLE LATER

           Ally and Colin sit on the bed surrounded by trays containing  
           everything on the room service menu. 

                                 ALLY
                        How do you like your steak...

           She gestures to three different platters.

                                 ALLY (CONT’D)
                        Rare, medium or well?  

                                 COLIN
                        I like lobster.

                                 ALLY
                        Got that, too.  
                    "20 Times"        
                                                                 7-10-08    70.

           She passes him the lobster.  

                                 COLIN
                        Nice dress, by the way. 

                                 ALLY
                        I know.  And check out the matching 
                        purse and shoes.  I should have 
                        known he was gay.

           Colin takes a bite and butter drips down his chin. 

                                 ALLY (CONT’D)
                        Let me. 

           Ally takes the hem of her gown and wipes his face with it.  

                                 ALLY (CONT’D)
                        I guess it doesn’t matter.  There’s 
                        no such thing as a First Lady who’s 
                        slept with twenty guys.  You’ve got 
                        to be a lady to be First Lady, and   
                        I ain’t no lady.  

                                 COLIN
                        Come on, sure you are.  You’re lots 
                        of lady.  

           Colin picks up his guitar.

                                 COLIN (CONT'D)
                        In fact, you’re once, twice, three 
                        times a lady.

           Colin begins playing a fast paced, rock version of “Three 
           Times A Lady.”  

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        When we are together/ The moments I 
                        cherish/ With every beat of my 
                        heart.

           Ally jumps off the bed and dances.  Colin loves seeing her so 
           carefree.

                                 COLIN (CONT'D)
                        To touch you, to hold you/ To feel 
                        you, to need you/ There’s nothing 
                        to keep us apart./ You’re once, 
                        twice/ three times a lady/ And I 
                        love you.

           Ally abruptly stops dancing.

                                 ALLY
                        I either need to lie down or throw 
                        up.

                                 COLIN
                        What about some air?  

           EXT. D.C. STREET -- A LITTLE LATER

           Ally and Colin walk along the Potomac. 

                                 ALLY
                        I can’t believe after all the shit 
                        you gave me, you can play Lionel 
                        Richie.

                                 COLIN
                        I can play anything.

                                 ALLY
                        I wasn’t sure if you were an actual 
                        musician or just had a lot of 
                        guitars in your apartment.  

                                 COLIN
                        I’m an actual musician.

                                 ALLY
                        And you’re really good.  How come 
                        you don’t make a living at it?

                                 COLIN
                        I’m in a band but I want to play my 
                        own music.  

                                 ALLY
                        I understand that but don’t you 
                        worry about paying the rent?  I 
                        mean, I don’t love marketing but--

                                 COLIN
                        What do you love?

           Ally thinks.

                                 ALLY
                        I guess I love making my freaky 
                        little sculptures, but I’m not 
                        going to make money at that.

                                 COLIN
                        How would you know?  You’ve never 
                        tried.

           Colin spots a statue of Eleanor Roosevelt.  

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Ooh.  Take my picture.  

           He hands her his iPhone, runs up to the sculpture and starts 
           undressing.  

                                 ALLY
                        What are you doing? 

                                 COLIN
                        Making history interesting.  Take 
                        my picture.   

           He leans casually against the sculpture. 

                                 ALLY
                        Colin, put your clothes on. 

                                 COLIN
                        I’m telling you Ally, the only 
                        thing in the way of you and true 
                        happiness is that dress.  

                                 ALLY
                        Smile.  

           She takes his picture.

           INT. FOUR SEASONS SUITE -- LATER

           Ally and Colin enter the room, exhilarated from their 
           adventure.  Ally wears Colin’s button down shirt like a 
           dress.

                                 ALLY
                        I can’t believe you finally got me 
                        naked. 

                                 COLIN
                        My shirt looks good on you.

                                 ALLY
                        Good, ‘cause I’m keeping it.

                                 COLIN
                        No, I can’t afford to lose anymore 
                        shirts.  Women are always stealing 
                        my shirts. 

                                 ALLY
                        Women aren’t stealing your shirts.  
                        They’re borrowing them, fully 
                        intending to give them back, but 
                        you never call so...

                                 COLIN
                        They keep the shirts. 

                                 ALLY
                        Yup.  
                    "20 Times"        
                                                                 7-10-08    74.

                                 COLIN
                        So, are you saying if I had fewer 
                        one night stands, I’d have more 
                        shirts?   

                                 ALLY
                        That’s what I’m saying. 

                                 COLIN
                        Well, that settles it then.  I am 
                        changing my ways.  I’m not going to 
                        lose one more shirt. 

                                 ALLY
                        Really?

                                 COLIN
                        Really.  

           A beat.

                                 COLIN (CONT'D)
                        Starting with this one. 

           Colin moves in close and starts unbuttoning Ally’s shirt.

                                 ALLY
                        Wow...  Good for you.   

                                 COLIN
                                 (still unbuttoning)
                        Well, it’s about time.   

                                 ALLY
                        I couldn’t agree more.

           Ally unbuckles his belt. Colin undoes the last button on her 
           shirt but before slipping it off, he stops.  

                                 COLIN
                        What if I told you, I really came 
                        down here to tell you I found Nate.  
                        Would we still be doing this?  

           She whips the belt off his pants.  That answers his question.  
           He kisses her.  It gets heated fast and soon they’re 
           breathlessly ripping off each other’s clothes.  

                                 ALLY
                        Wait.  

                                 COLIN
                        I have one.  
                    "20 Times"        
                                                                 7-10-08    75.

                                 ALLY
                        No.  It’s just...  I need to slow 
                        down.  

                                 COLIN
                        Okay, I totally understand. 
                                 (then)
                        How about I stick it in just a 
                        little? 

                                 ALLY
                        No.

                                 COLIN
                        It won’t count. 

                                 ALLY
                        Trust me, it counts. 

                                 COLIN
                        Come on, just a little, just this 
                        much. 

           Colin holds his hands eight inches apart.  Ally laughs.  

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Fine.  No sex.  I’m going to keep 
                        kissing you though.   

           He kisses her. 

           INT. FOUR SEASONS SUITE -- THE NEXT MORNING

           Colin and Ally sleep, wrapped in each others arms.  Colin 
           wakes and kisses Ally’s head.  She slowly opens her eyes, 
           smiling when she sees Colin.

                                 COLIN
                        You look so pretty in the morning.

                                 ALLY
                        I do?  Really? 

                                 COLIN
                                 (sweetly)
                        You’re so crazy. 

           Colin kisses her. 
                    "20 Times"        
                                                                 7-10-08    76.

           INT. ALLY AND COLIN’S HALLWAY -- DAY

           Ally and Colin head up the stairs to their respective 
           apartments.  When they get to their doors it’s awkward.

                                 ALLY
                        So...

                                 COLIN
                        All righty...

           After a moment Bandit and his owner both trot by, going 
           upstairs.  Ally and Colin share a look.  Once the dog lover 
           is past the awkwardness resumes.

                                 ALLY
                        So, I’ll see you.

                                 COLIN
                        Yes you will.

                                 ALLY
                        Okay then.

           Ally goes into her apartment.

           INT. ALLY’S APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS

           Ally enters and the phone rings.  

                                 ALLY
                        Hello?

                                 COLIN (V.O.)
                        Hey.  Just wanted to make sure you 
                        got home safe.

           Ally laughs.

                                 ALLY
                        I was thinking about over ordering 
                        from Charlie Chang’s tonight?  You 
                        in the mood for some tiny spare 
                        ribs?

                                 COLIN
                        Oh.  I’d love to but I have plans 
                        tonight.  How about tomorrow? 

                                 ALLY
                        Okay but tomorrow I might order 
                        just the right amount...
                    "20 Times"        
                                                                 7-10-08    77.

                                 COLIN
                        I’ll take my chances.

           INT. STATIONERY STORE -- DAY

           Ally and Daisy look at a binder of stationery samples with 
           different fonts.

                                 ALLY
                        What is this for again?

                                 DAISY
                        Placecards.

                                 ALLY
                        And what about them?

                                 DAISY
                        I’m trying to pick the right font.

                                 ALLY
                        Okay.  
                                 (then)
                        I’m surprised Eddie didn’t want to 
                        do this with you.  What’s more fun 
                        than this?  Oh, is he having a 
                        rusty fork shoved up his ass? 

                                 DAISY
                        Shut up.  I know this is boring.  
                        Have you talked Mom into coming to 
                        the wedding?

                                 ALLY
                        No.  I don’t have to.  Because I 
                        have an idea.  You’re going to talk 
                        Dad out of coming.

                                 DAISY
                        I am?

                                 ALLY
                        Yeah.  Let’s face it.  He’s only 
                        coming because he thinks you want 
                        him to, so why don’t you let him 
                        off the hook and make everyone 
                        happy.

                                 DAISY
                        All right, I’ll try.  How was D.C.? 

                                 ALLY
                        It was really fun. 
                    "20 Times"        
                                                                 7-10-08    78.

                                 DAISY
                                 (intrigued)
                        Really?  

                                 ALLY
                        No, not because of Tom.  That was 
                        kind of a disaster.  Colin ended up 
                        coming down and we just had a great 
                        time. 

                                 DAISY
                        Wait, Colin?  Your rapey neighbor? 

                                 ALLY
                        Do we call him that?  

                                 DAISY
                        No, I just call him that behind 
                        your back.

                                 ALLY
                        Well, stop because he’s actually a 
                        really nice guy.  

                                 DAISY
                        You’re the one who told me you’ve 
                        seen more women come out of his 
                        apartment than a matinee of the 
                        Vagina Monologues.

                                 ALLY
                        I know but...

                                 DAISY
                        Oh shit, Ally. 

                                 ALLY
                        What?  

                                 DAISY
                        You slept with him. 

                                 ALLY
                        I did not. 

                                 DAISY
                        Good.  Don’t.  He’s exactly the 
                        kind of guy you’ve been trying to 
                        avoid and I don’t want you to get 
                        hurt.

                        another book?

                                 ALLY
                        You’re killing me.

           INT. ALLY’S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           Ally is at her table working on an unfinished sculpture: a 
           colorful scene of various New Yorkers eating at Nathan’s.

           She hears Colin’s door open and tiptoes to the peephole to 
           check it out.  He looks too handsome.  Where is he going?

           After a moment she makes a decision she’s not proud of.  She 
           grabs her keys and exits.  

           EXT. ALLY’S BUILDING -- MOMENTS LATER

           She runs out of the building and looks to see which way Colin 
           went.  After spotting him, she begins to follow.  

           EXT. COFFEE SHOP -- LATER

           Ally peeks through the window of the coffee shop and sees 
           Colin sitting in the back with a voluptuous blonde.  Ally 
           shakes her head and walks away.  

           INT. ALLY AND COLIN’S HALLWAY -- MORNING

           Ally knocks on Colin’s door and he opens it.

                                 COLIN
                        Hey, there.  

           Ally casually peers over his shoulder, scoping out the 
           apartment.  

                                 ALLY
                        Hi.  Can I come in? 

                                 COLIN
                        Sure.

           INT. COLIN’S APARTMENT

                                 ALLY
                        So, remember you said you found 
                        Nate?  Can I have his number?

                                 COLIN
                        Seriously?
                    "20 Times"        
                                                                 7-10-08    80.

                                 ALLY
                        Yeah.

                                 COLIN
                        Why?

                                 ALLY
                        Because I want to call him.  

                                 COLIN
                                 (taken aback)
                        Oh, okay. 

                                 ALLY
                        Is that a problem?

                                 COLIN
                        No.  I’m just surprised. We almost 
                        has sex the other night. I thought--

                                 ALLY
                        Yeah well, you almost have sex with 
                        a lot of people.

                                 COLIN
                        That’s not true.  Normally I close 
                        the deal.

                                 ALLY
                        You don’t take anything seriously 
                        do you?  You’re a musician who 
                        never has a gig and a guy who never 
                        has a second date.

                                 COLIN
                        Whoa.  Why are you being such a 
                        bitch?  What the fuck happened?

                                 ALLY
                        Nothing happened.  You’re dating.  
                        I’m dating.

                                 COLIN
                        What are you talking about?

                                 ALLY
                        I saw you with that woman last 
                        night.

                                 COLIN
                        Last night?  That wasn’t a date.  
                        That was for work. 
                    "20 Times"        
                                                                 7-10-08    81.

                                 ALLY
                        Fine, whatever.

                                 COLIN
                        What do you mean, fine whatever?  
                        Don’t you believe me?

                                 ALLY
                        It doesn’t matter.  You’re not the 
                        kind of guy I’m supposed to end up 
                        with anyway. 

                                 COLIN
                                 (hurt)
                        Really?  What kind of guy am I, 
                        Ally?

                                 ALLY
                        You’re the kind of guy you date 
                        before you meet the guy you’re 
                        going to end up with.  And I’ve 
                        already dated twenty of you.  

                                 COLIN
                        I see.  So, what are you going to 
                        do?  Marry Nate so you don’t have 
                        to go over twenty and move back to 
                        Long Island where your mom can brag 
                        about you to people who don’t give 
                        a shit about your happiness anyway? 

                                 ALLY
                        Calling Nate has nothing to do with 
                        my mom or anyone else.  It’s what I 
                        want. 

                                 COLIN
                        How the fuck would you know what 
                        you want?  You’re so busy working 
                        in jobs you don’t like and dressing 
                        in clothes you don’t wear you don’t 
                        even know who the fuck you are. 

           Colin exits slamming the door behind him.  She opens it. 

                                 ALLY
                        I know who I am.  I’m someone who’s 
                        not going to let another 
                        undeserving asshole into my heart.  
                        Or my vagina.  

                                 NEIGHBOR (O.S.)
                        Shut the fuck up!

                        Stop fucking your dog! 

           She slams her door.  He slams his.   

           INT. ALLY’S APARTMENT -- BEDROOM

           Ally sits on her bed holding the phone.  She steels herself 
           and then dials.  

                                 ALLY
                        Hey, Nate Sterling.  It’s Ally.  
                        Ally Darling.  From high school.  
                        And after high school sometimes.  
                        Anyway, I came across your number 
                        and just thought, wow, I should 
                        call Nate... and leave a long 
                        rambling message on his answering 
                        machine.  Anyway, I’d love to catch 
                        up.  You can reach me at 917 494---
                                 (Ally hiccups)
                        Oh god.  I just hiccuped.  Um, It’s 
                        91--
                                 (hiccup)
                        Oh boy.  Okay.  
                                 (really fast)
                        It’s 9174940336.  Bye. 

           She hangs up the phone and hiccups. 

                                 ALLY (CONT’D)
                        Perfect. 

           INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT -- NIGHT

           Daisy sits at a table set for four.  Ally approaches.  

                                 ALLY
                        Not again.  Who’s the surprise 
                        guest this time? 

                                 DAISY
                        Originally I was supposed to have 
                        dinner with Dad to tell him he 
                        didn’t have to come to the wedding, 
                        but then he said he was bringing 
                        Jacinda--

                                 ALLY
                        Jacinda?
                    "20 Times"        
                                                                 7-10-08    83.

                                 DAISY
                        Yes.  And I couldn’t have that 
                        conversation with him in front of 
                        his new girlfriend, so I thought it 
                        would be easier if we did it 
                        together.   

                                 ALLY
                        You mean if I did it?  

                                 DAISY
                        Yes.  

                                 ALLY
                        I’m never meeting you for dinner 
                        again.

           Just then their father, TERRY, 65, enters with an exotic 
           beauty, JACINDA, 35.  

                                 ALLY (CONT’D)
                        Oh my god, that’s Jacinda?  She’s 
                        so young and... beautiful. 

                                 DAISY
                        Did he get rich and not tell us 
                        about it?

                                 ALLY
                        Or maybe he has a really large--

                                 DAISY
                        Stop.  That’s disgusting. 

           Terry and Jacinda arrive at the table.  

                                 TERRY
                        Ally, I didn’t know you were 
                        coming.  What a nice surprise.  Now 
                        you can both meet Jacinda. 

                                 JACINDA
                        It’s so nice to meet you girls.  
                        Terry’s told me so much about you.  

           Jacinda has a sexy, exotic accent to go with her sexy, exotic 
           body.  

                                 ALLY / DAISY
                        You too.  

           Terry notices Ally checking her iPhone.

                                 TERRY
                        You got one of these too?  I got 
                        them for us so we can text.  

                                 JACINDA
                        He loves to text.  

                                 TERRY
                        I don’t just use it to text, I like 
                        to download music.  You girls like 
                        to download music?

                                 ALLY / DAISY
                        Yes, Dad.  

                                 JACINDA
                        He has such great taste in music. 

                                 DAISY
                        He does?  Is he still into Dan 
                        Fogelberg? 

                                 JACINDA
                        Who?

                                 DAISY
                        You have such a beautiful accent, 
                        where are you from?

                        She’s Swedish and Jamaican.  Nice 
                        combo, huh? 

                                 JACINDA
                        So Daisy, your dad is so excited 
                        about this wedding.  It’s all he 
                        can text about.  

           Ally and Daisy exchange a look.  

                                 TERRY
                        I just can’t wait to introduce her 
                        to the whole family.  

                                 DAISY
                                 (to Jacinda)
                        Oh, so you’re coming too.  That’s 
                        great.  

                                 TERRY
                        What do you mean?  She wouldn’t 
                        miss it.  She already got a dress.  
                        You should see her in it.  Wowie.

                        Ally, you got a date?  ‘Cause if 
                        not, Jacinda can fix you up.  She 
                        has the touch.

           INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT BATHROOM -- LATER

           Ally and Daisy wash their hands.  

                                 DAISY
                        Well, now what am I going to do?  
                        Not only is Dad coming to my 
                        wedding, he’s bringing our new 
                        mommy. 

           Ally checks her phone. 

                                 DAISY (CONT’D)
                        Ally, this is a disaster.  Why do 
                        you keep checking your phone?  

                                 ALLY
                        I called Nate Sterling a couple of 
                        days ago but he’s not calling me 
                        back.  

                                 DAISY
                        Nate Sterling?  From high school?  
                        When is this thing going to be 
                        over?

                                 ALLY
                        Soon.  That the problem.  I’m 
                        running out of options.  If I’m 
                        going to find the one, I’m going to 
                        have to broaden my search. 

                                 DAISY
                        I really need you to focus on this. 

                                 ALLY
                        Sorry.  I will, I promise.  As soon 
                        as I get back from Denver.

           EXT. SIDE OF A MOUNTAIN -- ANOTHER DAY

           CLOSE ON a man’s butt, clad in lycra shorts and a rapelling 
           harness, as he scales the side of a rock.

           WIDEN to reveal Ally, climbing behind him.

                                 MOUNTAIN MAN
                                 (calling down to Ally)
                        How you doing down there?

                                 ALLY
                                 (perky)
                        Great!

           Ally suddenly falls out of frame.

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET -- DAY

           Ally walks, balancing coffee, the newspaper and her purse, 
           all while talking on the phone, with her arm in a sling. 

                                 ALLY
                        Hey Christine, I was just calling 
                        to see if you ever found Evan 
                        Slater?  

                                                                 INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOME -- SAME TIME

           Christine lies in bed, next to a spray tanned pretty boy.  

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Evan?

           Evan, the pretty boy, looks up.  Christine puts her finger to 
           her mouth, indicating for him to be quiet.  He shrugs then 
           lifts the sheet and checks out her boobs.  

                                 ALLY
                        I’d come out there myself but I’m 
                        kind of low on cash.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Oh, I found him and he’s a real 
                        loser.  Practically homeless.   

                                 ALLY
                        Poor Evan.  That’s so sad--

           Her phone beeps.

                        Oh, I got to go.  
                                 (then)
                        Hello?  Nate?  

           EXT. ROMANTIC ITALIAN RESTAURANT -- GARDEN PATIO -- NIGHT

           Ally, dressed in a twin set and pearls, shares a bottle of 
           wine with Nate, 32, charismatic and handsome with a great 
           head of hair.

                                 NATE
                        You look exactly the same.

                                 ALLY
                        I do?  I was hoping I looked 
                        better...

                                 NATE
                        Ally, do you have any idea how hot 
                        you were in high school?

                                 ALLY
                        No.  No idea.  Tell me.

           Nate laughs.

                                 NATE
                        I’m sorry, I interrupted you.  You 
                        were saying you’re looking for a 
                        job in marketing?  Because I can 
                        get you an interview with my 
                        family’s company.  

                                 ALLY
                        Actually, I was saying I’m at a 
                        crossroads--

                                 NATE
                        Oh yeah?  What else would you do?

                                 ALLY
                        It might sound crazy but I make 
                        these little papier mache miniature 
                        scenes of New York.  They’re hard 
                        to describe.  You kind of need to 
                        see them.

                                 NATE
                        I’d love to.

                                 ALLY
                        Really?  Great.  They’re in my 
                        shower.  

                                 NATE
                        Then I guess we’re done here.

           INT. ALLY’S APARTMENT -- BATHROOM -- LATER

           Ally whips open the shower curtain to reveal her latest 
           sculpture.

                                 ALLY
                        I told you.  This is where they 
                        dry.

           Nate kisses her.

           INT. BRIDAL SALON -- ANOTHER DAY

           Ally sits on a couch beaming outside Daisy’s dressing room.  

                                 ALLY
                        He’s even more handsome than I 
                        remember and he still smells so 
                        fucking clean.  

           Daisy comes out of the dressing room. 

                                 ALLY (CONT’D)
                        What are you wearing?  That’s not 
                        your dress, that is a totally 
                        different dress.

                                 DAISY
                                 (defensive)
                        I know.  I like this one better, 
                        okay?  It’s more comfortable.  
                        There’s room to eat, move, dance.

           Daisy does a crazy little dance.  She is finally losing it.

                                 ALLY
                        Okay.

                                 DAISY
                        I couldn’t breathe in that other 
                        fucking dress.  I should be able to 
                        breathe at my own wedding.  Why 
                        doesn’t anyone want me to breathe?  
                        I mean, I’m just really fucking 
                        stressed out right now.

                        Mom to come to the wedding now that 
                        Dad’s bringing Jacinda?  

                                 ALLY
                        Stop.  I will go with you to talk 
                        to Mom.  You don’t even have to 
                        trick me.  And everybody wants you 
                        to breathe.  So you can breathe in 
                        that dress?

                                 DAISY
                        Yes.

                                 ALLY
                        Then why don’t you do that now.

                                 DAISY
                        Okay.

           Daisy takes a scary, crazy breath.

           INT. METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART -- STERLING WING -- NIGHT

           Yes, his family has it’s own wing at the museum.  Ally and 
           Nate enter the black tie charity event.  The theme is Winter 
           Wonderland and wonderland is an understatement: twinkling 
           lights, champagne, and ballgowns.  Ally looks around in awe.  

                                 NATE
                        I am so sorry about this.  I have 
                        to show up at these events for my 
                        family.  It’s the only downside of 
                        running the foundation.

           A waiter passes and Ally takes a glass of champagne.

                                 ALLY
                        This is a downside?

                                 NATE
                        I’ve just never been a fan of all 
                        the parties and ass kissing.

                        Whose ass are you going to have to 
                        kiss?

                                 NATE
                        Nobody’s.  Everybody’s going to be 
                        kissing mine.

                        I mean, I don’t think half these 
                        people even know what charity 
                        they’re supporting.  They just want 
                        to get their picture in the Sunday 
                        Style section.

                                 (re: the decor)
                        Obviously we’re saving winter 
                        wonderlands.

                        We’ve actually known each other 
                        since high school.  

                                 CLAIRE
                        How cute.  

                                 ALLY
                        He was my prom date.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Nate always had a rebellious 
                        streak.

           Nate and another guest, Stevenson, join them.

                                 NATE
                        Hey, I see you met Claire.  Isn’t 
                        she great?  

                                 ALLY
                        Yeah.  Great.

                                 NATE
                        This is Charlie Stevenson.  He 
                        heads up marketing, so he’s the one 
                        you’re going to be meeting with 
                        next week.

                                 ALLY
                                 (surprised)
                        Oh, hi.  So nice to meet you.

                                 STEVENSON
                        I promise I won’t be this drunk for 
                        our interview.

                                 ALLY
                        Oh, me neither.

           Stevenson fist bumps Nate.

                                 NATE
                        Later, Brother.

           Stevenson walks off.  A photographer approaches.  

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Can I get a picture, Mr. Sterling.

           Ally and Claire flank Nate and smile.  Flash.  Ally pulls 
           Nate away as the photographer continues to shoot Claire and 
           anyone she can grab.

                                 ALLY
                        You didn’t tell me you got me an 
                        interview.

                                 NATE
                        I didn’t?  Oh.  It wasn’t a big 
                        deal.

                                 ALLY
                        And I really appreciate it but 
                        remember, I told you I wasn’t sure--

                                 NATE
                        Wow.  Have I told you how beautiful 
                        you look tonight?  

                                 ALLY
                        Only once.

                                 NATE
                        You look beautiful.  I’m going to 
                        get us some champagne.

           EXT. DARLING FAMILY LONG ISLAND HOME -- DAY

           Ally and Daisy approach the door. 

                                 DAISY
                        Where’s the scarf? 

                                 ALLY
                                 (holding up a box)
                        I’ve got it.  But I don’t think a 
                        scarf is going to make her feel 
                        better about the fact that her ex-
                        husband is bringing a swim suit 
                        model to her daughter’s wedding.  

                                 DAISY
                        You’re right.  Let’s not give it to 
                        her, she might try and hang herself 
                        with it. 

           INT. AVA’S LONG ISLAND HOME -- FOYER -- CONTINUOUS

           Ally and Daisy tentatively enter the foyer.

                                 ALLY
                        Mom?

           Ava enters from the kitchen.  

                                 AVA
                        I can’t believe you.  When were you 
                        planning on telling me about this?  

                                 ALLY
                        Uh... now.

                                 DAISY
                        That’s why we’re here, Mom.  

                                 AVA
                        I had to read about it in the 
                        Sunday style section.  

           Ally and Daisy exchange a confused look.  Ava looks at Ally.

                                 AVA (CONT’D)
                        You and Nate Sterling at the Nature 
                        Conservancy Gala.  Are you an item? 

                                 ALLY
                        Yes.  
                    "20 Times"        
                                                                 7-10-08    93.

                                 AVA
                        Is he coming to the wedding? 

                                 ALLY
                        Actually, he is.  I asked him last 
                        night.

                                 AVA
                        Oh good.  I’m going to put you two 
                        at my table, front and center.  Let 
                        me get the seating chart.

                                 DAISY
                        Wait, so you’re coming?

                                 AVA
                        Of course, I’m coming.  

           Ava runs into the other room.  

                                 DAISY
                        What do we do?  Should we tell her 
                        about Jacinda?

                                 ALLY
                        Are you kidding?  She’s coming to 
                        the wedding.  Let’s just quit while 
                        we’re ahead. 

                                 DAISY
                        What’s going to happen when she 
                        sees them there? 

                                 ALLY
                        She’ll act like everything’s fine 
                        and then drink too much.  It’ll be 
                        fun.  

           INT. ALLY’S APARTMENT -- DAY

           Ally, dressed for her interview, is gathering her keys and 
           purse when an envelope is slipped under her door.  She picks 
           it up and opens the door, catching Colin heading back to his 
           apartment.

                                 ALLY
                        Hey.  Colin.  Hi.

                                 COLIN
                        Hey.  I was just dropping that off.

           Ally looks inside the envelope to find a wad of cash.
                    "20 Times"        
                                                                 7-10-08    94.

                                 ALLY
                        What is this?

                                 COLIN
                        The money you paid me.   

                                 ALLY
                        But you earned it. 

                                 COLIN
                        Hey, knowing that you found the 
                        kind of guy you’re supposed to end 
                        up with is reward enough for a guy 
                        like me. 

           He enters his apartment and slams the door.

           INT. STERLING ENTERPRISES - CORNER OFFICE

           Ally sits in front of Stevenson who peruses her file.

                                 STEVENSON
                        So it says here you spent a few 
                        summers interning at Omni before 
                        you landed your job at Benefits 
                        Marketing Group, but that doesn’t 
                        tell me enough about you.  Who is 
                        Ally Darling?

           Ally realizes she doesn’t know how to answer this question.

           INT. ALLY’S APARTMENT -- EVENING

           Ally, dressed in a sexy top and jeans, answers the door to 
           Nate.

                                 NATE
                        Hello.

                                 ALLY
                        Hi.

                                 NATE
                        We actually need to get going. 

                                 ALLY
                        I’m ready.  Why?  Is something 
                        wrong?

                                 NATE
                        No, you look great, it’s just a 
                        little downtown for this crowd.  
                    "20 Times"        
                                                                 7-10-08    95.

                                 ALLY
                        Oh, okay.  I guess I’ll go change. 

           She goes into her bedroom.  Nate looks at one of her 
           sculptures: a scary looking subway scene.  He locks eyes with 
           the tiny, homeless, papier mache sax player.   

                                 NATE
                        So, what happened today?  Stevenson 
                        said you basically told him you 
                        didn’t want the job. 

                                 ALLY (O.S.)
                        Yeah, I need to talk to you about 
                        that.  

           Ally comes out of the bedroom in the midst of changing.  She 
           has a skirt on over her jeans.  

                                 ALLY (CONT’D)
                        I appreciate your help but it turns 
                        out that marketing’s really not for 
                        me.

                                 NATE
                        So, what are you going to do?  
                                 (re: sculptures)
                        This?

                                 ALLY
                        Well, yeah.  I realize I might not 
                        make any money at first, or ever, 
                        but I’ll never know if I don’t try.  
                        And in the meantime, if I have to 
                        get a day job I’d rather work at a 
                        gallery or help out another artist, 
                        something inspiring.

                                 NATE
                        I really went out on a limb getting 
                        you that interview, maybe you could 
                        have told me all this before. 

                                 ALLY
                        Actually, I tried to tell you I 
                        wasn’t sure, but you kept 
                        interrupting me.  And granted it 
                        was always with a compliment, but 
                        still you weren’t listening.  

                                 NATE
                        Can we just talk about this in the 
                        car?  We’re late and you have a 
                        skirt over your jeans. 
                    "20 Times"        
                                                                 7-10-08    96.

           Ally takes a deep breath. 

                                 ALLY
                        Nate, I don’t think I can make this 
                        work.  

                                 NATE
                        It might look fine if you just take 
                        off the jeans.  

                                 ALLY
                        No, I mean us. 

           INT. ALLY’S APARTMENT -- DAY

           Ally lies in bed in her pajamas.  It looks like she’s been 
           there for a few days.  Teary, she watches Tootsie on TV.  

           ON TV:  Dustin Hoffman walks through Central Park and pushes 
           over a mime.  

           Ally and Michael Dorsey are both at their low points.

           Her phone rings.  She makes no move to answer it, letting the 
           machine pick up.  

                                 DAISY (V.O.)
                        Where’ve you been?  Call me.  I 
                        want to take you out to lunch.  It 
                        will just be me I swear.  And Mom.  
                        I’m kidding, but seriously we need 
                        to talk to her, she’s really pissed 
                        off about the font--

           The machine cuts her off.   

                                 MACHINE (V.O.)
                        Memory full. 

           Ally plays her messages.

                        Hey Sweetheart, it’s Dad.  I’ve 
                        been texting you.  Jacinda’s single 
                        brother is in town.

                        He’d love to come to the wedding if 
                        you still don’t have a date.  Text 
                        me. 

           Ally deletes the message and turns off the machine.  She 
           picks up her iPhone and reads and deletes Terry’s texts.  She 
           accidentally pushes the photo button and is confronted by a 
           picture of Colin, in D.C., naked next to Eleanor Roosevelt.  
           She begins scrolling through, revisiting the last time she 
           was truly happy.

           INT. ALLY’S APARTMENT 

           Ally sits at the table, totally engrossed, working on her new 
           sculpture:  A tiny, naked, papier mache Colin sitting on a 
           bigger papier mache Lincoln’s lap.

           INT. JET FUEL COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           Ally looks on as Greg, the owner, hangs her Nathan’s 
           sculpture on the wall.  He steps back to admire it.

           Ally, Ava and a few other bridesmaids, Jamie, Katie, Valerie 
           and Eileen, help Daisy into her dress.  It doesn’t quite fit.  

                                 AVA
                                 (to Daisy)
                        Honey, your dress doesn’t fit.  

                                 ALLY
                        Shh.  She looks great. 

           Ally struggles with the zipper.

                        Can I get some help here?

                                 DAISY
                        Where’s my croissandwich?  Who ate 
                        it?

                                 ALLY

           They start frantically scouring the room looking for it, even 
           looking under cushions.

                        Guys, I don’t think it’s in the 
                        couch.

           Just then KAREN, the pinched and controlling hotel wedding 
           coordinator, rushes in as if her ass is on fire.

                                 KAREN
                        Okay, listen, I don’t want anyone 
                        to panic, but--

                        What’s happening?!

                                 KAREN
                        The harpist isn’t coming.

                                 DAISY
                        I had a harpist?

                                 AVA
                        Of course.

                                 KAREN
                        She broke her finger during the 
                        philharmonic softball league 
                        playoffs.  And given that this is 
                        one of the busiest wedding weekends 
                        of the year, all the other harpists 
                        are booked.  

                                 AVA
                        Oh Christ.

                                 KAREN
                        But I have a list of all the other 
                        weddings happening in the city and 
                        found a replacement who can be here 
                        as soon as her first wedding is 
                        over.  So if she’s a little late, 
                        that’s why.  And if she doesn’t 
                        show, I’ve got a flautist in my 
                        back pocket.

                        So, as soon as the ceremony is 
                        over, I’m going to want the entire 
                        bridal party to hang back while the 
                        other guests go to the cocktail 
                        hour.

                                 (to Ally)
                        Nate knows to join us for pictures, 
                        right?  

                                 ALLY
                        Actually, Nate’s not here.  

                                 AVA
                        Why not?

                                 ALLY
                        Because... we’re not seeing each 
                        other anymore.

                                 AVA

                                 (pulling herself together)
                        Okay.  Okay.  That’s okay.

                        Are you sure, Mom?

                                 AVA
                        Yup.  

                                 KAREN
                        All right, ladies.  Let’s get this 
                        girl married.

                                 KATIE
                        Oh my god, it’s so exciting!

           A flautist plays as the guests trickle in and take their 
           seats.

           INT. WALDORF-ASTORIA -- BALLROOM (SIDE ANTEROOM) -- SAME TIME

           The entire bridal party, including groomsmen, is crammed into 
           a tiny room waiting for Karen to give them the go ahead.  Ava 
           peeks through the door.

                        Ooh, the Hochmans are here.  The 
                        McGurks.  Jeannie looks good.  Oh, 
                        and there’s your father.

           Ally and Daisy reach for each other’s hands and hold on 
           tight.

                        Who’s that woman?  Is he with that 
                        woman?  Did he bring a date to your 
                        wedding?  An inappropriately young 
                        date?

                                 ALLY
                        I don’t know but I guess the 
                        harpist isn’t coming.

                                 KAREN
                        Okay, it’s time.  

           Karen taps the first pair of attendants to walk down the 
           aisle.

                        And go.

           Karen counts quietly to herself and taps the next pair.

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        And go...

           INT. WALDORF-ASTORIA -- BALLROOM

           The procession is in progress.  Ally enters on the arm of her 
           groomsman and proudly walks down the aisle.  She takes her 
           place at the front of the room.

           Ally watches as Ava walks Daisy down the aisle.  Ava has a 
           huge fake smile on her face but when she spots Terry and 
           Jacinda the smile fades and her grip on Daisy’s arm tightens.  
           Daisy looks to Ally for help.  

           Ally sees that Eddie is looking at Daisy adoringly.  She 
           indicates with her eyes that Daisy should ignore Ava and look 
           at Eddie.  

           Daisy does and her stress melts away.  She reaches the front 
           of the room and takes Eddie’s hand.

                        Welcome.  We are gathered here 
                        today to celebrate the union of 
                        Daisy Ann Darling and Edward 
                        Michael Vogel.  As most of you 
                        know, these two have a turbulent 
                        history.  In fact, if you told 
                        Daisy ten years ago that she was 
                        going to marry Eddie Vogel, she 
                        would have, and I quote, ‘thrown up 
                        on you’.  

           The congregation laughs.

                        Obviously, a lot has changed.  And 
                        that change is a testament to 
                        Daisy’s trusting nature, Eddie’s 
                        commitment to being his best self, 
                        and their shared belief that 
                        anything is possible.    

           Ally takes this in as we...

                                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. WALDORF-ASTORIA -- BALLROOM -- A LITTLE LATER

                                 OFFICIANT
                        ... So, Daisy and Eddie, may your 
                        life continue to be filled with 
                        many more pleasant surprises.  I’m 
                        finally done talking, so please 
                        share your first kiss as husband 
                        and wife.  

           Everybody stands and claps as Daisy and Eddie kiss.   Ally 
           looks on with tears of joy in her eyes.  The crowd continues 
           to clap as Daisy and Eddie walk back down the aisle followed 
           by the rest of the wedding party.  

           INT. BALLROOM ENTRANCE AREA -- MOMENTS LATER

           The guests file out of the ballroom and make their way 
           towards the cocktail area as Karen and the photographer try 
           to wrangle the wedding party.  Ally hugs Daisy.

                        You did it.  You’re Mrs. Vogel.

                        I can’t believe your father brought 
                        a date.  She can’t be more than 
                        thirty.  What will people think?  

                                 ALLY
                        Mom, let’s talk about this later.  
                        The photographer needs us. 

                                 AVA
                        Fine.  

           Ava calls to a guest standing with her twenty year-old son. 

                                 AVA (CONT’D)
                        Debbie, bring Benji over here.  

           Debbie and Benji join them.  

                                 AVA (CONT’D)
                        Benji, sweetheart, would you stand 
                        next to Ally in the pictures so it 
                        doesn’t look like she’s alone? 

                                 BENJI
                        Sure. 

                                 ALLY
                        What?  No.  I don’t need anyone to 
                        stand next to me.  Thanks anyway, 
                        Benji.  

           He starts to go.  

                                 AVA
                        No, Benji, wait.  Ally, it’s just 
                        for the pictures.  It will look so 
                        much better--

                                 ALLY
                        Mom, I’m here alone because I 
                        wanted to be.  I don’t care how it 
                        looks.  And I’m surprised that you 
                        do.  

                                 AVA
                        Ally, please. 

                                 ALLY
                        I thought today you would be so 
                        happy that for once you wouldn’t 
                        care what people think.  
                   "20 Times"        
                                                                7-10-08    103.

                                 BENJI
                        I’ll catch up to you at the 
                        reception. 

           Benji steps away.  A group of guests have gathered to listen. 

                                 ALLY
                        But since you’re so concerned, let 
                        me tell you what I think they’re 
                        thinking, if they’re thinking about 
                        us at all.  They’re probably 
                        thinking Dad’s here with a date 
                        that’s way too hot for him, the 
                        ceremony was about five minutes too 
                        long--

                                 DAISY
                                 (to Eddie)
                        I knew it. 

                                 ALLY
                        And Daisy’s wacky sister is here 
                        alone.  Because that’s the reality 
                        of the situation, Mom.  That’s what 
                        is.  And you know what else is?  
                        I’m a jobless whore who’s slept 
                        with twenty guys and may sleep with 
                        twenty more. 

                                 DAISY
                        And I’m pregnant!  

                                 BENJI
                        And I prefer to be called Benjamin! 

                                 ALLY
                        So, there you have it.
                                 (pointing to each person)
                        Alone.  Pregnant.  Benjamin.  Deal 
                        with it.  
                                 (to Daisy)
                        Oh my god.  You’re pregnant!  

           They hug as Ava sinks into a chair, devastated.  

                                 AVA
                        I’m going to be a grandmother. 

           INT. WALDORF-ASTORIA -- RECEPTION BALLROOM -- A LITTLE LATER

           Ally is enjoying the attention of about five different guys, 
           all of whom heard her yell that she was a whore.  A sixth guy 
           comes over and brings her a drink.
                   "20 Times"        
                                                                7-10-08    104.

                                 ALLY
                        Thank you.  I appreciate the 
                        drink...
                                 (then, to guy behind her)
                        And the shoulder massage, but I was 
                        joking earlier when I said I might 
                        sleep with twenty more guys.

           Shoulder massage guy gives up and walks away.  Daisy 
           approaches.

                                 ALLY (CONT’D)
                        How’s Mom?

                                 DAISY
                        I think Dad’s dancing is making it 
                        easier for her.

           Ally looks to the dance floor.  Terry dances with Jacinda, 
           exuberantly busting out moves he’s been saving since the 
           seventies.

                                 ALLY
                        Aw.  I’m proud he doesn’t care how 
                        stupid he looks.  They’re happy.

           Ally feels a tap on her shoulder.  It’s Benji.

                                 BENJI
                        Dance with me or I’ll have to dance 
                        with my mom.

                                 ALLY
                        Come on.

           On the dance floor, Ally surveys the happy couples around her 
           as she dances with the awkward twenty year-old.

                                 BENJI
                                 (sotto)
                        I’ve got some weed.  Wanna get 
                        high?

                                 ALLY
                        No thanks, Benjamin.

           The band begins a new song.  It’s “Three Times A Lady.”  Ally 
           smiles.

                                 ALLY (CONT’D)
                        They’re playing Lionel Ritchie.

                                 BENJI
                        Nicole Ritchie’s dad?
                   "20 Times"        
                                                                7-10-08    105.

                                 ALLY
                        Will you excuse me?

           INT. WALDORF-ASTORIA -- HALLWAY

           Ally is on her cell.

                                 ALLY
                        Hey Colin, it’s Ally.  Um... Where 
                        are you?

                                 COLIN (V.O.)
                        I’m uptown.  Why?

                                 ALLY
                        I just want to talk to you.  What’s 
                        all that noise in the background?

                                 COLIN (V.O.)
                        I’m at a wedding.

                                 ALLY
                        Really?  Who do you know that’s 
                        getting married?

                                 COLIN (V.O.)
                        Nobody.  Not only do I not know how 
                        to make a commitment, I don’t even 
                        socialize with people who do.

                                 ALLY
                        No, I didn’t mean it like--

           He’s hung up.  Ally sees Karen down the hall, berating a 
           waiter.  Ally rushes over.

                                 ALLY (CONT’D)
                        Karen, where’s that list you had of 
                        all the other weddings going on in 
                        the city today?

                                 KAREN
                        Oh, it’s right--

           Ally snatches it and runs.

           EXT. WALDORF-ASTORIA -- ENTRANCE

           Ally bursts out the double doors, list in hand, and sprints 
           down the street.  Three steps in she trips over the hem of 
           her bridesmaids dress.  She gets back on her feet, hikes up 
           the dress, and keeps running.
                   "20 Times"        
                                                                7-10-08    106.

           INT. PIERRE HOTEL -- LOBBY

           Ally enters and tries to catch her breath as she approaches 
           the ballroom.

           INT. PIERRE HOTEL -- BALLROOM

           Ally makes her way through a sea of wedding guests scanning 
           the crowd for Colin.  No luck.

           EXT. FIFTH AVENUE

           Ally hauls ass up the street, weaving through pedestrians.  
           She gets stuck behind a line of third-graders on a field 
           trip, holding hands and waiting to cross the street.  Ally 
           has to pry two of their hands apart to get through but once 
           on the other side she puts their hands back together and 
           continues running.

           INT. THE CARLYLE -- BALLROOM

           Ally bursts in to another reception.  The guests are 
           primarily Asian American.  She quickly deduces that the three 
           Caucasian people there aren’t Colin. 

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK   

           Ally cuts through the park, heading for Central Park South, 
           list still in hand.  

           She rounds a corner and is immediately confronted by a dog 
           walker with seven dogs on long leashes.  Ally veers left, 
           then right, but inevitably gets tangled up and falls into a 
           pile of fur.

           She finally extricates herself and continues on her mission.

           INT. THE RITZ CARLTON -- BALLROOM

           Ally enters, now beginning to look a little ragged.  She 
           looks around and makes her way to the bar.

                                 ALLY
                                 (out of breath)
                        Water, please.  No ice.

           Ally downs the water and looks from table to table.  She 
           doesn’t see Colin but she does catch the eye of the groom, 
           who sits at the head table.  It’s Disgusting Donald.  
                   "20 Times"        
                                                                7-10-08    107.

           She gives him a friendly wave.  He gives her a quizzical 
           look.  She quickly heads for the exit.

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK -- BOATHOUSE

           Ally limps towards the entrance, shoes in hand.

           INT. BOATHOUSE PAVILION

           Ally enters, her bridesmaid dress looking a little worse for 
           wear, and once again scans the crowd.  And once again, 
           there’s no Colin.  Sweaty, discouraged, and thoroughly 
           exhausted, Ally turns to go.  

           The band begins to play.  Ally stops in her tracks when she 
           hears the singer’s voice.  It sounds familiar.  Could it be?  
           She slowly turns back.  It is.  There, on stage, is Colin.  
           He’s the lead singer and guitarist of the wedding band.

           Thinking fast, she grabs a glass of champagne and a cocktail 
           napkin from a passing waiter and walks towards the stage, 
           grabbing a spoon along way.  

           As she moves towards the front of the room, she sees the 
           bride and recognizes her as the voluptuous blonde who Colin 
           met the morning Ally followed him.  

           The band finishes their song and Ally bounds up onto the 
           stage, clinking her glass.  Colin turns and sees her for the 
           first time.  He’s confused and happy -- but mostly confused.  

                                 COLIN
                        Ally?

           Ally ignores him and continues clinking, quieting the room.  
           She takes the mic.

                                 ALLY
                        Hey everybody!  I thought it was 
                        time to give the band a break and 
                        get the toasts started.

           The guests clap tentatively while the bride and groom 
           exchange a look.

                                 ALLY (CONT’D)
                        First, on behalf of...

           Ally refers to the personalized cocktail napkin in her hand.
                   "20 Times"        
                                                                7-10-08    108.

                                 ALLY (CONT’D)
                        ...Michelle and Doug, I want to 
                        welcome all the out of town guests.

           The guests clap.  So do Doug and Michelle.

                                 ALLY (CONT’D)
                        And I also want to thank Michelle’s 
                        parents for hosting such a lovely 
                        affair.  This is by far the most 
                        beautiful wedding I’ve been to 
                        today.

           Everyone chuckles.

                                 ALLY (CONT’D)
                        But most importantly I’d like to 
                        ask the father of the bride to come 
                        up here and say few words about his 
                        little girl.

                                 COLIN
                                 (sotto)
                        Charlie.

                                 ALLY
                        Where are you, Charlie?

           More applause.  Charlie smiles like he’s just won something 
           and heads to the stage.

                                 COLIN
                                 (sotto)
                        What are you doing?

                                 ALLY
                                 (sotto)
                        I told you I needed to talk.

           Ally passes the mic to Charlie, who gives her a kiss on the 
           cheek.

           EXT. BOATHOUSE -- DOCK

           Ally stands on the dock looking at the water.  Colin joins 
           her.

                                 COLIN
                        Where’s Nate?

                                 ALLY
                        We broke up.  I stopped trying to 
                        make a bad thing work.
                   "20 Times"

                                 COLIN
                        Good for you.

                                 ALLY
                        Colin, I’m sorry. 

                                 COLIN
                        It’s okay--

                                 ALLY
                        No, listen.  All this time I 
                        thought my relationships never 
                        worked because I only dated 
                        assholes.  But you know what I 
                        realized?  Sometimes I was the 
                        asshole.  I kept getting into 
                        relationships for the wrong 
                        reasons.  But now I know what I 
                        want and I’m not afraid of it.  
                        Well, that’s not true, I’m 
                        terrified.  But terrified is good, 
                        right?

                                 COLIN
                        I think so.

                                 ALLY
                        Good because you terrify me.

                                 COLIN
                        You terrify me, too.

           A moment.

                                 ALLY
                        Why didn’t you tell me you were in 
                        a wedding band?

                                 COLIN
                        Because I was embarrassed.  I was 
                        supposed to be a real musician and 
                        instead I play Lionel Richie two to 
                        three times a week.

                                 ALLY
                        But that’s my new favorite thing 
                        about you.  If it makes you feel 
                        any better I was supposed to be 
                        V.P. of a mid-size corporation with 
                        two kids and a French husband by 
                        the time I was thirty.
                   "20 Times"        
                                                                7-10-08    110.

                                 COLIN
                        Things don’t really turn out how 
                        you plan, huh?

                                 ALLY
                        No, they turn out better.  I think 
                        I love you, Twenty-One.

           Colin kisses her.

                                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. ALLY’S APARTMENT -- BEDROOM -- MORNING

           Ally and Colin lie in each other’s arms.  The phone rings and 
           Ally lets the machine get it.  

                                 JAY (V.O.)
                        Hey Ally, it’s Jay from Club Med 
                        Turkoise.  I got a message from 
                        your assistant and I just wanted to 
                        tell you, we didn’t actually sleep 
                        together.  I mean, I finger banged 
                        you, we did oral, I think I spanked 
                        you, but you passed out in the 
                        shower and I’m a gentleman, so, you 
                        know, we didn’t do it.  Take care.

           He hangs up.  Ally jumps up and down on the bed, pointing at 
           Colin.

                                 ALLY
                                 (sing song)
                        You’re number twenty!  I’m still at 
                        twenty!  You’re number twenty!

           He tackles her and kisses her and we...

                                                                      FADE OUT.
