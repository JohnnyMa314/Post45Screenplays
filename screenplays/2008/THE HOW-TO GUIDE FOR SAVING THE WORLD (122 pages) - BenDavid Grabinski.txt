           MITCHELL MCBRIDE (40). A gruff, self-absorbed, and cocky 
           military type. He’s sitting in a metal chair across from a 
           MAN WE CAN’T SEE. The UNSEEN MAN’S voice is off. Strange. It 
           sends a chill down our spine --

           -- but McBride isn’t scared. Huh. Maybe we should be worried 
           about this guy.

                                 COLD MALE VOICE
                        You’re our man.

                                 MCBRIDE
                        Good choice. I didn’t think I asked for 
                        that much, to be perfectly honest.

                                 COLD MALE VOICE
                        We found your request to be both modest 
                        and appropriate.

                                 MCBRIDE
                        I assume you killed the other crews.

                                 COLD MALE VOICE
                        Of course.

                                 MCBRIDE
                        What did they try to get?

                                 COLD MALE VOICE
                        An island. One asked for Bolivia.

                                 MCBRIDE
                        I don’t even know where the fuck that is. 
                        Doesn’t even sound like a country. Sounds 
                        like a kind of cheese.

                                 COLD MALE VOICE
                        Do you understand what’s been asked of 
                        you?

                                 MCBRIDE
                        Completely. You don’t have to worry about 
                        me.
                (beat)
                        And to clarify, the deal is we’ll be 
                        spared, right?

                                 COLD MALE VOICE
                        Yes. All your men shall live.

                                 MCBRIDE
                        Uh, men? You know, there are a few women 
                        in my crew.
                                                      (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                 COLD MALE VOICE
                        This is of no concern to us.

                                 MCBRIDE
                        I just thought you’d be worried about an 
                        Adam and Eve thing.

                                 COLD MALE VOICE
                        Adam and Eve?

                                 MCBRIDE
                        You know, lived in the garden. First 
                        people to fuck.
                (no response)
                        It doesn’t really matter.

                                 COLD MALE VOICE
                        The gear is in those crates...
                (beat)
                        ...and the countdown has begun.

           We hear a ZAP and PULL BACK to reveal that whoever he was 
           talking to is now gone. Only a cloud of BLUE SMOKE remains. 

           McBride approaches a FEW DOZEN METAL CRATES. He presses a 
           BUTTON on one, we hear a BEEP, and then it opens to reveal --

                                 MCBRIDE
                        Holy. Shit.

           -- it’s filled with WEAPONS. This is technology we, or he, 
           has never seen before. We SMASH CUT to BLACK and the TITLE:

               THE HOW-TO GUIDE FOR SAVING THE WORLD

           A HALF-EMPTY BOTTLE OF CLAMATO

           Sitting on a kitchen counter.

           INT. SYLVESTER’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - MORNING

           SYLVESTER DANTE (30) is nursing a glass filled with a red 
           liquid, presumably Clamato, while going through his mail. The 
           apartment is sparse, except for several moving boxes. There’s 
           a sadness to Sylvester’s actions and gestures.

           INT. SYLVESTER’S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Sylvester’s door opens and he enters the hallway. A MALE 
           NEIGHBOR and a FEMALE NEIGHBOR are mid-conversation:

                                 MALE NEIGHBOR (O.S.)
                        Don’t touch it, honey.
                                                        (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                 FEMALE NEIGHBOR (O.S.)
                        Relax. I didn’t touch it. I don’t plan on 
                        touching it. It’s not on my “to do” list.

           Sylvester is unfamiliar with his NEW KEYS. It takes him a 
           moment to figure out which one is right and lock the door. He 
           turns to see the source of the voices --

           -- and stops in his tracks. The whole world stops. It’s not 
           the guy that catches his attention, it’s the female neighbor. 

           She’s the most beautiful thing he’s ever seen. She’s not a 
           model or an unattainable beauty; she’s the kind of gorgeous 
           you could run into on the street. If you’re lucky.

           As he’s staring at her longer than he probably should...

           ...she catches his eye and stares back. 

           It’s an INCREDIBLY AWKWARD MOMENT.

                                 FEMALE NEIGHBOR (CONT’D)
                (points at her lip)
                        You have a V8 mustache.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Uh...
                (wipes it off)
                        It’s not V8. 
                (beat)
                        It’s Clamato.

           They stare at each other for a moment without responding. 
           Sylvester clumsily turns around and heads for the stairs.

           INT. OFFICE WAITING AREA - DAY

           Sylvester and RODNEY DANTE (40), his brother and mediocre 
           lawyer, are standing and waiting outside a room. A YOUNG 
           FEMALE INTERN walks past Sylvester.

                                 RODNEY 
                        How about that? Yay or nay?

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Not my type.

           A SCANDALOUSLY DRESSED SECRETARY walks past. Rodney looks at 
           Sylvester. Sylvester shakes his head.

                                 RODNEY
                        What’s wrong with her?
                                                                      (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                 SYLVESTER
                        I don’t know. She just looks...dirty.

                                 RODNEY
                        “Christina Aguilera dirty” or “gas 
                        station bathroom dirty?”

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Is there a difference?

                                 RODNEY
                        Touche, salesman. Touche.
                (beat)
                        Look, anyone with half a dick is going to 
                        give you the same advice. At this moment, 
                        while we’re here waiting, I’m not just 
                        your big brother. I’m not just your 
                        lawyer. I’m your amigo. I’m you’re 
                        shrink. And me, I’m telling you this...
                (beat)
                        You’re bitter now, but time heals all 
                        poon.

           Sylvester LAUGHS quietly to himself and thinks for a moment.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Well, there is this one girl, my 
                        neighbor...

           Sylvester gets quiet. Passionate. But a little embarrassed.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        She’s the most beautiful woman I’ve ever 
                        seen.
                (beat)
                        Look, I’m not saying like, if they did a 
                        study...or scientifically crunched some 
                        numbers...they’d prove that she’s the 
                        most beautiful woman on the planet. What 
                        I’m saying is she looks exactly like I 
                        wish all women would look.
                (beat)
                        From now on, if someone says, “what’s 
                        your type?” I can just point at this girl 
                        and say, “that’s it. That’s my type.”

                                 RODNEY
                        Sounds like quite a girl. Visually.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Yeah, but she’s living with a dude. I’m 
                        not sure if they’re dating, engaged, or 
                        married. But it’s one of the three.
                                                   (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                 RODNEY
                        The first girl you go after is 
                        unavailable? That’s the opposite of a 
                        good idea.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        I never said I’m going after her. That’s 
                        not my style.

                                 RODNEY
                        Then what is your style?

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Talking about what I want until I’ve 
                        annoyed everyone around me...then 
                        eventually doing nothing about it.

           A SECRETARY (25) leans out into the hallway.

                                 SECRETARY
                        They’ll see you now.

           As he’s about to go in:

                                 SYLVESTER
                        You weren’t going to charge me for that 
                        conversation were you?

                                 RODNEY
                        No, of course not. I’m blood.
                (thinks it over)
                        Well, I was going to. But I won’t now.

           INT. ARBITRATION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Sylvester, Rodney, LESLEY (30), his soon-to-be-ex-wife, and 
           HER LAWYER sit around a boardroom style table across from an 
           ARBITER. Sylvester looks nauseous.

                                 ARBITER
                        What are your reasons for seeking a 
                        divorce?

                                 LESLEY
                        He’s a pussy.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        I’m not sure that’s a legal term.

                                 HER LAWYER
                        I think what she means to say is Mr. 
                        Fincher is a nice guy, a gentleman.

                        I meant he’s a vagina.

                                 RODNEY
                (flustered)
                        Your honor...arbiter, I think someone 
                        should order lunch because we’re going to 
                        be here a long...

                                 SYLVESTER
                (interrupts him)
                        Look, I know we had a battle plan, but 
                        I’ve been thinking it over...

                                 RODNEY
                        Sylvester, what are you doing?

                                 SYLVESTER
                (ignores him, to Lesley)
                        Lesley, you can have the house, my car, 
                        and the cat.

                                 LESLEY
                        You see what I mean? 
                (points at Sylvester)
                        Exhibit A.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        I can’t deal with it anymore. I just want 
                        this to be over and done with.

           He stands up and walks out of the room. Rodney’s not happy.

                                 HER LAWYER
                        That was quick. I didn’t have to do shit.

           EXT. GROCERY STORE - DAY

           It’s a scorcher outside. Not a cloud in sight.

           INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Buying a large amount of BEER and CLAMATO.

           EXT. GROCERY STORE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Heading back to his car. SMACK. Something hits his head. He 
           grabs it.  It’s hail. It begins to fall like crazy -- this is 
           not normal weather. He flees to his car -- awkwardly pushing 
           the cart. 

           He throws everything inside and climbs in the driver’s door. 
           The hail stops and the sun comes back out.

                        The hell?

           INT. SYLVESTER’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - LATER

           Sylvester is putting the beer into the fridge. He hears 
           someone KNOCK at the door. Who the hell could that be?

           INT. SYLVESTER’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           PATRICK BAY (35), the male neighbor, is in the doorway.

                                 PATRICK
                        Patrick.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Sylvester?

                                 PATRICK
                        You got anything that sucks?

                                 SYLVESTER
                        I think that’s a matter of opinion.

                                 PATRICK
                        A vacuum? Dust Devil? I spilled pancake 
                        mix on our carpet.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        I’ll check.

           He walks off to look for something. Patrick looks around the 
           place. He’s not impressed.

                                 PATRICK
                        You just moved into the building?

                                 SYLVESTER (O.S.)
                        Two weeks.

           Sylvester returns with the vacuum in his hand.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        So...how long have you and your wife 
                        lived in the building?

                                 PATRICK
                        I’m not married.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        I mean...how long have you and your 
                        girlfriend lived in the building?

                        I don’t have a girlfriend.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Uh...I mean...
                (beat)
                        ...how long have you and your “friend 
                        with benefits” lived here?

           Beat.

                                 PATRICK
                        You’re the most transparent person I’ve 
                        met in my entire life. Are you into her? 
                        Do you think she’s attractive?

                                 SYLVESTER
                        No. God no. Why would you...?

                                 PATRICK
                        She’s my sister.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        But you called her “honey?”

                                 PATRICK
                        That’s her name.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        What?

                                 PATRICK
                        Our parents really dug Winnie the Pooh.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        That’s too stupid to be true.

           Sylvester is a little overwhelmed by this new information. 
           Patrick looks around the apartment. Then he looks back at 
           Sylvester. He’s sizing him up.

                                 PATRICK
                        You look like a vagina.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        I’ve never been told there’s a physical 
                        resemblance.

                                 PATRICK
                        I didn’t mean literally. You just look 
                        like a pussy. You’re never a dick, right?

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Not really.

                        That’s what I thought.
                (beat)
                        You should come over for dinner tonight 
                        and meet my sister. I’ll hook you guys 
                        up.

                                 SYLVESTER
                (flabbergasted)
                        But you said I was a pussy?

                                 PATRICK
                        Every guy would rather have his sister 
                        date a pussy than an asshole.

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Sylvester follows Patrick into the hallway.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        That’s it? You’ll hook us up?

           Patrick turns around.

                                 PATRICK
                        If you’re not interested...

                                 SYLVESTER
                        I’m beyond interested.

                                 PATRICK
                        Good. I can’t make any guarantees, but 
                        I’ll do my best. Luckily for you, my best 
                        is pretty damn good. 
                (opens his door)
                        I took off work today, told ‘em I had the 
                        shits. Come over in an hour.
                (beat)
                        You got anything against Chinese?

                                 SYLVESTER
                        You mean like...because of Tibet?

                                 PATRICK
                        I meant Chinese food.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Oh. Okay. That’s fine.

                                 PATRICK 
                        Well, alright. See you then.

           Sylvester stands alone in the hallway, shocked and confused.
                                          (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)           INT. PATRICK’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Patrick is vacuuming loudly. When he stops and turns it off, 
           we hear LOUD MUSIC coming from Sylvester’s apartment.

           INT. SYLVESTER’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Music is blasting out of his iHome. Sylvester is singing into 
           a CURTAIN ROD as if it was a microphone. He looks like he 
           just won the lottery and got laid at the same time.

                                 SYLVESTER
                (singing loudly)
                        ...YOU’RE HALFWAY THERE! OH-OH! LIVIN’ ON 
                        A PRA-A-AYER! TAKE MY HAND...

           INT. PATRICK’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Patrick hits the wall really hard.

                                 PATRICK
                (yelling)
                        Stop celebrating!

           The music and singing stops.

                                 SYLVESTER (O.S.)
                (muffled)
                        My bad!

           EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

           Establishing shot. Nice neighborhood.

           INT. SUBURBAN HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           A typical upper middle class living room. Artwork. Couch/love 
           seat combo. Coffee table. Home entertainment center. One 
           thing in the room stands out:

           THE DEAD HOUSEKEEPER LYING ON THE FLOOR.

           RED ROTHCHILD steps over her body. He’s a giant mercenary. 
           Seven feet tall. Bald. One word is tattooed on his forehead: 
           MURDER. He turns to reveal something in his hands--

           ANGLE ON: A BIG RED BOOK. It looks like a sleek and stylish 
           phone book, but the front cover, back cover, and spine are 
           SOLID RED with NO TEXT, WORDS, OR IMAGES. 

           We PAN to REVEAL the house is a huge disaster. He was 
           searching for the book.
                                                                 (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                 RED
                (into his walkie)
                        This is Red reporting in. I have book 
                        number 77.
                (looks at his watch)
                        It’s 1700 hours. Over.

           INT. DECREPIT OLD BUILDING - COUNTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           COUNTING MERCENARY hears Red and turns a page in a massive 
           pad. There are lines for 212 books. The previous 76 books 
           have been noted meticulously. He checks a BOX for BOOK #77 
           and writes: RED 1700.

           INT. PATRICK’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           We hear a KNOCK. Patrick opens the door with a take-out menu 
           in hand. His button up shirt is hanging open and he has a 
           BLACK SHIRT beneath it. Sylvester’s standing there, happy as 
           can be, with flowers and a bottle of Clamato.

                                 PATRICK
                        Are you retarded?

           Patrick grabs the flowers and WHACKS Sylvester in the face.

                                 SYLVESTER 
                        Ow.

                                 PATRICK
                        Flowers don’t hurt.

           Patrick throws them in the trash.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Dude?!

                                 PATRICK 
                        Why would you bring flowers? That’s not 
                        how this works. I’m the one with the plan 
                        here. You just have to roll with it. No 
                        part of rolling with it involves flowers.

           Sylvester stands there sheepishly with his hands in his 
           pockets. Patrick is buttoning up his shirt.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        Let me borrow your cell to order the 
                        food. Mine’s on the charger.

           As Sylvester reaches into his pocket to grab his cell, 
           something falls out of his pocket and hits the ground.
                                                (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        What the hell is that?

           Sylvester freezes.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        Is that a condom?

                                 SYLVESTER
                        No.

           Yes, it is.

                                 PATRICK
                        Is that for my sister? Did you think you 
                        were gonna fuck my sister?

                                 SYLVESTER
                        No, no, no. It’s not for her.

                                 PATRICK
                        Was it for me? Did you think you were 
                        gonna fuck me?

                                 SYLVESTER
                        No. Of course not.

                                 PATRICK
                        Then why did you bring a condom with you?

                                 SYLVESTER
                        No. I...it was in these pants, in the 
                        pockets. I haven’t worn them in awhile. 
                        It’s an honest mistake.

           Patrick stares him down, trying to see if he’s full of shit. 
           Sylvester looks horrified.

                                 PATRICK
                        This was a bad idea.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        No, it wasn’t. This was a great idea. 
                        I’ll be cool from this moment on, scout’s 
                        honor.

           Patrick grabs the cell from Sylvester and walks off.

                                 PATRICK (O.S.)
                        I’ll be a minute. Grab a brew or two.

           Sylvester breathes a sight of relief.
                                                  (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        And pick up that condom.

           Sylvester kneels down and picks it up.

           INT. PATRICK’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Sylvester has a half full glass of beer in front of him. He 
           begins to pour the Clamato into it. We turn to see Patrick.

                                 PATRICK
                (horrified)
                        What have you done to that beer?

                                 SYLVESTER
                        It’s, you know, a red beer. A Montana 
                        breakfast.

                                 PATRICK
                        No, I don’t know. And no, I don’t want to 
                        know. Ever.
                (beat)
                        Let’s go get the Chinese.

           INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - MOMENTS LATER

           They move ahead in line as the conversation progresses:

                                 SYLVESTER
                        She doesn’t know I’m coming? This is a 
                        surprise blind date?

                                 PATRICK
                        No, do I seem like an idiot? Stop 
                        talking.
                (beat)
                        I’m going to tell her you’re a good 
                        friend of mine and we’ve been hanging out 
                        for a while now.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Will she buy that?

                                 PATRICK
                        Yeah. The trick is to establish that we 
                        have inside jokes. Once you throw down a 
                        few, people just assume you’ve spent 
                        plenty of time together.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        What do I do then?
                                                        (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                 PATRICK
                        If I ever say anything that sounds like 
                        gibberish, just laugh and play along, 
                        acting like you know exactly what I mean. 

           Sylvester is impressed with Patrick’s plan.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        Leave the rest to me.

           INT. PATRICK’S APARTMENT - MAIN AREA - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           As Sylvester and Patrick enter the apartment we PUSH IN to 
           reveal HONEY BAY (25).

                                 HONEY
                        Who the hell is this asshole?

           INT. PATRICK’S APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - LATER

           The three of them are eating dinner at the table.

                                 HONEY
                        You guys aren’t friends.

                                 PATRICK
                        Yes, we are. Why would you say that?

                                 HONEY
                        Because you don’t have any friends.

                                 PATRICK
                        I’m friends with the guy at the deli.

                                 HONEY
                        What’s his name?

                                 PATRICK
                        ...Bob?
                (beat)
                        Well, I have Sylvester.

                                 HONEY
                        You’ve never mentioned him before.

                                 PATRICK
                        Why would I bring him up?

                                 HONEY
                        You didn’t even say anything to him in 
                        the hall this morning.
                                                    (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                 SYLVESTER
                        Yeah, we already talked about the Suns 
                        game last night. So we didn’t really have 
                        anything else to say.

           Patrick is proud of Sylvester. He gives the universally 
           understood “good move” look.

                                 HONEY
                        Whatever.

           Honey picks at her food. No one says anything for a moment. 
           This isn’t going well.

                                 SYLVESTER
                (to Patrick)
                        I need a time out. Uh, I mean I have to 
                        use the restroom.

           Sylvester looks at the hallway. He’s not sure how he’s 
           supposed to get Patrick to leave the table with him.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        Well, I don’t know my way around over 
                        there. Maybe you...
                (he winks to Patrick)
                        ...can show me where it is?

                                 HONEY
                        It’s the one with the toilet. Are you 
                        saying you might get lost?

                                 SYLVESTER
                (defensive and nervous)
                        Hell no. I never get lost. Sometimes I 
                        even wear a blindfold just to make shit 
                        more challenging.

                                 PATRICK
                (realizing what Sylvester is 
                doing)
                        I have to go get something...from my 
                        room. I’ll show you on the way.

           INT. PATRICK’S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Patrick and Sylvester have a quiet pow wow at the end of the 
           hall. It looks like they’re having a team huddle.

                                 PATRICK
                        I think the plan is working.
                                                   (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                 SYLVESTER
                        Are you crazy? She doesn’t even buy that 
                        we’re friends. I don’t even buy that 
                        we’re friends.

           Patrick puts his arm on Sylvester’s shoulder.

                                 PATRICK
                        Relax, she’s a smartass. That’s her 
                        thing. You’re in. I know it. Just calm 
                        down and let it flow.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Really? Well, okay. I’ll relax. 
                (breathes in)
                        I’m lettin’ it flow.

           INT. PATRICK’S APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           They get back to eating. Mid-conversation.

                                 HONEY
                        I think my cubicle-mate wants to get into 
                        my pants. We’re seeing a movie later.

                                 SYLVESTER
                (blurts out)
                        Why would you do that?

                                 HONEY
                        Go on a date?

                                 PATRICK
                        You know, Sylvester’s single.

                                 HONEY
                        That’s the most surprising thing I’ve 
                        heard all night.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Actually I’m not.

                                 PATRICK
                        Yes, you are.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Technically, I’m married.

                                 PATRICK

                        Well, I won’t be soon. I’m not an expert 
                        in legal lingo, but I had arbitration 
                        today.

                                 HONEY
                        What happened?

                                 SYLVESTER
                        I’d rather not get into it.

                                 HONEY
                        She divorced you, didn’t she?

           Sylvester’s had enough. He stands up and stretches.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Well, I’m going to clear the table now.

           Honey pushes her chair back and stands up.

                        Where are you going? What about dessert?

                                 HONEY
                        Relax. I gotta put stuff in the dryer.

           She walks out the door and closes it behind her.

                                 PATRICK
                        You’re married?

                        Look, do you want me to be honest?

                                 PATRICK
                        Sure, if you’re going to say, “I like her 
                        a lot. She’s wonderful.”

                                 SYLVESTER
                        I’m not into her.

                                 PATRICK
                        Seriously? There’s no way can do better.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        It depends on your definition of better.

                        Are you telling me there’s something 
                        wrong with my sister?

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Look, I thought I was really into her. 
                        Here she is, this beautiful girl next 
                        door. Right in my lap.
                (beat)
                        But I think I dug her because I didn’t 
                        know anything about her. You know, she 
                        was a mystery to me. But now I’ve solved 
                        the mystery...
                (beat)
                        ...and I don’t like it. She actually 
                        reminds me of my ex-wife.

                                 PATRICK
                        I’m going to hurt your face.

           RAY ROTHCHILD (30), a mercenary, watches as the floor numbers

           INT. PATRICK’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The front door opens. Honey comes back in and kicks off her 
           shoes. They didn’t hear the door open. Uh oh.

                                 SYLVESTER (O.S.)
                (whispering)
                        I appreciate you trying to make this work 
                        out, but she’s not right for me. I’m 
                        heading out. Make up an excuse for me.

           Honey is surprised but silent. She makes her way into --

           INT. PATRICK’S APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           -- the dining room and takes a seat. She continues to listen.

                                 PATRICK (O.S.)
                (whispering)
                        Just stay and eat some pie. She doesn’t 
                        know why you’re here. You’re just my...
                (makes air quotes)
                        ...”friend” that dropped by to grab some 
                        grub. Hang out for a few, leave, and 
                        she’ll never be the wiser.

           Honey shakes her head. This isn’t going to go well. Patrick 
           and Sylvester come back into the dining room.

                        I’m like a ninja.

           Patrick and Sylvester sit down at the table. Patrick begins 
           to pass pieces of pie around the table.

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        So, what were you guys talking about?

                                 PATRICK
                        Baseball.

                                 HONEY
                        Really? Sylvester, which team were you 
                        talking about?

                                 SYLVESTER
                        All of them?

           Honey shakes her head in disbelief.

                                 PATRICK
                (to Sylvester)
                        Nice job. You’re really bad at making 
                        shit up as you go along, aren’t you?

                                 HONEY
                        Jesus Christ, Patrick. I heard everything 
                        you said in the kitchen. Why did you 
                        think I’d like this guy?

                                 PATRICK
                        I don’t know. I was feeling a little 
                        optimistic. Sue me. I thought maybe you’d 
                        date a guy that wasn’t an asshole for 
                        once.

                                 HONEY
                        Really? Are we going there? It’s not like 
                        I’m actively on the prowl for jerks. 

                                 SYLVESTER
                        I’m going to leave now.

           They ignore him.

                                 HONEY
                        I don’t wake up thinking, “you know what 
                        would be nice? Dating another asshole.” 
                        It’s called bad luck, Patrick. Finding 
                        someone right for you isn’t easy.

                        Some people can’t find anyone. You should 
                        know that.

           It takes Sylvester a moment to get this.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Oh, ouch. That’s a low blow.

                                 HONEY
                        Stay out of this.

                                 PATRICK
                        Yeah, man. This is none of your business.

                                 HONEY
                        When’s the last time you got any?

                                 PATRICK
                        Any what?

                                 SYLVESTER
                        I think she means ass.

           Patrick glares at him.

                        I’ve had a dry spell lately.

                                 HONEY
                        Dry spell? That’s why we call you “The

           Patrick gives him a look. Sylvester stays out of it.

                                 HONEY
                        You see that? We just turned the tables 
                        on you? How does that feel?
                                              (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                 SYLVESTER
                        I didn’t do shit to no tables, man.

           EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Near the edge of the building, Rothchild aims the large 
           weapon off-screen. He presses a few buttons and it LIGHTS UP. 
           He begins to pull the trigger --

           INT. PATRICK’S APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Patrick delicately cuts a piece of his rhubarb pie and stabs 
           it with his fork. As he’s about to eat it --

                                 PATRICK
                        Fine. If the moral of the story is “no 
                        good can come from giving a shit about 
                        your sister” then I’ve learned my lesson.

           Patrick’s fork gets closer to his mouth --

                                 HONEY
                        It’s not that. It’s just...

           WIKHOOM! In a matter of seconds -- the wall explodes and the 
           window shatters into thousands of pieces!

           GREEN GLOWING PLASMA rockets into Patrick’s chest -- propels 
           him out of his chair -- FLYING BACKWARDS -- leaving a huge 
           impression in the drywall.

           He falls to the ground in a violent heap.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Jesus balls! 

           Honey SCREAMS at the top of her lungs.

           EXT. ADJACENT APARTMENT BUILDING ROOF - CONTINUOUS

           Rothchild fires a GRAPPLING HOOK at the building -- directly 
           above the gaping hole he just created when shooting Patrick.

           INT. PATRICK’S APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Sylvester looks at the huge hole in the wall.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        What the fuck just happened?

           WHOOSH! Rothchild glides gracefully through the hole in the 
           wall and lands with a menacing THUMP.
                                                   (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me, sir? Did you do that?

           POW! Rothchild PUNCHES Sylvester. He drops to the ground 
           clutching his face. He mumbles something unintelligible.

           Rothchild rushes towards a bookshelf and begins to throw the 
           books all over the place. We hear Patrick GROAN.

                                 ROTHCHILD
                        Well, I’ll be a monkey’s butt buddy. How 
                        the hell are you still tickin’?

           Rothchild approaches the messy heap that is Patrick.

                                 ROTHCHILD (CONT’D)
                        This will save me all that time I’d have 
                        to blow looking all over this shit 
                        apartment for it. 

           Rothchild steps on Patrick’s bicep.

                                 ROTHCHILD (CONT’D)
                        You know what I want, Patrick.

                                 PATRICK
                (muffled, hard to discern)
                        Fuck off.

                                 ROTHCHILD
                        I have no idea what you just said. You’ll 
                        need to point or something. If I got you 
                        a piece of paper or a pen would that 
                        help?

                                 HONEY
                        Leave him alone!

                                 ROTHCHILD
                        Woman, I just fired a plasma cannon at 
                        your brother. This ain’t gonna end well. 
                        You should probably start the grieving 
                        process now.

           Honey looks at Sylvester. He’s terrified and in pain.

                                 HONEY
                        What are you looking for?

                                 ROTHCHILD
                        You gonna help me? It’s a big red book.

                                 HONEY
                        If I tell you where it is will you leave?
                                                        (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                 ROTHCHILD
                        Sure, after you’re all dead.

           Honey nervously looks at a closet door.

                                 ROTHCHILD (CONT’D)
                        Thanks for that.

                                 HONEY
                        Shit.

           He approaches the closet door and opens it. 

           ANGLE ON: The shelf. We see another BIG RED BOOK. It’s 
           exactly like the book Red had in the previous scene. 
           Rothchild picks it up.

                                 ROTHCHILD
                        Heavy little fucker.
                (into his walkie, checks his 
                watch)
                        This is Rothchild. I’ve got book #102. 
                        It’s 1800 hours. Over.

                                 WALKIE TALKIE VOICE
                        Copy that, Rothchild. Over.

           Rothchild begins to put the big red book in his sack --

                                 ROTHCHILD 
                        And Bingo was his name...

           UNDER THE TABLE: We see an EMPTY HOLSTER taped to the wood!

           We WHIP PAN over to see Patrick -- holding a RUGER BLACKHAWK 
           HANDGUN -- aimed directly at Rothchild.

                                 PATRICK
                        ...O.

           BOOM! SPLAT! THUD! The book drops. The room fills with smoke.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Oh my god! Did his head just explode?

           Off-screen, Sylvester DRY HEAVES.

                                 SYLVESTER (O.S.) (CONT’D) 
                        That was much worse than Scanners.
                (beat)
                        It’s okay. I’m cool.

           He pauses for a moment. Then he DRY HEAVES again.
                                                   (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        Spoke too soon.

                                 PATRICK
                (quietly)
                        Sylvester...grab the book...

                                 SYLVESTER
                        I just saw a guy die! I’ve never seen 
                        that before.

                                 PATRICK
                        You’re about to see another one. Hurry 
                        up.

           Sylvester jumps up and runs to it, nervously stepping over 
           the corpse of Rothchild. Honey kneels down next to Patrick.

                                 HONEY
                        What’s going on, Patrick? This is insane!

                                 PATRICK
                        I’m sorry I tried to hook you up with 
                        Sylvester. I’m sorry I made it seem like 
                        your track record has been your fault 
                        instead of bad luck.

                                 HONEY
                        Patrick, who gives a shit? Are you okay?

           She holds his hand, and wipes her eyes with her sleeve.

                                 PATRICK
                        You both need to get out of here now. 
                        You’ll be dead if you don’t. 
                (coughs)
                        More people are coming. 

           Sylvester walks over with the book and kneels next to him.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        You can’t call the cops. You can’t tell 
                        anyone what happened here. They have 
                        people everywhere.
                (to Sylvester)
                        I’m just warning you guys, it’s going to 
                        be dangerous.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Patrick, I don’t want to do anything 
                        dangerous here.

                                 PATRICK
                        Then we’re fucked.
                                                        (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)

Honey’s crying uncontrollably.

                                 HONEY
                        Patrick!

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Honey...we have to get out of here.

                                 HONEY
                        No, I...

                                 SYLVESTER
                        He said more people are coming!

           Honey nods.

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Sylvester walks into the hallway and quickly enters the 
           laundry room adjacent to their apartments.

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - LAUNDRY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Honey follows him in. She’s stopped crying but you can tell 
           beneath the surface she’s a total fucking mess.

                                 HONEY
                        What are you doing?

           Sylvester sets the book on a WASHER.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Don’t you want to know what this is?

                                 HONEY
                        Nope.

           Sylvester ignores her.

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        Fine. Hurry it up.

           Honey opens the book and we hear a slight HISS. This isn’t a 
           regular book. There’s no title for the book inside either. 
           Just a simple white page with the text:

           IF THE OWNER OF THIS BOOK IS ALIVE...
           TURN TO PAGE 2

           IF THE OWNER OF THIS BOOK IS DEAD...

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Jesus. What is this thing?

                                 HONEY
                        I don’t know. Patrick just told me if 
                        anything ever happened to him I was 
                        supposed to take it.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Well, something happened to him.

                                 HONEY
                        If you want it, it’s yours. I don’t know 
                        if you noticed, but that scary guy killed 
                        Patrick for it and, as you said, more 
                        people are coming.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        But, Honey, what am I supposed to do?

                                 HONEY
                        I don’t know. Turn to page 3? Leave it 
                        here for the bad guys? Put it on Ebay? I 
                        don’t care. That’s on you. I’m gone.

           Honey runs out the door on her phone.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Honey, wait...!

                                 HONEY (O.S.)
                        Lucy, I’m on my way over. I hope you get 
                        this message...

           Sylvester gives up on Honey. He flips to PAGE 3.

           IF HE/SHE IS IN FACT DEAD, IMMEDIATELY GO TO:

           He stares at the book for a moment and thinks it over. What’s 
           he going to do? We SMASH CUT to--

           INT. DAEWOO - NIGHT

           Sylvester is driving down Bendix Avenue in his Daewoo.

                                 SYLVESTER
                (mumbling to himself)
                        Fucking dead people. Fucking explosions. 
                        Yeah, I’d like to be set up with your 
                        sister! That sounds like a great idea.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        What the hell did I get myself into?

           He reads the building numbers as he passes them.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)

                (beat)

           Sylvester slams on his breaks. He’s in front of a large 
           building that looks like a COSCO or PRICE CLUB. A simple logo 
           for READINESS INCORPORATED is on the front.

           INT. READINESS INC. - LOBBY - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

           The OPEN/CLOSED sign is flipped to CLOSED. Silence. The 
           lights are all on but no one is in the reception area. 
           Sylvester knocks on the glass double doors.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Hello? Is anyone in there?

           Sylvester pushes on the door and it opens. A sign is on the 
           reception desk: OUT TO LUNCH. BACK IN FIVE MINUTES. He looks 
           at a poster on the wall. It’s stylized like World War II 
           propaganda art. It says: WE’RE READY. DON’T WORRY. 

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        Ready for what?

           Sylvester sits on a plush couch and nervously flips through a 
           HIGHLIGHTS MAGAZINE. He gets up and RINGS the bell on the 
           reception desk. Still, no one appears. 

           He looks at the wall and sees -- A PICTURE OF PATRICK.

           Actually, several pictures of Patrick. This is the EMPLOYEE 
           OF THE MONTH WALL. It seems Patrick was “the guy” 90% of the 
           time. The pictures go around the corner and Sylvester follows 
           them down a hallway into...

           INT. READINESS INC. - MAIN CUBICLE AREA - MOMENTS LATER

           Sylvester enters a massive cubicle area. He approaches the 
           first cubicle and pokes his head inside. A normal looking 
           TECH GUY is taking a nap at his desk, with his head resting 
           on his folded arms.

                                 SYLVESTER
                (quietly)
                        Excuse me, sir? I have this book...
                                                                 (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)           The guy is sound asleep.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        Sir?

           Sylvester cautiously approaches him and leans in closer.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                (whispering)
                        Sir, I hate to wake you up but...

           The Tech Guy doesn’t respond, so Sylvester pokes him. And 
           just like that...he falls out of his chair and hits the 
           ground. WHOOMP! His lifeless eyes stare up at Sylvester.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        Holy fuck me!

           Sylvester backs up out of the cubicle.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                (loudly for anyone within 
                earshot)
                        There’s a dead guy in this cubicle! 
                (beat)
                        Does anyone realize there’s a dead guy in 
                        this cubicle?!

           Sylvester approaches the next cubicle and enters. Another 
           Tech Guy is taking a nap...or dead. Sylvester pokes the guy 
           several times.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        No, no, no, no, no.

           He looks in the next cubicle. The guy at the desk is dead. 
           Then the next.... Then the next... 

           A QUICK MONTAGE of dead guys in the building. A guy slumped 
           next to a WATER COOLER. A guy lying on the floor of the 
           bathroom with his pants down. A guy LEANING into the fridge. 
           We crane up for an OVERHEAD VIEW of at least 100 cubicles....

           And a dead employee is behind every desk.

           Sylvester runs back towards the lobby of the building -- but 
           he stops. He sees something down a hallway. He begins to walk 
           towards it...curious.

           INT. READINESS - ENORMOUS TECH ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Sylvester walks into the craziest room he’s ever seen.
                                                        (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)           There are rows and rows of SUPERCOMPUTERS surrounding what 
           looks like a THIRTY FOOT TALL HOURGLASS. It’s cracked and 
           lights are FLICKERING inside...LIKE SOMEONE HAS DISABLED IT.

           On the walls are hundreds of large screens showing shots of 
           THE EARTH FROM ORBIT. Sylvester’s in awe and scared. He 
           begins to slowly back towards the exit.

                                 SYLVESTER
                (quietly to himself)
                        What...the hell...is...this place?

           EXT. READINESS INC. - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

           Sylvester is running like a bat out of hell towards his car.

                                 SYLVESTER
                (mumbling to himself)
                        Dead people. Dead people everywhere. This 
                        is crazy. This is crazy.

           INT. DAEWOO - MOMENTS LATER

           The book is lying open on the passenger seat. Sylvester grabs 
           it and reads the bottom of the page.

           IF EVERYONE IN THE BUILDING IS ALIVE...
           TURN TO PAGE 4

           IF EVERYONE IN THE BUILDING IS DEAD...
           TURN TO PAGE 5

           Sylvester angrily throws the book on the passenger seat.

                                 SYLVESTER
                (to the book)
                        Fuck you. You’re an asshole.

           ANGLE ON: The book is lying open on the passenger seat. The 
           pages begin to move slowly -- and the book closes on its own.

           Sylvester sees this. It must be a security feature.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        Fine. Close. See if I care.

           He starts the car and begins to pull out into the street.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        I’m never reading another book again. I 
                        don’t care if there’s another Harry 
                        Potter. From now on, it’s nothing but 
                        magazines and the internet for me.

He 
           reaches for it and looks down. Just as he clicks it into 
           place -- BOOM!

           EXT. INTERSECTION - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           SMASH! A black Suburban PLOWS into the Daewoo! The Daewoo 
           rolls once -- twice -- then smashes into a dumpster. 

           INT. DAEWOO - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Sylvester is hanging upside down, saved by his seatbelt. He 
           hears the sound of car doors opening and dozens of boots 
           hitting the pavement.

           A boot KICKS IN HIS WINDOW! SMASH! Sylvester puts up his 
           hands defensively. He can’t see who is doing this.

                                 MENACING VOICE (O.S.)
                        Who are you? Do you work for Readiness?

                                 SYLVESTER
                        No! No, dude! This book just said to go 
                        there!

           Everything gets quiet.

                                 WHISPERING VOICE (O.S.)
                        Did he say he has a book? How is that 
                        possible?

                                 SYLVESTER 
                        It’s cool, man. You guys can have it. I 
                        don’t need it.

           Someone KICKS IN the passenger window. SMASH!

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        Jesus! Enough with the glass!

           A hand reaches in with a knife and cuts his seatbelt. WHOOMP! 
           Sylvester falls out of his seat into an awkward ball.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        Ow. Fuck! Ow. Goddamn you people --
                        whoever the fuck you are.

           EXT. INTERSECTION - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Sylvester crawls out. When he sees them he puts his hands up.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Oh. It’s you guys.

           A COW EATING GRASS

           We PULL BACK to find two TECH MERCENARIES looking at it. 
           McBride is standing next to them.

                                 MCBRIDE
                        Did you test that one, yet?

                                 TECH MERCENARY #1
                        Nope.

           Tech Mercenary #1 is aiming one of their bizarre guns at the 
           cow. This one looks like a METAL CROSSBOW.

           He FIRES it -- BAM! -- and a bullet flies out of it. We FLY 
           ALONG WITH IT until it hits the cow. PFFT. The cow doesn’t 
           flinch. It just continues to eat the grass. Deadpan.

                                 MCBRIDE
                        Huh. Try the next one.

           Tech Mercenary #2 aims another gun at a DIFFERENT COW. This 
           gun looks like a SHOULDER MOUNTED MISSILE LAUNCHER. He fires 
           it. SHHHHT! A purple laser hits the cow. 

           Suddenly, the cow begins to float -- then rise higher -- 
           higher -- and higher -- until it disappears into the night 
           sky.

                                 MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
                        Huh. Anti-gravity. I like it.

           Tech Mercenary #1 is holding what looks like a cross between 
           a Christmas ornament and a grenade.

                                 TECH MERCENARY #1
                        We finally figured this one out. It’s not 
                        a grenade.

           Tech Mercenary #2 puts on his sunglasses.

                                 MCBRIDE
                        Then what is it, Corey Hart?

           Tech Mercenary #2 closes his eyes. Tech Mercenary #1 presses 
           a silver button on the side of the device. 

           TICK -- TICK -- TICK -- TICK

           McBride begins to run as soon as he here’s the sound. But it 
           doesn’t explode. A large beam of light shoots out of the 
           object. McBride stops running.
                                                        (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                 MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
                        Whoa, Nellie. It’s just a super 
                        flashlight? What’s the fun in that? I 
                        thought they only gave us weapons.

           We PULL BACK even farther this time to reveal where they are.

           EXT. DECREPIT OLD BUILDING - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           This isn’t a rinky dink operation. There’s a large fence 
           around the whole area. Armed mercenaries posted all over the 
           location. The rooftop. The gate. Etc. MESSENGER MERCENARY 
           runs out the front doors of the building to McBride.

                                 MESSENGER MERCENARY
                        Hey, boss. Lucius has been trying to get 
                        a hold of you on your walkie.

           McBride looks down at his walkie talkie.

                                 MCBRIDE
                        It’s on. This one must be broken. Grab me 
                        another one when you go back.

           He hands McBride a phone.

                                 MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
                        Talk to me.

           EXT. READINESS - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           LUCIUS, a mercenary, is putting Sylvester in handcuffs.

                                 LUCIUS
                        You’re sure all our guys have checked in 
                        and we have all 212 books, right?

                                 MCBRIDE (O.S.)
                        Of course.

                                 LUCIUS
                        Then why am I standing here next to some 
                        guy who had one in his car?

                        Bring him in. We’ll figure out how this 
                        asshole got one of the books. Then we’ll 
                        kill him.

           EXT. READINESS - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Lucius hangs up his phone.

                                 LUCIUS 
                        Bag him up. 

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Is someone going to literally put me in a 
                        bag, or is that like bad guy lingo?

           Mercenary #4 punches Sylvester in the face.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        That never stops hurting.

           They put a large bag, like a potato sack, over Sylvester’s 
           head. It goes down to his waist.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                (muffled)
                        That answers my question.

           They pick him up and haul him away, fumbling, kicking, and 
           screaming.

           INT. CONDO - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           LUCY (25) is sitting in front of the bathroom door, reading a 
           NEW YORKER MAGAZINE.

                                 LUCY
                        I’m just going to sit out here reading 
                        the New Yorker until you decide to talk.

           No response.

           INT. CONDO - BATHROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Honey’s sitting on the toilet (the seat is closed, she’s not 
           going to the bathroom) eating ICE CREAM out of the CARTON 
           with a SPOON. She’s in shock. Silent.

           INT. CONDO - HALLWAY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Lucy continues to read the magazine.

                        Come on, Honey. What happened? Do you 
                        want to talk about it?

           Beat.

                                 HONEY (O.S.)
                        No.

                                 LUCY
                        Okay, then. I’ll take that as a “no.”

           INT. SUBURBAN - MOMENTS LATER

           Sylvester is tied up in the back of the suburban with the bag 
           over his head and torso. 

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Where are we going?

                                 LUCIUS (O.S.)
                        If you ask one more question I’ll cut 
                        your balls off. You’d like to keep your 
                        balls, wouldn’t you?

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Affirmative.

           EXT. DECREPIT OLD BUILDING - NIGHT

           Two GUARD MERCENARIES open a gate in the chain link fence and 
           the Suburban drives on through towards the bad guy base.

           INT. DECREPIT OLD BUILDING - FIRST FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Lucius and Sylvester, still bagged up, enter the building. 
           There are dozens of mercenaries in the room. TVs. Computers. 
           Weapons. Etc.

                                 LUCIUS
                        Follow me.

           Sylvester walks right into a wall.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Ow.

           INT. DECREPIT OLD BUILDING - LOUNGE AREA - NIGHT

           Several mercenaries are watching the news on a large TV.

           INT. DECREPIT OLD BUILDING - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT

           The doors of an old school elevator open and Lucius leads 
           Sylvester into the interrogation room.

           INT. DECREPIT OLD BUILDING - SECOND FLOOR - I.R. - CONTINUOUS

           He drags Sylvester over to the wall, unlocks his handcuffs 
           and re-locks them around the pipe. SCARY MERCENARY stands 
           watch at the door.

                                 LUCIUS
                        I’ll be right back.

           INT. DECREPIT OLD BUILDING - RECORDS ROOM - NIGHT

           McBride is looking at the records with Counting Mercenary.

                                 MCBRIDE
                        You said they’re all accounted for. 
                        You’re sure of that, right? You weren’t 
                        off on a piss or smoke break? Maybe you 
                        missed something?

                                 COUNTING MERCENARY 
                        No, sir. All our guys have called in 
                        every book, all 212 of them. The books 
                        are being brought here as we speak. We’ll 
                        do a complete count once they’ve arrived.

                                 MCBRIDE
                        You do want to live in the castle, right? 
                        I could kick you out quicker than you can 
                        say “Oh-shit-I-fucked-up.” Hell, I could 
                        make you live outside with the horses.

           We hear the STATIC of a walkie talkie then:
                                                  (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)

                        This is Lucius. I have the guy in the 
                        interrogation room on the second --

           He breaks up.

                                 MCBRIDE
                        This is my second walkie and it’s shit.
                (into his walkie)
                        Repeat. Which guy?

                                 LUCIUS (O.S.)
                        The guy with the...

           KSHHH! His walkie talkie continues to act up.

                                 MCBRIDE
                        Son of a bitch.

           McBride storms out of the room.

           INT. DECREPIT OLD BUILDING - FIRST FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

           McBride stomps over to the Tech Mercenaries.

                                 MCBRIDE
                        Which one of you cocksuckers bought these 
                        shitty walkie talkies? 

                                 TECH MERCENARY #1
                        I did, sir.

                                 MCBRIDE
                        Were they on clearance?

                                 TECH MERCENARY #1
                        Yes, sir. I thought we’d save some money.

                                 MCBRIDE
                        You thought we’d save some money? We’re 
                        flush, retard. We all took out massive 
                        loans and maxed out our credit cards. We 
                        won’t have to pay any of that back, you 
                        understand? 

           McBride angrily kicks a clearly EXPENSIVE COMPUTER off the 
           table and it SMASHES against the ground.

                                 MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
                        You see what I mean? That probably cost a 
                        thousand dollars.

                        I don’t give a shit. We can just buy 
                        another one.
                (beat)
                        This is not a time to be cheap. This is 
                        the time to indulge. This is the time to 
                        buy some goddamn quality walkie talkies!

           McBride walks over to the old school elevator.

                        I swear to god I’ll be by myself in the

                        old sports bloopers if you guys continue 
                        to fuck up. Consider this a warning.

           The doors close and the elevator begins to rise.

                                 MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
                (shouting)
                        Have fun being dead!

           INT. DECREPIT OLD BUILDING - SECOND FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           McBride approaches Lucius and sees Sylvester through the 
           door. The bag is off Sylvester’s head.

                                 MCBRIDE
                        This guy looks like a pussy.

                                 LUCIUS
                        Well, he’s not an employee. He said the 
                        book belonged to his neighbor.

           Red comes around the corner and approaches them.

                                 RED
                        My step-brother’s missing.

                                 MCBRIDE
                        Okay, I don’t know who the hell that is 
                        or who the hell you are. We’re a little 
                        busy, buddy.

           McBride motions to Lucius. He’s clearly giving him the bitch 
           work.

                                 MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
                        You can talk to my right hand man about 
                        it. He’s head of human resources.

           McBride approaches the door and watches Sylvester for a 
           moment while they continue behind him. Lucius is annoyed.

                        He checked in after finding the last book 
                        on his list. No one’s heard from him 
                        since.

                                 LUCIUS
                (realizes what happened)
                        Son of a bitch.

           McBride spins around, having overheard their conversation. 
           He’s obviously come to the same conclusion.

                                 MCBRIDE
                        Whose book was it?

           INT. DECREPIT OLD BUILDING - SECOND FLOOR - I.R. - NIGHT

           McBride and Lucius enter with a PRINTOUT.

           ANGLE ON: The printout. It’s a long list of names and times. 
           Patrick’s name is circled.

                                 SYLVESTER 
                        This is a total misunderstanding.

                                 MCBRIDE
                        Well, okay then. Explain this to me. 
                        Every employee had a book. 212 employees. 
                        212 books. 

           EXT. DECREPIT OLD BUILDING - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           We see several mercenaries unloading seemingly endless stacks 
           of BIG RED BOOKS from the Suburbans.

                                 MCBRIDE (V.O.)
                        We killed ‘em all, the current guys, the 
                        retired guys, even the guys that called 
                        in sick. And we took all their books, all 
                        212. Well...
                (beat)
                        ...we thought we did.

           INT. DECREPIT OLD BUILDING - MAIN AREA - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           We see mercenaries stacking all the books into the center of 
           the room while Counting Mercenary counts them off.

PATRICK’S APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Two FEMALE MERCENARIES find Rothchild’s body and look out the 
           window. They see Rothchild’s SUBURBAN parked in the alley.

                                 MCBRIDE (V.O.)
                        Our guy, Rothchild, had 32 books to pick 
                        up on his route.

           INT. DECREPIT OLD BUILDING - SECOND FLOOR - I.R. - CONTINUOUS

           McBride looks down at his paper.

                                 MCBRIDE
                        Patrick Bay was the last Readiness 
                        employee on Rothchild’s list. And I 
                        assume that he’s a friend or relative of 
                        yours.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        He’s my neighbor. Possible friend.

                                 MCBRIDE
                        Right. Well, our guy checked in after 
                        finding his book, and no one has heard 
                        from him since. Did you kill him?

                                 SYLVESTER
                        No, dude. I didn’t kill anyone.

                                 MCBRIDE
                (thinks it over)
                        Right. So, maybe our guy thinks he kills 
                        Patrick, but he didn’t. And Patrick’s 
                        last word is...
                (mimes shooting a gun)
                        ...bang.

           EXT. PATRICK’S APARTMENT BUILDING - ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           The FEMALE MERCENARIES open up the back of Rothchild’s 
           Suburban which. There are 31 BIG RED BOOKS in the back.

                                 FEMALE MERCENARY
                (into her walkie)
                        There are 31 books here.

                                 MCBRIDE (V.O.)
                        So if our guy, Rothchild, has 31 books 
                        sitting in the back of his car...

                (thinks it over)
                        ...the book you have, Patrick’s book, 
                        brings us to our grand total of 212. 
                (beat)
                        That’s a lot of math.

           Lucius nods. Sylvester thinks this over.

                                 SYLVESTER
                (horrified)
                        You killed everyone in the Readiness 
                        building? How? Why?

                                 MCBRIDE
                        How? We gassed them. Why? Because, by 
                        this time tomorrow night, everyone on the 
                        planet is going to be dead.

           Holy shit. Sylvester is floored. Speechless. The room starts 
           to SHAKE. It’s a small EARTHQUAKE. Lucius and McBride look 
           like they expected this.

                                 LUCIUS
                        They must be getting closer.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Who? What the fuck is going on?

                                       CUT TO:

           INT. CONDO - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           LUCY (25) is still sitting in front of the bathroom door, 
           reading her magazine, while the room SHAKES a little. She 
           reaches up to hold her WINE GLASS sitting on a shelf, keeping 
           it steady so it won’t spill.

           The short earthquake ends. She takes a sip of the wine. 
           Silence for a beat. Then...

                                 HONEY (O.S.)
                        I have no idea what Patrick did for a 
                        living.

                                 LUCY
                        She speaks.

           The BATHROOM DOOR opens and Honey peaks out.

                        Yeah, but that’s not even a real word.

           She opens it all the way and leans against the DOOR FRAME.

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        I think he was full of shit. I don’t know 
                        where he worked. I don’t know what he 
                        did. But I’ve been thinking...

           She takes a bite of ICE CREAM and the first few sentences are 
           a little “mumbly” because she has food in her mouth.

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        A few years ago I was supposed to go see 
                        a movie with this guy but he flaked out 
                        on me. Some bullshit reason. Patrick 
                        asked if he could come along, said he 
                        wanted to see it. I knew he just felt 
                        bad, but he’s not the kind of guy to you 
                        know...verbalize that. Anyway..
                (beat)
                        We’re outside of the theater and there’s 
                        a homeless guy sitting there. He has this 
                        sign: “Abducted by aliens. Need money for 
                        food.” I laughed, but Patrick...
                (beat)
                        Look, I’ve never seen Patrick give a 
                        penny to a homeless guy and yet he gives 
                        him a hundred bucks and a pack of smokes.
                (beat)
                        I always thought that was weird...

           Honey trails off. Thinking. She’s “putting 2 and 2 together.”

           INT. DECREPIT OLD BUILDING - SECOND FLOOR - I.R. - CONTINUOUS

           Sylvester’s shocked by what he’s just heard.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Aliens? What?

                                 MCBRIDE
                        A bunch of ‘em are on the way. A whole 
                        race of assholes. They’re going to kill 
                        95% of the population, enslave the rest, 
                        repopulate the planet. You know...the 
                        basic stuff.

                                 SYLVESTER
                (laughing)
                        Right.
                                                              (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                 MCBRIDE
                        You don’t believe me? You didn’t already 
                        think this had something to do with 
                        aliens?

                                 SYLVESTER 
                (laughing)
                        Uh, no. Do I seem like a conspiracy 
                        theory dude? I’m not a crazy person.

                                 MCBRIDE
                        Didn’t you see what our guy used to kill 
                        your friend? What did you think that was?

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Some new fancy weapon. I don’t know. I 
                        don’t subscribe to Guns and Ammo.

           McBride nods to Lucius. Lucius leaves the room for a moment.

           INT. DECREPIT OLD WAREHOUSE - SECOND FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

           Lucius approaches a table littered with bizarre weapons. He’s 
           deciding which one to choose. He settles on a device that 
           looks like a cross between a TOMMY GUN and a SNAIL.

           INT. DECREPIT OLD BUILDING - SECOND FLOOR - I.R. - NIGHT

           Lucius returns with the weapon.

                                 LUCIUS
                        We call this one The Medusa.

           Lucius fires at Scary Mercenary! He SCREAMS in agony and 
           turns into SOLID ROCK. Sylvester opens his eyes to find 
           himself alive and the other dude a statue.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Whoa, did that turn him into a statue?!

                                 MCBRIDE
                        Okay, see, that’s a fucked up weapon. 
                        Where do you think we got that?

                                 SYLVESTER
                        The future?

           Lucius PUNCHES him in the face.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        Okay, aliens. Fuck. I’m a believer.
                                            (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)

                        As I said, they’ll be here in...
                (looks at watch)
                        ...16 hours, and when they get here, 
                        everything’s going to end. 
                (beat)
                        Everything.

           Sylvester thinks for a minute.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        So the guys you gassed...Readiness? 
                        Patrick was like...a Men in Black, right? 
                        One of the guys that could stop the 
                        aliens?

           McBride nods.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        Oh my god! So aliens, like, live among 
                        us?

                                 MCBRIDE
                        No. Idiot. If they did, you’d be dead. 
                        There’s no such thing as good aliens. 

                                 SYLVESTER
                        I don’t understand. Why would you kill 
                        the only people that could save the 
                        world? Why would you kill our only hope?

                                 MCBRIDE 
                        Well, they were your only hope. I’ll be 
                        fine. 
                (beat)
                        Me and my guys get to live. We struck a 
                        deal with the aliens. If we help ‘em have 
                        a smooth transitional process, you know, 
                        if we get all 212 books and no one stops 
                        ‘em from landing here and doing their 
                        thing, we won’t get killed. We’ll get a 
                        huge zone to live in while they take the 
                        rest of the planet.
                (beat)
                        I asked for the biggest castle on earth. 
                        I’ve always wanted to live in one since I 
                        saw Chitty Chitty Bang Bang as a kid. You 
                        ever see that movie? The bad guys in that 
                        one had a hell of a crib. And now I get 
                        one. I’m going to wear a crown and 
                        everything. I think there’s even a 
                        waterfall.
                (turns to Lucius)
                        There’s a waterfall, right?
                                                        (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)           Lucius nods.

                                 MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
                        You can’t beat that shit.

           Lucius walks out of the room. Sylvester looks about as down 
           as you can get. Lucius returns with another alien device. 
           It’s like a HACKSAW with a GLOWING LASER instead of a blade.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        What’s that?

           Lucius uses the alien hacksaw to cut a huge chunk out of the 
           door frame.

                                 LUCIUS
                        Another gift from our alien friends.

                                 MCBRIDE
                        It was nice talking to you. Thanks for 
                        clearing a few things up for us.

           McBride begins to walk out of the room.

                                 SYLVESTER 
                        No. No. No. I don’t want to go like that. 
                        I don’t want to go period.

                                 MCBRIDE
                        What are we? Savages? No one’s killing 
                        you with this.
                (beat)
                        We’re using it to cut off your hands.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Wait, my hands? Why my hands?

           McBride walks out of the room. Lucius approaches him with the 
           hacksaw.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                (freaking out)
                        Please don’t do that. I like my hands. I 
                        need my hands. How am I going to wave at 
                        someone?! Or tie my shoes? Or point? How 
                        am I going to point at something without 
                        any fingers?!

           Lucius unchains the handcuffs from the pipe on the wall and 
           re-locks them on Sylvester’s other hand.

                                 LUCIUS
                        Follow me. No funny business.

           Sylvester reluctantly follows him. He’s terrified.

           INT. DECREPIT OLD BUILDING - SECOND FLOOR - C.R. - NIGHT

           Lucius leads Sylvester into “the cutting room.” There’s 
           plastic all over the floor. It makes a SQUEAKY noise with 
           every step. Lucius drops the BIG RED BOOK on the table. 
           WHOMP! He’s holding the HACKSAW.

                                 LUCIUS
                        Put out your arms.

           INT. DECREPIT OLD BUILDING - DARK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           McBride’s in the same “dark room” from the opening of the 
           film. He’s talking to a HOLOGRAM ALIEN with a “cold male 
           voice.” The transmission is faint. It’s just a CLUSTER OF 
           WHITE NOISE. We have no idea what the aliens look like --

           -- but the mere shape of it is fucking unsettling. 

                                 HOLOGRAM ALIEN
                        But you have all the books now?

                                 MCBRIDE
                        Every last one.

                                 HOLOGRAM ALIEN
                        You must use this man to open his book. 
                        We must see how they planned to stop us.

                                 MCBRIDE
                        I’m already on it.

           INT. DECREPIT OLD BUILDING - SECOND FLOOR - C.R. - CONTINUOUS

           Sylvester’s holding his hands behind his back.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        You don’t need my hands. Go to Readiness 
                        and get some dead-guy-hands. They’re not 
                        doing anything with them.  You could just 
                        take ‘em. You don’t need alive-guy-hands.

                                 LUCIUS 
                        The employees can’t open the books.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Why? That’s stupid.

                                 LUCIUS
                        You’re stupid. They wrote the books. They 
                        don’t need to know what’s inside. Each 
                        book is coded for one person. 
                                                                   (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                 LUCIUS(CONT'D)

                        Every employee chose a friend or relative 
                        to leave it to, like a will. If you leave 
                        one to your ex-girlfriend from high 
                        school, only she can open that book. You 
                        leave one to your gay brother, only your 
                        gay brother can open that book. 
                (beat)
                        We didn’t know if each book was left to a 
                        gay brother or an ex-girlfriend. But now 
                        we have your book, and we’re going to 
                        have your hands.

                                 SYLVESTER 
                        I have a better idea. I could just open 
                        it for you. See!

           He tries to open it. Nothing happens. He tries again.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                (struggling)
                        I could be like your “book guy.” Whenever 
                        you need someone to open it...

           Sylvester’s flailing, trying desperately to open the book.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        Did you glue the pages shut?

           He hits it. Digs his fingernails into the side. Slams the 
           book against the wall.

                                 LUCIUS 
                        You said you were at Readiness because 
                        the book told you to go there. How would 
                        you know that if you didn’t open the 
                        book?

           -- and Sylvester realizes the shit’s about to hit the fan.

           FLASHBACK: Back in the laundry room. We see Honey opening the 
           book.

           Lucius looks at Sylvester.

                                 LUCIUS (CONT’D)
                        What? That was a “I just realized 
                        something” face. What did you just 
                        realize?
                (thinks for a moment)
                        You didn’t open the book. Who can open 
                        this book? Who did Patrick leave it to?
                (into his walkie)
                        We have a problem.
                                                    (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)           His walkie talkie CRACKLES. He slams it down angrily. Now 
           Sylvester has a “what the fuck am I going to do?” face.

           He looks around the room. How is he going to escape? The 
           window is closed. Is there a lock on it? Hmm...

           It’s MacGyver time.

           A nail on the ground. Then the handcuffs lock. Back to the 
           nail on the ground. Can he pick the lock?

           Sylvester dives to the ground and grabs the nail! He begins 
           to try and pick the lock...

           BAM! Lucius shoots him in the head.

           Thank Christ that was a dream sequence.

           Attempt #2: Ah ha! Sylvester grabs the laser hacksaw! He 
           swings it at Lucius to cut off his arm --

           -- but the laser shuts down -- and he just hits him with the 
           handle.

           Lucius shoots him in the head.

           BACK IN REAL TIME: Sylvester’s deep in thought. How the hell 
           is he going to --?

           Lucius sees Sylvester’s eyes darting around the room.

                                 LUCIUS (CONT’D)
                        Don’t get any stupid ideas.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        That’s the only kind I have.

           Sylvester looks down and sees something off-screen. That’s 
           it. That’ll work.

                                 LUCIUS
                (into his walkie)
                        Can anyone hear me? We have a problem 
                        here.

           We hear Sylvester moving around behind Lucius. Then...

           THUD! Sylvester hits Lucius as hard as he can over the head 
           WITH THE BIG RED BOOK!

           Lucius falls to the floor.

           Sylvester takes a moment to celebrate this minor victory with 
           a brief happy dance.
                                                                  (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)           He looks at the clock in the room, then he sees a DIGITAL 
           COUNTDOWN CLOCK. 

           15:24:12 -- 15:24:11 -- 15:24:10 etc. Sylvester grabs a pen 
           out of Lucius’ messenger bag and writes the current time and 
           the time left on the countdown clock onto his arm.

           He stops. Thinks for a moment. Then begins to look through 
           the bag for something else.

                                 SYLVESTER 
                        Keys. Keys. Keys. Come on...!
                (no dice)
                        Fuck!

           Hacksaw! He grabs it and carefully turns it to cut off the 
           handcuffs -- and it POWERS DOWN. Just like “before.” Fuck.

           INT. DECREPIT OLD BUILDING - FIRST FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

           Red is pacing back and forth. McBride walks past him.

                                 RED
                        Did you find out where my step-brother 
                        is?

                                 MCBRIDE
                        Who?
                (thinks for a second)
                        Oh, right. Your step-brother. He’s dead.

           Something inside Red snaps. Then he becomes creepily calm.

                                 RED
                        Do you mind if I kill the guy upstairs?

                                 MCBRIDE
                        Lucius is taking care of it, but if you 
                        hurry you might catch him before he does 
                        the job.

           Red hurried. He’s already gone.

           INT. DECREPIT OLD WAREHOUSE - SECOND FLOOR - I.R. - NIGHT

           He puts the book inside Lucius’ messenger bag. He opens the 
           window. Looks down. No one’s beneath it.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Here goes something stupid.

           Sylvester stops. He forgot something. He runs out of the 
           room. He’s gone for a moment -- then he returns.

DECREPIT OLD WAREHOUSE - DAY

           Sylvester begins to climb out the window. If there’s an ideal 
           way to do it, this isn’t it. He turns around awkwardly, his 
           cuffed hands being a major hindrance, and slips!

           He almost falls but he catches onto the ledge with his hands!

           He hangs above the ground for a moment. Then --

           -- he lets go of the ledge!

                                 SYLVESTER 
                        Ohshitohshit --

           WHAM! He lands on his feet and FALLS BACKWARDS on his back.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        Ow! Fuck the world. This isn’t worth it.

           Sylvester rolls over and climbs out into the darkness.

           INT. DECREPIT OLD WAREHOUSE - I.R. - CONTINUOUS

           Red sees Lucius unconscious on the floor and Sylvester’s 
           nowhere in sight. He yells very, very loud. This isn’t going 
           to be good.

           EXT. DECREPIT OLD WAREHOUSE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Two Guard Mercenaries at the MAIN GATE are talking to each 
           other, unaware of what’s going on. This is the only way out 
           of the compound. Sylvester approaches them.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Hey, guys. I’m going on a beer run. You 
                        need anything?

           An ALARMS sounds! The guards begin to panic. Sylvester 
           reaches into his bag and --

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        Say cheese!

           -- TURNS THE TWO GUYS INTO STONE!

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        Holy wow.

           They’re blocking the gate. He pushes Guard Mercenary #1. He 
           falls and hits Guard Mercenary #2. They drop to the ground 
           like dominos. Sylvester opens the gate.

Armed to the teeth. 
           They peel out and head towards the gate.

           EXT. INDUSTRIAL AREA - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

           Sylvester is huffing and puffing down an empty road. We hear 
           the Suburban in the distance. It peels around a corner and 
           ROARS and SPEEDS towards him. Sylvester stops running. It’s 
           getting closer and closer to him!

           The mercenaries are firing out the windows --Sylvester turns 
           and runs down a narrow dark alley.

           EXT. NARROW DARK ALLEY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Sylvester reaches into the bag --

           The Suburban turns and begins to drive down the alley! If the 
           alley was an inch narrower it wouldn’t fit. They get closer 
           and closer --

           Sylvester stops running! The Suburban is twenty feet in front 
           of him when --

           He aims the Medusa at the Suburban!

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Please work. That would be nice.

           He FIRES! BOOM! The ENTIRE SUBURBAN and its contents TURN TO 
           STONE!

           But it’s too early for another happy dance because -- THE 
           SUBURBAN CONTINUES TO SLIDE TOWARDS HIM!

           The alley is on an incline and the STONE SUBURBAN is going to 
           crush Sylvester! He runs as fast as he can --

           -- he jumps up onto a box, then onto a dumpster --

           -- and he JUMPS HIGH INTO THE AIR --

           -- as the STONE SUBURBAN CRASHES INTO THE DUMPSTER --

           Sylvester lands on it, surfing it for a moment, before it 
           skids to a halt. Sylvester breathes a sigh of relief.

           IN THE DISTANCE: Another Suburban approaches. Red’s driving.

           EXT. NARROW DARK ALLEY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Sylvester stands on top of the stone Suburban and for the 
           first time, because of the gun, he seems cocky. Confident. He 
           aims the Medusa at RED’S SUBURBAN and just waits for it.
                                                            (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)           He lets it come. And just when it’s within reach -- 

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Adios, you sons of bitches.

           He pulls the trigger -- AND NOTHING HAPPENS! 

           Click. Again -- NOTHING. He looks down at the gun. There are 
           four FLASHING SQUARES on the back. EMPTY.

           A mercenary stands up through the SUNROOF and sprays MACHINE 
           GUN FIRE AT HIM! Sylvester drops the Medusa and runs for it.

           SCREECH! Red avoids slamming into the STONE SUBURBAN. Nowhere 
           to go. The alley’s too narrow. He speeds in REVERSE. 

           Sylvester runs around the corner.

           INT. SUBURBAN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Red SLAMS on the BRAKES.

                                 RED
                        Get out and find him! But I get the kill!

           Several of the mercenaries jump out and Red speeds off.

           EXT. BUS STOP - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Sylvester looks around frantically, he can hear the Suburban 
           somewhere in the distance. He struggles to turn around and 
           get his wallet while in handcuffs. He gets on the bus.

           The doors close behind him and the bus drives off into the 
           distance. Seconds later, a Suburban DRIFTS around the corner, 
           bumping into a SMALL PARKED CAR. The bus is out of sight.

           INT. SUBURBAN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Red looks around. Where did he go? Red = very angry.

           INT. DECREPIT OLD BUILDING - DARK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           McBride is talking to the “white noise” Hologram Alien again.

                                 HOLOGRAM ALIEN
                        “A little problem?” What do you mean?

                                 MCBRIDE
                        Well, we lost the guy.

           The Hologram Alien begins to act...different. He begins to 
           twitch and shake. He’s on the verge of becoming very, very, 
           very angry. This isn’t good.
                                                   (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                 HOLOGRAM ALIEN
                        And...his...book?

                                 MCBRIDE
                        He has that, too.

                                 HOLOGRAM ALIEN
                        If they open that book they can...
                (beat)
                        ...they can...

           If the Hologram Alien was a tea kettle the steam would be 
           coming out right about...

                                 MCBRIDE 
                        You’re about to lose your shit, aren’t 
                        you?

           VARIOUS ROOMS IN THE DECREPIT OLD BUILDING

           We cut in and out of each room while the Hologram Alien 
           begins to ROAR and SCREAM at McBride. He’s so loud that 
           everyone in the building can hear him. Several people plug 
           their ears.

                                 HOLOGRAM ALIEN (O.S.)
                        Find him now! Find him now! Find him now! 
                        FIND HIM RIGHT NOW!

           McBride walks out of the room and clears his throat. Even 
           he’s a little shaken.

                                 MCBRIDE
                        You heard the...guy. Get to work!

           INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Sylvester’s on the phone. It’s hard to do with handcuffs.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        I need a really big favor.

           INT. RODNEY’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Rodney’s on the phone. The Daily Show’s on MUTE.

                                 RODNEY
                        You know I hate you right now, and yet 
                        you still call. This baffles me.

           EXT. CONDO - NIGHT

           Sylvester gets out of a cab and approaches the front door. He 
           knocks and Lucy comes to the door.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Is Honey here?

                                 HONEY (O.S.)
                        Is that fucking Sylvester?!

                                 SYLVESTER
                        I guess she is.

           INT. CONDO - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

           Lucy leads Sylvester into the living room.

                (to Lucy)
                        Could you give us a minute?

           Lucy goes to her room.

                        What the hell are you doing here? How did 
                        you find me?

                                 SYLVESTER
                        My brother used to be one of those 
                        assholes that would serve people. He 
                        always told me he could find anyone. I 
                        thought he was full of shit, but...
                (beat)
                        ...here I am. You work with two Lucys and 
                        one of them was a 60 year old black 
                        woman. I made a judgement call.
                (beat)
                        We need to talk. Like now.

           INT. CONDO - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

           Sylvester just finished “the story.” It’s a lot to process. 
           The book is on the coffee table next to the ice cream.

                        spend your time with right now. We don’t 
                        like each other. Your brother just died.

                        You don’t even need me. Watch...

           She touches the book with her finger.

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        Open it.

           Sylvester opens it.

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        See, my job is done. Don’t close it and 
                        go do what you have to do. Best of luck.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        It’s not that simple. It closes on its 
                        own after a while. It’s like a security 
                        measure.

           Honey grabs the SPOON, places it in the book, and closes it.

                                 HONEY
                        A bookmark. Look at me. I’m a genius.

           A perfectly straight line begins to burn into the spoon along 
           the edge of the book. The part of the spoon that’s hanging 
           out detaches and falls off.

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        Holy shit. That’s like magic.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Or science.

                                 HONEY
                        Same thing.
                (beat)
                        I really have to go with you, don’t I? 

                                 SYLVESTER
                        You really do.

                                 HONEY
                        Fuck. Let me pee first.

           She walks off. Sylvester begins to read through the book.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Okay, owner of the book is dead...

           He turns the page and reads silently for a moment.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                (loud enough for Honey to hear)
                        We’re going to Albuquerque, New Mexico. 
                        Readiness has some fancy building there.

                                 HONEY (O.S.)
                        You have to drive. I don’t have a car.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Neither do I.

           We hear a door open and Honey walks back into the room.

                                 HONEY
                        Then what are we supposed to do?

           Sylvester thinks for a moment -- then he LAUGHS as we cut to:

           EXT. UPPER CLASS HOME - NIGHT

           Sylvester rings the doorbell. Honey looks at his handcuffs.

                                 HONEY
                        I hope Home Depot is open this time of 
                        night. Where else are we going to get 
                        something to cut those off?

           Sylvester reaches into his messenger bag and grabs the 
           powered down laser hacksaw.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        I just wish this thing worked.

           Honey looks at it and presses a button. BZZZZZ! The laser 
           hacksaw comes to life.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)

It cuts 
           like butter. He then carefully cuts off a piece of the 
           “bracelets” and they fall off. He turns it off and puts it 
           back in the bag.

                                 HONEY
                        That’s a cool doohickey you got there.

           Honey hits the doorbell again. The door opens to reveal... 
           Lesley. Sylvester’s ex-wife. In her underwear. With a 
           BEEFCAKE DUDE behind her. Lesley looks at Honey.

                                 LESLEY
                        Well, well, well... I see you’ve replaced 
                        me already.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        So have you.

                                 LESLEY
                        That doesn’t count. We don’t like each 
                        other.

                                 HONEY
                        Neither do we.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        I need to borrow the car.

                                 LESLEY
                        It’s my car. I don’t know if that’s a 
                        good idea, Sil...

                                 HONEY
                        Lady, stop being a fucking bitch and give 
                        us the goddamn keys!

           Beefcake Dude walks forward like he’s going to protect 
           Lesley.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        You should probably give us the keys.

           Honey points at Beefcake Dude.

                                 HONEY
                        Take another step and I will fuck you up!

           INT. LESLEY’S CAR - NIGHT

           Honey is driving. Sylvester is reading the book.

                                 HONEY

                        I’m going to figure out how to get to 
                        Albuquerque.

           Sylvester pulls an ATLAS out of the glove compartment.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        You know, I was talking to that book like 
                        it was Wilson before I found you. This is 
                        probably going to be easier now that I’m 
                        doing it with an actual person.

                                 HONEY
                        Yay for me.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        I have to ask, why didn’t you freak out 
                        when I mentioned aliens? Why’d you let 
                        that slide?

                                 HONEY
                        Did you see the weapons that guy was 
                        using back at the apartment? Where else 
                        would those come from?

                                 SYLVESTER
                        The future?

                                 HONEY
                        There’s no such thing as time travel, 
                        Sylvester.

           PFFT. WUMP -- WUMP -- WUMP.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Did you hear that?

           The car begins to swerve erratically.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        I think we just had a blow out. I’ve 
                        never had one before, but...
                (he turns around)
                        I think we had a blow out. You should 
                        pull over.

           POP! The back passenger window begins to spiderweb.

POP! POP! Her window and his window begin to 
           spiderweb.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        Why did...?

           He looks at her window. Then his.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        Maybe someone’s shooting at us?

           He looks out her window and sees a familiar Suburban. An 
           ANGRY MERCENARY is leaning out the BACK WINDOW and firing a 
           gun with a SILENCER! Honey SCREAMS.

           Sylvester looks down at his bag.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        Honey, duck!

           She looks and sees -- HE’S HOLDING THE LASER HACKSAW! He 
           throws it at the mercenary -- like a frisbee --

           -- the mercenary is about to be split in two, but -- the 
           handle hits his arm and the saw falls out the window -- 
           towards the ground. Sylvester’s humiliated. Then --

           -- everything’s -- in -- slow -- motion -- 

           -- as the saw lands under the Suburban and bounces up -- 

           -- a few inches off the ground -- 

           -- and the Suburban catches up with it.

           THE LASER HACKSAW CUTS OFF THE BOTTOM HALF OF THE BACK WHEEL!

           CHUNK! Sparks! The Suburban fishtails into another car! WHAM!

           Sylvester and Honey are so distracted they don’t realize --

           They’re about to drive through a red light. 

           EXT. INTERSECTION - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Here comes the BOOM! SMASH! A station wagon SLAMS into the 
           side of Lesley’s car and they FLIP OVER and land upside down. 

           We hear the insanity of cars SMASHING into other cars.

           INT. LESLEY'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Sylvester looks over at Honey. She seems okay.

                        Thank god.

                                 HONEY
                        We’re upside down, Sylvester! How is this 
                        okay?

                                 SYLVESTER
                        It’s no big deal. I did this earlier. 
                        Let’s get out of here.

                                 HONEY
                        Oh my god! Is that them?

           We see their P.O.V.: The suburban is directly across from 
           them. And it’s also upside down. They’re facing each other.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Don’t worry about it. I think they’re all 
                        dead.

           The PASSENGER MERCENARY is hanging upside down -- and his 
           eyes open up.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        Uh oh.

           He grabs his machine gun and aims it at Sylvester and Honey. 
           They both reach to try and undo their seatbelts. Panic. 
           Chaos. BAM! BAM! The window shatters.

           Honey remembers something. She reaches down into her purse -- 
           and removes Patrick’s gun. Sylvester covers his eyes -- 
           waiting for death -- 

           BAM! BAM! BAM! Honey and the mercenary are having an upside 
           down shoot-out with each other! BAM! Honey shoots the 
           mercenary dead. Sylvester opens his eyes.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        Maybe we should get out of the car now.

           EXT. INTERSECTION - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Sylvester and Honey climb out of the car.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        If any of you are hurt, I’m very sorry.
                (looks at the Suburban)
                        Except for you guys. You’re fucking 
                        assholes.

           He grabs Honey by her arm and they bolt off into the 
           distance.

                        Your ex is going to be pissed.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        It doesn’t matter. I was planning on 
                        running it into a wall before I gave it 
                        back to her anyway.

           Honey LAUGHS.

                                 HONEY
                        Time for Plan B, Sylvester. Got one?

           He sees something. We PULL BACK to REVEAL -- they’re standing 
           in front of a TRAIN STATION.

           INT. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

           Sylvester and Honey wait patiently while an ALOOF EMPLOYEE 
           prepares their tickets. In the background, Sylvester sees a 
           YOUNG GUY approach a receptive YOUNG GIRL and flirt with her. 
           She takes a pen and writes her number on his hand.

                                 ALOOF EMPLOYEE
                        Here you go. Two tickets to Albuquerque.

           Honey grabs the tickets and they walk away.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Did you see that?

                                 HONEY
                        The two love birds?

                                 SYLVESTER
                        I’ve never once had a girl do anything 
                        like that to me.
                (beat)
                        Knowing that’s never going to happen...

           He trails off. Honey thinks this over. They both stand there 
           silent and slightly depressed while waiting for their train. 

           It suddenly becomes SILENT in the station. Everyone has 
           curiously turned their attention a TV hanging from the 
           ceiling. It’s the NIGHTLY NEWS. Honey nudges Sylvester.

                                 ANCHOR
                        ...and on top of bizarre weather 
                        patterns, there are now reports of city 
                        wide power outages in London, Moscow, and 
                        New York City.

           DEEP SPACE 

           This is the “P.O.V.” of the ALIEN SPACESHIP. It’s heading 
           towards earth. We SMASH CUT to--

           NEW YORK CITY: The power in the entire city is turning off. 
           Then on. Then off again. Car accidents. Looting.

           LONDON: No power. 

           MOSCOW: No power.

           BACK IN THE STATION: They look at each other. Shit.

           INT. UPSIDE DOWN SUBURBAN - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

           We hear SIRENS and all the usual shenanigans that follow a 
           major car accident. Angry Mercenary wakes up in the backseat. 
           Disoriented. He’s not sure how he got there, then...

           P.O.V.: Through the front windows of the Train Station he 
           sees Sylvester and Honey. Uh oh.

           INT. TRAIN - SYLVESTER’S ROOM - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

           They set down their stuff.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Let’s go to the dining car.

                                 HONEY
                        I’m not hungry.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Me neither. But that’s not the point. 
                        This train is going to get there when it 
                        gets there. We can’t make it go any 
                        faster. We might as well enjoy this brief 
                        time we have.
                (beat)
                        Plus, I kind of want to be around people, 
                        you know? This may be our last chance.

           Honey thinks this over for a moment, and she understands.

           INT. TRAIN - DINING CAR - NIGHT - LATER

           They’re looking at the times Sylvester wrote on his arm and 
           scribbling them on a piece of paper. Mid-conversation:

                                 HONEY
                        No, you add the countdown number to the

                (beat)
                        No, that’s not it either.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        I’m horrible at math.

                                 HONEY
                        I’m probably less horrible.

           Sylvester sets the book on the table.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Can you open it for me? I want to take a 
                        look at this thing while you’re figuring 
                        that out.

           They both reach for it -- and their fingertips inadvertently 
           touch. He pulls his hand away. Did he like touching her? 
           Maybe he does. He begins to flip through the book.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                (reading a page)
                        This is great. If everyone at Readiness 
                        was alive it says, “You should not read 
                        any further. This is just a boring 
                        technical manual. Please give it to the 
                        first employee you meet. We’re sorry for 
                        taking up your valuable time.”
                (laughs and turns the page)
                        Oh my god! If we hadn’t bought train 
                        tickets it shows you how to steal a car. 
                        I wish we did that.
                (turns a page)
                        It also shows how to hotwire a car!

           Sylvester is more amused by this than Honey. She keeps 
           screwing with the numbers. Sylvester turns a page.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        How to “use your womanly charms to get 
                        free gasoline?” I may actually love this 
                        book. I want to marry it.

           They hear someone at the table next to them talking about the 
           BLACKOUTS, TIDAL WAVES etc. They look at each other. No words 
           are necessary. The WAITRESS walks up to their table.

                                 HONEY
                        We’re not getting any food. But I would 
                        like to order two Wild Turkey shots.

                                 SYLVESTER 
                        And I want a red beer.

                                 WAITRESS
                        No problem, sir. Anything you need.

           The waitress leaves.

                                 SYLVESTER 
                        She actually knew what a red beer was. 
                        I’m going to tip her half my bank 
                        account. I’m not even kidding.
                (beat)
                        If you’re looking to get drunk I can deal 
                        with that.

           Honey keeps screwing with the numbers.

                                 HONEY
                        What do we have to do in Albuquerque?

                                 SYLVESTER
                (looks at the page)
                        Ehh, it’s complicated.
                (turns the page)
                        Ooh, there’s a maze in here.

                                 HONEY
                        I like mazes.

           Honey looks up from the numbers.

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        I got it. We have ten hours and thirty 
                        minutes, give or take a few, or until 
                        1:00 P.M. tomorrow.

           The waitress brings back the shots and the red beer.

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        I wasn’t planning on getting drunk. I 
                        just thought we should do a shot for 
                        Patrick.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Can’t argue with that.

           They hold up their shots.

                                 HONEY
                        A friend of mine once said, “If you 
                        weren’t related to one of your family 
                        members, and you’d still be friends with 
                        them otherwise, then you should consider 
                        yourself lucky. Because that...”
                (she tears up a little)

                        “...because that is guaranteed to no 
                        one.”

                                 SYLVESTER
                        I hear that.
                (beat)
                        You know, I think I would have become 
                        friends with Patrick if things hadn’t 
                        gone the way they did.

                                 HONEY
                        So do I. So do I.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        To Patrick. The friend I almost had.

           They take their shots.

           INT. TRAIN - HALLWAY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           A MYSTERIOUS GUY (35) is walking down the hallway. We can’t 
           see his face.

           INT. TRAIN - DINING CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

                                 HONEY
                        You never said what happened with your 
                        wife...or your ex-wife...whatever she is. 
                        Did I mention I don’t like her?

                                 SYLVESTER
                (laughs)
                        Yeah, you did. It fell apart the way 
                        things usually fall apart. I knew things 
                        weren’t working. I’d lie in bed at night 
                        and worry about us. I kept all of this to 
                        myself, because I thought one person 
                        worrying was enough. We didn’t need two. 
                (beat)
                        But then the papers came. Turns out she 
                        was lying next to me in bed, every night, 
                        thinking the same thing. Difference is, 
                        she did something about it. And here I 
                        am. Drinking a red beer.

                                 HONEY
                        I’ll give one of those a shot.

           She motions for the waitress.

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        I’ll have the same but with V8. I’m 
                        allergic to clams and shellfish.
                                                   (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                 SYLVESTER
                        There’s no clams. It’s tomato juice.

                                 HONEY
                        It’s Clamato, genius.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Right.

           MOMENTS LATER: The waitress gives her the drink and Honey 
           takes a sip.

                                 HONEY 
                        This tastes like alcoholic tomato soup.

                                 SYLVESTER
                (a little drunk)
                        I’m going to get some shots.

           Honey is amused by drunk Sylvester. He gets up and leaves. 
           She sees that someone is setting up KARAOKE in the corner.

           INT. TRAIN - RANDOM CART - CONTINUOUS

           An OLD COUPLE doing the crossword. KNOCK KNOCK. Mysterious 
           Guy, his face is still off-screen, walks into their car, 
           holding a pair of pictures.

                                 MYSTERIOUS GUY (O.S.)
                        Excuse me, I’m looking for my friends.

           The pictures are of Sylvester and Honey.

           INT. TRAIN - RESTAURANT AREA - AT THE BAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Sylvester’s waiting for his shots.

                                 GUY WITH A BINDER (O.S.)
                (loudspeaker)
                        Honey. You’re up.

           The BARTENDER sets TWO SHOTS in front of Sylvester. Honey 
           walks on the stage. The opening of “LIVING ON A PRAYER” by 
           BON JOVI blasts out of the speakers.

                                 SYLVESTER 
                        Mother of god.

           Sylvester downs the shots. WHAM! WHAM! He runs to the stage 
           and jumps up and grabs the other microphone.

                                 HONEY
                        This is my song.
                                                   (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                 SYLVESTER
                        This is my song! It’s my favorite song of 
                        all time. Watch, I don’t even need the 
                        teleprompter.

                                 HONEY
                        Neither do I.

           They’re missing the beginning of the first verse. They turn 
           and face each other to make sure neither of them are looking 
           at the TELEPROMPTER.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        I’m watching you.

                                 SYLVESTER/HONEY
                (singing loud)
                        She says we’ve got to hold on to what 
                        we’ve got. ‘Cause it doesn’t make a 
                        difference if we make it or not. We’ve 
                        got each other and that’s a lot. For 
                        love...
                (beat)
                        We’ll give it a shot!

           As they face each other, a weird sense of admiration is 
           clearly forming. Holy shit. This might actually be romantic.

           BACK AT THE TABLE - MOMENTS LATER

           Sylvester and Honey sit back down. Sylvester is drunk.

                                 HONEY
                        Normally, this would be the time for 
                        celebration shots, but I think you’re 
                        good on the booze front. I’ll go close 
                        the tab.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Dope.

           She gets up and heads to the bar. Sylvester begins to 
           drunkenly rap to himself.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        If anyone in the club gots a buzz tonight 
                        say, “hell yeah!”
                (beat)
                        Hell yeah! If anyone in the club gots 
                        some munchies tonight say, “hell yeah!”
                (beat)
                        Hell yeah!
                                                   (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)           Sylvester’s facing a glass door and can see down the hallway. 
           He sees Mysterious Guy. Huh. He seems mysterious.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        If anyone in the club gots some nachos 
                        tonight say...
                (quietly to himself)
                        ...hell yeah.

           Sylvester gets up to check him out. Something’s not right.

           INT. TRAIN - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Sylvester’s following Mysterious Guy from a distance. He sees 
           Mysterious Guy let himself into their room. Time to man up. 
           Sylvester drunkenly approaches his room.

           INT. TRAIN - SYLVESTER’S ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Sylvester enters the room to find Mysterious Guy going 
           through their things. It’s the Angry Mercenary from the 
           upside down Suburban!

                                 SYLVESTER
                (drunkenly)
                        I threw a hacksaw at you!

                                 ANGRY MERCENARY
                        Where’s the book?!

                                 SYLVESTER
                        What book?

                                 ANGRY MERCENARY
                        He’s Just Not That Into You. What do you 
                        think? The goddamn red book. Where is it? 
                        Where’s the girl that can open it?

           Sylvester stands there drunk for a moment, and then... 

           ...something inside him does a 180. He’s not going to be a 
           pussy anymore.

                                 SYLVESTER 
                        Alright, motherfucker.

           Sylvester puts up his fists.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        I’ve had it with this crap. Put up your 
                        shit!

                                 ANGRY MERCENARY
                        My what?
                                                        (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                 SYLVESTER
                        Your shit. Put up your shit.

                                 ANGRY MERCENARY
                        My fists?

                                 SYLVESTER
                        That’s what I said.

           Sylvester is swaying back and forth.

                                 ANGRY MERCENARY
                        I bet you’ve never thrown a punch in your 
                        life.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        That’s because I never had a motherfucker 
                        to punch.
                (beat)
                        Come on! I got liquid balls.

                                 ANGRY MERCENARY
                        Don’t you mean liquid courage....

           But before he can even finish his sentence...

           ....Sylvester throws a DEVASTATING PUNCH! 

           Or not.

                                 ANGRY MERCENARY (CONT’D)
                        That didn’t even hurt.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        It hurt me!

           Sylvester shakes his fist.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        Ow!

                                 ANGRY MERCENARY
                        Do you want to know how to throw a punch 
                        correctly? It’s not that hard. I’ll show 
                        you.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Really? That’s awfully nice of...

           WHOOM! He punches Sylvester in the face. Sylvester clutches 
           his nose.
                                                   (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                (muffled)
                        You’re right. That was more effective.
                (beat)
                        I think you broke some things.

           Sylvester lets go of his nose.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        That was cool, but how about this!?

           He throws a quick punch, but before it even connects with his 
           face... WHAM! Angry Mercenary punches him again. Sylvester 
           stumbles back against the door of the room.

           Angry Mercenary pulls out a large knife. Fuck.

                                 ANGRY MERCENARY
                        Enough with the fisticuffs.

           Sylvester is leaning forward in pain, breathing heavily. 
           Angry Mercenary takes a step towards him, then...

           Out of nowhere -- Sylvester lets out a badass cry of rage -- 
           jumps forward --

           -- and headbutts Angry Mercenary! WHACK!

           Sylvester sways back and forth -- and crumples to the ground.

           HE KNOCKED HIMSELF OUT.

           Angry Mercenary is very confused. It’s not usually this easy.

           INT. TRAIN - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Honey wanders down the hallway.

                                 HONEY
                (quietly to herself)
                        Where’d you go, you drunk bastard.

           She opens the door.

           INT. TRAIN - SYLVESTER'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Before Honey looks in and realizes what’s going on she says:

                                 HONEY
                        What’s up?

           Then she sees Angry Mercenary looking for the book. Sylvester 
           is unconscious on the ground.
                                                        (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                 ANGRY MERCENARY
                        The jig.

                                 HONEY
                        Um...

           She looks down at Sylvester. Angry Mercenary brings out the 
           knife again.

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        That’s a big knife.

                                 ANGRY MERCENARY
                        Yes, it is.

           She reaches into her purse and pulls out...

           ...Patrick’s gun.

                                 ANGRY MERCENARY (CONT’D)
                        Oh, fuck.

           Honey aims it at him.

                                 HONEY
                        Oh, fuck, indeed.

           She pulls the trigger. CLICK. Nothing happens. He LAUGHS.

                                 ANGRY MERCENARY
                        You stupid bitch. You left the safety on.

           She looks at the safety and pushes it.

                                 HONEY
                        Thanks for the tip.

           BOOM! She fires. Somewhere off-screen, Angry Mercenary is now 
           a bloody mess. We JUMP CUT TO BLACK--

                                 HONEY (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Sylvester. Sylvester. Wake up.

           We FADE IN on--

           INT. TRAIN - SYLVESTER’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Sylvester wakes up, clutching his forehead. He sees the blood 
           and gore all over the walls.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Did I do that?
                                         (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                 HONEY
                        I just found you here unconscious.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        I broke my forehead.
                (looks down at his clothes)
                        At least I didn’t get any of that...
                (motions towards the gore)
                        ...on me.

           He stands up and turns around. We (and Honey) see that his 
           entire back is covered with bits and pieces of the bad guy.

                                 HONEY
                        Uh, Sylvester?

           He turns around. His front side is totally clean.

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        Do you have a change of clothes with you?

                                 SYLVESTER
                        No, why?
                (thinks for a moment)
                        There are bits and pieces of dude on me, 
                        aren’t there?

                                 HONEY
                        Yep.

           Sylvester turns his head and tries to look at his back.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Thaaaaaaaaat’s morbid.

           INT. TRAIN - SYLVESTER'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Sylvester is now wearing a tight pair of Honey’s sweatpants.

                                 HONEY
                        What are we going to do with the body?

                                 SYLVESTER
                        We can put it in a cubby.

                                 HONEY
                        What the hell is a cubby?
                (beat)
                        Look, I’ll figure something out. Go see 
                        if you can find some cleaning supplies.

           Honey stops and looks around. They hear the sound of a walkie 
           talkie. Uh oh.
                                                   (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                 MERCENARY ON THE WALKIE (O.S.)
                        Come in. Over.

           Sylvester and Honey look at the walkie talkie. Neither of 
           them are sure what to do. Sylvester picks it up and looks out 
           the window. 

           Honey turns to see what he’s looking at. They look out the 
           window for a long time. Silence. Thinking. Then...

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Now, keep in mind I may be wrong about 
                        this...
                (beat)
                        ...but there’s a small chance we may be 
                        fucked.

                                 HONEY
                        You might be on to something here.

                                 MERCENARY ON THE WALKIE (O.S.)
                        We’ll be at your location within seconds.

           EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           FIVE HELICOPTERS APPROACH THE TRAIN! They swoop over the top 
           and form a straight line. A perfect row of helicopters move 
           along with the train.

           We see inside Helicopter #1: A FEMALE MERCENARY WITH A GUN is 
           sitting in a seat bolted to the helicopter, with a LARGE 
           GATLING GUN at her disposal.

           Inside Helicopter #2 through #4: Quick cuts. Four ski-masked 
           mercenaries in each of them.

           Inside Helicopter #5: Red is holding a LARGE BLACK CASE.

           EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           The helicopters continue to fly above the train. But then the 
           fifth helicopter, flying behind the others, pulls to the 
           right and flies ahead of the pack, passing the train.

           INT. TRAIN - SYLVESTER’S ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Sylvester and Honey see this.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        What the hell are they doing?
                                                               (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)           EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           The fifth helicopter flies far ahead of the train and stops, 
           hovering and waiting.

           INT. HELICOPTER #5 - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Red looks down and watches as the train is approaching him. 
           PILOT #5 turns around and looks at him.

                                 PILOT #5
                        Shut it down.

                                 RED
                        Aye aye, captain.

           Red reaches into the BLACK CASE and takes out a large, silver 
           METAL DISC. He looks out at the coming train and --

           -- then he TOSSES IT OUT OF THE HELICOPTER!

           EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           We fall with the metal disc. Falling... Falling... Then... 
           PING! It hits the train and magnetizes to it. 

           BZZT! A large WAVE OF BLUE ELECTRICITY shoots out of the disc 
           and envelops the entire train!

           INT. TRAIN - SYLVESTER’S ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           The train lurches to a halt. Sylvester and Honey fall to the 
           ground. We hear other people SCREAMING and SHOUTING in the 
           train. The lights go off. Pitch black.

           For a moment we hear nothing. Just silence.

           INT. HELICOPTER #2 - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           A mercenary attaches a BLACK ROPE to a hook.

           EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           All the mercenaries rappel out of their helicopters in 
           unison, gliding down to the stopped train below. Red doesn’t 
           bother to slide all the way down. He jumps with ten feet to 
           go. He’s a determined motherfucker.

           INT. TRAIN - ANOTHER ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           A couple has woken up in TOTAL DARKNESS. Before they can even 
           begin to wonder what’s going on -- their window SHATTERS -- 
           and a mercenary flies into the room as they SCREAM.
                                                        (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)           INT. TRAIN - AND YET ANOTHER ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Several mercenaries land in a pile of shattered glass.

           INT. TRAIN - SYLVESTER’S ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Sylvester and Honey jump up.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        RUN AWAY!

                                 HONEY
                        RUN AWAY!

           They do.

           INT. TRAIN - LAST COMPARTMENT - NIGHT

           In the last compartment on the EAST END of the train 
           (Sylvester’s room is somewhere close to the middle) a group 
           of mercenaries stand in the darkness.

                                 MERCENARY IN THE DARK
                        It’s dark as a black man’s balls in here. 
                        Where are those flashlights?

           Another mercenary takes out an ALIEN FLASHLIGHT ORB from 
           earlier -- but it’s one of the blue orbs.

           Mercenary In The Dark #1 grabs it and presses the button.

                                 MERCENARY IN THE DARK (CONT’D)
                        This thing ain’t working. Anyone got some 
                        alien batteries? Double As or some shit?

           We hear a TICKING noise.

                                 MERCENARY IN THE DARK #2
                        Is that thing tickin’?

           BOOM! They explode! Okay, the blue ones aren’t flashlights.

           INT. TRAIN - LAST COMPARTMENT - NIGHT

           Sylvester and Honey rush into the last compartment. They 
           COUGH and wave their hands around. The room is filled with 
           smoke that’s slowly going out the shattered window.

                                 HONEY
                (plugging her nose)
                        Ew! It’s smells like burnt dude in here.

           They see the charred remains of unlucky mercenaries.
                                                                 (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                 SYLVESTER
                        Good guess.

           They stand away from the window so no one can see them.

                                 HONEY
                        What are we supposed to do?

           We hear on Sylvester’s walkie talkie:

                                 MERCENARY VOICE (O.S.)
                        I think they’re in the last compartment 
                        in the east section of the train. Repeat, 
                        I believe they’re in the last compartment 
                        of the train. 
                (beat)
                        If they try to escape we’ll take them 
                        out. Over.

           Honey takes a careful look out the window.

           P.O.V.: We see Helicopter #1 hovering close to the ground 
           near the end of the train. A spotlight is moving back and 
           forth. Female Mercenary With A Gun is ready to open fire on 
           them at any moment.

                                 HONEY
                        Okay, that’s a little excessive.

           Sylvester looks down for a second.

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        We are so fucked.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Maybe not.

           Sylvester grabs a small handgun from one of the bodies.

                                 HONEY
                        Uh, Sylvester? Their gun is a lot bigger.

           Sylvester ignores her and cocks it.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        This might be what you call a genius 
                        moment.

           INT. TRAIN - HALLWAY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Red and a group of mercenaries are rushing down the hallway 
           with the flashlights, not grenades, looking for Sylvester and 
           Honey. They’re armed to the teeth and not to be fucked with. 
           Red is leading the charge.
                                                   (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)

           Sylvester aims the gun at the ceiling and fires. BAM! BAM! 
           BAM! Click. Click. No more bullets.

                                 HONEY
                        Actually, I think they call that a brain 
                        fart.

           INT. HELICOPTER #1 - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

           The helicopter is hovering over the stopped train. The 
           HELICOPTER PILOT barks into his headset.

                                 HELICOPTER PILOT
                        I just heard gunshots! Can anyone confirm 
                        the kill? Over.

                                 SYLVESTER (O.S.)
                (over the headphones)
                        Come in. Over.

                                 HELICOPTER PILOT
                        Is that you, Kyle? What happened?

           INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Sylvester is holding a walkie talkie. He doesn’t seem 
           surprised this is working. Honey does.

                                 SYLVESTER
                (shrugs)
                        Um? Yes? I’m Kyle. The man and woman are 
                        as dead as they can be. We also have the 
                        book. Over.

           Sylvester grabs the book and extends his arm out the 
           shattered window.

           EXT. TRAIN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           We see his arm hanging out of the train holding the book.

           INT. HELICOPTER #1 - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           FEMALE MERCENARY WITH A GUN looks down and sees the book.

                                 FEMALE MERCENARY WITH A GUN
                (yelling)
                        He’s got it!

                                 SYLVESTER (O.S.)
                        We need to get out of here as soon as 
                        possible.

           move closer to the train.

           INT. TRAIN - LAST COMPARTMENT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Sylvester starts to put on a charred uniform.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Put one on, now!

           INT. TRAIN - NIGHT - HALLWAY

           Red and the mercenaries are still rushing towards the end of 
           the train as if nothing has changed.

                                 RED
                (barks to the others)
                        That’s was supposed to be my kill! Let’s 
                        confirm it! Make sure we get her hands!

           EXT. TRAIN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Sylvester and Honey climb out the window in full mercenary 
           attire. Sylvester falls to the ground in what looks like a 
           painful manner. Honey follows him with a little more grace. 
           They rush towards the ladder. 

           Sylvester has a MESSENGER BAG slung over his shoulder, 
           presumably containing the book. He lets Honey climb the 
           ladder first. He waits nervously behind her.

           INT. TRAIN - HALLWAY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Red and the mercenaries are about to arrive in the last 
           compartment...

           EXT. HELICOPTER #1 - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Sylvester and Honey are getting closer to the top.

                                 HONEY
                        I’M SCARED OF HEIGHTS!

                                 SYLVESTER
                        THAT’S UNFORTUNATE!

           INT. TRAIN - LAST COMPARTMENT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           The mercenaries storm into the room to find...

           INT. HELICOPTER #1 - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Female Mercenary With A The Gun helps Honey into the 
           helicopter.

                        Where’s the book?!

           She points down at Sylvester.

           Red sees a lot of dead mercenaries and nothing else. Uh oh.

                                 RED
                        WHAT THE FUCK?!

           INT. HELICOPTER #1 - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Honey aims a gun at FEMALE MERCENARY WITH A GUN.

                                 HONEY
                        How did you guys fall for that? Are you 
                        special ed mercenaries?

           Honey takes off her ski mask as Sylvester climbs in.

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        God, that thing was hot as hell. My hair 
                        has to smell awful now.

           Sylvester grabs a gun and aims it at Helicopter Pilot as he 
           turns around.

                                 RED (O.S.)
                        I don’t know what happened but the only 
                        dead people in here are ours! Over!

                                 SYLVESTER
                        I’d appreciate if you could get us as far 
                        away from here as possible. Vamanos, por 
                        favor.

                                 PILOT #1
                        Fuck you. Got a way to make me?

           Honey KICKS Female Mercenary With A Gun very hard -- she 
           loses her balance -- AND FALLS OUT OF THE HELICOPTER!

                                 PILOT #1 (CONT’D)
                (deadpan)
                        I see. Where you wanna go?

           EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           We see Helicopter #1 fly off into the distance.

HELICOPTER #1 - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

           Honey and Sylvester are relaxing for a moment.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        There’s no reason that should have 
                        worked.

                                 HONEY
                        I may be a lot of things and a lot of 
                        those things aren’t that great. But I’m 
                        not the kind of girl that won’t give 
                        credit where credit is due. 

                                 SYLVESTER
                        I appreciate that but there’s a small 
                        problem.

                                 HONEY
                        Yeah?

                                 SYLVESTER
                        There are four helicopters chasing us.

           Honey turns and looks where Sylvester’s looking. Sylvester 
           aims his gun at Pilot #1.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        RUN AWAY!

                                 HONEY
                        RUN AWAY!

           BAM! Sylvester SCREAMS and turns around.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Someone shot me in the ass!

           We see Red leaning out of helicopter #5 with the same 
           CROSSBOW GUN they used to shoot the cow in the earlier scene. 
           Honey looks at Sylvester’s wound.

                                 HONEY
                        It’s nothing. It looks like they shot you 
                        with a BB gun. I’ll take you to the 
                        doctor after we save the world.

           FOUR HELICOPTERS ARE ON THEIR TAIL. 

           The sun is rising. Good time for a chase. And we’re off!

           WHOOSH! Helicopters are chasing them through the forest --

           Through the trees -- over the trees --
                                                             (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)           Honey looks at the B.F.G. Sylvester nods.

                                 SYLVESTER 
                        I can’t. I’d have to sit on my bullet 
                        wound.

                                 HONEY 
                        I’d do it, but...

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Scared of heights. Right. Fuck.
                (to the pilot)
                        Stop running away from them. Circle back.

           Sylvester climbs into the seat and grabs the gun. His 
           helicopter turns back and --

           -- SYLVESTER OPENS FIRE! THE GUN IS MAKING SYLVESTER SHAKE 
           LIKE CRAZY.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        THIS... IS... FUCKING... CRAZY... MAN!

           He doesn’t hit a helicopter. SHRED! Bullets rip through a 
           tree -- and the top half of it topples over -- falling onto a 
           helicopter! IT EXPLODES!

           Sylvester’s helicopter circles back again and he misses again 
           -- but the bullets rip through a POWER LINE! BZZT! SPARKS 
           FLY! The power line detaches and falls --

           -- the helicopter flies out of the way to avoid it --

           -- AND CRASHES INTO ANOTHER HELICOPTER! BOOM!

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        I hope I don’t start a forest fire!

           One left. #5. Red’s helicopter. Red is firing a machine gun 
           out of his helicopter. PING! PING! They take a few bullets. 
           Sylvester fires back -- CHUNK! BOOM! 

           The rotor on the helicopter explodes! The helicopter spins 
           out of control and falls out of view.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        Get us out of here!

           RED’S HELICOPTER

           Before it crashes... Red FIRES a RAPPEL line into a TREE and 
           escapes in the nick of time! Then -- BOOOOOOOOOM! 

           E-NOR-MOUS EXPLOSION.

                                 HONEY 
                (ecstatic)
                        YAY! I DIDN’T KNOW YOU HAD IT IN YA!

                                 SYLVESTER
                        NEITHER DID I! AND I’M STILL SHITFACED!

           HIGH ABOVE A SMALL TOWN IN NEW MEXICO - LATER

           The sun is about to come up. They have been flying for some 
           time. Sylvester aims the gun at the pilot.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        TAKE US DOWN! THIS IS WHERE WE GET OFF!

           Pilot #1 nods and does as he was asked.

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - EARLY MORNING - LATER

           The helicopter begins to descend towards the ground and lands 
           on a high school football field.

           INT. HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

           The pilot turns and looks at Sylvester and Honey.

                                 PILOT #1
                        Now what?

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Turn this off. Shut it down or whatever.
                (beat)
                        Now take off your helmet.

                                 PILOT #1
                        Okay, whatever you want.

           Pilot #1 takes his helmet off. WHAM! Sylvester hits his head 
           with the butt of his gun. Out cold.

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - FOOTBALL FIELD - MOMENTS LATER

           Sylvester and Honey jump out, land on the dewy grass, and 
           begin to walk off the field. Sylvester has the messenger bag 
           over his shoulder.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        I know it’s not the right town but I 
                        couldn’t let them know where we were 
                        going. We don’t know if that ‘copter has 
                        a tracking device or something like that. 
                        We’ll have to drive the rest of the way.

                                 HONEY
                        We have no car and I sure as hell don’t 
                        have enough cash to rent one. Do you?

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Not anymore. I left most of my life 
                        savings to that waitress on the train.

                        Why would you do that?

                                 SYLVESTER
                        It’s the end of the world. She could 
                        spend it on something nice. Like a pony. 
                        Besides, we don’t need money.

                        We have this.

           EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Honey is hot-wiring a Volvo while Sylvester is reading her 
           the instructions.

                                 HONEY
                        This isn’t so hard. Thank you, book.

                                 SYLVESTER
                (holding his head)
                        I should have stopped at zero drinks. I 
                        feel like someone dropped a TV on my 
                        head.

                                 HONEY
                        Is there a hangover cure in there?

                                 SYLVESTER
                (while turning the pages)
                        Why would there be...?
                (beat)
                        Oh...there is.
                (reading)
                        Okay, 2 ibuprofen, a bottle of water, and 
                        3 gas station taquitos? Huh.

                        Shouldn’t we be near Glorieta?

           Sylvester is looks at the ATLAS. Honey looks out the window.

                        Sylvester...

           He looks out the window. We PULL BACK to REVEAL that the 
           entire town has been destroyed by a tornado. IT’S A DISASTER 
           ZONE. Honey begins to drive even faster.

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)

                        I don’t know. This isn’t the map to the 
                        building. It’s a map to a map.

                                 HONEY
                        What?

           EXT. SMALL MESA - DAY - SOME TIME LATER

           Sylvester and Honey are climbing up a SMALL MESA.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        There’s a device buried at the top with a 
                        map to the finish line. The book just has 
                        the location of the device. And it should 
                        be right...
                (looks at the book)
                        ...here.

                                 HONEY
                        Fuck you.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Me? What did I do?

                                 HONEY
                        I was talking to the book.

           We rise up with them as they reach the top -- and they find --

           A DESTROYED HOUSE IS LYING ON ITS SIDE -- RIGHT ON THE SPOT!

                        Glorieta is twenty miles away! How did 
                        the tornado bring it all the way here?

                                 SYLVESTER
                        I don’t know.  What are we --?

           He looks at the book. We see the bottom of the page:

           IF YOU NEED TO MOVE A HOUSE DISLOCATED BY A TORNADO...
           TURN TO PAGE 276

           They turn the page. We hold on them reading it.

                                 HONEY 
                        Oh, come the fuck on! This is ridiculous.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        There’s no goddamn way that would work.

                                 HONEY
                        This book is full of shit.

           They read the detailed instructions as we SMASH CUT TO--

           A FEW MINUTES LATER: Sylvester and Honey stretch. 

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        That is the second coolest thing I’ve 
                        done with my hips.

           We CRANE UP to see --

           -- THEY MOVED THE HOUSE TWENTY FEET TO THE NORTH! 

                                 SYLVESTER
                        What’s the coolest thing you’ve done with 
                        your hips?

           Honey sees that Sylvester has some DIRT on his arm. 

                                 HONEY 
                        Hey, you got something on you. 
                (she wipes it off)
                        Let’s go dig up the device.

           She walks out of frame.

           (cid:13)           MOMENTS LATER: They’re digging on their hands and knees where 
           the house was. They find a LARGE METAL DEVICE. Honey stands 
           on a mark that reads: STAND HERE.

                                 COMPUTER VOICE
                        Hold blank page in front of laser.

           Honey opens up the book and a LASER scans the BLANK PAGE. 
           After it’s done, Honey turns the book to find that a MAP is 
           SLOWLY APPEARING on the page that is no longer blank.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        That’s awesome.

           INT. VOLVO - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Sylvester’s looking at the NEW MAP and the ATLAS.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        We’re actually going near Santa Fe. We 
                        stay on the interstate until exit 78, 
                        then we’ll turn when we see a sign for 
                        the campgrounds. If you drive fast as 
                        hell we’ll get there in two hours.
                (beat)
                        Do you want me to drive?

                                 HONEY
                        I’m good.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Do you mind if I sleep, then? I know it’s 
                        rude but I’m exhausted, from the house, 
                        and because I haven’t slept in a 
                        day...aaaaand I’m hungover.

                                 HONEY
                        That’s fine. I’m both fine and dandy, all 
                        things considered. Adrenaline has way 
                        more of a kick than Starbucks.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Wake me up when you get there. 

           Sylvester closes his eyes and tilts the seat back. Honey sits 
           there as Sylvester begins to fall asleep. She thinks for a 
           moment and comes to a realization.

                                 HONEY 
                        Sylvester?

           Sylvester responds without opening his eyes. He’s only half-
           awake.
                                                                 (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                 (MORE)

                        Yeah?

                                 HONEY
                        Why are you here?

                                 SYLVESTER
                        In the car? 
                (yawns)
                        Because we stole it?

                                 HONEY
                        You didn’t have to come along. It wasn’t 
                        your responsibility.

                        need help.

                                 HONEY
                        Even before that, you were going to go 
                        off and do this on your own. You didn’t 
                        even hesitate.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        I probably hesitated a little. I don’t 
                        remember all the details.

           We hold on Honey for a moment.

                                 HONEY
                        I’d never have opened the book in the 
                        first place if it wasn’t for you. I was 
                        scared and...
                (beat)
                        Sylvester, I just wanted to say...
                (beat)
                        I just...
                (beat)
                        ...you’re good people.

           We hear SNORING. She turns to see that Sylvester is asleep.

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        You didn’t hear a word I said.

                                 SYLVESTER
                (waking up, mumbly)
                        What? Who said...?
                (without opening his eyes)
                        You know what’s awesome? They don’t know 
                        where we are. They don’t even know where 
                        we’re going.

                        I mean, we didn’t even know where we were 
                        going until the laser printed that map. 
                        There’s absolutely no possible way they 
                        can find us.

           INT. CARGO PLANE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           McBride and several dozen mercenaries are inside the cargo 
           plane. McBride approaches a large FLAT SCREEN and Tech 
           Mercenary #1.

                                 MCBRIDE
                        Find ‘em. Bring up the target.

           Tech Mercenary begins to punch away at the keys as we 
           intercut with --

           A SATELLITE IN SPACE

           Spinning around, repositioning, and we PUSH IN on a LARGE 
           LENS and then we see --

           SATELLITE P.O.V.: We’re zooming in -- flying towards the 
           earth’s surface until we find --

           THE COW FROM EARLIER IN THE MOVIE

           In X-RAY VISION we see a glowing GREEN DOT where the cow was 
           shot with the CROSSBOW GUN. McBride stares at the satellite 
           video of the cow on the flat screen.

                                 MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
                        How about you bring up the other thing we 
                        shot with the tracker, genius?

           Tech Mercenary #1 punches away at the buttons again and we 
           INTERCUT with the SATELLITE doing its thing and they get a 
           NEW VIDEO on screen.

           It’s SATELLITE VIDEO of Sylvester and Honey’s Volvo at a GAS 
           STATION. In X-RAY VISION we see the glowing GREEN DOT in 
           Sylvester’s ass while he’s sleeping.

           NOTE: This will be done in a tasteful and comedic fashion.

           INT. GAS STATION - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Honey approaches the counter with the book in hand, two 
           BOTTLES OF WATER, and IBUPROFEN.

                                 HONEY
                (she looks down at the book)
                        I’ll need...three taquitos?

           GAS STATION HICK grabs the TAQUITOS and scans the water.

                        That’ll be 34.26, m’am.

           Honey thinks for a moment then looks down at the book. She 
           opens it up and turns to another page. Gas Station Hick looks 
           confused. Honey reads the page and sets the open book on the 
           counter, unbuttons her top button, and arches her back.

                                 HONEY
                (in a “sexy voice”)
                        So...how long have you worked at this gas 
                        station?

           This isn’t sexy. It’s just awkward.

           ANGLE ON: The Page. “HOW TO USE YOUR WOMANLY CHARMS TO GET 
           FREE GASOLINE.” There’s a diagram of a girl unbuttoning her 
           top button and examples of “SEXY POSES.”

           Honey turns her head and attempts to toss her hair back. 

                                 GAS STATION HICK
                        What the hell you doin’?

           Gas Station Hick isn’t having any of it. Honey gives up. 

           ANGLE ON: The page. “IF THIS DOESN’T WORK, TURN TO PAGE 49.”

           She turns to the next page and continues to read.

                                 GAS STATION HICK (CONT’D)
                        Miss, you owe me 34.26.

                                 HONEY
                        Hold on a second.

           She reads the page -- AND QUICKLY POKES HIM IN THE THROAT 
           WITH TWO FINGERS! He drops to the ground.

           INT. VOLVO - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Honey puts the food and water in the backseat. She SMILES and 
           watches Sylvester sleep for a moment. He’s an adorable 
           sleeper and it’s VERY clear she thinks so. 

           She sees something on the dashboard -- a PERMANENT MARKER.

           INT. CARGO PLANE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Tech Mercenary #1 punches a few buttons and they ZOOM OUT to 
           see the tiny Volvo driving towards Santa Fe.

                                 MCBRIDE 
                        Time to touch base with the boss.

He touches a 
           few buttons on the remote and they wait a moment. Then...the 
           Hologram Alien appears OFF-SCREEN. Lucky us. Everyone looks 
           repulsed and scared. Mainly repulsed.

                                 MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
                        You’re coming in a lot more clear than 
                        usual.

                        I kind of preferred you all blurry and

                                 COLD MALE VOICE
                        Have you taken care of everything? We

                                 COLD MALE VOICE
                        Good. You need to make a stop on the way.

           HIGH ABOVE THE EARTH

           We’re falling with a LARGE BLACK OBJECT. It bursts into 
           flames as it plummets through our atmosphere.

           FALLING -- FALLING -- we’re getting closer to the ground --

           EXT. ABANDONED BOTTLE FACTORY - DAY

           We’re somewhere in the middle of nowhere (but most likely New 
           Mexico). The factory’s in shambles. McBride and Lucius are in 
           the distance, waiting for something. Then...BOOM!

           THE LARGE BLACK OBJECT SMASHES THROUGH THE ROOF! Dust fills 
           the air. Then...the entire factory collapses like a 
           controlled demolition. We hear something climbing out of the 
           rubble but we don’t see it.

He’s taller. He lumbers towards 
           them. They look like they might shit themselves.

                                 MCBRIDE
                        Are you...the supervisor?

           THE SUPERVISOR makes a noise, like a GROWL and a GURGLE.

                                 MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
                        You don’t speak English, do you?

           He makes another noise. It seems to imply he can’t.

                                 MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
                        Okay, let’s move. The clock’s ticking.

                                       CUT TO:

           INT. VOLVO - DAY

           The car’s parked. Sylvester wakes up. Honey’s not in the car.

                                 HONEY (O.S.)
                        We’re here. You need to see something.

           Sylvester climbs out of the car.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Does “here” have coffee?

           Sylvester stops and looks at a GIGANTIC READINESS BUILDING in 
           the middle of nowhere -- surrounded by ROCK FORMATIONS. It’s 
           THREE STORIES TALL and a MILE WIDE. The sides and top are 
           solid gray. There are no windows and no doors in sight.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        Wow.

                                 HONEY (O.S.)
                        That’s not what I was talking about.

           Sylvester turns to see Honey and sees she’s not looking 
           forward, but up. Sylvester looks up at the sky. There’s a 
           SMALL BLACK SMUDGE.

                                 SYLVESTER 
                        It looks like someone spilled some ink on 
                        the sky.

                                 HONEY
                        I think that’s their ship.

                        We should probably find the entrance to 
                        the building.

                        That’s a good idea.

           MOMENTS LATER --

           They are walking around the entire perimeter, looking for an 
           entrance. They eventually find a small door that’s barely 
           visible. A tiny KEYPAD is next to it.

           Honey looks at the book and types in a number. The door opens 
           with no fuss or complications.

                        Hello, Honey. I hope you’re not watching 
                        this video because that would mean I’m 
                        dead, and that would suck. They asked 
                        each of us to record a message in case 
                        our book ended up being used to save the 
                        world. I’m not sure what I’m supposed to 
                        say here. They didn’t give us a script.
                (beat)
                        You’re 15 now and the only thing I really 
                        know about you is that you like The Spin 
                        Doctors, but I have a good feeling about 
                        you. I think you have your head screwed 
                        firmly on your shoulders. You’re 
                        basically the only person I can trust.

           Honey seems flattered by this. It’s a sweet moment.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        I hope you’re at a legal driving age by 
                        now. That would make this easier. Maybe 
                        you’re even older. Maybe you’re married 
                        and have kids. If so, I hope I was a cool 
                        uncle and always got ‘em what they wanted 
                        for their Christmas.
                (beat)
                        I also hope you didn’t have to use your 
                        womanly charms to get free gasoline. For 
                        the record, I didn’t write that chapter. 
                        I’m not sure what that was all about. 
                        Everyone should just do the fingers 
                        thing. I wrote that part.
                (beat)
                        So, good luck. I think it’s probably safe 
                        to say that I still love you whenever you 
                        see this video, whether you’re 16 or 36. 
                        Now go be awesome. Apparently the world 
                        needs you.

           A new video begins. It’s a dated INFORMATIONAL VIDEO about 
           Readiness.

           FOOTAGE: We see a Readiness Employee walk into frame and 
           address the camera. He’s BUTTONED UP and NO NONSENSE.

                        told him that wasn’t a word.

           FOOTAGE: We see a dated montage of a camera roaming around 
           the Readiness building we saw earlier with all the employees 
           working efficiently at their stations.

           We see the HOURGLASS room from earlier. Dozens of employees 
           sit behind computer screens and operate SWITCHES AND KNOBS. 
           We see a CLOSE UP of an employee pressing a BUTTON as we CUT

                        We have several satellites in orbit all 
                        around the earth. They’re weaponized and 
                        can focus on any target, no matter how 
                        large.

           We see a cliche flying saucer approach earth. The satellites 
           all turn and shoot it. It explodes. We CUT TO the Readiness 
           Employee standing in front of the camera.

                        realized that the aliens would probably

           back at the Readiness headquarters.

           A LARGE HOURGLASS IS IN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM. Unlike the

           They all turn around for a moment and look at The Supervisor. 
           Deadpan.

           He makes a GUTTURAL NOISE that implies McBride is right. 
           Everyone’s silent for a moment, thinking of what’s at stake.

           P.O.V.: Someone is climbing into the helicopter. He sits in 
           the passenger seat. By the reaction of the SCARED PILOT 
           MERCENARY we can tell who this is.

                        Uh, here’s your headset.

           The Supervisor reaches his ARM out, we’re seeing an ALIEN 
           APPENDAGE for the first time, and grabs the HEADSET. His arm 
           is GELATINOUS, PULSATING, and HIDEOUS.

           MOMENTS LATER: We see all the HELICOPTERS taking off. A war 
           is coming. CUT TO--

                        On page 5 of the book it says you must

                        Honey, I’m sorry!

           We stay with his P.O.V. watching Honey get SMALLER and 
           SMALLER as he’s pulled into a metal tube and everything goes 
           to BLACK as we CUT TO:

           EXT. FINAL READINESS BUILDING - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Silence. Serene. Then...we hear Sylvester SCREAM. A HOLE 
           appears on the side of the building and Sylvester is spit out 
           of it and onto the ground. He lands with a painful THUD and 
           the hole CLOSES.

           INT. FINAL READINESS BUILDING - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Honey looks severely distressed.

                        No time for emotions. We must start the 
                        process.

           EXT. FINAL READINESS BUILDING - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Sylvester slumps to the ground, sitting against the building. 
           He looks up at the sky. THE BLACK SMUDGE IS MUCH BIGGER NOW.

           We hear FOOTSTEPS in the distance. Then we hear a man out of 
           breath. He’s getting closer. Sylvester looks around. What’s 
           he supposed to do? He grabs a large rock and stands up. 

           He’s ready for anything -- except this.

                                 SYLVESTER 
                        Whoa, whoa, whoa. What the...

                        ...whoa.

           A man is crawling on his hands and knees with a shirt tied 
           around his head. His chest is covered with bandages.

           It’s Patrick. The real Patrick. The not dead Patrick.

           Robopatrick escorts Honey to the outskirts of the rows of TEN 
           FEET TALL SUPERCOMPUTERS surrounding the Hourglass.

                        You need to turn on two grids. The 
                        locator grid and the terminate grid. The 
                        locator grid will cause the satellites to 
                        find the spaceship. After that’s been 
                        completed, the terminate grid will 
                        destroy the spaceship.
                (beat)
                        The code to start the locator grid is 
                        inside your book.

           Honey opens up the book and turns to the page.

           The BLACK SMUDGE is even bigger now. Patrick drinks an entire 
           bottle of water from the car in a few seconds and munches on 
           a TAQUITO.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Where’d you get that?

                                 PATRICK
                        It was in the bag. It looks like we have 
                        less than ten minutes before the 
                        spaceship passes the point of no return.

                                 SYLVESTER
                (in shock)
                        How...what...?

                                 PATRICK
                        After that we can’t destroy it. After 
                        that we’re fucked.

                        So did I.

           FLASHBACK: We see Patrick wake up hours after his “death.” He 
           looks down at his chest and rips his shirt off. Beneath it is 
           the BLACK SHIRT we saw earlier. 

           We INTERCUT with Sylvester showing up with the flowers for 
           the dinner date. We see Patrick’s BLACK SHIRT. But it’s not a 
           black shirt at all. It’s like a SCI-FI BULLET PROOF VEST.

                                 PATRICK (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        It was just a prototype. I helped design 
                        it. It absorbed 85% of the blast. The 
                        rest of the impact from the plasma put me 
                        into a temporary coma.

           We see Patrick lying on the ground again, and he removes the 
           “black shirt.” Smoke is coming off of it. It’s ragged like 
           acid has burned through it. His chest is bleeding and covered 
           with severe burns.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        Ouch.

                                 PATRICK
                        I always wear it. I wear it when I go to 
                        the bar. I wear it when I go shopping. I 
                        even wear it when I take a shit. You can 
                        never be too careful in my line of work.
                (beat)
                        Sorry I’m late. But to be fair, you had a 
                        6 hour head start on me.

                        How did you get here? Did you drive? Fly?

           Patrick looks up and remembers what he had to do to get there 
           as we SMASH CUT TO--

           THE MOST BADASS MONTAGE OF ALL TIME [FLASHBACK]

           We find Patrick sneaking up to an AMBULANCE parked behind a 
           HOSPITAL. He breaks into it and takes out some bandages and 
           various syringes as we CUT TO--

           A BANDAGED PATRICK STEALING A HARLEY IN FRONT OF A BIKER BAR. 
           As he’s about to start it -- A GANG OF BIKERS WALK OUT OF THE 
           BAR.

                                 BIKER
                        Oh, son. You dead.

           (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                 PATRICK
                        Why? There’s only ten of you.

           MOMENTS LATER -- Patrick is in an epic KNIFE FIGHT inside the 
           bar. People are screaming. UNCONSCIOUS BIKERS are littered 
           all over the floor. A BIKER THAT’S ON FIRE runs through the 
           frame without Patrick reacting to it as we CUT TO--

           PATRICK FLYING DOWN THE INTERSTATE ON THE HARLEY. He’s like 
           Leonard Smalls from Raising Arizona. He takes a swig from a 
           BOTTLE OF LIQUOR.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        YEAH! BRING IT!

           We PAN TO REVEAL that he’s being chased by several COP CARS. 
           He tosses a MOLOTOV COCKTAIL over his shoulder and it lands 
           on the hood of a cop car as we CUT TO--

           A DEAD COLUMBIAN MAN LYING ON THE GROUND. We hear AK-47 
           GUNFIRE and SCREAMING. We PAN over dozens of BULLET-RIDDLED 
           COLUMBIAN MEN and an open BRIEFCASE full of COCAINE. We hear 
           the last BURST of GUNFIRE and we TILT UP to see...

           We’re at an AIRFIELD. Patrick gets into a HELICOPTER and 
           throws out the DEAD PILOT. The helicopter begins to take off.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        Sayonora, fuckwads!

           A still-firing-AK-47 spins like a LAZY SUSAN on the ground as 
           we CUT TO--

           PATRICK FLYING THE HELICOPTER. It’s early morning. He looks 
           down and sees he’s low on fuel.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        Oh, son of a horse bitch!

           He jumps out with a PARACHUTE as we CUT TO--

           PATRICK RIDING A CAMEL IN THE DESERT WITH HIS SHIRT TIED 
           AROUND HIS HEAD. The wreckage of the helicopter is in the 
           background.

           PATRICK BURYING THE CAMEL AND SAYING A FEW KIND WORDS ON HIS 
           BEHALF.

           PATRICK BARTERING WITH A YOUNG SKATEBOARDING KID. He hands

           PATRICK HOLDING ONTO THE BACK OF A TRUCK AND SKATEBOARDING 
           DOWN THE HIGHWAY LIKE MARTY MCFLY.

           And finally -- PATRICK RUNNING DOWN THE INTERSTATE WITH A 
           BROKEN SKATEBOARD ON THE GROUND BEHIND HIM. He passes a sign 
           reading: SANTA FE 5 MILES. We hold on it then CUT TO:

                        We have to keep them from getting inside. 
                        The building is strong and well protected 
                        but if they throw enough shit at it 
                        they’ll eventually break through.

           Honey is hiding around the corner, frantically flipping 
           through the book.

           IF THE ROBOT MALFUNCTIONS...
           TURN TO PAGE 217

           She turns the page 217.

           INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO MANUALLY ACTIVATE THE TERMINATE GRID

           She looks down at the page and sees the diagram of a LARGE 
           CIRCULAR MAZE. There are TEN NUMBERED TERMINALS inside and an 
           HOURGLASS in the center. The page has the exact route to do 
           the terminals IN ORDER.

                                 HONEY (O.S.)
                        I hate mazes.

           She stands up and runs around the corner while we hear the 
           M.G.A. and Robopatrick somewhere in the distance. She walks 
           into an opening in the SUPERCOMPUTERS and we--

           CRANE UP to reveal that the rows and rows of supercomputers 
           are actually a GIANT MAZE. She darts inside, following the 
           book’s instructions, looking for the first TERMINAL. The 
           M.G.A. fly into the entrance -- FIRING MADLY!

           Patrick is firing the Readiness equivalent of an AK-47 at a 
           helicopter and screaming. We hear an EXPLOSION in the 
           distance. 

           Sylvester looks up and sees that the BLACK SMUDGE is now 
           taking up a large chunk of the sky. He grabs one of the AK-

                        (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)           In different parts of the room...FIVE MACHINE GUNS fall to 
           the ground. One lands right in front of Honey. No arms. 
           Nothing. Honey’s confused. But then... Holy shit.

           FOUR LEGS APPEAR ON THE SIDES OF THE MACHINE GUNS!

           The machine gun in front of Honey stands upright, and it now 
           looks like a PUPPY DOG with a MACHINE GUN for a HEAD. An 
           ANTENNA extends from the back, forming a TAIL. 

           Adorable but deadly. Honey runs away as it FIRES at her!

           She runs around the corner and panics. What now? She sees the 
           book. Light bulb moment! The dog runs towards her and...

           HONEY CLOSES THE BOOK ON ITS HEAD! It kicks and twitches but 
           she holds the book tight. The part of the it’s head that’s 
           hanging out -- just like the “spoon bookmark” earlier --

           -- FALLS OFF AS THE BOOK BURNS THROUGH IT! CLANK! She opens 
           up the book and runs to the NEXT TERMINAL.

           OUTSIDE THE MAZE: We see FOUR DOGS run into the maze. Uh oh.

           EXT. FINAL READINESS BUILDING - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           We see the mercenaries going around every side of the 
           building. Red walks up to ANOTHER MERCENARY.

                                 RED
                        What does this Sylvester guy look like?

                                 ANOTHER MERCENARY
                        I don’t know. Kind of a pussy.

           BACK WITH SYLVESTER AND PATRICK:

                                 PATRICK
                        They’re on the ground. I’ll take the 
                        north side of the building and you take 
                        the south.

           Patrick points at a GIANT ROCKET LAUNCHER on the ground.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        This is the most powerful weapon we have. 
                        It only has one shot. Only use it when 
                        it’s completely necessary.

           Patrick runs around the corner.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        You’re only bringing one gun!

                        I’m not bringing more than I need.

           INT. FINAL READINESS BUILDING - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Honey is activating a terminal when Robopatrick approaches 
           her again. He’s badly damaged but still walking.

                                 HONEY
                        The hell?

           He fires and she instinctively holds up the book to shield 
           her face. TINK! THE BULLET BOUNCES OFF THE BOOK AND KILLS 
           ROBOPATRICK! She didn’t know it was bulletproof.

           She looks at Robopatrick sadly for a moment. Sure, he tried 
           to kill her...but he does look like her brother.

           EXT. FINAL READINESS BUILDING - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           ON THE NORTH SIDE: Patrick jumps to the side to avoid a 
           stream of GLOWING GREEN PLASMA. He suddenly looks scary.

                                 PATRICK
                        That’s the gun you tried to kill me with.

           The mercenary is scared shitless. Patrick YELLS and runs at 
           him like a bat out of hell.

           ON THE SOUTH SIDE: Sylvester hears Patrick going apeshit and 
           slaughtering mercenaries. He turns to see McBride and a 
           CLUSTER of MERCENARIES approach him. Sylvester grabs the 
           Giant Rocket Launcher and POWERS IT UP. He aims it at them.

                                 MCBRIDE
                        Oh shit.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        This is for fucking with my planet!

           He fires the rocket launcher! But he made one tiny mistake...

           IT WAS BACKWARDS.

           BOOM! The rocket blows a HUGE HOLE in the SIDE OF THE 
           BUILDING. Sylvester flies forward faster than he could 
           imagine and SMACKS into a rock formation!

           ON THE NORTH SIDE: Patrick’s standing in the middle of 30 
           DEAD MERCENARIES, holding the GLOWING PLASMA GUN. Ah, 
           revenge. He hears an EXPLOSION and runs around the EAST SIDE.

           ON THE SOUTH SIDE: Sylvester’s lying on his back. He’s a 
           mess. We see his upside down P.O.V.:
                                                              (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)

                        Thanks, retard.
                (to his guys)
                        Come on, four minutes!

           They swarm into the building. We hear a THUD -- THUD -- THUD.  
           And Sylvester, and the audience, sees The Supervisor for the 
           first time. It’s walking towards the hole in the building. 

           We see him (upside down P.O.V.) from behind. He’s NINE FEET 
           TALL and REPULSIVE. His legs are tall. His movements are 
           JERKY and ERRATIC. Before Sylvester can react... 

                                 RED (O.S.)
                        Are you Sylvester?

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Uh...yeah?

           Red picks him up and throws him at a rock formation!

                                 RED
                        You killed my step-brother! You tried to 
                        blow me up!

                                 SYLVESTER
                        I’m sorry. I don’t know what or who 
                        you’re talking about!

                                 RED
                        You are going TO DIE!

           INT. FINAL READINESS BUILDING - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           The entrance M.G.A. (that were going to kill Sylvester 
           earlier) MOW DOWN A DOZEN MERCENARIES! The bullets do nothing 
           to The Supervisor and he keeps walking. Two more mercenaries 
           run into the building right after this.

                                 COMPUTER VOICE
                        Your choice. Leave or be murdered.

           Scared Mercenary looks at the bodies and the M.G.A.

                                 SCARED MERCENARY
                        Leave?

           Red has a large knife and he’s about to gut Sylvester.

                        That guy? I didn’t even kill him. That 
                        was Patrick!

           the building and --

           -- WHUMP! They land on Red -- pinning him to the ground. 

           INT. FINAL READINESS BUILDING - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           The Supervisor walks towards the maze.  A dog runs up to him.  
           He stares at it. Curious. Then he kicks it very hard -- YELP! 
           -- the dog flies high in the air -- and out of frame.

           EXT. FINAL READINESS BUILDING - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Red climbs out from beneath the mercenaries. Sylvester runs 
           into the rock formations. Red follows him.

           MOMENTS LATER: Patrick arrives and sees the HOLE IN THE 
           BUILDING. He looks inside: a DOG is chasing McBride. He fires 
           the GREEN PLASMA at the dog! It falls down --

           -- DAMAGED -- but it pops back up. McBride enters the maze! 
           We see THE HEAD OF THE SUPERVISOR, he’s 3 inches taller than 
           the maze. He lumbers through it -- looking for Honey.

                                 PATRICK
                        Honey? Are you in that maze thing?

                                 HONEY (O.S.)
                        Don’t make me kill you again, 
                        Robopatrick!

                        I’m not Robopatrick. I’m your brother.

                        My brother’s dead.

                        You moved in with me when you couldn’t 
                        afford to pay your bills. Sometimes you 
                        eat ice cream while you’re going to the

           Long beat.

           He sees Lucius’ dead body in the pilot seat. He grabs a gun 
           we can’t see. Red is running towards him.

                        it to wipe my ass.

           Sylvester turns and aims the gun.

                        Or you’re going to be a statue. Whichever

           Red’s face = HOLY SHIT. Sylvester FIRES with Red OFF-SCREEN.

           We’re with Sylvester. NOTHING HAPPENED. He looks down at the 
           gun. It’s not The Medusa. He looks at Red.

           Anti-Gravity gun! Oh, shit. Sylvester runs away through the 
           rock formations while Red begins to float high up in the air. 

           Red can’t see where he went and FIRES in frustration. He 
           looks back at the ground.

                        and the female inside the maze. 

           IN THE MAZE: One of the dogs runs up to Honey and is about to 
           shoot her down. She closes her eyes in anticipation.

           DOG P.O.V.: Everything is BLUE TINTED. A RED TARGET is around 
           Honey with the word “INTRUDER” next to her.

           The RED TARGET disappears! And the word “FRIEND” appears next 
           to Honey. 

           WIDE: We see the dog playfully staring at Honey and WAGGING 
           his TAIL. He turns and runs away, looking for the 
           mercenaries.

           He FIRES and they go down. He SMILES -- and doesn’t realize

           Sylvester jumps out of the way as -- WHOMP! -- an ALIEN 
           STATUE crashes into the ground where he was standing. 

           Sylvester grabs a HANDFUL OF GUNS and darts inside the 
           building. We can’t see the spaceship but it’s blocking out 
           the sun. The PARATROOPERS are getting close to the ground.

           his shoulder. In his pockets. Etc.

           We PULL BACK to reveal -- Patrick’s aiming the Anti-Gravity 
           gun at Sylvester! He fires! Sylvester begins to float. He

                        Tick tock, and you don’t quit.

           Patrick runs outside.

           IN THE MAZE: Honey is running towards the FINAL TERMINAL. 
           It’s at the base of the GIANT HOURGLASS.

           EXT. FINAL READINESS BUILDING - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Still “overcast.” Patrick steps outside.

                                 PATRICK
                        Can’t you assholes take a hint?

           No mercenaries in sight. Confused. He walks around the corner 
           -- and sees the ALIEN STATUE. PARATROOPER ALIENS are landing 
           everywhere. But there’s the solution to all his problems --

           -- THE WEAPONS SHACK. Bingo. He runs towards it.

           INT. FINAL READINESS BUILDING - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           We will INTERCUT with brief images of Patrick outside.

           IN THE MAZE: Before Honey can put in the numbers, the 
           mercenaries surround her! McBride aims a gun at her head and 
           grabs the book. She puts her hands up. 

                                 MCBRIDE
                        So, you’re the girl we’ve been hearing 
                        about.

           They approach the hourglass -- facing away from Honey.

                                 MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
                        What did we use on the last one? C4?

           INTERCUT: We see Patrick grabbing weapons.

                                 SYLVESTER (O.S.) 
                        Psst!

           Honey looks around -- then up. 

           An AK-47 falls, from out of nowhere, and she catches it. 

           INTERCUT: The Paratrooper Aliens have surrounded the shack.

           The mercenaries turn around to see --

           -- HONEY MOW THEM ALL DOWN! McBride is still standing.

                        How did you...?

                                 HONEY
                        I’m like a ninja.

           She pulls the trigger. Nothing happens. She’s out of bullets.

                                 MCBRIDE
                        A fucked ninja.

           BAM! BAM! BAM! McBride goes down. 

                                 MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
                (faintly)
                        So confused...

           He looks up to see --

           -- SYLVESTER STANDING UPSIDE DOWN ON THE CEILING WITH A GUN 
           AIMED DOWN AT HIM!

                                 SYLVESTER 
                (to Honey)
                        Hey, babe.

           BAM! McBride fires back at Sylvester. He’s not dead! 
           Sylvester runs around the top of the hourglass for cover. 
           PING! A bullet bounces off the hourglass.

           INTERCUT: Patrick = Rambo. The aliens are being slaughtered.

           The Supervisor finally finds the center of the maze, looks 
           up, sees Sylvester, and GROWLS. He looks down at McBride. 
           McBride’s wondering what The Supervisor is about to... Uh oh. 
           The Supervisor grabs McBride and --

                                 MCBRIDE
                        I’m so not getting a ca...

           HE THROWS MCBRIDE AT SYLVESTER!

           Sylvester runs out of the way to avoid McBride as he -- 

           CRUNCH! He SMASHES into the hourglass and falls to the 
           ground. No castle for you, asshole.

           INTERCUT: Patrick runs out of bullets. The last alien stands 
           in front of him. He’s cocky. He knows Patrick’s screwed.

                                 PATRICK
                        These boots aren’t made for walking, 
                        motherfucker.
                                                  (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)           Patrick ROUNDHOUSE KICKS him in the FACE. He SCREAMS, grabs 
           the ALIEN STATUE, and beats him to death with it!

           SYLVESTER UNLOADS A ROUND INTO THE SUPERVISOR!

                                 SYLVESTER 
                        Eat that, you ugly fuck!

           The. Bullets. Do. Nothing. What now?!

                                 THE SUPERVISOR
                (forced and guttural)
                        Your...guns...not...harm...me.

           Sylvester grabs the GREEN GLOWING PLASMA GUN.

                                 SYLVESTER 
                        How about one of yours?

                                 THE SUPERVISOR
                        Oh...shit.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        HONEY, GET DOWN!

           She runs around the hourglass as Sylvester fires the gun! 
           FLASH! IT FLAT-OUT-DESTROYS THE SUPERVISOR. Honey runs up and 
           punches in the numbers.

                                 COMPUTER VOICE
                        Terminal 10 of 10 has been manually 
                        activated. You have 40 seconds to 
                        evacuate the building. In order to power 
                        the terminate grid, this building will 
                        implode.

           The hourglass is POWERING UP. It’s very loud. Sylvester looks 
           down at Honey. He has to yell to be heard over the hourglass.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        HEY!

                                 HONEY
                        HI?!

                                 SYLVESTER
                        ARE YOU OKAY?!

                                 HONEY
                        THIS ISN’T THE TIME, SYLVESTER!

           Sylvester holds out his hand for her to see.
                                                             (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                 SYLVESTER
                        THIS MEANS YOU LIKE ME, RIGHT?!

                                 HONEY
                        WELL...YEAH!

                                 SYLVESTER
                        GOOD. 
                (beat)
                        BECAUSE I THINK YOU’RE WONDERFUL!

                                 HONEY
                        YOU’RE BEING REALLY CUTE RIGHT NOW BUT WE 
                        HAVE TO GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!

                                 SYLVESTER
                        I KNOW. I JUST DIDN’T WANT TO GET BLOWN 
                        UP WITHOUT KNOWING!

           Honey SMILES. She gets it. But time to go! She looks at the 
           book to find the quickest way out of the maze. Sylvester runs 
           across the ceiling towards the entrance.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        GET THE GUN! YOU’LL HAVE TO REVERSE ME!

           On the ground, outside the maze, Honey flips the switch on 
           the gun and aims it at Sylvester.

                                 SYLVESTER (CONT’D)
                        Wait, what am I going to land on?

           Too late. Honey fires the gun. Sylvester SCREAMS and falls to 
           the ground, landing on a pile of DEAD MERCENARIES. 

           The building SHAKES and THE HOURGLASS GOES BERSERK! The half-
           dead upper-half of Robopatrick sees them running away.

                                 ROBOPATRICK
                        Good luck, my friends.

           EXT. FINAL READINESS BUILDING - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           THE ROOF OPENS UP. They run out of the building as it begins 
           to GLOW and PULSATE! 

           IT FIRES A GLOWING STREAM OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH THE CLOUDS 
           AND INTO SPACE!

           HIGH IN SPACE: The stream hits one SATELLITE and it goes from 
           SATELLITE to SATELLITE to SATELLITE...

           BACK ON THE GROUND: Sylvester and Honey are looking straight 
           up. Into the sky. And here’s the big reveal --

           (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)           THE ALIEN SHIP IS FINALLY IN VIEW.

           It takes up the entire sky. And it’s not what you were 
           expecting. Probably.

           It looks like a JET BLACK JELLYFISH. No shiny surfaces. Just 
           a mass of floating organic matter, taking up the entire sky. 

           This is the scariest and strangest thing you’ll ever see.

                                 SYLVESTER (O.S.) 
                        That is the weirdest looking spaceship 
                        I’ve ever seen.

                                 HONEY (O.S.)
                        Well, actually, it’s the only spaceship 
                        you’ve ever seen.

           A DEEP RUMBLING. A LARGE FLASH OF LIGHT. The spaceship looks 
           like it was hit with TEN THOUSAND BOLTS OF LIGHTNING.

           HIGH IN SPACE: Hundreds of satellites are turning and 
           transforming, revealing large cannon-like protrusions. 

           They fire a web of electricity at the ship. It begins to 
           splinter and shatter. Through the cracks we see blue fire 
           begin to build inside of the ship.

           We see INSIDE THE SHIP briefly as BLUE FIRE rips through 
           their gelatinous corridors and for mere seconds we see ALIENS 
           ENGULFED IN FLAME.

           ON THE GROUND: They look up at the ship. Fiery pieces of ship 
           fall into the atmosphere. Patrick walks around the corner.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Did you kill all of them?

                                 PATRICK
                        Yep.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        Well, I broke my forehead, got shot in 
                        the ass, we moved a house, and we saved 
                        the world.

                                 PATRICK
                        You moved a house?

                                 HONEY
                        Yep.

                                 PATRICK
                        Wow.
                                              (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)           She runs up and hugs him. She talks while holding him tight.

                                 HONEY 
                        You’re going to have to explain to me how 
                        you’re alive but we’ll save that for 
                        later. Thanks for the video. It meant a 
                        lot to me.
                (she steps back)
                        You’re the best brother a girl could ever 
                        ask for.

           She walks up to Sylvester.

                                 PATRICK
                (quietly to himself)
                        What video?

                                 SYLVESTER
                (holding out his hand)
                        Thanks.

                                 HONEY
                        Everyone likes flattery.

           She grabs his hand and rewrites the number.

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        I just wanted you to know, in case 
                        everything went as badly as it seemed 
                        like it could, that at least one person 
                        cared for you, that at least one person 
                        liked you.

                                 SYLVESTER
                        And thought I was handsome?

                                 HONEY
                (laughs sweetly)
                        Yes, and thought you were handsome.

           She kisses him passionately. We pull out to a WIDE SHOT as 
           Sylvester and Honey embrace. In the background PIECES OF THE 
           SHIP FALL FROM THE SKY IN A STUNNING FIERY BLAZE --

           -- and what would look apocalyptic in any other context, is 
           now beautiful and hopeful. Sylvester and Honey look upwards 
           as the music crescendos and we SMASH CUT TO--

           BLACK

                       THE END
