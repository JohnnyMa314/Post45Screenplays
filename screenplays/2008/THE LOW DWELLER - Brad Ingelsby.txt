           ON A SHAGBARK TREE - SUMMER NIGHT 

           and there’s a pie-eyed man at the base, late twenties, sturdy 
           and thick-wristed.  His eyes are dark brown, but the liquor’s 
           in him and they’re barely open now.   

           This is the low dweller, CHARLIE ‘SLIM’ HENDRICK. 

           POLICE SIRENS fill the air.  Distant, but encroaching.  

           There’s not a mark on him to explain the blood on his shirt - 
           it’s not his.  He stirs a bit as if nudged and his eyes 
           raise. 

           SLIM’S POV 

           across the rural dirt road, a weathered farmhouse sits vacant 
           on the land.  An aged ‘For Sale’ sign peeks above the brown 
           summer overgrowth.  

           The SIRENS close in and throw their blue-red lights onto the 
           trees and tall grass and finally...Slim. 

           And then, from the sky, MAYFLIES FALL.  In sheets.  
           Weightless, thin-winged insects.   

           DEPUTY MULBY NOLAN, late twenties, approaches cautiously, 
           DEPUTY #1 at his side.  Guns drawn.  

                                 DEPUTY NOLAN 
                        Slim.  Slim tell me what’s goin’ 
                        on... 

                                 DEPUTY #1
                        Speak up, you sumabitch! 

           Deputy #1 advances on Slim. 

                                 DEPUTY NOLAN
                   (harshly)
                        Hey!  
                   (Deputy turns)
                        Lemme do this...

           Nolan holsters his pistol and bends down beside Slim.

                        Slim.  Slim it’s Mulby...
                   (sees the blood)
                        Jesus...what you gone an’ done? 

           He removes his handcuffs and Slim doesn’t resist when they’re 
           put on.  His wearied eyes never leave the farmhouse. 

           The Mayflies twitch on the ground. 

                                        DISSOLVE TO:

           A DEAD DOG - MORNING - SUMMER  

           on the edge of a wheat field.  It’s not pretty, blood and 
           flesh, like the sun and heat have been at it for days and now 
           the maggots and fleas and buzzards have taken over.   

           ACROSS THE RURAL HIGHWAY ROAD, through the heat-haze, the 
           high barbed wire perimeter fence of a prison disrupts a 
           cloudless blue sky.   

                                 WRITTEN WORDS 
                        Four years later.  1986.  Lowlands.  
                        Southern Indiana.  

           Guards escort Slim towards the gate.  They remove the 
           handcuffs and the gates open and Slim steps out, not joyous 
           or doleful, he just steps out and squints from the sun and 
           regards the dog a moment. 

           INT. ROADSIDE RESTAURANT - MORNING  

           A RECORD PLAYS ROBERT JOHNSON BLUES and a FAT TRUCKER sits in 
           a corner booth eating runny eggs.  The shack is empty less 
           him and a lazy Doberman.

           BAT-BAT the wooden screen door closes as Slim enters.  The 
           DOBERMAN BARKS and the Fat Trucker looks up. 

                                 OWNER (O.C.)
                        Quit yellin’ out, Girdie. 

           Slim takes a seat at the counter, wipes the sweat from his 
           forehead and THE DOG BARKS more as it ponders Slim.   

           From the kitchen, the pot-bellied OWNER steps out, limping 
           from an ancient injury. 

                                 OWNER (cont’d)
                        Oh quit it now...

                        He don’t mean no harm.  Big baby’s

                        Cup a coffee.  

           Owner hands Slim a menu, fills his mug.  Black.

                        Easton?  By foot?
                   (Slim doesn’t answer)
                        Hope you aint in a rush.  Got a 
                        good twunny miles a’head.  Aint no 
                        one ‘round ta drive ya’? 

           Slim considers the Owner and squirms a bit and looks behind 
           him.

                        No need ta look back here.  I know

           Owner limps back into the kitchen.  Slim sips his coffee.

           Fat Trucker drops his fork.

                        mornin’. 

           Slim looks around.  The sun-tired dog wags its tongue.  Owner 
           returns with the omelet and the slaw.  Tops Slim off. 

                                 OWNER (O.C.) (cont’d)

                        yous comin’ out ahead a the game. 

           Slim don’t wanna address it - woman or no woman - so he just 
           leaves it and starts eating. 

           Fat Trucker stands, waves to Owner.

                        without me. 

           Slim continues to eat.  Doesn’t look back. 

                                 OWNER
                        You heard ‘im, Noah. 

           Fat Trucker exits.  Owner pats the dog’s ribs.  

           EXT. ROADSIDE RESTAURANT - LATER THAT MORNING 

           Slim exits the shack and squints from the bedlamite sun and 
           begins walking down the straight, endless road.  Toward home.    

           EXT. RURAL BACKROAD - EARLY EVENING 

           PURPLE TWILIGHT NOW and Slim is sweating beneath his neck and 
           under his arms and he wears the road’s dust.  CICADAS BUZZ in 
           the tall grass, rubbing their wings.    

           A CAR APPROACHES and Slim hides his eyes.  Passes a road sign 
           with an outline of Indiana and underneath it, Welcome To 
           Easton: Home to Welter’s Quarry. 
                                                (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)

           Modest.  Ranch style.  A faded Dodge Aries sits in the loose 
           gravel driveway.  

           Slim ascends the porch steps and walks into the home.  

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           IT’S DARK but the window allows a hint of moonlight to reveal 
           two figures on a bed.  Both nude.    

           There’s a young man, mid-twenties, all knees and elbows with 
           some ink stains of flaming motorcycles and hard-rock homage.  
           This is CORMAC HENDRICK, Slim’s brother.  

           Beside him, an OBESE GIRL lies on her belly and her ashen, 
           flabby ass is the moon.  

           THE DOOR OPENS.  Slim peers in.  

           Cormac squints from the sudden hallway light.  Stirs.  

                                 CORMAC
                        Who the fuck’s that? 

                                 SLIM
                        ...It’s me.  I’m home.

                                 CORMAC
                   (a beat)
                        Shut the door.  

           Slim takes a moment.  Then does.  The room darkens. 

                                        DISSOLVE TO:

           A SPRAWLING WHEAT FIELD - DUSK - ONE MONTH LATER  

           ROLLING COMBINES in the somnolent, old-gold light.  The 
           HARVEST WORKERS, handsome young men, careless and profane, 
           work on the periphery with scythes.  Telling tales. 

           LATER - EVENING 

           THE SUN HAS FALLEN and the anonymous, sun-wearied WORKERS 
           collect their day’s pay from THE OWNER, a round man.

           Slim is among them and there’s a slight beard coming in on 
           his sunburnt face. 

           He steps up to collect. 

                                 SLIM 
                        Like ta ask I might work weekends, 
                        Sir. 

           The Owner appraises Slim and he’s watched the workers toil 
           and knows who works and who doesn’t.  

                                 THE OWNER 
                        We start at dawn then.  Hear that? 

                                 SLIM
                   (a beat, takes his pay) 
                        Yes, Sir.    

           He leaves the line. 

           INT. HENDRICK HOME - FAMILY ROOM - EVENING 

           AN OLD TV plays the baseball game behind a layer of fuzz and 
           Slim watches with his feet up.  

           Cormac enters.  Slim sits up, ready to talk, but Cormac 
           breezes right into the hallway and shuts his bedroom door.

           EXT. WHEAT FIELD - DAY 

           Slim in the field and he is stooking the wheat, tying it into 
           bundles, preparing it for threshing.  

           EXT. WHEAT FIELD - LATER 

           DUSK NOW and a shirtless Slim is threshing the stooks with a 
           homemade flail, beating the wheat from the straw.  

           INT. HENDRICK HOME - KITCHEN - EVENING 

           Slim enters and Cormac is on the couch, shirtless, watching 
           TV with a beer and cigarette burning.  Slim takes off his hat 
           and walks to the refrigerator and removes a pop.    

                                 SLIM

                        Already ate.  

           INT. ABERDEEN’S TAVERN - NIGHT 

           A LABORER’S HANGOUT and there is much talk and all of it 
           liquor-loud.  

           Slim sits in the corner of the bar, alone.  He quietly eats 
           his hamburger and sips his pop and looks at no one.  

           EXT. WEATHERED FARMHOUSE - DAYS LATER - GLOAMING    

           The home sits, still-vacant, on the land.  The very same ‘For 
           Sale’ sign peeks above the tall grass.  

           Full-bearded and skin bronze, Slim stands on the porch, 
           feeling the strength of the wood.  He lumbers down the steps 
           and approaches his weathered ‘81 Ford pick-up truck.

           EXT. JILLY’S EAT & REST - NIGHT (LATE)       

           A woeful, dirt-infused establishment. 

           Owner and local bookie, JOHN O’RILEY, sixties, sits on the 
           front steps, twisting his mustache and spitting sunflower 
           shells and bits stick in his beard and teeth.

           The Ford pick-up crawls into the gravel lot, squeaks to a 
           stop.  Slim steps out, leaves the car running and the look he 
           gives the fat man lets us know they’re not friends. 

                                 SLIM
                        Where’s my brother then? 

                                 JOHN 
                        ‘Round back...  

           John labors to his feet and follows Slim, waddling the way 
           overweight men do.  Like ducks. 

                                 SLIM
                        Who did it?

                        Were a few of ‘em.  Garret 
                        Bickson’s fists mostly.  Got inta 
                        it over some dame.

                        work on his eyes, belly an’ ribs. 

           They round the corner into the dark shadows --

           BEHIND THE RESTAURANT 

           and glance down at Cormac who’s a limp sack of bones on the 
           ground.  

           John’s already winded and panting and leans against the wall.  

                                 SLIM
                        An’ what were you doin’ while they

                                 JOHN
                        I don’t whoop no more over dustups.  
                        Too old.  ‘Sides, this one a the 
                        more lopsided fights I seen. 

           Slim bends down, rolls his brother over.  His nose is 
           bloodied and his eyes are blue-black, racoon-ish.  If Slim’s 
           surprised by the sight, he doesn’t show it.  

                                 SLIM

                   (a beat)
                        ...Help me get ‘im up. 

           Slim and John lift the boy and Slim tosses his brother over 
           his shoulders like a baby calf and walks back toward the 
           truck.  John follows. 

                                 JOHN
                        He’s inta me again.  Took a horse 
                        name Magellan in the fifth race 
                        over at Pikestead.  Cramped up on 
                        the back stretch.  Didn’t show. 

           Slim opens the passenger door of the pick-up, lifts Cormac 
           in.  Shuts the door.  

                                 SLIM
                        How much for? 

                                 JOHN
                        Two grand.

                                 JOHN
                        Day or two. 

                                 SLIM
                        Could prolly come up with half by 
                        then.  Not more.   

                                 JOHN
                        Like it all, but...have the kid 
                        bring over half if you got to.  Got 
                        a little smoke showin’.  Smells 
                        like you’re burnin’ coolant. 

           A tiny snake of smoke escapes the truck’s hood. 

                                 SLIM 
                        Loose cap...

           Slim pops the hood and looks into the guts of the vehicle. 

           GABBY O’RILEY, early thirties, exits the empty restaurant in 
           waitress uniform, eyes brown as oak and a beauty age can only 
           temper.  She bites softly into a peach. 

                                 GABBY
                   (to John)
                        I’m ready, Dad.

           Hearing her voice, Slim turns.  Gabby looks up.  They share a 
           glance.  

           It simultaneously startles and softens her to see him, but 
           she swallows both emotions and says nothing. 

                                 JOHN
                        Have Slim take ya’ back.  I’ve some 
                        things ta do inside yet. 

                                 GABBY
                        Dad, the babysitter -- 

                                 JOHN
                        Goddamnit, Gabby!  I’ve things ta 
                        do inside yet!  Aint like he don’t 
                        know where we live...  An’ get that 
                        one-eyed brother a yours ta take 
                        out the garbage. 

           CRUNCH - CRUNCH Gabby across the gravel and she climbs into 
           the pick-up, ignoring Slim as she does.  

           The restaurant doors open and John walks back inside. 

           A BLUE OLDSMOBILE CUTLASS glides into the lot slowly now, 
           almost hauntingly so, carrying two shadowy figures.  

           BUD DEAKINS, fifties, with eyes that need sleep, steps from 
           the car in a cheap suit.  He’s balding.  Amorphous red 
           birthmarks burden his face and neck.  Ugly. 

                                 BUD

                        Been a long, empty ride. 

           Inside the car, THE SHADOW OF A FEDORA commands our 
           attention. 

           INT. OLDSMOBILE CUTLASS - CONTINUOUS

           CLOSE ON TWO GIANT, HARDENED HANDS as they slice into a 
           pepperoni log with a BOXCUTTER and the mouth of a Boxer Dog 
           lifts its head to eat the thin slice.  

           EXT. JILLY’S EAT & REST - CONTINUOUS

           BOOM!  The hood of the Ford shuts.  Slim climbs into the 
           truck and it grumbles out of the lot. 

           Bud TAPS on the hood of the Cutlass then crosses to the 
           restaurant.  

           INT. JILLY’S - BACK OFFICE - NIGHT    

           SMALL AND CONGESTED.  John sits behind his desk and removes 
           his BUSINESS LOG from a drawer.  Takes out a pen.    

           THE DOOR OPENS.  Bud enters like a tiptoeing fog. 

                                 BUD
                        How are ya’, John-Boy?

                   (without looking up)
                        Fine, I suppose. 

           As though ritual, John pulls a thick envelope of cash from a 
           drawer and hands it to Bud.  Bud appraises it quickly then 
           tucks it away and paces.   

                                 BUD

           John looks up at Bud and Bud eyes him right back and there’s 
           an unease about John suddenly.  

           INT. RESTAURANT - MOMENTS LATER

           CLINK - CLINK Bud drops two coins into the timeworn jukebox 
           and cues LORETTA LYNN who begins to tell of ‘the boys’ and 
           liquor and lovin’.

           BEHIND THE COUNTER 

           John removes a few slices of bread, slides butter across 
           them.  Bud approaches, takes a stool at the counter.  

                                 BUD
                        Was sorry to hear about Mare.

                        few collections along the way.  

           John’s fidgety as he cuts the sandwiches and if he was uneasy 
           a second ago, he’s skittish as hell now.  He glances back at 
           Bud, then inconspicuously SLIDES A STEEL KNIFE UP HIS SLEEVE. 

                                 JOHN

           SIZZLE! the sandwiches against the pan and the hot grease and

           CLOSE ON JOHN 

           sweating as he flips the sandwiches - SIZZLE! against the 
           grease - and he wipes his brow and DING! the entrance bell.

                        We’re closed... 

           There’s the PIT-PAT PIT-PAT OF DOG FEET across the linoleum.

                                 JOHN (cont’d)
                        What word don’t ya understand, pal? 

           John turns and freezes and his face goes white like he’s seen 
           a ghost...Bud is gone...but there is the unnaturally tall man 
           in the Fedora - SAM NEBRASKA - seated on a stool in a 
           charcoal suit, the Boxer dog obediently by his feet. 

           CLOSE ON SAM NEBRASKA...forties, with eyes like dying embers.  
           His face is marred by cavities and a cleft palette the damage 
           of which surgeries couldn’t ameliorate. 

                                 JOHN (cont’d)
                        Sam -- you uh -- 
                   (swallows)
                        -- that brother a yours doin’ 
                        alright...? 

           John turns back to the sandwiches, removes them from the pan 
           and the hot grease and he’s shaking like a leaf and his 
           breaths are quick and fast and he can’t think anymore so he 
           PULLS THE KNIFE FROM HIS SLEEVE and whips back to Sam and -- 

           SINK!  SAM’S BOXCUTTER INTO JOHN’S NECK and John stumbles 
           back against the counter, WHEEZING HORRIDLY for air.   

           Sam stands and moves behind the counter as smooth as 
           unwinding smoke.  

           DING! the entrance bell and Bud enters again and he looks at 
           John holding the hole in his neck and there’s blood making 
           trails down his shirt like witch fingers.

                                 BUD
                        Hear that?  Breaths are short and 
                        quick.  It won’t be long now...  
                        Fucking thief.  

           Sam stares at John’s eyes as though reading them and when 
           John’s eyes raise to look at his killer, Sam softly closes 
           his eyelids...so they won’t look at him anymore. 

                                 SAM NEBRASKA
                   (direful)
                        Come here, girl. 

           The Boxer dog approaches his ankles and Loretta continues 
           from the jukebox and it’s goddamn frightening somehow, as 
           though a lonely ghost were singing from the darkened corner.

FORD PICK-UP (DRIVING) - EVENING   

           THE WINDOWS ARE DOWN but the car is silent less the wind and 
           the occasional groan from Cormac.

                                 GABBY 
                        How long you been back?  

                                 SLIM 
                        Few months.  
                   (a long beat)
                        ‘Preciate you straightenin’ Corm up 
                        back there.  

           Gabby says nothing.  

           A long, awkward silence.  

           CORMAC FARTS.  

           Slim smiles and Gabby smiles and when Slim looks over she’s 
           staunch again and looks out the window. 

           The pick-up rocks as it glides onto an unpaved driveway.  
           Slim shifts into park. 

                                 SLIM (cont’d)
                        Listen, Gabby, I meant to come by --

           She exits before he can finish.  

           He watches out the windshield as she approaches the front 
           steps of the home and takes her son, BEN, five, from the arms 
           of the Babysitter and into hers.  

           EXT. HENDRICK HOME - NIGHT 

           The Ford rolls into the driveway. 

           INT. HENDRICK HOME - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT 

           DARKNESS AND FLICK A LAMP IS TURNED ON as Slim lays his 
           brother down on the brown sofa.  An old, sickly labrador - 
           GUNTHER - approaches with companionable gleam and Slim 
           ignores the animal. 

           He drapes a blanket over Cormac and regards his brother a 
           moment.

           The weight of guilt is heavy. 

           EXT. CORNFIELD - NIGHT  

           THE BLUE OLDSMOBILE PARKED IN THE TALL STALKS and Sam takes 
           John’s body from the trunk and lays it down on the ground. 

           Bud leans on the bumper and the Boxer Dog is sniffing around.   

                                 BUD
                        Seem strange to you how many of 
                        these things we’ve been closing 
                        lately?  
                   (no answer from Sam)
                        Guess I’m thinking too much.  
                        There’s some money sitting in the 
                        log.  Couple accounts worth 
                        sticking around for...  There’s a 
                        whore joint just outside town.  
                        Been there once.  Fucked a piggy 
                        girl named Maryanne.  Said she 
                        taught school during the week.  
                        They keep Bibles on the night 
                        stands. 

           Bud tosses the Boxer a restaurant mint. 

                                 SAM NEBRASKA
                        Don’t feed her that...

           Sam opens the dog’s mouth and fishes out the candy and lets 
           her know it wasn’t her fault. 

                                 BUD
                        We get what we can.  A little 
                        windfall would do me well. 

           Silence.  The stalks are still.  Bud pulls out John’s 
           BUSINESS LOG and his LIGHTER FLICKS ILLUMINATING A PAGE AND 
           THE NAME ON TOP...Cormac Hendrick.  

           INT. HENDRICK HOME - BEDROOM 

           Outside, the CHINK AND CHAFE OF INSECTS and wide awake on the 
           single bed is Slim, sitting in the trapped summer air.   

           On the night stand, A PICTURE OF SLIM AND GABBY from a sun-
           brushed afternoon long forgotten.

A PHONE RINGS -- 

           INT. NOLAN HOME - BEDROOM - PREDAWN 

           THE LIGHT ON THE NIGHT STAND IS FLICKED revealing a bed and 
           MULBY NOLAN.  He sits up, answers the phone. 

                                 SHERIFF NOLAN 
                        Hello... He didn’t call?... I’ll 
                        get my mother up an’ then be over.

           He hangs up the phone, wipes the sleep from his eyes.  The 
           NAKED WOMAN beside him, forties, stirs. 

                                 NAKED WOMAN
                        Should I go? 

                                 SHERIFF NOLAN
                        Yeah...

                                 NAKED WOMAN 
                        I gotta pee first...

           She looks at Nolan as if for a kiss or a goodbye.  He gives 
           her nothing.  She leaves for the bathroom. 

           From the night stand drawer, Nolan removes and opens a new 
           bottle of bourbon.  He sips and we hear the woman PEEING.  

           In the grey predawn light, he’s just thirty.  A functioning 
           alcoholic, he’s developed a chronic cough.  The five years 
           since we last saw him look like ten and to him they feel like 
           twenty.  Somehow, he thought things would be different. 

           He coughs, loud and deep-lunged.  The TOILET FLUSHES.   

           INT. BATHROOM - EARLY MORNING   

           Nolan sits on the edge of the tub, bathing his MOTHER, 
           seventies.  She is old and so frail and barely cognizant. 

                                 MOTHER 
                        I’m tired, Mulby.  

                                 SHERIFF NOLAN 
                        Are you takin’ your medicine, Ma? 

                                 MOTHER

                        Lean your head close to me.  

           She leans and he shampoos the wire hair on her freckled 
           scalp. 

                                 MOTHER
                        My knees hurt. 

           INT. KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING 

           In Sheriff’s uniform, Nolan sits at the kitchen table eating 
           a fried egg.  Across from him, Mother nibbles toast.    

           INT. FAMILY ROOM - LATER    

           Nolan lays his Mother down on the sofa.  He turns the TV on 
           for her.  A gameshow.  Turns it loud because she can’t hear. 

           INT. HENDRICK HOME - KITCHEN - MORNING 

           DUSTY SUNLIGHT and Cormac’s seated at the kitchen table in a 
           landscaping t-shirt, drinking a beer and fashioning his toast 
           into a temple, egg yolk as the glue.  

           Slim enters, pours himself a black coffee, takes a seat at 
           the table.  He reaches over, turns his brother’s face toward 
           him to appraise the bruises.  Cormac resists.  

                                 SLIM
                   (about the beer)
                        You’re lettin’ yourself get too 
                        used ta that stuff. 

                                 CORMAC
                   (straightening his temple)
                        Yeah well, that’s the one thing Pop 
                        left me with.  His thirsty insides. 

           Cormac takes a piece of bacon from his plate and dangles it 
           over Gunther’s mouth.  The dog numbly accepts.

                        Don’t feed ‘im that stuff.  No 
                        wonder his wires are all messed up.

           Cormac stands, brings his plate to the sink.

                        half what you owe.  For now.  

           Cormac considers the envelope.  Enraged, he tosses his beer 
           bottle across the room.  SMASH! 

                                 CORMAC

                        burst on someone!    

           After a moment, the air settles and Cormac lights a cigarette 
           and inhales deeply.  Releases.

           Dodge Aries and drive away.

           INT. SHERIFF’S CRUISER (DRIVING) - MORNING 

           SUMMER SUN on the windshield as Nolan drives.  Outside, 
           something catches his eye and he slows. 

           EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS 

           Nolan exits the Cruiser and considers a pair of bare feet 
           protruding from a line of shrubs.

           The scrawny legs stir a bit and reveal they belong to the 
           naked body of a young man.

                        It’s Mulby, Brady.

                        Mulby Nolan? 

           A RUSTLING and a head peeks out now.  This is BRADY O’RILEY, 
           twenty-two, slight and callow with a jittery, blood-spotted 
           right eye which makes him appear a bit cross-eyed.      

           He looks up at Nolan.  Still drunk.

                        Well it’s good, good to see you,

                        I see it again. 

           Brady spins.

                        And there’s my ass, you old bag!

                        Put some goddamn clothes on, will 
                        ya?!  Jesus Christ, Brady.   

           Nolan hands Brady his ten-gallon hat and Brady puts it over 
           his crotch.  

           A passing car slows.    

                                 BRADY 
                        What the fuck d’you want?  
                   (lifts the hat)
                        I’ll let ya’ kiss it for sixty-five 
                        cents!    

           Elaine shuffles back into the home, watches behind the door. 

           Nolan begins to gather Brady’s clothes from the sidewalk and 
           street - rawhide jacket and cowboy boots.

                        Get dressed in the car.  I’m headed 
                        to your place anyhow.  

                                 BRADY

                        Your dad didn’t come home last 
                        night. 

                                 BRADY
                        Hopefully he fell in a river.  

           Nolan nudges Brady toward the Cruiser.  

                                 BRADY (cont’d)
                        Say, why don’t you never come 
                        ‘round no more, Sheriff?  Never 
                        come to see my sister anymore.  

           Nolan stiffens a bit.  Brady climbs inside. 

                                 BRADY (cont’d)
                        Why is that, Sheriff? 

           Nolan doesn’t know the answer.  He rounds the hood and HONK! 
           Brady hits the horn, startles Nolan.  

           Nolan climbs inside and starts the car.  

                                 BRADY (cont’d)
                        You aint gonna tell my sister, are 
                        ya’? 

           They drive away.

           She turns back, watches Ben inside the home.  Dressed in 
           baseball uniform and glove, he tosses a ball to himself.

           She smiles.  

           The Sheriff’s Cruiser rolls into the driveway.  Nolan and a 
           now-dressed Brady exit.  Brady walks into the house without 
           speaking to Gabby.  Nolan approaches. 

                                 GABBY
                        Should I even ask about that?  
                   (Nolan shakes his head)
                        Hope I didn’t wake you up this 
                        mornin’.

                        but he didn’t come home.  Not like

                        Slim came by the restaurant.  They 
                        discussed something about Cormac.    

           Nolan considers that a moment - Slim - and his thoughts 
           wander beyond the case.  

           INT. O’RILEY HOME - FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS 

           Brady sits on the stairwell.  Nursing a headache, but

                        Just likes being out there. 

           A long pause and Nolan watches Ben inside the home and 
           neither Gabby or Nolan speaks.

           Nolan COUGHS and COUGHS and wipes the sweat from his forehead

           THE HARVEST WORKERS SPREAD OUT IN THE FIELD and Slim walks 
           alongside a combine with a scythe.  The day wanes but he is 
           not tired.  

           He pauses a moment.  Admires the wheat.  His gaze finds THE 
           OWNER & HIS SON seated on the front porch.  Talking.  The 
           Owner slides his arm over his son’s shoulder.         

           He returns to work.  

           EXT. WHEAT FIELD - DUSK 

           SLIM WALKING TO HIS PICK-UP and Brady steps out of the Ford 
           wearing a buck-colored cowboy hat and there’s a bulge of 
           tobacco in his cheek.

           Slim tosses his belongings into the truck bed.  Brady follows 
           and CRACK! BRADY’S FIST AGAINST SLIM’S MOUTH and Slim winces 
           and spits out a streak of blood and Brady regards his fist, 
           surprised by the force of the blow.

           Brady draws his arm back again.  Before he can throw a punch,

                                 BRADY
                        I bet not.  I remember what 
                        happened down in Rittsfield...at 
                        that bar you crazy sonofabitch. 

           He lets Brady down. 

                                 SLIM
                        I ain’t been that way in a long 
                        time. 

                                 BRADY
                        Some things ya’ don’t lose. 

           Slim don’t wanna hear it and he climbs inside the Ford now 
           and BU-BU-BU-BU-RUMP!  the engine kicks.  

           The truck pulls away and Brady watches it go and there is a 
           look on his face like that of a bullied youth.  Hurt.

           The front door of the modest home SHOOTS OPEN releasing the 
           SOUNDS OF A HUMBLE PARTY and Cormac is shoved out by TWO MEN.

           No answer and Cormac moves into the street, lights a

           SHROUDED IN DARKNESS, Sam Nebraska sits emotionless in the 
           backseat, eyes under his Fedora like candle flames through 
           caverns. 

           Cormac enters and the light clicks and floods the car 
           momentarily and Sam Nebraska presses his SILVER .45 PISTOL 
           against Cormac’s temple.  His cigarette sags.

                        What i-i-s it you want, fella?   

           Cormac turns to view Sam and with that Sam reaches over, 
           grabs Cormac’s palm and SLICES! ACROSS IT WITH HIS BOXCUTTER.  
           Cormac SCREAMS IN PAIN. 

                                 SAM NEBRASKA 
                        Take the back roads...where it’s 
                        dark...

           Cormac is panting now, his eyes straight ahead, blood 
           dripping from his palm onto the steering wheel. 

           The SENILE ENGINE COUGHS and TURNS and the car pulls away.  

           VIEW ON THE REAR VIEW MIRROR 

           as the headlights of the Blue Cutlass emerge from darkness.

           INT. HENDRICK HOME - KITCHEN - EVENING  

           AT THE KITCHEN TABLE Nolan’s made himself at home and he 
           pours a little bourbon (the bottle’s half empty now) into his 
           coffee and pets Gunther at his feet.  

           Slim enters and the men appraise one another wordlessly.

           Gunther leaves Nolan and saunters up to Slim’s feet and Slim 
           moves behind the counter and pours himself a coffee.

           Slim opens the sliding glass door and lets the dog out.  He 
           takes a seat at the table.  Away from Mulby.

                        thin as the light around a shade.  

           Nolan stares at Slim long after the word’s end.  Finally, he 
           coughs - loud and deep - and when he can’t stop, Slim rises 
           and brings him a glass of water.  He sips and it soothes.

           quick and...slowly...WHOOF...life leaves his body in a tiny 
           exhale.  Things end quietly without notice.

           Bud swats the flies away and Sam Nebraska just lets them 
           fall.  They twitch on his Fedora and shoulders and when 
           they’ve all fallen...silence. 

                                 BUD (cont’d)
                        ...Fuckin’ bugs. 

           They enter the Cutlass and the engine kicks and the wipers 
           streak the Mayflies across the windshield.  Brown-yellow. 

           EXT. TOWNSHIP BASEBALL FIELD - NIGHT 

           The Sheriff’s Cruiser sits on the dirt shoulder just beyond 
           the outfield wall.  

           INT. SHERIFF’S CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

           Nolan watches Ben, bored in right field.  The bottle of 
           bourbon is nearly empty and he pours the final sips into his 
           coffee.  His eyes find Gabby in the bleachers now. 

           INT. OLDSMOBILE CUTLASS (DRIVING ) - LATER    

           THE NIGHT SKY CAVERNOUS AND BLACKNESS ALL AROUND as Bud and 
           Sam drive.  The Boxer Dog sleeps in the backseat. 

           The CAR SHAKES. 

                                 BUD
                        Goddamn belt.  I need to get this 
                        thing inspected.   

           Bud hands Sam his share of the money.

           WIDE AWAKE, Slim with a mug of black coffee, waiting up for 
           his brother to return home. 

                                          FADE OUT.

EXPANSE - DAWN   

           Beleaguered by tall grass and forest, the Dodge Aries sits 
           like a stranger in an alien land.  The humidity heavies the 
           air and there is the sound of a LABORING WOODPECKER.  

           CORMAC’S FACE

           in the grass and the blood has dried and cracked and his 
           cheek is pressed against the ground as a dead Mayfly rests on 
           his head. 

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - SAME  

           A POLICE CRUISER glides past the expanse.  BRAKES SQUEAL and 
           wheels slide, shooting up a dirt cloud.    

           EXT. EXPANSE - LATER THAT MORNING 

           POLICE CRUISERS and DEPUTIES surround the scene.  A young 
           deputy, DEPUTY BOGWIGGIN, is there, sweating after having 
           just thrown-up. 

           Standing over the body, an OLDER DEPUTY pinches the wings of 
           the Mayfly and removes it from Cormac’s forehead and regards 
           the insect. 

                                 OLDER DEPUTY
                   (to Bowiggin)
                        Helluva way ta live, huh?  The 
                        Mayfly.  Their mouths don’t work. 
                        Can’t eat.  Usually live less than 
                        a day.  Imagine tryin’ ta squeeze a 
                        life into a day. 

           The SHERIFF’S CRUISER arrives.  Nolan steps from the car 
           having already received the news.  He bends down to Cormac’s 
           level, considers the body. 

                                 DEPUTY BOWIGGIN
                        Who the hell’d do a thing like 
                        that, Mulby?

                                 SHERIFF NOLAN
                        There’s jus’ an evil in this world. 

           THE SKY IMPLODES and it begins to rain heavily. 
                                                               (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)

HENDRICK HOME - AFTERNOON 

           From a distance, the side of the house.  Rain percusses the 
           aluminum awning above the side entrance where Slim sits. 

           Gunther prowls the front yard, sniffing tufts of weeds. 

           A Cruiser idles to a stop and a Deputy approaches Slim slowly 
           with the news. 

                                 PRIEST (V.O.)
                        ‘This other son of yours wasted 
                        your money on bad women. 

           And in seconds it’s all been said. 

           CLOSE ON SLIM 

           listening to Deputy, but not at all.  There’s a vacancy in 
           his eyes.    

           INT. SAINTS PETER & PAUL CHURCH - AFTERNOON 

           A PRIEST recites the Bible passage from the podium.  An urn 
           sits at the altar.

                                 PRIEST 
                        And now that he has come home, you 
                        ordered the best calf to be killed 
                        for feast.

           Nolan and Gabby are there, separately.  Nolan watches Slim.  

           No one among the small number of MOURNERS is crying.  Their 
           presence is perfunctory: a town member died.  All except 
           Slim.  His eyes are wet and burning.

           EXT. WEATHERED FARMHOUSE - EVENING (DUSK) 

           THE SUN WANING AND THE SKY ORANGE as Slim scatters his 
           brother’s ashes over the land.  

                                 PRIEST (V.O.)
                        His Father replied, “My son, you 
                        are always with me, and everything 
                        I have is yours. 
                                                                 (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT    

           Slim lying in bed and the air is heavy in the room and he 
           won’t be falling asleep soon.

                                 PRIEST (V.O.)
                        But we should be glad and 
                        celebrate... Your brother was dead, 
                        but he is now alive. 

           So he rises and exits into the -- 

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           and peers into Cormac’s empty bedroom.  Stark.  Nothingness. 

                                 PRIEST (V.O.)
                        He was lost and has now been 
                        found.”’

           Outside the window, MAYFLIES FALL IN DROVES, touching the 
           earth as soft as baby steps. 

           INT. BASEMENT - MINUTES LATER  

           A LIGHT STRING AND A HAND PULLS DOWN ON IT and lights floods 
           the unfinished basement revealing Slim. 

           He moves to a corner where a mounted oak gun rack hosts a 12 
           GAUGE SHOTGUN with silver side plates.  He removes the gun. 

           ON SLIM’S HANDS 

           hardened, feeling the weight and texture of the gun.  
           Remembering.   

                                      FADE TO BLACK.

           (O.S.) THE SOUND OF WIND SWIRLING THROUGH CAR WINDOWS and -- 

           INT./EXT. FORD PICK-UP - NIGHT   

           Slim drives through the night.  Windows down.  Night black.

           A throw-back to the 50’s burger pits.  Waitresses tend to 
           customers car-side. 

           Brady eats on a bench, eyes watching the teenagers mingle 
           with a hue of jealously over things never had. 

                                 TEENAGER
                        What’s wrong with your eye, man?

           LAUGHS FROM THE KIDS and Brady’s head sinks and he wishes he 
           could just disappear. 

           Suddenly, SLIM’S HAND YANKS BRADY UP by the collar --  

                                 BRADY
                        What the...
                   (looks back, sees Slim)
                        The hell’s this about!?  Huh!? 

                                 SLIM
                        You know your Father’s business? 

                                 BRADY
                        I aint finished eatin’! 

           Slim considers that, pauses. 

                                 SLIM
                        Go ‘head.  Get your burger...  Go 
                        on dammnit!

                                 BRADY
                        I don’t want it no more.  You upset 
                        my stomach. 

                                 SLIM
                        Suit yourself. 

           And Slim drags Brady to the Ford and opens the passenger door 
           and throws him inside.  Brady opens the door to climb out. 
           Slim slams it shut. 

           EXT. O’RILEY HOME - NIGHT 

           The Ford pick-up parked by the curb.   
                                               (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)           INT. FORD PICK-UP - CONTINUOUS  

           Slim alone and now Brady enters and closes the door behind 
           him.  He hands Slim a sheet of paper.  Slim eyes it.  

                                 BRADY
                        Collector named Cullen Meanan.  
                        Used ta work for my Dad.  Drank too 
                        much when he could get it, ate too 
                        much when it was there, talked too 
                        much all the time.  Dad let ‘im go.  
                        Figured he’d know somethin’. 

                                 SLIM
                        This the only name you got?  

                                 BRADY
                        Well shit, I don’t see you bringin’ 
                        nothin’.

                                 SLIM
                        I don’t know nothin’. 

           Slim starts the car and hastily reverses. 

                                 BRADY
                        You goin’ now!?  He lives all the 
                        way over in Egan Valley for 
                        chrissakes! 

                                 SLIM
                        You got somewhere else ta be?  
                   (Brady doesn’t)
                        Then put your head against that 
                        window an’ get some sleep. 

           Slim shifts the truck into drive.  It barrels down the road. 

                                           CUT TO:

           A RESTAURANT SIGN - EGAN VALLEY - EARLY MORNING 

           ZINDEL’S DINER and just below it a sign announces, Today’s 
           Special: Eggs - Runny, Over-Easy, Scrambled, Poached, Fried.  
           $2.95 w/sausage patties. 

           PAN TO REVEAL -- the Ford pick-up in the parking lot.

           (cid:13)           EXT. FORD PICK-UP - CONTINUOUS 

           Slim watches the outside.  Brady’s asleep, head against the 
           window, drool dripping onto his shirt.   

           Slim sees something.  Nudges Brady. 

                                 SLIM 
                        That him? 

           Brady stirs, wipes the drool from his face.  Looks. 

                                 BRADY
                        Yeah...that’s him... 

           Slim reaches behind his seat and grabs the Winchester. 

           EXT. GRAVEL LOT - CONTINUOUS  

           CLOSE ON A THICK SILVER BELT BUCKLE OF A CONFEDERATE FLAG and 
           the fold of a fat man’s gut hangs over the belt as he walks.  

           The gut belongs to the truculent CULLEN MEANAN, mid-thirties, 
           on his way to his car.  He pinches the ass of his homely 
           girlfriend, DIANA, twenties. 

                                 DIANA
                        Stop it, baby!  I just ate.  You’ll 
                        make me pee my pants. Gosh... 

           Nearby, Slim and Brady exit the Ford pick-up and approach 
           Cullen.  Slim holds the Winchester tight to his side.  

                                 BRADY
                        Cullen.  Remember me?  Brady 
                        O’Riley. 

                                 CULLEN MEANAN
                   (without stopping)
                        Nope...

                                 BRADY
                        I got a question. 

                                 CULLEN MEANAN
                        Well I ain’t got time ta answer 
                        questions from people I don’t know.  
                        The lady an’ me planned a mornin’ 
                        of debauchery.

           Brady jogs to catch up.

                                 CULLEN MEANAN
                   (turns back sharply)

                                 SLIM
                        We got a question’s all. 

                                 CULLEN MEANAN 
                   (to Slim)
                        Who you a‘pose ta be?  I asked the 
                        boy a question.  Let him answer on 
                        his own.  
                   (back to Brady)
                        What’d you jus’ call me, crazy eye?  

                                 BRADY
                        Fat body...? 

                                 CULLEN MEANAN
                        That right?  I assume that’s some 
                        kinda gag on my weight, huh? 

                                 DIANA
                        I’d say it was, baby. 

           And with that Cullen’s hand is at Brady’s throat, SLAMMING 
           HIM AGAINST A CAR.  Slim raises the shotgun from his side, 
           levels it at Cullen --

                        Now we didn’t plan -- 

           BA-WHOOMP! Cullen drills Slim in the gut.  Slim doubles over 
           and Cullen SMASHES his fist into his ear.  

           Diana is CUSSING --

           -- AND THRASHING HER PURSE at Brady.  

           Cullen RIPS the shotgun from Slim, SLAMS it against the 
           pavement, warping it.  

                                 CULLEN MEANAN
                        Fat body, huh!?  That what you 
                        a’holes said!?  My woman likes me 
                        big an’ healthy! 

           Slim’s bent over, cringing, his ear a cauliflower and Diana 
           is DRUBBING HIM NOW --

                                 DIANA 
                        You fuckin’ bastards tryin’ ta hit

                   (laughing)
                        Tell ‘em, Di-girl!  

           And then, mid-swing, Slim grabs Di-girl’s purse and pulls it 
           to him.  She lunges forward and CRACK! his fist meets her 
           nose.  She SCREAMS IN PAIN! 

           Before Cullen can react, Slim shoots up, takes a revolver 
           from his jeans and sticks it under his meaty chin. 

                                 SLIM
                        Move an’ I’ll blow this wattle 
                        right through your neck.

                        No I just struck your woman an’ 
                        she’s lucky that’s all I did...  
                        We’re lookin’ for the men who 
                        killed my brother.  Men we assume 
                        killed John O’Riley, too. 

           Brady dabs his bloodied nose with a handkerchief.

                        I aint collected in two years.  Got

           Cullen points to a shiny white pick-up truck in the parking 
           lot.  The arborvitae logo of C & V Landscaping on the side. 

           Slim looks back at Brady.  Disappointed in this lead.  

                                 SLIM
                        Who collected from John then? 

           Diana struggles to her feet.  Slim pushes her back down with 
           the heel of his boot.

                        that!?  Fuckin’ pricks...

           In an instant Slim DRILLS Cullen in his tubby belly and then 
           CRACKS! him across his face and Cullen is bent over moaning 
           and blood is pouring from his broken nose...

           Slim aims the revolver and BANG! BANG! BANG! the windshield 
           of the white landscaping pick-up is a cobweb and he shoves 
           the hot gun back under Cullen’s double chin.

           THE FORD is pulled over.  Slim pukes while inside the car 
           Brady dabs his nose with a blood-drenched handkerchief.

           EXT. SHANTY - FAR OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN - AFTERNOON   

           The tiny home stands alone on a gravel back-road.  Just it 
           and the birds.  A PACKAGE lies outside the front door. 

           CLOSE ON THE PACKAGE 

           JONAH FINN, ANTIQUE GUN REPAIR, 13 Embrook Road, Cedarton, 
           Indiana. 

           The door opens and a hand brings it inside. 

           INT. SHANTY - AFTERNOON 

           JONAH FINN, sixties, at his unkempt work station under a desk 
           light and he slowly takes apart a Smith & Wesson .45 
           Triplelock Revolver, readying it for repair. 

           He’s a man built solid as oak possessing a handsomeness 
           marred only by the droop and hue of age.

           shaking as he disassembles the revolver.  The barrel.  The 
           cylinder.  The gate catch.  The grip.  The frame.  The 
           backstrap.  The hammer.

           He holds the cylinder up.  Squints as he appraises it. 

                                 JONAH
                        Rusted bitch...

           The room is suddenly flooded with light and Jonah looks to 
           the door and there is Slim with the busted-up shotgun. 

           Jonah smiles, removes the tattered cigarillo from his mouth. 

                                 JONAH (cont’d)

           INT. SHANTY - KITCHEN - AFTERNOON 

           SILENCE among Slim and Jonah at the square kitchen table.  
           Their eyes are focused outside on LEENY FINN, Jonah’s 
           daughter, eighteen and deaf.  She picks daffodils, watches 
           her three-legged rabbit roam. 

                                 JONAH
                        Jesus Christ.  He was my Godson.  I 
                        remember when he was born.  Your 
                        Father an’ me sat on the roof.  It 
                        was a Monday afternoon...  How they 
                        done it? 

                                 SLIM
                        Beat ‘im. 

           That makes Jonah so sick he can’t speak.  Finally -- 

                                 JONAH
                        Know who it was?

           ON A LINE OF HANDMADE VASES ON AN OLD TABLE and BOOM! a shot 
           is fired.  The vases don’t move.  BOOM!  Again no movement. 

           SLIM AND JONAH STAND AT A DISTANCE, Jonah with a revolver, 
           taking aim, his hands shaking wildly. 

                                 SLIM

                        Fine...caught a chill’s all.

           Jonah steadies himself and - BOOM! - a FAMILY OF BIRDS 
           ABSCOND from an Ash tree above the thin stream.

           Slim turns back.  Leeny watches from the yard, skeptical of 
           both the shooting and Slim. 

                                 SLIM
                   (about the vases)
                        You’re certain Leeny don’t want ‘em 
                        no more?

                        nuthin’ but tadpoles anyhow...

           Slim takes the gun, aims and BOOM!  A SPLURT! as the bullet 
           hits the stream and the Mallards flee.

                        Breathin’ in poison.  Doctors say I 
                        aint got too long.  I’m gatherin’ 
                        dust here.  There’s no dignity in 
                        that. 

                                 SLIM
                   (considering)
                        What about Leeny? 

                                 JONAH
                        She gets along fine.  Takes care a 
                        herself better than I do...  

           And on Jonah’s face is a man who doesn’t want to die in bed.  

                                 SLIM
                        OK...

                                 JONAH
                        OK what? 

                                 SLIM
                        We leave tomorra.

           Slim reverses again.  Jonah watches him and the hint of a 
           smile slowly curls on his face. 

           INT. HENDRICK HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT      

           HEAVY RAIN AGAINST THE WINDOW and, on the stove, Slim starts 
           heat under a teapot.

           (O.S.) THE SCREECH OF TIRES.  

           He moves to the front door.  OUTSIDE, Gabby steps from her 
           Buick with purpose, ignoring the mailbox she knocked over. 

                                 SLIM 
                        Shit...

           Slim runs back to the kitchen, shuts off the light, then - 
           CLING-CLANG-CLINK he knocks over some pots.

                                 SLIM (cont’d)
                        Fuck.  Goddamnit...

           Quiet.  

           A KNOCK.  Nothing.  Another KNOCK. 

                                 GABBY (O.S.)
                        I know you’re in there, Charlie.  I 
                        saw the light on when I pulled in!  
                   (a beat)
                        It’s rainin’ like hell, Charlie!

           Slim doesn’t move. 

           EXT. HENDRICK HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Gabby in the pouring rain, roaming the house, peering in 
           windows. 

                                 GABBY
                        I know what you’re doin’, Charlie!  
                        They’ll send ya back ta jail an’ I 
                        don’t care - I really don’t - but I 
                        won’t let you take Brady.  Oh would 
                        you open the door you coward!

                        They’ll send ya back ta jail, 
                        Charlie!  

           The thought settles on her and she begins to cry and somehow 
           this isn’t about Brady at all.  The rain falls on her head, 
           fast and hard. 

           Slim opens the door slowly and holds a section of newspaper 
           over her head. 

                                 SLIM

           She allows herself to be close against his body for a moment.  
           Then she SLAPS! him across the face.  Hard.  His eyes fall.  

                                 GABBY
                        You ruined what we had but I won’t 
                        let you take Brady.  He’s just a 
                        kid and I won’t let you take him... 

           She takes a moment to compose herself, clears her eyes.  

           He watches her walk away and climb into the running Buick and 
           we see Ben in the passenger seat.  

           (O.S.) THE TEAPOT WHISTLES and he doesn’t think to remove it.

           EXT. CORNFIELD - PREDAWN 

           THE SKY IS BLUE-PURPLE and an ELDERLY FARMER walks alongside 
           his Hound Dog.  The man’s pipe smokes white. 

           He pauses.  Looks down at the insect-ridden body of John 
           O’Riley. 

           The Hound Dog sniffs and the Elderly Farmer stares 
           emotionless, like it were a squirrel.     

           EXT. HENDRICK HOME - BACKYARD - MORNING 

           CLOSE ON A BOWL OF DOG FOOD and Gunther eating lethargically.   

           The Winchester approaches the dog’s head...against his 
           skull...

           Slim stands over the animal...aims...narrows his eye...finger 
           finds the trigger...

           ...but he can’t do it.  He lets the gun down. 

                                 SLIM
                        Shit.  Goddamn you, Gunth...  

           EXT. DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER   

           Slim moves to the Ford, tosses a duffle bag into the flatbed, 
           notices the DEPUTY CRUISER spying him from across the street.

SHANTY - MORNING 

           JONAH AND LEENY wait on the front porch.  Quiet.    

           The Ford enters the driveway.  Leeny hands Jonah a bagged 
           lunch she’s packed for him.  

           He stands and walks away and she watches as he enters the 
           truck and watches still as it disappears down the road.  

           EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN - LATER THAT MORNING 

           The Sheriff’s Cruiser parked just before the train tracks, 
           blocking passage.  Nolan’s outside, back against the car. 

           The Ford pick-up approaches, slows to a stop.  Slim exits.  

                                 SHERIFF NOLAN
                        Headed outta town someplace?

                        have ya?...  We got leads on John’s

                        Oh cut it, will ya’, Mulby!?  Just 
                        stand there an’ watch ‘til this 
                        truck vanishes over that road an’ 
                        then you can run to her...jus’ like 
                        ya did the last time. 

                                 SHERIFF NOLAN
                        She came to me the last time. 

           SLIM GRIPS NOLAN’S SHIRT, pushes him back against the 
           Cruiser.  Their faces just inches apart. 

                                 SHERIFF NOLAN (cont’d)
                        It’s on you, Slim.  You went in.  
                        You left her.  

                                 SLIM
                        An’ if I didn’t go in? 

           Nolan doesn’t speak.

           Jonah steps from the truck.  Slowly in his age.  

                                 JONAH
                        Take it easy now, Slim.  Go easy. 

           He gently pulls Slim off of Nolan. 

                                 SLIM
                        It don’t matter no more...she don’t 
                        want neither of us. 

           Slim and Jonah climb back into the pick-up and Nolan watches 
           the car vanish.  Alone.  

           INT. FORD TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER 

           THE FERTILE WIND SWIRLS THROUGH THE CAR and Jonah opens the 
           lunch bag Leeny’s provided, bites into a pastrami sandwich. 

                                 JONAH
                        Wanna tell me what that was about? 

           Slim doesn’t.

           Jonah doesn’t like the sandwich.  Tosses it out the window.  
           Lights a cigarillo now and that tastes good.  He settles in.

HIGHWAY REST STOP - AFTERNOON 

           Slim gasses the Ford.  Jonah emerges from the shop, swigs a 
           fresh pint bottle of whiskey, lets it tarry in his mouth. 

                                 JONAH
                        Oh I do miss that taste...

           A FREIGHT TRUCK GLIDES IN and Brady hops out with a knapsack, 
           watery-eyed.

                        Been on you two since you left 
                        Gulchwood.  
                   (wipes his tears)
                        Found my Pop this mornin’.  Deke 
                        Casey’s field.  Goddamn asshole’s 
                        dead.  Bastard sonofabitch.   

           Brady can’t hold it together and his stomach heaves.  

           Slim looks at Jonah who’s already looking at him and neither 
           knows what to say so Jonah offers up his whiskey. 

                                 JONAH
                        Take some a that back. 

                                 BRADY
                        No! 

                                 JONAH
                        Oh hush, will ya’?  I’m standin’ 
                        right next ta ya’.

           Brady abides.  Swigs.  Coughs.    

                                 JONAH (cont’d)
                        Feel better? 

                                 BRADY
                        Hell no, Mister! 

                                 SLIM
                        Take it back slow for chrissakes.  
                        You’re burnin’ your throat. 

           Brady takes some more back.  Slower this time.  Doesn’t 
           cough. 

           INT./EXT. FORD PICK-UP - LATE AFTERNOON 

           Slim, Jonah and Brady driving along the country highway, 
           fields of wheat unfolding behind them, and passing a road 
           sign now: Bowenville - 35 Miles.   

           EXT. MAIN STREET - BOWNENVILLE, OHIO - EARLY EVENING  

           If time moved past the 1960’s, no one told the store owners.  

           The Ford pick-up crawls down the road and parks outside a 
           hamburger joint, Archibald’s.  

           Brady steps out.  Enters the restaurant.  

           INT. FORD PICK-UP - SOME MINUTES LATER 

           Slim and Jonah wait. 

                                 JONAH 
                        -- the hell’s he doin’ in there?  
                        Waitin’ tables? 

                                 SLIM 
                        Here he comes. 

           Brady enters the car, licking a tall, strawberry ice cream 
           cone.  He says nothing.  Slim and Jonah stare at him. 

                                 JONAH
                        Well...? 

                                 BRADY
                        Well what?

                        You get an address? 

                                 BRADY
                        No one knows Terry Adams.  

                                 JONAH
                   (a beat)
                        All them people in there an’ you’re 
                        tellin’ me not one knows a name? 

                                 BRADY
                        Yeah that’s what I’m tellin’ ya’. 

                                 JONAH
                        You better watch yourself, kid.  I 
                        don’t know you well ‘nuff.  

           CLUNK - Slim opens the door and exits and Jonah opens his 
           door and gives Brady an earnest stare before leaving. 

           INT. ARCHIBALD’S - EVENING 

           A MODEST CROWD fills the space and it’s Friday night so the 
           JUKEBOX PLAYS a little louder.  

           DING! Slim and Jonah enter and Slim removes his baseball cap.  
           Eyes take them in with a hue of xenophobia, then quickly 
           return to conversations and burgers and pop.   

           They approach the counter where a THIN MAN cleans the grille. 

                                 SLIM 
                        Excuse me, sir. 

                                 THIN MAN
                   (without turning back)
                        Menus on the counter.   

                                 SLIM
                        Actually, wondered if you might 
                        help us.  Lookin’ for an old 
                        friend.  

                                 THIN MAN
                   (turns now)
                        Which old friend’s that? 

                                 SLIM
                        Terry Adams.

           Thin Man smirks and approaches the counter. 

                                 THIN MAN
                        I didn’t know him ten seconds ago 
                        when your friend asked and I don’t 
                        know him now. 

                                 JONAH
                        Seem an awful small town not to 
                        know someone.  

                                 THIN MAN
                        If it’s so small, Old Dog, you find 
                        ‘im. 

           PATRONS CHUCKLE at the counter and the man in Jonah’s been 
           hurt a bit, made feel small.       

           Thin Man retreats. 

                                 THIN MAN (cont’d)
                   (to a Waitress)
                        I’m gonna fill the bathroom paper.

           EXT. ARCHIBALD’S - MOMENTS LATER 

           DING! Slim and Jonah exit and Slim moves to the Ford but 
           Jonah’s got other plans and veers.  

           INT. BATHROOM - ARCHIBALD’S - EVENING 

           Thin Man refills the toilet paper roll inside a bathroom 
           stall when - BOOM! -- 

           THE DOOR’S KICKED OPEN BY JONAH’S HEEL and he grabs the Thin 
           Man and shoves his head down, inches from the toilet water.  

                                 JONAH 
                        Got a memory of ‘im now?  He come 
                        in lickin’ ice cream cones? 

           Slim appears now and says nothing.  Goes over and locks the 
           bathroom door.  

                                 THIN MAN

           KNOCK! Jonah elbows Thin Man on his skull and covers his 
           mouth with his hand.   

           Jonah looks down at the toilet water.  Clean.  Been flushed. 

                                 JONAH
                        There piss an’ shit in one a them, 
                        Slim? 

           Slim looks into the neighboring stall. 

                                 SLIM
                        Both. 

           Jonah YANKS the Thin Man up, drags him next door, shoves his 
           head down into that toilet.  It’s filled with brown water, 
           piss and sloppy wet shit.  

           Thin Man resists with all his might and his neck veins are 
           showing and his face is a furnace, but his head’s moving 
           closer to the shit water...still...closer...

           ...finally, HE SHAKES HIS HEAD FURIOUSLY. 

           Jonah freezes.  Releases his hand.  

                                 JONAH
                        Say it. 

                                 THIN MAN
                        He runs a movie theater.  Drive-in 
                        off’a Duncan Road.

                        Two miles up.  Third stop make a 
                        right.  Take it til you see the 
                        lights.

           Jonah relents and A SPASM OF PAIN RUNS THROUGH HIM and he 
           cringes in pain and collapses against the stall door and 
           clutches his chest.   

           Thin Man falls back as well, too tired to yell or fight.

           CAREFULLY, Slim aids the ailing Jonah into the pick-up.  He 
           is an old vase. 

                                           CUT TO:

           EXT. CROSSROADS DRIVE-IN - NIGHT 

           BUT OUR VIEW’S FAR, FAR AWAY and the screen is just a tiny 
           rectangle of light in the middle of no man’s land.  

           Slim’s truck is a speck crawling down the dirt entrance road.   

           EXT. TICKET BOOTH - NIGHT 

           WITH A SIGN, Tonight: Stand By Me.  Family’s - $8.    

           Inside the thin booth, an ASIAN WOMAN cradles her NEWBORN 
           while she watches the picture.  

           THE MOVIE SCREEN   

           is wide and Stand By Me plays and the hairless fatso Vern 
           Tessio is panting and crying as a locomotive is about to ram 
           up his ass.

           THE CONCESSION STAND 

           under yellow lights, a PURE-FACED GIRL eats caramel popcorn 
           and reads a magazine about what makes a boyfriend good. 

           THE HOOD OF A CHEVROLET 

           reflects the blue of the movie screen and behind it a young 
           couple necks.  HE reaches up, palms her breast.  SHE resists.

                                 SHE 
                        Wait.  

                                 HE
                        What is it? 

                                 SHE

           She smiles, rubs his hands.  To warm them to touch her.  

           PAN ACROSS the line of domestic cars, the patrons, and we see 
           the passengers - some old, some young, some families and some 
           lovers.  Popcorn and soda and goobers and gummies.  

           Finally, we pause at the Ford.  Inside are Brady and Jonah.  
           Jonah is tired, eyes fading.  Brady eats chocolate raisins.

                        It aint believable.  Bullshit.

           Brady adjusts the speaker so he can hear better.

           SLIM 

           walks the dirt grounds between cars.  He crosses now to the 
           rear of the lot, toward the wooden shed that is the 
           projection room.    

           He pauses outside the door, tucks his revolver into the waist 
           of his jeans.

           The man behind the voice YANKS open the door.  He’s forty, 
           tall and tattooed, face harsh and voice black-lunged.  Looks 
           about as much like a projectionist as a whore does a nun.

                        Need to ask ‘im some questions.  

           Projectionist sees the gleam of the revolver in Slim’s jeans 
           and he stares at Slim as though reading him.

                        some collectin’ from John O’Riley.

                        I’d say he’s got ten seconds to

                        truck through his movie screen.  

           Projectionist retreats a step.  Slim draws the revolver.  

           A resigned look washes over Projectionist and Slim knows it’s 
           TERRY ADAMS and Terry Adams knows the past has run him down.  

           Terry wanders back into the darkness of the projection room.  
           Stares out the tiny shed window at the movie screen.

           EXT. CROSSROADS DRIVE-IN THEATER - NIGHT 

           THE MOVIE RUN OUT and the crowd dispersed.  

           AT THE TICKET BOOTH, the exiting cars return their speakers 
           to the Asian Woman.   

           BRADY sits on the hood of the Ford, eating a hot dog.  He   
           watches the Pure-Faced Girl sweep the trash.  When she looks 
           his way, he quickly turns.  Self-conscious about his eye. 

           OUTSIDE THE PROJECTION ROOM, Slim and Terry sit on folded 
           chairs eating concession food.  

                                 TERRY ADAMS 
                        -- started collectin’ when I was 
                        nineteen.  I wasn’t goin’ nowhere.  
                        Friend a mine knew a guy named 
                        Richie Nebraska who took bets.  
                        Said he lived outside Philly, had 
                        little operations scattered all 
                        over.  Needed a few bruisers to go 
                        around an’ collect for ‘im.  I 
                        weren’t no husher back then so the 
                        job didn’t bother me none.  I’d get 
                        my list every week, go shake a few 
                        pockets, toss some fists if needed.  
                        All there was to it.  I was young, 
                        hungry an’ thirsty, an’ the pay 
                        filled most a that.

           zits, sits beside his GRANDPARENTS, eighties, on the sofa.  
           The Grandparents look comatose, unmindful. 

           Terry questions the boy while Sam stares longingly at the

           The Young Boy’s on the floor, body limp from a broken neck.  
           The Grandparents have bullet holes in their foreheads and 
           blood rivulets drip off their noses. 

           Terry enters.  His face sobers.  Sam’s bent down, closing the 
           Boy’s eyelids.

           UNDER THE MOVIE SCREEN, Brady sits beside the Pure-Faced 
           Girl.  She’s opened his palm and is showing him the

                        think we was doin’?  Talkin’? 

                                 JONAH
                        I guess not...

           Jonah slides his toast across a runny egg yolk.  Eats. 

                                 JONAH (cont’d)
                        The first girl I ever had was 
                        Summer Ingersoll.  Behind Mac’s 
                        Tall Burger Pit when she was on 
                        break.  She smelt like grease.

           Brady stops eating suddenly.

                                 JONAH (cont’d)
                        Didn’t make a sound the whole time 
                        we shook.  Pulled up her pants and 
                        drank a strawberry milkshake.  I 
                        was fourteen.

           Brady brings his napkin up to his mouth.  Gags.  Pukes a bit.  
           He stands up, rushes off to the bathroom.

                        Only sound she made. ‘Shine your

           Slim and Jonah sit in the humid air.  Jonah slides his toast 
           over the yolk. 

           INT. FORD PICK-UP (DRIVING) - DUSK 

           EARNEST LOOKS from the men and silence pervades the car. 

           THE WINCHESTER peers above the backseat, nearly hidden but 
           loud as thunder.  RAIN PATTERS against the windshield. 

           EXT. ROUTE 31 - COATESVILLE, PA - NIGHT 

           IN THE DISTANCE, A MASSIVE STEEL MILL exhales from the white-
           hot of a day’s toil.  

           Slim’s pick-up plods into town.  Like a tired horse.  

           EXT. COATESVILLE STREET - NIGHT (LATE) 

           SHEETS OF RAIN POUND a grimy street.  It’s a husky city, 
           Coatesville.  Brawling.  Big-shouldered.

           JIMMY PERCY, forties, a slight, pig-nosed bartender looks up 
           and sees the rain dripping from a crack in the soft ceiling.

           The lights are up as the shoddy, saloon-like bar has closed 
           for the night.  CC & ELLIOT HARDINGS, forties, curious twin 
           brothers - CC slight and Elliot plump - sit at the bar.

                        OK.  Let’s go on home.  Mom’ll 
                        throw a fit if we’re late in this 
                        rain.  Think we drown.  

           Elliot helps his dejected brother to his feet.  It’s been a 
           long night of drinking.

           Francis moves across the bar, up the REAR STAIRCASE.

                        ...Rawlings and Oberton.  Then 
                        Altoona.  Close them all.  It’s 
                        time.  

           Seated by the window, staring pensively outside at the rain 
           is RICHIE NEBRASKA, fifties, a small, tired man dressed in a 
           grey suit.  Could easily be mistaken for a lawyer or a judge.  

                                 RICHIE NEBRASKA (cont’d)
                        I’m old, Sammy.  I’m old and tired 
                        and my blood’s different than it 
                        used to be. 

                                 SAM NEBRASKA 
                        Bud know? 

           Richie turns back to Sam.  

                                 RICHIE NEBRASKA
                        I told my brother first.  Like I 
                        always do.  You make yourself some 
                        money over at Jilly’s? 
                   (Sam nods)
                        Good for you, boy... 
                   (about the dog)
                        They won’t allow her at the new 
                        place, Sam. 

           Sam cuddles the dog closer.

                        Oh God she’s sick, Samuel.  Her 
                        heart’s failing her.     

           Sam nearly cries. 

                                 RICHIE NEBRASKA (cont’d)
                        Goddamnit, Sam! 

           Richie stands, SLAPS SAM ACROSS THE FACE.  Sam hangs his head 
           like a child amid his Mother’s reproof. 

                                 RICHIE NEBRASKA (cont’d)
                        I should’ve known better than to 
                        bring that up.  She’ll feel only a 
                        pinch and then...endless meadows 
                        and lilacs. 

           Guilt burgeons in Richie.  He moves to his brother and rubs 
           his blotched scalp.  

                                 RICHIE NEBRASKA (cont’d)
                        You were old before you were young, 
                        Sam.  That was my fault.  

           He kisses his head.

           FATIGUED DUPLEX HOMES line the blue-collar street and the

           Slim, Jonah and Brady.  Jonah greases the hammer of a Colt 
           Revolver with an ancient tin of hair wax, cigarillo in his

           Jonah moves over to the adjacent bathroom window and quietly 
           slides it open.

           In the charcoal suit, Sam lies emotionless on the bed and 
           there’s the SOUND OF BUD MOANING from the neighboring room.  
           The Boxer Dog sleeps in the corner.

           Francis gives Bud a blowjob under the sheets and BUD BANGS 
           HIS BACK AGAINST THE HEADBOARD.

           INT. COOZ’S - CONTINUOUS

           Slim and Brady hold Jimmy and Doc at bay and Brady is 
           breathing heavily and Slim looks up at the ceiling at the 
           rhythmic DRIP - DRIP - DRIP of rain water.  

           DOC BARSTOW 

           lets his hand slide towards his holstered pistol -- 

                                 SLIM

           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Jonah climbs in the window and his HAND TREMBLES WEAKLY in 
           his age and he slips slightly and his foot touches down on a 
           scale - KINK - the slightest sound.  Jonah freezes -- 

           INT. SAM’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Sam doesn’t move, his eyes fixed on the ceiling.  BUD 
           CLIMAXES NEXT DOOR IN A LOUD ORGASMIC U-U-UGH!  

           Then silence.

           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS  

           Jonah exhales and his feet touch the ground.  He removes his 
           Colt Revolver and pushes the bathroom door open slightly and 
           through the space between hinges, he sees the bed is empty.  

           He pushes slowly into --

           INT. SAM’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           and only the Boxer Dog is there, looking calmly to the opened 
           window.  Jonah turns.  Sam Nebraska stands outside on the 
           landing, gun drawn.

           Slim looks up.

           JIMMY PERCY 

           ducks down behind the bar.  

           DOC BARSTOW

           reaches for his pistol --  

                                 SLIM
                        Don’t fuckin’ do that! 

           but Doc draws the Pistol out and BA-WOOM! the Winchester 
           explodes and DOC FLIES OFF THE STOOL, blood squirting from 
           his neck.

           Richie has his coat open and he’s struggling greatly in his 
           age to get his pistol from the holster and Slim takes two 
           steps closer to him, gun aimed at his chest.   

           Richie looks at Slim, beaten.  He spits in Slim’s face.  Slim 
           pulls the trigger - BA-WOOM! 

           INT. BUD’S BEDROOM - SAME

           Bud slides his pants on quickly and -- 

           (O.S.) BA-WOOM!  He freezes a second...now grabs a pistol 
           from a drawer in the night stand. 

                                 BUD
                   (to Francis)
                        Get outta here, whore. 

           Bud exits.  On the bed, Francis smokes from a crack pipe,

           Brady has retreated to the rear staircase landing and he is 
           trembling and sweating.  Standing over Richie’s body, Slim 
           reloads - KLUCK KLUCK - and takes aims at the bar.

           DRIP of rainwater from the ceiling.  The Boxer Dog saunters 
           lazily past.  

           Bud peers into Sam’s bedroom and --

           stands over Jonah who is crawling on his belly, leaving a 
           streak of blood on the weathered hardwood floor.  Sam 
           watches, listens to his breathing.

           and descends the shadowy stairs.  At the bottom is Brady, 
           nervous, eyes searching the bar floor.  Bud takes aim at the

           Brady moves into the bathroom and closes the door and Slim 
           makes his way across the bar floor, around the pool of blood 
           at Doc Barstow’s head --

           Slim moves to the space under the stairs, amid empty liquor

           Jonah has stopped crawling and Sam hears FOOTSTEPS outside

           and Sam pulls the trigger - BOOM! BOOM!

           SPLINTERED and he flies down to the landing.

           -- and takes aim at Slim who is reloading the Winchester and 
           he PULLS THE TRIGGER AND MISSES, just above Slim’s head.  
           Slim winces.  Scrambles to reload.  Hands moving quickly. 

           Jimmy shoots again...A MISFIRE...A beat.

           BLOOD SEEPS UNDER THE DOOR like an army of encroaching ants

           Dead.  Blood.   

           His heart sinks and his face trembles in a seizure of shock 
           and anger.  He picks up the bloody animal and rushes to the 
           bathroom.

           Slim reloads again. 

           Brady peeks out the bathroom door and there is Bud dead on 
           the landing and Jimmy dead behind the bar and Doc dead on the 
           floor and the old man Richie dead nearby.  

           He looks at Slim, a bit scared of him.  Slim stares back. 

                                 SLIM
                        Stay in there...

           FOOTSTEPS DESCENDING THE STAIRS and Brady steps into the

           Moments later, stoned Francis stumbles by Slim in only his 
           underpants.  He moves to the bar and pours himself a drink.  

           Slim moves out of the space and up the staircase.

           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           CLOSE ON THE RED BATH WATER and the Boxer Dog submerged and 
           Sam is WHIMPERING as he scrubs the animal furiously with soap 
           as though that will help and there is blood all over the 
           tiled floor. 

           Under the door, the SHADOW OF A MOVING FIGURE...Sam turns.  

           INT. SAM’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Slim enters slowly, Winchester leveled.  He moves to Jonah 
           who is sitting up against the bed, shirt blood-drenched, 
           breaths deep and long.   

                                 SLIM
                        Jesus Christ...

           Slim sees the two bullet holes and the blood.  So much blood. 

                                 JONAH
                   (a faint whisper)
                        ...bath...room...

                                 SLIM
                        I’m gonna get you outta here...

                                 JONAH
                   (slightly louder)
                        Bath...room...

           Slim looks up and in the window reflection...Sam Nebraska 
           slowly opens the bathroom door, pistol drawn. 

           SLIM LUNGES FOR THE DOOR and WHAM! Sam’s giant hand is 
           SLAMMED AGAINST THE WALL and his PISTOL FALLS to the ground.  

           There is a struggle, each man pushing and...

           ...their eyes meet for a long moment: THE BLACK-EYED DOG AND 
           THE GLOWING EMBERS...

           Slim cocks his fist back and CRACKS! SAM ACROSS THE FACE.  
           Sam flies back into the bathroom.

                        sonofabitch?!   

           Slim reaches for the pistol but SAM RUSHES THROUGH THE DOOR 
           now and barrels Slim AGAINST THE WALL and CRACK! against his 
           face and CRACK! - CRACK! - CRACK! a furious series of blows. 

           INT. DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Brady on the toilet, trembling.  Too scared to move. 

           INT. SAM’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           CRACK! Slim falls to the ground now, face bloodied and Sam 
           reaches for the boxcutter.  He bends down to Slim’s level and 
           Slim is clutching his stomach and MOANING and Sam looks deep 
           into his eyes when -- 

           BANG! Sam’s shoulder is shot.  He turns, Jonah is holding his 
           Colt Revolver weakly, aiming again, struggling with the 
           hammer --

           SAM RUSHES INTO THE BATHROOM and out the window before Jonah 
           can pull the trigger and Jonah’s hand sinks slowly to the 
           ground. 

                                 SLIM
                        Brady!  BRADY GODDAMNIT GET UP 
                        HERE!

           FOOTSTEPS and moments later Brady enters the room. 

                                 SLIM (cont’d)
                        Stay here with Jonah...

                                 BRADY
                   (scared shitless)

                        aint leavin’ us are ya? 

           Slim struggles to his feet and picks up the Winchester --

                        ...I’m gonna kill that bastard.

COOZ’S - CONTINUOUS  

           Francis in his underpants stands at the jukebox, eyeing the 
           options.

           Slim enters from the stairwell, Winchester aimed, eyes 
           darting.  He steps up to the cash register, SHINK! it opens 
           and he removes $1,000.  No more.  No less.    

           CLOSE ON THE JUKEBOX

           as the mechanical arm LIFTS A RECORD from a row and SIMON & 
           GARFUNKEL’S’ Cecilia  blares through the bar, eerie as hell 
           like a requiem.  

           SLIM   

           is startled by the music and it’s just growing louder and 
           goddamn louder and he whips around and Francis is dancing 
           now, all alone, lost in a drug-induced bliss. 

           INT. SAM’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS  

           Brady sits beside Jonah and the music is heard from 
           downstairs and BLOOD-HUED WATER IS OVERFLOWING AND RUSHING 
           OUT FROM UNDER THE BATHROOM DOOR.  

                                 BRADY
                   (crying)
                        ...fuckin’ drive-in asshole...never 
                        said nuthin’ ‘bout this shit...

           Jonah’s head slumps onto Brady’s shoulder and he sighs like a 
           man come to the end of something.  And then he dies.  

           Brady begins to cry, tries to steel himself and only half 
           succeeds.  He removes Jonah’s head from his shoulder and gets 
           to his feet and takes Jonah’s Revolver. 

           INT. COOZ’S - CONTINUOUS  

           Francis dancing.  Winchester drawn, Slim KICKS OPEN the rear 
           entrance, looks outside.  Nothing.  The percussion of rain 
           and darkness.

           Slim’s trying to focus but his eyes are uneasy with the music 
           and Francis and he’s suddenly acutely aware of his own 
           breathing. 

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           REVOLVER DRAWN, Brady charily walks through the SPLICK-SPLACK 
           of the water at his feet as he approaches the DRIP - DRIP - 
           DRIP of the rain from the ceiling and the soft wooden floor 
           and suddenly WHOOSH! HE FALLS -- 

           INT. COOZ’S - CONTINUOUS

           -- THROUGH THE CEILING, plaster and water following him down. 

           Slim turns, looks up, and --  

           SAM NEBRASKA 

           bursts through the rear entrance with a HORRID YELP! that 
           comes from the black-oil boughs of hell and he tackles Slim 
           to the ground and the WINCHESTER FLIES ACROSS THE BAR FLOOR. 

           There is a great struggle...neither man getting an advantage.  
           And then, finally, the massive Sam Nebraska manages to climb 
           atop Slim and HE REMOVES HIS BOXCUTTER and regards Slim’s 
           beaten face a moment when -- 

           BOOM!  A beat.  

           Only the music is heard.  

           Sam turns back, sees -- 

           BRADY

           standing amid the pile of plaster, Winchester aimed.  

           SAM NEBRASKA

           looks down now as blood permeates his shirt.  He lurches, 
           then falls off Slim, face to the bar floor...eyes open...but 
           fading...

           dances still to the music like a circus act and there is the 
           SOUND OF ENCROACHING SIRENS.

                                 SLIM 
                        We gotta get outta here...

           shine a path down a quiet, rural highway and there is no wind 
           or rain, only the METALLIC GRUMBLE of the old engine. 

           INT. COOZ’S - NIGHT

           - THE O’RILEY HOME and Brady steps from the truck.  FROM AN

           the pick-up.  At Slim.   

           - MORNING AT THE WHEAT FIELD and Slim toils among the harvest 
           workers. 

           - AFTERNOON and Slim at the WEATHERED FARMHOUSE.  He takes 
           the ‘For Sale’ from the soil.  It’s his now.   

           - DUSK BEHIND THE FARMHOUSE and Slim digging with a shovel 
           and now taking the Winchester and burying it.  Deep.  

                                          FADE OUT.

           there, eating candy apples and funnel cakes and pulled pork 
           and fried pickles.

           ON A BENCH 

           Brady wipes Ben’s mouth free of powdered sugar and Slim’s 
           eyes are focused on the dance floor.  The murders linger on 
           their faces, shrink them somehow, and Brady is looking around 
           anxiously as if everyone knows and is watching.     

                                 BRADY
                        I uh...actually slept a bit last 
                        night.  Wasn’t much, but...closed 
                        my eyes at least.  

                                 SLIM
                   (a beat)
                        I think I’ll be goin’...

           Before Slim can leave, Leeny approaches and grabs him, pulls 
           him towards the dancing. 

                                 SLIM (cont’d)
                        Oh no...
                   (she tugs harder)
                        You go, Leeny.  Plenty a boys’d 
                        love to have your hand out there. 

           She pouts. 

                                 BRADY
                        Go on... 

           Slim gives in. 

           EXT. DANCE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

           Bales of hay flank the giant makeshift floor and Slim and 
           Leeny enter now, mid-song, and THE FLOOR IS ALIVE and there’s 
           the swing of the crook of arms and the bobbing of heads.  

           GABBY

           sees Slim among the crowd and her smile fades.
                                   (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)

           being swung around...the passing faces all a blur...except 
           Gabby. 

           GABBY 

           catches Slim gazing and turns away upon the meeting of eyes. 

           The SONG ENDS.

                                 BAND LEADER (O.C.)
                        Oh boy, it’s been a good time with 
                        you folks tonight.  We’re gonna 
                        slow it down a minute here...

           Led by a MOUNTAIN DULCIMER, the band walks into their version 
           of BOB DYLAN’S 4th Time Around.  Slim looks around for Gabby 
           but he’s lost her in the crowd.

           ON THE BENCH 

           Leeny returns, sweating and flush, sits beside Brady and Ben.  

                                 BRADY 
                        You Jonah’s daughter? 

           She doesn’t answer. 

                                 BRADY (cont’d)
                   (nudges her)
                        Hey...
                   (she nudges him back.  
                    Hard)
                        Damn, I didn’t mean nothin’ by it, 
                        jus’...

           She signs at him, vituperatively - a tough girl she is - and 
           he just now realizes she’s deaf. 

                                 BRADY (cont’d)
                        Oh hell, I never...jus’ that I seen 
                        a picture a you b’fore.  Thought 
                        you were awful pretty - I mean it 
                        wasn’t mine or nothin’ an’ I 
                        weren’t lookin’ at it long or 
                        strange-like, I jus’...hell you 
                        can’t hear a damn thing I’m sayin’ 
                        anyway, can ya’?

           Leeny just stares at the people walking by.  

                                 BRADY (cont’d)
                   (deflated)
                        Yeah...  

           SLIM 

           looks for Gabby and he’s just about to give up when...a hand 
           pulls him back...Gabby’s.  She doesn’t speak as she escorts 
           him through the crowd to the dance floor. 

           They begin to dance closely, her head on his shoulder, 
           neither looking at the other.  Years of hurt stand between 
           them. 

           MULBY NOLAN 

           outside the dance floor, alone, not drunk, not sober, and he 
           watches as Slim and Gabby dance. 

           SLIM & GABBY 

           as the song progresses, she holds him tightly, his back and 
           the bones of his shoulders, and remembers him.  There is a 
           look on his face of not wanting to be alone anymore.

           MULBY NOLAN

           can’t bear to watch anymore.  He walks away. 

           THE MUSIC STOPS and CLAPS ensue. 

           Gabby retreats slightly and looks at Slim.  She walks off the 
           dance floor.  He watches her go. 

           EXT. WEATHERED FARMHOUSE - NIGHT   

           The Ford pick-up glides into the gravel driveway. 

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 

           Slim at the kitchen table with a bottle of Sloe Gin beside 
           him and it’s the first time we’ve seen him drink yet.  

           He pours himself another and soon he will feel no memories.

           Slim stumbles into the dark room and he’s drunk something 
           good now and it’s on his face.  Gabby stands by the window, 
           lit by slivers of moonlight around the shade, holding the 
           picture of Slim and her.  

                                 GABBY
                        I’d forgotten this day...

                                 SLIM
                        Gabby -- 

                                 GABBY 
                   (gently)
                        Sshh, Charlie...

           She drops her homemade dress from her shoulders and stands 
           naked now, skin white as porcelain with a shock of gold hair. 

                                 GABBY (cont’d)
                        Sshh...

           She shivers.  He moves towards her. 
                                 (MORE)

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT    

           SILVER-WHITE MOONLIGHT on the bed and Slim and Gabby making 
           love and this is much more than physical: two people capable 
           of loving only the other. 

           EXT. WEATHERED FARMHOUSE - PREDAWN 

           NIGHT LINGERS IN PURPLE and Slim sits up with a blanket over 
           him while Gabby draws invisible shapes on his back. 

                                 GABBY 
                        You killed them, didn’t you?  The 
                        ones who got my Father...
                   (he doesn’t speak)
                        I don’t care.  How bad am I for 
                        saying that, but I don’t.  I just 
                        wanted you to come home.  
                   (kisses his shoulder)
                        Back to me. 
                   (a long beat)
                        He’s not yours, Charlie.  Ben.  
                        He’s not your son...

                        a while I was just so angry and...

           Tears form in her eyes but Slim doesn’t flinch and it’s clear 
           this wasn’t news to him.  

                                 SLIM
                        It aint my right ta be mad, Gabby.  
                        I lost that when I went away. 

                                 GABBY
                        He gave me everything and I 
                        couldn’t love him...  It all was 
                        dead without you...all the places 
                        we’d go - the river and that old 
                        house where you would make love to 
                        me...and that spot with the tall 
                        grass - do you remember it?  Did 
                        you ever think about it?  The sun 
                        never reached it, remember?  They 
                        were all dead when I went without 
                        you...it was like they never made 
                        sense, like the air didn’t reach 
                        them anymore...
                   (a beat) 
                        I used to cry when we made love.  

                                 (MORE)
           A beat.  His stomach heaves and, despite his attempts against 
           it, he begins to cry for all he’s done.  She pulls him down 
           into her arms and holds him.

           INT. BEDROOM - DAWN

           Slim’s awake, looking over at Gabby asleep beside him.  He 
           watches her breathe.    

           EXT. WEATHERED FARMHOUSE - MORNING 

           Slim exits the home with a cup of coffee and the Sheriff’s 
           Cruiser is in the driveway.  Nolan leans against the car and 
           he looks drunk and he hasn’t slept.

                        Cooz’s?  No I don’t -- 

           CRACK!  NOLAN’S FIST AGAINST SLIM’S FACE and Slim drops the 
           coffee and slams back against the home.

           SLIM TACKLES NOLAN DOWN THE STEPS.  They wrestle on the 
           ground.  Finally Nolan CRACKS! Slim across the face.  Hard.  
           Slim winces and rolls around, lip-blooded.  Nolan stands.

                        that he’s got clean clothes, shoes 
                        on his feet -- 

           Slim stands and charges after Nolan again but Nolan easily 
           tosses the weakened Slim down.

           She rushes to Slim’s aid.  Her choice devastates Nolan.

           CLOSE ON A PAIR OF GIANT HANDS in the lap of a hospital gown. 

           Sam Nebraska is carted by a NURSE down a sun-drenched hallway 
           where TWO DETECTIVES wait in the distance. 

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - LATER 

           The Detectives stand by the glass window looking into a 
           makeshift room at Sam Nebraska.  A DOCTOR stands with them. 

                                 DOCTOR

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           all, as docile as an abused mutt.

                        It could be tomorrow, it could be 
                        six months from now.  It could be 
                        never.  It’s not out of the 
                        question.

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT (LATE)  

           A bored COP, thirties, sits outside hospital room 204, sleepy 
           under the soporific evening lights.   

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM 204 - CONTINUOUS  

           THE REFLECTION OF THE STEEL MILL on the window and Sam 
           Nebraska stares outside, seated in a wheelchair.  Behind him, 
           a NURSE, sixties, straightens the bedsheets.  

                                 NURSE
                        Anything you need before I go?  

           Sam doesn’t respond.  His eyes focus on the bed pan.  She 
           drapes a blanket over him.

           CLOSE ON SAM NEBRASKA 

           His eyes.  No longer embers.  Explosions.  The death of 
           stars. 

           And if we didn’t know already, we know in that look he hasn’t 
           forgotten a single thing. 

           The Nurse exits. 

           EXT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT (LATER)  

           The COP lurches, his eyes fading.  He shoots up.  Clears his 
           face.  Looks around. 

           INSIDE THE ROOM, A CRASH...something metal hitting the floor.   

           Cop stands up, feels his pistol. 

                                 COP
                        What’s going on in there?  
                   (a pause)
                        Answer me inside that room...

           Urine leaks out from under the door.

           He finds his set of keys, unlocks the door, draws his pistol 
           and enters.  A pause.  Silence.

           (O.C.) A struggle is heard.  A GASP FOR AIR.  A GURGLE.  Then 
           a body drops...then scissors...then quiet. 

           Moments later, Sam Nebraska steps from the hospital room, 
           strolls down the hall as quiet as mist.   

           Blood seeps out from under the door. 

           EXT. COATESVILLE STREET - MORNING 

           ON A GAUDY PINK NEON SIGN, ‘THE OCEAN SPRAY’ with the white 
           crest of a blue wave towering over the letters.  

           It’s Cooz’s...except it’s not Cooz’s at all.  A renovation 
           has begun with an ‘Opening Soon!’ banner in the window.

           STREET CORNER

           Sam looks up at the sign.  What used to be his home.  

           By the side of the bar, the Oldsmobile Cutlass has a boot on 
           the wheel, signs on the dash declaring - Past Inspection! 

           INT. THE OCEAN SPRAY - MOMENTS LATER

           FAUX PALM TREES IN SANDBOX OASES and innocuous, steel-drum 
           Island music.  A few CARPENTERS labor behind the renovated 
           bar.  DRILLS and SAWS. 

           Sam walks across the floor. 

           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           CLOSE ON SAM, eyes sunk and there is a quiver in his lip as 
           he stares at THE BLACK & WHITE PHOTO of Richie Nebraska and 
           himself. 

           A FOREMAN peers into the room. 

                                 FOREMAN 
                        You’re here for the plumbing? 

           Sam’s eyes never leave the photo and the Foreman takes that

                        Upstairs is gonna be a fuckin’ 
                        effort, huh?  

           The Foreman looks down at the BLOOD-RIMMED BASIN OF THE 
           BATHTUB and he shakes his head and leaves and Sam’s eyes 
           haven’t moved a fucking inch.  

           INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER  

           THE CLOSET DOOR OPENING and Sam pulling out the Charcoal suit 
           and the Fedora from the shelf above. 

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT  

           Sam stands in front of the mirror shirtless, feeling the pink-
           white raised, stitched skin of the Winchester blast scar - 
           large and amorphous and -- 

           FLASHBACK SEQUENCE - FROM SAM’S POV 

           Glimpses of moments from that night at Cooz’s.  

           - RICHIE NEBRASKA leaving the bathroom. 

           - JONAH bloodied, crawling on the floor. 

           And there are words coming and going throughout, pieces of 
           things heard - ‘Brady...Brady get up here!’ ‘fuckin’ drive-in 
           asshole’ ‘You the man who killed my brother you sonofabitch?’ 
           ‘BOOM!’ ‘Birds without wings.’ 

           - THE BLOOD OF THE BOXER DOG seeping under the door like a 
           legion of approaching ants. 

           - SLIM’S FACE, when their eyes met.  The black-eyed dog and 
           the glowing embers. 

           - THE BOXCUTTER approaching Slim’s face. 

           - RICHIE’S FACE, dead against the floor. Blood-coated. 

           - BRADY with the Winchester and BOOM! it explodes in A FLASH

           Sam Nebraska shaves, dressed in the charcoal suit.  He 
           finishes now, wipes the blood from his neck and puts on the 
           Fedora.  

           INT. THE OCEAN SPRAY - CONTINUOUS   

           VIEW FROM THE FLOOR as the curiously tall man walks out of

           INT. SPENARD GUN DEALERS - EVENING 

           ON A REVOLVER being shown to Sam by the DEALER.  But Sam’s 
           eyes don’t even view the pistol...they’re focused on the wall 
           where a side-by-side double barrel shotgun is mounted.  

           INT./EXT. TAXI - NIGHT 

           Driving.  Under the vastness of a black sky.  In the 
           backseat...Sam Nebraska. 

           EXT. HARDINGS HOME - PREDAWN 

           A duplex. Sam Nebraska steps from the taxi, the double barrel 
           shotgun at his side.  

           In the driveway, he sees an old CADILLAC BROUGHAM. 

           INT. HARDINGS HOME - BEDROOM - PREDAWN 

           A BOY SLEEPS SOUNDLY in a room filled with posters of Toucans 
           and there are ant farms and pet caterpillars, too. 

           This is MAGWYNN HARDINGS, seventeen.  The boy who shit 
           himself.  

           VIEW ON THE WINDOW 

           as the Fedora slides by, throwing its unearthly shadow on the 
           wall beside Magwynn’s bed, stirring him momentarily.

           Another DOORBELL. 

           CC trudges to the door.  Outside, shrouded in darkness, is 
           Sam and we can’t make out a single feature except his eyes 
           and the glint of the shotgun.

           Elliot appears in the home now.  Squints to see who’s there.

           EXT. WEATHERED FARMHOUSE - AFTERNOON 

           LEENY’S THREE-LEGGED RABBIT runs about and Ben gives chase, 
           baseball glove in hand.  Running circles.  

           NEARBY IN THE FIELD  

           Slim and Brady till the land, sweating and sun-red, preparing 
           it for planting. 

                                 BRADY
                        Gotta be careful a smut.

                        You hear somethin’? 

                                 BRADY
                        Saw Cud Banks at the hardware 
                        center.  Told how he had it last 
                        year.  Came out one day, whole 
                        field smelt a fish.  Had ta burn it 
                        all.    

           Slim pauses, regards the field.  The task ahead awakens a 
           near-smile on his face.

           LEENY EXITS THE SCREEN DOOR with purpose and stands now with 
           impatient eyes at the boys.  She STOMPS HER FOOT: lunch is 
           up.  Slim turns.

           Brady exits the field, heads in for lunch. 

           Slim turns, watches Ben toss a baseball to himself, making 
           basket-catches.

           She straightens up quickly, tosses A TISSUE-WRAPPED PREGNANCY 
           TEST into the waste bin.  She looks herself over, making sure 
           her smile isn’t telling.  

           Brady appears in the doorway.

           Slim and Ben and Slim’s showing the boy the right way to 
           catch.  She watches a moment, then leaves the vanity.

                        Said he didn’t remember nothin’... 
                        wondered if you still had an 
                        interest in questionin’ him. 

           EXT. HIGHWAY - EVENING (DUSK) 

           CC’s CADILLAC BROUGHAM rolls down the highway.

           INT. CADILLAC BROUGHAM - CONTINUOUS

           CC driving, Sam Nebraska beside him.  In the backseat, Elliot 
           and Magwynn, the kid, looking wholly out-of-place and 
           skittish. 

                                 CC HARDINGS
                        He’s not a smart kid, Sam.  He 
                        needs to find a trade...  Kids at 
                        school tease him something awful.   

                                 ELLIOT HARDINGS
                        Oh would you quit it? 

                                 CC HARDINGS
                        What?

                                 ELLIOT HARDINGS
                        Quit bothering the boy. 

                                 CC HARDINGS
                        I aint bothering him.  
                   (Elliot shakes his head)
                        I’m just sayin’, he’s not going to 
                        college so he better take up 
                        something soon.  There’d be no 
                        point in college for him.

WEATHERED FARMHOUSE - PORCH - NIGHT               

           A DRIZZLE OF RAIN NOW and Brady ensconced in a wicker chair, 
           thick bubble of tobacco in his cheek.  Slim exits the home 
           with a mug of coffee. 

                                 BRADY
                        Comin’ ta the end of the long days 
                        an’ short nights.  Figure we plant 
                        now an’ we’ll see beards come 
                        Spring.  Five feet high, I’d say.  

                                 SLIM
                        Be nice if we saw ‘em by Spring. 

                                 BRADY
                        Have us a King Harvest, huh? 
                   (a beat)
                        Say, Slim...  What happened that 
                        night...down in Rittsfield?

           Slim looks out into the cavernous night and it’s a question 
           he don’t wanna answer. 

                                 SLIM
                        ...I don’t remember much.  Left 
                        home ‘round ten.  Wim Redbrook come 
                        by an’ pick me up like he always 
                        did...says we’d go ta some bar down 
                        in Rittsfield jus’ open up.  I’d 
                        been drinkin’ a while an’ when I 
                        walk outta the house I hear this 
                        mewling in the air, like a damn 
                        injured cat.  I turn an’ there’s 
                        Pop sittin’ under the barn light.  
                        Liquor-hazy.  There weren’t nothin’ 
                        special in that ‘cept now he’s 
                        talkin’ an’ Pop don’t talk...  
                        Can’t make out much, so I step 
                        closer to ‘im an’ I can hear ‘im 
                        now an’ he’s sayin’ the same thing.  
                        Over an’ over...‘I shoulda yelped.  
                        I shoulda yelped ‘til it burned an’ 
                        burned.’  Man laid concrete his 
                        whole life, never said a word about 
                        it.  I got in Wim Redbrook’s car 
                        an’ that was the last I ever saw a 
                        him.  Died while I was inside.

           Slim turns back to Brady.

                        That’s what I remember ‘bout that 
                        night.  Nothin’ at the bar, nothin’ 
                        ‘bout when that man come at me with 
                        a knife an’ nothin’ bout when they 
                        found me under a Shag tree with his 
                        blood on me...   

           A beat. 

           The HEADLIGHT OF THE SHERIFF’S CRUISER shine on the gravel 
           driveway.  Nolan exits and approaches through the rain. 

                                 SLIM (cont’d)
                        What the hell you want?  I thought 
                        I told -- 

                                 SHERIFF NOLAN
                        I aint here for you.  I came here 
                        for her sake.  Got a message from 
                        Pennsylvania.  Sayin’ one survived 
                        from that bar...

           Brady looks at Slim. 

                                 SLIM
                        Who was it?

                        Goddamnit, Mulby, which one!? 

                                 SHERIFF NOLAN
                        Said his name was Sam Nebraska... 

           And the faces of Brady and Slim go cold and numb.

                                 SHERIFF NOLAN (cont’d)
                        Said he come outta a coma not 
                        rememberin’ a thing an’ if I --  

                                 SLIM
                        Where is he now? 

                                 SHERIFF NOLAN
                        In the hospital...  I’m headed up 
                        that way come mornin’.    

           A beat.  Nolan puts his cap back on, walks through the rain 
           back to his Cruiser. 

           Slim looks into the bedroom and the yellow glow of the 
           bathroom where Gabby and Leeny bathe Ben.  Gabby takes the 
           boy into her arms and wraps a towel around him.

           blurry windshield.

           POURING RAIN outside and Terry is taking down the film reels.    

           INT. OLDSMOBILE CUTLASS - CONTINUOUS   

           Elliot lights a cigarette, exhales.  CC looks over at Sam and 
           we reveal Sam is looking out the windshield at the projection 
           room.  

                                 SAM NEBRASKA

                        Magwynn, see if I couldn’t show -- 

           Sam Nebraska steps out of the car and the sound of rain 
           intrudes momentarily before the door closes on CC talking. 

           INT. TICKET BOOTH - NIGHT 

           Lee shuts the ticket window and turns out the light.

           RAIN HITS THE WOODEN ROOF HARD as Terry puts the film back 
           into the reel tins.  

           A NOISE.  He turns to the doorway.  Sees the silhouette of 
           Sam Nebraska.  

           EXT. TICKET BOOTH - CONTINUOUS 

           Waiting for the rain to still, Lee rocks the baby and HUMS A 
           LULLABY.  

           She looks over at the projection room.  Notices Terry’s 
           shadow is joined BY A CURIOUSLY LARGE SHADOW.

WEATHERED FARMHOUSE - LATER 

           RAIN FALLING IN SHEETS NOW and Slim and Brady stand outside 
           the running Buick in the driveway. 

                                 SLIM
                        -- I got an Aunt Suzanne I aint 
                        seen in too long.  We’ll head up 
                        that way tomorra. 

                                 BRADY
                        You don’t think he’d come for us, 
                        do ya’ Slim?  

           H-O-N-K! The car horn startles Brady.

                        Goddamnit!...fuckin’ hell...

           INSIDE THE CAR -- Gabby chuckles and Leeny sits with Ben in 
           her arms and he’s cradling the three-legged rabbit.  

                                 BRADY (cont’d)
                        What’ll I tell Gabby? 

                                 SLIM
                        Tell her nothin’.  Don’t let her 
                        veer from your sight an’ don’t let 
                        her leave ta come here.  Keep a 
                        pistol ‘round in a drawer in case.  
                        Come mornin’, I’ll pick up some 
                        food in town an’ then get Leeny.  
                        Be ready.  

           Brady nods, climbs into the car.  

           Slim watches the car reverse.  We move in on his eyes...

           ...as they DISSOLVE INTO...

           ...the GLOWING EYES OF SAM NEBRASKA.  He’s walking.  Out of 
           the projection room.   

           VIEW FROM THE DOORWAY

           THE RAIN and Sam Nebraska strolls across the grounds toward 
           the Cadillac.  The moon flaunts its silver reflection across 
           the land, a sinuous bridge of light.

           PAN INTO THE PROJECTION ROOM: to Terry Adams.  Head dropped 
           to his shoulder.  It’s grisly.  Face’s been beaten so bad we 
           hardly recognize him.  

           INT. NOLAN HOME - BATHROOM - NIGHT 

           Nolan, the defeated man, bathes his Mother.  

                                 MRS. NOLAN 
                        I’m tired, Mulby...my knees hurt...

           INT./EXT. FORD PICK-UP - NIGHT  

           Slim in the car, Gunther beside him.  He glances outside his 
           window to the O’Riley home.  

           He takes a pull from the bottle of Sloe Gin now.  Keeping 
           watch.  Revolver in his lap.  Suitcase in the backseat. 

                                        DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. O’RILEY HOME - FRONT LAWN - MORNING 

           THE SWAYING SHADOWS OF SHAGBARK TREES and it’s windy but no 
           rain. 

           INT. FORD PICK-UP - CONTINUOUS

           THE WIND WHISTLES against the car windows.  Slim stirs, opens 
           his eyes.  Morning.  He gathers himself, starts the truck. 

           INT. O’RILEY HOME - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS  

           THROUGH THE WINDOW Brady watches the pick-up drive away.  He 
           turns to the clock - 8:00 am - sips his coffee.  

           INT. CADILLAC BROUGHAM - MORNING      

           CLOSE ON MAGWYNN’S HAND AS A CATERPILLAR explores his fingers 
           and Magwynn watches with child wonder. 

                                 ELLIOT HARDINGS
                        -- never figure we’d see him again.

                   (turns back to Magwynn, 
                    sees the caterpillar)
                        Oh Jesus Christ...  Get that off!  
                        Fuckin’ dumb-dumb!  

           CC knocks the caterpillar out of his Magwynn’s hand.  Magwynn 
           WHINES and kicks the back of his Father’s seat.  Loud. 

           Sam Nebraska turns back, grabs the boy’s hand, jerks him 
           forward.  He removes his boxcutter, SLICES THE PALM. 

           Magwynn SCREAMS IN PAIN! 

           CC looks at Sam as if to intervene but thinks better of it.  

           Sam’s eyes are fire. 

           EXT. MAIN STREET - EASTON - MORNING 

           And it’s not much of a Main street, but it’s the primary 
           artery of town. 

           Slim exits the market, tosses the last bag of groceries into 
           the bed of the truck.  He climbs in and when the truck is out 
           of view --   

           The Cadillac Brougham glides onto the street. 

           INT. EMPORIUM - MOMENTS LATER

           A PHARMACIST stands behind the counter preparing a 
           prescription and DING! THE ENTRANCE BELL and soon a shadow 
           kills some of the light around him.

                        Well that’s awful bold now aint -- 

           Pharmacist looks up.  His face sobers as he takes in Sam 
           Nebraska’s face and he can’t get out a word. 

                                 SAM NEBRASKA
                        ...Which place?

                        ask, Mister? 

           But Sam is gone. 

           EXT. O’RILEY HOME - EARLY AFTERNOON   

           RED SHUDDERS BANGING AGAINST THE HOME and it’s windy as hell 
           and the trees CREAK like masts. 

           ON THE ROOF 

           A WEATHERVANE OF A WINGED PIG oscillates wildly.  

           RABBIT CAGE - BACKYARD 

           THE THREE-LEGGED RABBIT is uneasy, its eyes darting out to 
           the expanse that stretches to a patch of woods. 

           RABBIT’S POV 

           a Fox waits in the expanse. 

           FRONT PORCH

           Brady stands atop a chair, hanging a birdfeeder.  He steps 
           down now, eyes its placement.  Content, he goes inside.

           Brady enters, struggling against the wind to close the door.

                                 BRADY
                        Goddamn...  Got that birdfeeder up.  
                        Gabby?  

           He walks into the -- 

           KITCHEN 

           Beyond the sliding glass doors, Gabby’s in the backyard where 
           the wind fills the bedsheets hung on clotheslines like sails. 

           On the kitchen table...A CARD.  Brady picks it up. 

           It reads, To Charlie: Congratulations, Dad...Love always and 
           always, Gabby...

           He regards his sister outside.  UPSTAIRS, FOOTSTEPS.  Brady 
           looks up. 

           EXT. SHANTY - MORNING 

           Leeny sits inside the Ford.  Outside, Slim’s packing her 
           suitcase into the bed of the truck. 

           He climbs inside.  Starts the car. 

           INT. O’RILEY HOME - BEDROOM - MORNING

           Brady helps Ben pack a suitcase.

           (O.S.) A CAR GRUMBLES OVER GRAVEL.  

           Brady moves to the window.  Looks.  OUTSIDE, the Cadillac 
           Brougham rolls into the gravel driveway. 

           Brady’s insides freeze.  He grabs Ben, opens the closet door. 

                                 BRADY (cont’d)
                        Get in there an’ don’t make a

                        back...  OK?  OK!? 

           Ben’s shaken by Brady’s sudden turn of emotion.

                          Keep quiet... 

           Brady shuts the closet doors, rushes out. 

           EXT. CADILLAC BROUGHAM - CONTINUOUS

           IN THE DRIVEWAY.  Sam steps out, looks around.  No neighbors.  
           He approaches the front door with the shotgun.  Elliot 
           follows. 

           CC reaches back inside, tries to drag Magwynn out.  The boy 
           resists, kicking his Father. 

                                 CC HARDINGS 
                        Hey!  You goddamn sonofabitch!  Get 
                        outta that car! 

           Magywnn resists.  CC shakes his head, approaches the home. 

           GABBY

           in the backyard (an expanse of grassland) and the wind is 
           crazy as she holds the three-legged rabbit in her arms and 
           bites down on a peach. 

                                 GABBY
                   (to the rabbit)

O’RILEY HOME - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Brady rips open a drawer, digs through and removes a 
           revolver.  His hands are shaking as he loads the gun and 
           bullets are hitting the floor and he’s looking outside at 
           Gabby taking the bedsheets down.   

                                 BRADY
                        Gabby!  GABBY! 

           But she can’t hear a word over the wind.  The gun is loaded 
           now.  Brady looks out the window, sees the top of Elliot’s 
           head.  He shoots - BANG! THE WINDOW SHATTERS.  Elliot ducks. 

                                 BRADY (cont’d)
                        GABBY!!  

           Brady RUNS TOWARDS THE BACK PORCH DOOR AND BA-WOOM! BA-
           WOOM!...he falls to the floor. 

           SAM NEBRASKA 

           shotgun drawn, steps towards Brady like the glide of water 
           over ice.  He looks down at the boy crawling towards his 
           sister...the wake of blood he’s leaving behind.

                                 BRADY

           Sam follows the direction of Brady’s eyes...to Gabby outside. 

           EXT. WEATHERED FARMHOUSE - BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           GABBY’S BARLEY-COLORED HAIR strands blow across her face and 
           there is only the sound of WILD WIND WHISTLING and it’s loud 
           as hell and you can’t hear a thing besides it. 

           CC steps around one corner of the home.  Elliot the other.  

           Gabby pauses, takes them in.  Their guns.  Her eyes narrow.

           THE SLIDING GLASS DOORS OPEN and Sam Nebraska steps out 
           slowly and drops his shotgun...removes the Boxcutter. 

           Gabby drops the peach.  

           She is alone with all that can happen. 

           CLOSE ON THE FOX

           watching everything.  Emotionless.  Eyes like pools of tar.

           Slim approaches the kitchen.  Brady’s body lies just inside 
           the sliding glass doors.  Slim rushes up to him...he’s barely 
           breathing.  Blood.

           Slim rolls him over.  His belly bleeds.  His breaths are low 
           and fading and his eyes are closing.

           Brady can’t speak.  He just stares.  But he’s alive.

           Leeny leans down and pushes Slim aside like a Mother and 
           she’s got a blanket for Brady.  

           Slim stands and looks around frantically when...his eyes find 
           the backyard.  He freezes.  

           BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           Slim exits the home like a zombie.  Gabby lies dead in the 
           grass, blood soaking her hair.  Eyes closed.    

           On the facade of the home, written with her blood -- ‘Birds 
           without wings.’

           Slim falls to his knees beside her body.  Broken.

           there are explosions in his chest.

           MOONLESS AND EVEN WINDIER THAN BEFORE.  Slim bursts out of 
           the house, Winchester leveled, ready to shoot.  He pauses... 

           Nolan stands at the bottom of the steps in uniform, Sheriff’s 
           Cruiser in the driveway.  His eyes take in the Winchester and 
           Slim doesn’t hide it.

           Nolan COUGHS and COUGHS and takes a flask from his pocket and 
           sips.  Finally, he draws his pistol, steels himself.

           A very long beat.  

           The two men stand on either side of the door.  Quiet.  Old 
           friends and the basest enemies...thinking of her.

                        ...Why didn’t you run?

           (O.S.) DIRT CRUMBLING UNDER TIRES.  Slim looks outside.  The 
           Cadillac pulls into the driveway. 

           INT. CADILLAC BROUGHAM - CONTINUOUS

           DARKNESS CLOAKS SAM NEBRASKA.  CC and Elliot are silent, 
           afraid to look at Sam.  Magwynn is whimpering, holding his 
           cut hand.

           EXT. WEATHERED FARMHOUSE - PORCH - CONTINUOUS

           THE DOOR SHOOTS OPEN and it’s Slim with the Winchester 
           leveled at his shoulder and BA-WOOM! BA-WOOM! and -- 

           Nolan is right behind him, FIRING HIS PISTOL - BANG! BANG! 
           BANG!   

           They rush back inside to reload.

           THE WINDSHIELD IS COBWEBBED and all are ducking except Sam 
           Nebraska who hasn’t moved.  

           CC is WHEEZING FOR AIR and there’s a hole in his stomach and 
           Magwynn is SOBBING loudly. 

           INT. WEATHERED FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Slim and Nolan reloads and peer out the door windows.

           Sam Nebraska exits with his shotgun.  CC falls out of the 
           car, stomach a bloody mess.

           Elliot climbs out now, sees his brother. 

                                 ELLIOT HARDINGS 
                        CC?

                        Christ, CC... 

           Elliot stands and takes his pistol from his waist and follows 
           Sam towards the home.

           INT. WEATHERED FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Slim by the door and Nolan nearby and Slim nods and Nolan 
           moves to the rear of the house. 

           EXT. BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           SAM NEBRASKA approaches the sliding glass doors and, looking 
           inside, Nolan is by the back door, gun drawn.  A BARK!  Sam 
           turns to see --  

           Gunther in the backyard.  BARKING at him.  

           SLIM   

           leaves the front door and moves towards the kitchen and BANG! 
           BANG! TWO SHOTS SHATTER THE WINDOW BESIDE THE FRONT DOOR. 

           Slim falls to the ground.  Hit.  Elliot KICKS OPEN THE DOOR. 
           Slim’s struggling with the Winchester.  Elliot takes aim -- 

                                 ELLIOT HARDINGS
                        You motherfucker -- 

           - BOOM! BOOM! ELLIOT FLIES OUTSIDE ONTO THE PORCH, crumples 
           to the ground. 

           Slim looks up. 

           NOLAN STANDS IN THE HALLWAY, pistol in hand.

                        He hit me...

           Nolan bends down to Slim who is bleeding from his side.  He 
           looks around, checking for Sam as he drags Slim into the -- 

           LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS   

           and into the dark corner.  Nolan sits beside him.  Reloads.  
           Silence.  We hear their breathing.  Then -- 

           VIEW ON THE SLIDING GLASS DOORS 

           -- SMASH! GUNTHER’S BODY FLIES THROUGH THE GLASS and lands 
           THUD! in a messy and bloody pile on the tiled kitchen floor. 

           From the darkness, Sam Nebraska steps into the home. 

           LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Nolan breathes heavily beside Slim, trying to muffle his own 
           coughing.

                   (quietly)
                        Slim?  Slim you alive...? 

           Slim’s head slumps and his eyes are wearied and fading and 
           blood paints his hand covering the bullet hole in his side. 

                                 SHERIFF NOLAN (cont’d)

           We HEAR FOOTSTEPS NEARBY.  Nolan quiets his breathing.  Slim 
           lifts his head slightly.  

           SLIM’S POV

           looking out a window to the land flanking the home.  And 
           suddenly the darkness is light-flooded land.  Gold and warm 
           with tall wheat. 

           And, and now Cormac is there, walking the field.  And there, 
           there’s Jonah, the old man, and he’s talking to his Godson.

           They are talking, something of great interest but little 
           importance. 

           Darkness falls once again. 

           SLIM  

           stares blankly outside the window.  Nolan nudges Slim.

           More FOOTSTEPS and Nolan looks up to see Sam Nebraska 
           approaching the front door, SHOTGUN DRAWN.  He walks past the 
           body of Elliot and climbs the wooden steps slowly, 
           methodically.  THUD...THUD...THUD...THUD.  

           When he’s gone from sight --

                        now.  

           Nolan tries to lift Slim up but his body is limp.

           Slim’s head lifts slowly and his fading eyes move to the 
           kitchen where he sees Gunther...dead among the broken glass.

           Slim labors to his knees, moves towards the dead dog.

           Nolan is exiting when BA-WOOM BA-WOOM! Nolan drops.  Sam 
           descends the staircase.  THUD...THUD...THUD...THUD.  

           By the landing, Nolan is panting and bleeding from his chest 
           and he’s crawling towards outside desperately, coughing 
           blood. 

           Sam raises his shotgun...BOOM! BOOM!  Two shots to Nolan’s 
           head.  

           There’s a trail of blood leading out to the porch. 

           EXT. PORCH - CONTINUOUS

           Sam steps onto the porch, reloads, and the WIND FLAPS HIS 
           SUIT JACKET WILDLY.  He follows the blood trail down the 
           steps and into the DARKNESS OF THE FRONT YARD. 

           Two eyes glisten in the night before him.  He REMOVES HIS 
           BOXCUTTER and --   

           From the sky, MAYFLIES FALL IN DROVES.  Thousands of them hit 
           the earth without a sound.  And Sam just lets them hit him.  

           Soon they’ve all fallen.  Only the wind is heard.  

           Sam moves towards the eyes...getting closer...something

           BA-WOOM! SLIM ON THE BOTTOM OF THE PORCH STEPS, one weak hand 
           holding the Winchester. 

           Sam drops to the earth.  Blood soaking his charcoal suit. 

           Slim struggles to his feet, stumbles weakly towards him.

           looks at Magwynn holding his Father.  And he tries to walk

           blood permeating his shirt and there is nothing left of

                        It’s hot... 

                                 SLIM
                        You wanna go inside? 
                   (Slim looks up.  Ben nods)
                        Come here...

           Ben walks towards Slim and Slim, the man with the black-eyed 
           dog inside him, takes the boy into his arms and we watch as 
           they approach the weathered farmhouse, painted and 
           refurbished.  

           Brady sits on the porch swing beside Leeny, her head resting 
           on his shoulder.  

                                 BRADY
                        Goin’ in already? 

                                 SLIM
                        He’s tired...

           Slim walks inside the home. 

           And soon, very soon, it will be time to harvest.  But not 
           yet. 

           FADE OUT:
