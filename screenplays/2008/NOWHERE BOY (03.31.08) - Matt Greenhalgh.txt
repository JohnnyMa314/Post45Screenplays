                                   NOWHERE BOY

           Hear the feint rumble of aircraft engines.

           Fade In:

           EXT. ROYAL LIVER BUILDING/LIVERPOOL -- EVENING

           THE LANDMARK THAT IS LIVERPOOL

           And we're on top of it.  The LYVERBIRD STATUES - full frame. 
           Imposing.  The port-city below on the cusp of darkness.

           Waiting for something.

           Drift down to the biggest clock-face in Britain (fact). 

           TITLE CARD: OCTOBER 9TH, 1940, LIVERPOOL

           The clock strikes 6.

           TITLE CARD: 6PM 

           Air raid sirens start to wail.

           INT. OXFORD STREET MATERNITY HOSPITAL -- NIGHT

           A SCREAMING WOMAN,

           25, red-hair, about to give birth being rushed through a
           corridor in a wheel-chair by a worried looking NURSE.  The
           pain unbearable.

           EXT. STREET/VICTORIAN HOUSES -- NIGHT

           BOOM!  

           The first bomb explodes. 

           ANTI-AIRCRAFT FIRE

           Litters the sky.  Spotlights swirl.  PEOPLE rush to the
           air raid shelters.  MOTHERS hurry CHILDREN up with desperate
           pleas.

           A TALL, STRIKING WOMAN

           41, steps out from a house, wraps a head-scarf around her
           no-nonsense face - sets off down the middle of the street.

           INT. OXFORD STREET MATERNITY HOSPITAL/CELLAR ROOM -- NIGHT

           The SCREAMING WOMAN gets lifted onto a threadbare bed.  A
           DOCTOR, hasn't slept for days, throws her skirt over her
           hips, prizes the thighs open.

                                 NURSE
                        She's overdue, nearly three weeks.

           The DOCTOR whips his stethoscope onto her belly.
                                 DOCTOR
                        It's breached - prepare for a
                        Caesarean.  Five mills of pethedrine
                        straight away..

                                 NURSE
                        Pethedrine ran out last night.

                                 DOCTOR
                        What have we got?

           The NURSE shakes her head.

           The DOCTOR looks into the SCREAMING WOMAN'S.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                        So, yes, sorry.... you may have
                        guessed, but this will hurt.

           She SCREAMS louder.

           EXT. PROTESTANT CATHEDRAL -- NIGHT

           Under the shadow of the gothic CATHEDRAL, STRAGGLERS rush
           into an UNDERGROUND SHELTER.

           A HOME GUARDSMAN

           Marshals the door. 

           The STRIKING WOMAN sprints from around a corner.

                                 HOME GUARDSMAN
                        Chop chop luv!  Doors are shuttin'.

           She rushes straight past him.

                                 HOME GUARDSMAN (CONT'D)
                           (confused)
                        This way y'stupid cow!

           INT. OXFORD STREET MATERNITY HOSPITAL/CELLAR ROOM -- NIGHT

           The DOCTOR's SCALPEL digs lightly into the pale, white,
           skin of the SCREAMING WOMAN.  Blood is drawn.

                                 NURSE (O.S.)
                        I can see a head!

                                 DOCTOR
                        What!!

           The DOCTOR swings a look at the NURSE crouched at the
           business end, rushes to check. 

                                 DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                        Jesus Christ!

           Sleep deprivation playing tricks with his mind.

           ANOTHER BOMB
           Rocks the building.  Plaster sprinkles the room like flour. 
           A burning candle falls setting a discarded sheet on fire,
           a NURSE douses the flames with a basin of water. 

           The DOCTOR and NURSES cover their mouths like it's normal -
           carry on delivering.

           EXT. OXFORD STREET MATERNITY HOSPITAL -- NIGHT

           The STRIKING WOMAN finally reaches the HOSPITAL ENTRANCE -
           her face, head-scarf and clothes covered in destructive
           white dust.  Jumps up the steps, disappears down the
           corridor.

           INT. OXFORD STREET MATERNITY HOSPITAL/CELLAR ROOM --
           MOMENTS LATER

           The STRIKING WOMAN flies through the door - to be confronted
           by an EMPTY BED and BLOODIED SHEETS.

           For a moment - panic.

                                 MIMI
                        JULIA!

                                 JULIA (O.S.)
                        Under here.

           See two bare feet sticking out from underneath the bed. 
           The STRIKING WOMAN dives under. 

           A SWADDLED BABY

           Suckling from his EXHAUSTED MOTHER's breast.  We immediately
           see the resemblance of the women - SISTERS.

           MIMI

           The elder, has rushed to

           JULIA's

           Bedside - who we now see is mid 20's and sexy - even post
           child-birth.

           MIMI's eyes stay fixed on the BABY.  JULIA - wasted, but
           high on life.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                        It's a boy, Mimi.  You were right.

                                 MIMI
                           (controlled joy)
                        I'm always right.

           Without asking MIMI takes the BABY from JULIA arms and
           breast.

                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        Is he healthy?
                                 JULIA
                        More than me.

                                 MIMI
                        Most babies look old and wrinkly. 
                        He's beautiful.
                           (excited)
                        'John'.  He's a 'John' isn't he? 
                        He looks like a 'John'.

                                 JULIA
                        What about 'Winston'?

           MIMI lets out a derisory laugh - then realises JULIA's
           serious.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                        Churchill needs all the help he
                        can get.

                                 MIMI
                        How about 'John Winston'?

                                 JULIA
                           (smiles)
                        That works.

                                 MIMI
                        Works for us all.
                           (c/up Baby)
                        Doesn't it? 
                           (pause)
                        Hello, 'John, Winston, Lennon'. 
                        You're a naughty boy, keeping me
                        waiting such a long time to meet
                        you.

           MIMI can't keep her eyes off BABY JOHN.

                                 JULIA
                        Mimi?
                           (pause)
                        Can I have him back now?

           But MIMI doesn't hear her.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                        Mimi?

           MIMI looks up.  JULIA carefully takes JOHN back to her
           breast.  MIMI watches - a weird feeling in her stomach.

           And as another bomb crashes in we cut to:

           BLACK

           FADE IN:

           EXT. MENDIPS -- MORNING

           A pleasant early Sunday morning.
           INT. MENDIPS/JOHN'S BEDROOM -- DAY

           A 15 YR OLD JOHN LENNON sleeps in the small, box bedroom
           at the front of the house. 

           His book shelf full of classic titles - 'Alice in
           Wonderland' and 'Huckleberry Finn' alongside whole volumes
           of 'Just William'.  Thick NHS SPECS on the side-board.

                                 MIMI (V.O.)
                        John!  Breakfast!

           INT. MENDIPS/MORNING ROOM/KITCHEN -- DAY

           JOHN, eating a hearty Sunday breakfast.  MIMI offloads
           another sausage, tops up his tea.  Mothering him.

           MIMI eyes JOHN as he eats, like she's studying his appetite.

                                 MIMI
                        Miriam Armitage says her son's off
                        to Edinburgh - to become a
                        veterinarian.

                                 JOHN
                        Is that it?  Go to Edinburgh? 
                        Easy.

                                 MIMI
                        Y'know what I mean.  University.

           JOHN looks up, reveal

           UNCLE GEORGE

           60, friendly looking (in his work clothes from the dairy
           farm), outside the window.  He pulls faces at the back of
           MIMI's head, spastic faces.

           JOHN giggles.

                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        What's funny?

           JOHN recovers, shrugs.

                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        I think a career in medicine would
                        suit you...

           UNCLE GEORGE

           Doing the joke where your own hand creeps up, starts
           strangling yourself.

                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        Imperative you get decent
                        qualifications at Quarry Bank.

           JOHN can't stop another giggle.  MIMI swings round, catches
           UNCLE GEORGE in the middle of the act.
           UNCLE GEORGE slowly releases himself - pretending he's got
           a sore neck.  Trapes off meekly to the backdoor.

                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        Why is it I've not so much as
                        grinned at that man in thirty years?

           UNCLE GEORGE comes in with SALLY, the mongrel PET-DOG. 
           MIMI expertly ducks his kiss - heads into the kitchen. 
           UNCLE GEORGE reaches into his pocket, gets out a

           HARMONICA

           Gives it a quick blast.

                                 JOHN
                           (excited)
                        A 'Gob Iron'!

           Lays it on the table in front of JOHN.

                                 GEORGE
                        One of the lads from the farm sold
                        it me cheap.

           JOHN scoops it up - blowing out random notes.

           EXT. ST. PETERS CHURCH -- DAY

           A huge, red-sandstone church.

           THE CONGREGATION flock for 11AM SERVICE.  MIMI and UNCLE
           GEORGE hold JOHN's hands (wearing his Specs).

           THIS FAMILY UNIT LOOKING NO DIFFERENT TO OTHERS.

           As they head in, see a SNOWY BLONDE KID - PETE SHOTTON,
           with his parents.

           JOHN and PETE exchange evils.

           INT. ST. PETERS CHURCH -- DAY

           THE REVEREND PRYCE-JONES - tall, wiry, shiny red nose -
           delivers his monotone eulogy.  JOHN sat bored, on the
           adjacent choir benches - his eyes wander.

           A PRETTY GIRL

           14, blonde bunches, sits near the front staring right back,
           intense smile - MARTHA BOWDEN.  JOHN, smiles back.  She
           blows a kiss.  JOHN returns it

           Find PETE sat behind - seething at this betrayal.  Martha
           the beef between them.  JOHN turns, gives him victorious
           wink.

           JOHN gets a pencil from behind his ear - opens his hymn
           book..
           INT. JOHN'S HEAD (ANIMATION) -- CONTINUOUS

           THE REVEREND, full pirates costume, eye-patch, parrot on
           his shoulder, at the pulpit.

                                 REVEREND
                        BLAH. 
                        Blahblablahblahblahblahblahblahbl
                        ahblahblahblahblahblahblahblah. 
                        GOD IS A CONCEPT!

                                 PARROT
                        God is a concept!

           THE CHOIRBOYS turn, lift their frocks up to expose their
           bare bottoms, out of which comes the word - "AMEN".

           (These sequences to be done in the style of John's actual
           drawings).

           INT. ST. PETERS CHURCH -- CONTINUOUS

           JOHN secretly sketching the above in the hymn book.

           INT. CHOIRBOYS CHANGING ROOM -- LATER

           Nearly empty.  Two boys, IVAN, spoddy looking and NIGEL,
           chubby, wait for PETE who in-turn eye-balls JOHN.

                                 PETE
                           (to Ivan and Nigel)
                        You two coming round to mine, 
                        watch my new telly?

                                 NIGEL
                           (innocent)
                        We already were...

           PETE gets up, heads to the door with IVAN and NIGEL.

                                 PETE
                        Have fun playing with yourself
                        Lennon.

                                 JOHN
                        Or maybe I'll get Martha to 'play
                        with me'...See her waving to me in
                        church did you?

           PETE tenses.

                                 PETE
                        You're sly, Lennon.  Nicking my
                        bird.

                                 JOHN
                        You'd chucked her.

                                 IVAN
                        No, she actually chucked-
                                 PETE
                        -Shut it Ivan! 

           Obvious Pete's been dumped.

                                 JOHN
                        So it's alright for Martha to wank
                        you off but not me?!

                                 PETE
                        Not if we're bezzie mates.

                                 JOHN
                        Why?

                                 PETE
                        It's...
                           (struggling)
                        ..unhygienic.

                                 JOHN
                        Why?  You in luuurvve with her or
                        something?

           PETE goes deep purple.  IVAN and NIGEL smirk.

                                 PETE
                        At least I'm not adopted.

           CRACK! 

           JOHN's left jab cracks PETE's nose - blood pours out.

           JOHN fists up, ready.  A HURT LOOK on his face (the first
           mention of his dodgy home-life).

           PETE - rage building, fists clenching.....then the pain
           hits him.  Then tears.  Lots.

                                 PETE (CONT'D)
                        Reverend! 

           He rushes off to grass John up.

           INT. MENDIPS/JOHN'S BEDROOM -- LATER

           MIMI throws JOHN into his bedroom.

                                 MIMI
                        I won't tire of making you decent,
                        John Lennon!  Enjoy being hungry!

           Slams the door shut.

           JOHN leans back on his bed, looks up at the ceiling locked
           in this room, in this life.....then his eyes close.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        'Twas brilig, and the slithy toves
                        Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
           EXT. DARK WOODS (ANIMATION) -- DAY

           JOHN in shorts and glasses, walking through a muggy forest,
           with sludgy ponds and seedy unknown cartoon-eyes peering
           from the blackness beyond.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        All mimsy were the borogroves, And
                        the mome raths outgrabe.

           TALL TROUSERED LEGS

           Of a man meets JOHN.  We see nothing above the waist, only
           his legs - this is the 'FATHER'.  JOHN peers up - a mind
           cloud from his head says 'Daddy?'  .

                                 FATHER (V.O.)
                        "Beware the Jabberwock, my son! 
                        The jaws that bite, the claws that
                        catch!  Beware the Jubjub bird,
                        and shun The frumious Bandersnatch!"

           The FATHER hands down a sword.  JOHN takes it.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        He took his vorpal sword in hand:
                        Long time maxnome foe he sought -

           JOHN carries on through the woods, swishing the sword -
           looking.

                                 JOHN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        So rested he by The Tumtum tree. 
                        And stood a while in thought.

           JOHN rests by a tree starts humming "tum,t,tum,t,tum".

           THE JABBERWOCK

           A monster of grotesque proportions comes flailing at JOHN. 
           But in the eyes of the monster we recognise Mimi.

                                 JOHN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        And as in uffish thought he stood,
                        The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
                        Came wiffling through, the tulgey
                        wood, And burbled as it came!

           JOHN swings his sword.

                                 JOHN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        One, two!  One, two!  And through
                        and through, The Vorpal blade went
                        snicker-snack!  He left it dead,
                        and with its head, He went
                        galumphing back.

           JOHN wanders back through the woods with the JABBERWOCK's
           head.  The TALL TROUSERED LEGS of the FATHER enter.  His
           BIG HANDS come into frame and hugs a BEAMING JOHN to his
           legs.
                                 FATHER (V.O.)
                        "And hast though slain the
                        Jabberwock?  Come to my arms, my
                        beamish boy!  Frabjous day! 
                        Callooh!  Callay!  He chortled in
                        his joy.

           Then suddenly the LEGS disappear.

           The JABBERWOCK'S HEAD disappears.

           And JOHN's smile disappears - and he is left where he
           started in the DARK FOREST.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                           (morose)
                        Twas brillig, and the slythy toves
                        Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
                        All mimsy were the borogroves, And
                        the mome raths outgrabe.

                                 UNCLE GEORGE (V.O.)
                        John?

           INT. MENDIPS/JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

                                 UNCLE GEORGE (V.O.)
                        John?  Got you some grub here.

           JOHN's eyes flick open, see UNCLE GEORGE (substitute Dad). 

           CARTOON DRAWINGS

           Of the Jabberwocky story and a Lewis Carrol poetry book on
           his bedside cabinet.

                                 UNCLE GEORGE (CONT'D)
                           (digs in a bag)
                        Corn-beef sarnie....angel cake.

           JOHN, munching away - ravenous.  (Note UNCLE GEORGE's happy,
           glazed look.  A slight slur on his words).

                                 UNCLE GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        Mimi's asleep.  Hard as nails that
                        woman..
                           (smiles)
                        ..bloody scary.
                           (pause)
                        Never helped,  playing mother to
                        her sisters.....no imagination
                        y'see.

           Beat.

                                 UNCLE GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        Am I making any sense lad?
                           (smiles)
                        Shouldn't be.  I'm pissed.

           JOHN manages a half-smile.
           He looks deeper.

                                 UNCLE GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        You're here, because she thinks
                        it's the right thing to do.
                           (pause)
                        Y'know that don't you?

           It's a veiled reference.  JOHN looks for more.  Nothing
           comes. 

           EXT. MENDIPS -- DAY

           Establisher of the house.  Nice and peaceful in the morning.

           INT. MENDIPS/BATHROOM -- DAY

           JOHN

           washing his face.  His reflection in the mirror soft,
           steamy, (as though a hot bath is running).  Then he sticks
           his specs on and everything hits focus (i.e there was no
           steam or bath).  He combs his hair into a regular side-
           parting - notices something under his chin - two PUBIC
           SPROUTS.  Fresh.  He tugs at them inquisitevely.

           Then yanks one out hard-

           INT. MENDIPS/KITCHEN -- DAY

           MIMI, cooking breakfast.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        Fuuuuck!

           Stops, did she really hear that - shakes her head - not
           her John.

           INT. MENDIPS/JOHN'S BEDROOM -- DAY

           JOHN knotting his school tie, undoes his shirt's top button,
           slings his school blazer on - the famous QUARRY BANK SCHOOL. 
           HARMONICA in the blazer's top pocket.  The school badge,

           A RED AND GOLD STAG - motto:

           'EX HOC METALLO VIRTUTUM'

           ('OUT OF THIS QUARRY COMETH FORTH VIRTUE').

           Hear THE SCHOOL ANTHEM, sung by schoolboys, as it plays
           over the following scenes....

           INT/EXT. MENDIPS -- DAY

           MIMI, washing up in the kitchen, watches JOHN un-park his
           RALEIGH LENTON bike walk it towards the front.

           She bangs on the window, signals for him to do his top
           button up.  JOHN, can't believe she's spotted it.  He does
           it up, sets off again.  Another bang on the window.
                                 MIMI
                           (mouths through the
                           window)
                        Glasses!

           JOHN tuts, digs his specs out - puts them on.  MIMI waves
           him out - free to go.

           Follow him out to the front where PETE waits on exactly
           the same model of RALEIGH LENTON.

           JOHN checks MIMI's out of view - takes his specs off.  And
           they set off riding down Menlove Avenue where...

           EXT. STRAWBERRY FIELDS -- DAY

           JOHN and PETE free-wheel past the FAMOUS RED GATES of the
           children's home and..

           EXT. CALDERSTONES GIRLS SCHOOLS -- DAY

           GIRLS congregating outside, the older ones - one in
           particular, MARIE KENNEDY with an ample bosom.. 

           JOHN and PETE ride slowly by - ogling.

                                 JOHN
                        Hey Marie!  Get your tits out!

                                 MARIE
                        Cock off Lennon.  Show us your
                        dick!

                                 JOHN
                           (stops)
                        Again!?  Just can't get enough can
                        you?

           Gets off his bike, starts undoing his pants.  The GIRLS
           all go screaming off into the playground.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        Where y'going?  This dick's won
                        prizes!

           A SCHOOL MISTRESS storms out.

                                 MISTRESS
                        You Two!  Get lost!  Go on!  Clear
                        off!  You disgusting imbeciles!

                                 JOHN
                           (mimics)
                        I am disgusting, sorry.  It's a
                        social disease.
                           (shrugs)
                        I've seen the doctor.

           Beat.
                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        I'd try a better bra, luv.  You're
                        sagging a bit.

           JOHN hops on his bike.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        No offence.

                                 MISTRESS
                        I know your headmaster!

                                 JOHN
                        So do I!  Tosser.  Halitosis.

           Rides of with PETE wailing with laughter.

           EXT. QUARRY BANK SCHOOL -- DAY

           Establisher of huge Victorian sand-stone school

           JOHN and PETE arrive in the playground as the bell rings. 
           The head in amongst the throng of QUARRY BANK BOYS.

           INT. QUARRY BANK SCHOOL/HALL -- DAY

           ASSEMBLY. 

           EVERYONE picks up the SCHOOL ANTHEM (started scene 23). 
           TEACHERS in gowns lined up on the stage.  JOHN and PETE
           goofing around singing in funny voices.  JOHN opting for
           soprano.

                                 JOHN/PETE
                           (singing)
                        "Quarrymen born before our birth,
                        Stretching each muscle and sinew."

           INT. QUARRY BANK SCHOOL/HISTORY CLASS -- DAY

           'CLIPPER' SHEARS

           60, history teacher and war vet, pounds the blackboard
           about THE BATTLE OF DUNKIRK.  The CLASS struggles to copy
           his chalked up ramblings.

                                 CLIPPER SHEARS
                        ...with more than 300,000 troops
                        stranded on the Dunkirk beaches in
                        May,  June, 1940.  What happened
                        next was described as "a miracle
                        of deliverance" by-
                           (stops)
                        By who?

           JOHN - back of the class, glasses on, head down, writing. 
           PETE sat next to him.

                                 CLIPPER SHEARS (CONT'D)
                        Lennon?
           JOHN'S EXERCISE BOOK

           Cartoons lampooning CLIPPER as he speaks - depicting him
           as NAZI GENERAL, teaching the class at gun-point.  (This
           is the famous 'DAILY HOWL').

           JOHN, totally engrossed in his art.

           CLIPPER turns round from the backboard.  Heads towards
           JOHN, with the creaking sound of a METAL LEG.

                                 PETE
                           (sharp whisper)
                        John.

           JOHN looks up, tries to drop 'THE DAILY HOWL' onto his lap -
           his history book underneath.

                                 JOHN
                           (checks the
                           blackboard)
                        Churchill, sir.

                                 CLIPPER SHEARS
                        Too late, boy.

                                 JOHN
                        ....by two weeks.  Mind you, the
                        lads had a good drink whilst waiting
                        on the beach.  So not all was lost.

           Beat.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        Unless you count France and Belgium.

                                 CLIPPER SHEARS
                        Give it me.

                                 JOHN
                        Give you what-

           CLIPPER yanks JOHN out of his seat, throws him to the floor. 
           He picks up 'THE DAILY HOWL' starts flicking through.

           On his reddening face.

           INT. QUARRYBANK SCHOOL OUTSIDE HEAD'S OFFICE -- DAY

           JOHN waiting outside.

           Name plaque on the door, "HEADMASTER - WILLIAM E POBJOY"

           Hear yelps inside, a thrashing in progress. 

           The door finally opens - a SOBBING BOY staggers out.  JOHN
           watches him slope off, rubbing his stinging hands.

                                 JOHN
                           (after him)
                        Puff.
                                 POBJOY (V.O.)
                        Lennon!

           INT. QUARRYBANK SCHOOL/HEADMASTERS OFFICE -- DAY

           JOHN walks in.

           POBJOY, 36, the headmaster, a tall, looming figure with
           pasty vampire skin, back to us, looking out of the window,
           surveying his kingdom.  The BAMBOO CANE re-charging in his
           hands. 

           THE DAILY HOWL

           sits in the middle of his desk.

                                 POBJOY
                        So you're the editor and chief of
                        this 'Daily Howl' are you?

                                 JOHN
                        Yes.

                                 POBJOY
                           (correcting)
                        Yes sir.

                                 JOHN
                        Yes,

           JOHN holds his nose, wafts his mouth in a smelly breath
           gesture.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        Sir.

                                 POBJOY
                        And basically you use it to lampoon
                        and deprecate my teaching staff.

                                 JOHN
                        They really don't need my help,
                        sir.

           POBJOY has a secret smile to himself.

                                 POBJOY
                        And all these pictures and
                        poems...they make sense to you?

                                 JOHN
                        Why would I do it if it
                        didn't......sir.

           POBJOY - stumped.  He turns round quickly.  JOHN just saves
           the day pretending he's smoothing his hair.

                                 POBJOY
                        Drawing in class is unacceptable.
                                 JOHN
                        What about art class?

                                 POBJOY
                           (stumbles)
                        Yes..Unless it's art-class..
                        obviously.

                                 JOHN
                        Which we only have one hour a week
                        of, sir.  Which is a bit frustrating
                        as I enjoy art far more than
                        history.

                                 POBJOY
                        Art doesn't get you into Oxford or
                        Cambridge, Lennon.

                                 JOHN
                        With respect sir, I would rather
                        chew my own nuts off.

                                 POBJOY
                        Don't get clever lad.

                                 JOHN
                        Easy for you to say, sir, you're a
                        teacher.

                                 POBJOY
                           (confused)
                        Pardon?

           Beat.

                                 JOHN
                        No.  I won't get clever, sir.

                                 POBJOY
                        You are not only failing yourself 
                        and Quarry Bank - you are also
                        failing the woman who has dedicated
                        herself to you and your upbringing.
                           (pause)
                        And in many ways saved you.

           Lets it sink in.

                                 POBJOY (CONT'D)
                        And this is how you repay your
                        Aunt Mimi is it?

           JOHN doesn't answer, the thought of failing Mimi doesn't
           sit well.  POBJOY picks up THE DAILY HOWL off his desk.

                                 POBJOY (CONT'D)
                        Quarry Bank is a proud academic
                        school Lennon.
                                 (MORE)
                                 POBJOY (CONT'D)
                        Most of our students go on to
                        achieve something in life - but
                        you - you're going nowhere,
                        boy...and nowhere's where you'll
                        end up if you carry on like this.

           JOHN stares defiantly.

                                 JOHN
                        Maybe that's where I belong, sir. 
                        Maybe it's not so bad there. 
                        Nowhere.
                           (pause)
                        Ever been?

           POBJOY sizes him up - can see the intelligence, the wit. 
           But has no idea how to handle it.

                                 POBJOY
                        We don't draw pretty pictures in
                        class, hear me?

           He flicks through THE DAILY HOWL.  POV: Grotesque images.

                                 POBJOY (CONT'D)
                        Or not so pretty pictures in this
                        case.

           He drops THE DAILY HOWL into his waste-bin.

                                 POBJOY (CONT'D)
                        This time you're lucky.  Next time
                        it will hurt.  Understand?

                                 JOHN
                        'Lucky'...'Hurt' - got that, sir.

                                 POBJOY
                        Get out Lennon.

           JOHN turns and leaves mutters 'wanker' under his breath. 

           POBJOY waits for the door to shut.  Digs out THE DAILY
           HOWL from the bin, settles himself in his chair, swigs
           from a hit-flask of whisky - starts reading....then
           smiling...then chuckling at John's art..

           EXT. MENLOVE AVENUE/MENDIPS -- DAY

           JOHN and PETE slowly cycling home after school, one handed
           blowing bubble-gum bubbles.  Nothing is said sensibly,
           everything an undertone of sarcasm, piss-taking, or just
           plain daft.  (Plenty of stuff said in spastic voices, a
           characteristic of JOHN through his life).

                                 JOHN
                        What we doing after tea?
                                 PETE
                           (mock serious)
                        Homework?

                                 JOHN
                           (Indian accent)
                        You very, very funny man, Snowy. 
                        Blady hilarious.

                                 PETE
                           (posh)
                        Cheers Winston, old chap.

                                 JOHN
                           (posh)
                        Pleasure Spunkhead.

           PETE's face suddenly drops.  JOHN follows his eye-line. 
           POV: An AMBULANCE parked outside Mendips,  NEIGHBOURS
           gathered at the front.

           JOHN sprints off on his bike.

           EXT. MENDIPS -- DAY

           JOHN throws his bike to the ground, rushes towards the
           house.

           UNCLE GEORGE

           Being carried out on a stretcher, eye's shut, white face,
           oxygen breathing apparatus stuck to his mouth.  JOHN's
           eyes - petrified, panicked.  MIMI following casting the
           NEIGHBOURS a suspicion glance.

                                 JOHN
                        Mimi?!

                                 MIMI
                        He's had a fall.  That's all.
                           (to neighbours)
                        There's nothing to see - really.

           JOHN getting more distraught as they load GEORGE into the
           back of the AMBULANCE.

                                 JOHN
                        I'm coming too!

                                 MIMI
                           (ignoring)
                        There's lamb stew in the oven ready. 
                        And you've got homework.

                                 JOHN
                        But Mimi-

                                 MIMI
                        -John!  Listen to me!  You're not
                        needed!
           She climbs into the back of the AMBULANCE.

                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        The pets needs feeding.

           The doors are slammed - it takes off - sirens wailing. 
           MIMI's POV: JOHN disappears in the distance.

           MIMI grabs GEORGE's his hand squeezes it lovingly. 

           A RARE MOMENT OF TENDERNESS

           She knows it's serious.

                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        Y'Silly bugger.

           INT. MENDIPS/LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

           JOHN on the settee, asleep.  The clock shows 11.30pm. Hear
           the front door, open and shut - the bang wakes him up. 

           INT. MENDIPS/MORNING ROOM/KITCHEN -- NIGHT

           JOHN sticks his head out of the lounge.  POV: MIMI sat in
           the morning room - staring at A FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH - GEORGE,
           MIMI and JOHN aged 5, posing outside Mendips.  The family
           unit.

           MIMI - her face pale with shock.

                                 JOHN
                        Mimi?

           She doesn't hear him.  He steps nearer.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        How is he?

           MIMI looks up at JOHN.

                                 MIMI
                           (blunt)
                        Dead.

           JOHN bursts into giggles.

           JOHN's smile gradually fades.  He looks around, not knowing
           what to do.  MIMI see's he's about to cry, gets up, moves
           off into the kitchen.  Avoiding.

           JOHN can't keep it in, rushes after her.  Hugs MIMI's BACK
           as she washes up - cries into her shoulder blades.

           MIMI slowly turns round to face him

           SHE NEVER HUGS HIM

                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        If you need to cry, go to your
                        bedroom.
           JOHN hears her, takes deep breaths, stops crying - nods
           slowly.

           He picks up the dish towel - starts drying the pots.  MIMI
           gets back to washing up.

           EXT. MENDIPS -- DAY

           FUNERAL CARS pull up outside the house.

           INT. MENDIPS/MORNING ROOM/KITCHEN -- DAY

           MIMI, dressed in black, looking gaunt yet strong, being
           faffed over and cared for by her YOUNGER SISTERS - MATER,
           NANNY and HARRIE. 

           Food being prepared for the wake.

           INT. MENDIPS/MIMI'S BEDROOM -- DAY

           JOHN creeps in.  Finds it weird, not really allowed in
           here.  POV: Separate beds. 

           He opens George's wardrobe, his SUITS hung up (some of
           these suit jackets he will wear at Art College).  Puts the
           NAVY UNIFORM JACKET on, looks in the mirror.  The tears
           come - but this time JOHN fights them off, rapping his
           knuckles on his eye-lids - forcing them away.

           A BOTTLE OF WHISKEY

           Half full - hidden at the bottom.  He screws the top off,
           takes a hit.  Gaggs at the taste.

           INT/EXT ST. PETERS CHURCH -- DAY

           A GOOD TURNOUT.

           JOHN, MIMI, the STANLEY SISTERS and COUSINS on the front
           row.  THE REV.  PRYCE-JONES, stands behind the coffin. 

           JOHN slightly pissed, plays the game where you squeeze
           someone's head between thumb and forefinger.  The REV
           getting it.

                                 REVEREND
                        George Smith was a true gent in
                        every sense of the word.  No-one
                        had a bad word to say about him.

           JOHN raises an eye at MIMI, (who never said a good word).

                                 REVEREND (CONT'D)
                        A much loved character in Woolton. 
                        The milk, his dairy farm produced,
                        enriched our tea cups on a daily
                        basis...
           EXT. GRAVESIDE -- DAY

           THE REVEREND winding things up.  JOHN and MIMI stood
           graveside, stoic.  OTHERS around them crying.

                                 REVEREND
                        God will show us the path of life;
                        in his presence is the fullness of
                        joy; and at his right hand there
                        is pleasure evermore.

                                 EVERYONE
                        Amen.

           THE COFFIN

           lowered into the grave.  JOHN watching this finality.

           He looks away, emotion creeping up on him, then, on the
           otherside of the grave, through the crowd, he sees THE RED
           HAIR.  The outline of the face. Fuzzy. Out of his sight-
           range, but he gets a feeling, he knows. 

           He reaches inside his jacket for his glasses - puts them
           on.

           JULIA

           staring right at him.  Face full of emotion (the opposite
           to Mimi).  Tears streaming down her face....but not for
           George.

           Hold.

           Then in act of solidarity she puts her own glasses on -
           the exact same NHS SPECS as JOHN's.  The two gaze at each
           other with clarity.

           Half-smiles.

           JOHN is interrupted by MIMI, she grabs his hand, leads
           them to the mound of dirt, throw a handful on the coffin. 

           JOHN eager to get back - he looks up again.

           JULIA gone.

           EXT/INT. MENDIPS -- DAY

           JOHN, alone, leaning against Mendips front wall.  Looking.

           MENLOVE AVENUE DESERTED

           except for the odd speeding car.

           JOHN sighs.  Heads back inside.  Follow him through all
           the downstairs rooms, searching through the FUNERAL GUESTS. 
           He ends up in the kitchen where MIMI is surrounded by
           HARRIE, MATER and NANNY.  JOHN studies them - all have a
           resemblance of the one sister that's not there.
           He heads outside.

           EXT. MENDIPS/BACK GARDEN -- CONTINUOUS

           JOHN strides across the lawn.

           His cousins MICHAEL (8), DAVID (11) are helping STAN (17)
           knock apples from the tree.  JOHN ignores them, climbs up
           into his TREE HOUSE.  He gets his HARMONICA out - starts
           playing 'Swedish Rhapsody'.

           STAN

           looks over at his JOHN.  Feels sorry for him.

                                 STAN
                           (climbs up)
                        I don't go back to Jockland till
                        Tuesday.  Let's hit Blackpool. 
                        The Pleasure Beach.

                                 JOHN
                        I don't need looking after Stan.

                                 STAN
                           (defensive)
                        George was my Uncle too.

           JOHN looks up - steely.

                                 JOHN
                        He was 'more than just and Uncle'
                        to me though, wasn't he?

           STAN nods sympathetically.  JOHN not going to elaborate.

                                 STAN
                        Well...Don't forget we're mates as
                        well as cousins.

           STAN heads off.  JOHN watches him.

                                 JOHN
                        Stan.

           STAN turns round.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                           (struggling)
                        Where did she go?

                                 STAN
                        Who?

                                 JOHN
                           (pause)
                        The one with the red hair.

           JOHN fixes him with a look.  It's eating him.
                                 STAN
                           (penny drops)
                        Was she there?

           JOHN nods.

                                 STAN (CONT'D)
                        Want me to ask?

           JOHN nods.  STAN sets off towards the house.

           INT. MENDIPS/KITCHEN -- DAY

           STAN walks in the kitchen, MIMI and THE SISTERS still
           gossiping.  They look formidable, even more so when he
           considers what he's about to ask.

           He thinks about not doing it - then connects eyes with
           JOHN, watching him from the tree-house.

           EXT. MENDIPS/BACK GARDEN -- DAY

           JOHN closely watching STAN.

           POV: STAN takes a deep breath.  Speaks.  All the SISTERS
           stop talking, stare at STAN.  No-one seems to say anything. 
           MIMI turns, looks into the garden - finds JOHN's eyes.

           Hold.

           MIMI turns back to STAN.  Stay with him as he returns from
           the kitchen, across the lawn, back to JOHN, being watched
           all the way by MIMI.

                                 STAN
                        She was busy, apparently.  Things
                        to do.

           JOHN nods, his emotions in check.  He clambers down from
           the tree house.

                                 STAN (CONT'D)
                        John.
                           (pause)
                        You should call her 'Mum' y'know. 
                        'The one with the red hair'.

           JOHN looks over at MIMI - then back at STAN.

                                 JOHN
                        I know.

           He heads over to the house.  STAN watching - concerned

           INT/EXT MENDIPS -- DAY

           STAN and JOHN heading for a day out.  MIMI behind them.

                                 MIMI
                        Back before dark, y'hear me Stan.
                                 STAN
                        Yes Aunt Mimi.

                                 MIMI
                        Look after him.

                                 JOHN
                        I don't need looking after.

                                 MIMI
                        Where are your glasses?

                                 JOHN
                        In my pocket.

                                 MIMI
                        Your pocket's not blind.

           They open the front door, MIMI watches them down the path. 
           JOHN pretending to put his glasses on (but never does).

                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        Careful on those Pleasure Beach
                        rides.  Death traps.

           STAN and JOHN hold an acknowledging hand up.

                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        And don't talk to any strangers.
                           (mutters)
                        Especially loose women.

           MIMI watches them head off down Menlove Avenue.

           STAN - one eye on MIMI, waiting for her to go back inside. 
           She finally does, he stops JOHN - looks him in the eye.

                                 STAN
                        Do you want to see your Mum?

                                 JOHN
                           (taken back)
                        What?

                                 STAN
                        I know where she lives.  Instead
                        of going to Blackpool, we can go
                        there.

           JOHN thinks.  Pressure.

                                 JOHN
                        Has she asked us?

                                 STAN
                        No.

           JOHN brain racing.
                                 JOHN
                        But, but...she might not want to
                        see me.

                                 STAN
                        It's worth trying isn't it?  I
                        mean, you wanted to see her the
                        other day.

           JOHN - a massive decision for him.

                                 JOHN
                           (resolute)
                        Let's go.

                                 STAN
                        But let's get this straight.  Mimi
                        never knows.

           Beat.

                                 STAN (CONT'D)
                        I like my testicles.

           They set off to cross the road, establish STAN's shoelace
           flapping.  JOHN in a daze.  But thrilled at the prospect
           of seeing his Mum.

                                 JOHN
                        What bus do we get?

                                 STAN
                        Don't need one.  She lives on
                        Springwood Estate.

                                 JOHN
                        ...that's round the corner.

           STAN shrugs - he knows.  JOHN - gobsmacked.

           EXT. DIRT-PATH BY DAIRY FARM -- DAY

           JOHN and STAN climb a path by Uncle George's dairy farm -
           cows being herded.

           EXT. ALLERTON GOLF COURSE -- DAY

           THEY race across the 15th fairway.

           EXT. MATHER AVENUE -- DAY

           THEY vault over a fence and hit another maine-road.  This
           time they both wait for the cars to pass - then cross.

           EXT. BLOMEFIELD ROAD/JULIA'S HOUSE -- DAY

           JOHN and STAN turn into a pretty tree-lined, road, council
           houses, but bigger.  KIDS run riot on the street, MUMS
           chatting, DADS fixing things in their gardens.  A real
           community feel.
           They reach the corner house.  NUMBER 1.

           STAN stands outside the gate, looks at JOHN who's slowed
           down behind.  JOHN, apprehensive.  The front door open. 
           We hear piano playing and voices singing 'I am the Music
           Man'. 

                                 JOHN
                        Maybe this isn't a great idea.

                                 STAN
                        Maybe.

                                 JOHN
                        Maybe we should go.

           STAN makes the decision, opens the gate walks up the path. 
           JOHN stays on the street - nervous.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        Stan!

           STAN nears the front-door, has a last look at JOHN then
           disappears inside.

           Beat.

           The piano playing stops dead.

           JOHN

           looking round, thinking of running off.  Escape.  Really
           thinking about it.  Heart pounding.  About to go, when-

           JULIA

           appears at the doorway, still in her nightgown (a silky
           flimsy number that hugs her body tight).  Freezes at the
           sight of JOHN.

           JOHN can't keep his eyes off her.  Both rooted to the spot. 
           Until JULIA breaks out of the trance, sprints down the
           path - grabs hold of her son, folds him into her body,
           kissing, smelling his skin.  Squeezing too tight.

                                 JULIA
                        Oh My Oh My Oh My!  My dream is
                        back!  Oh my dream!

           She tilts her head up to the heavens - eyes closed. 

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                        I knew you'd find me!

           STAN, comes to the door, followed by TWO YOUNG GIRLS, pre-
           ten,  still in their nighties.

           STAN's POV:  The heartwarming sight of a MOTHER holding
           her SON for the first time - in a very long time. 

           JULIA opens her eyes, looks at STAN.
                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                           (whispers)
                        Thank you.

           JOHN - a big warm, smile from within.

           INT. JULIA'S HOUSE -- LATER

           Sparsely decorated with hand-me down furniture.  Brightly
           coloured paintings, (by Julia), on the wall.  A PIANO takes
           up one corner - a BANJO and ACCORDION propped up next to
           it.

           JOHN and STAN sit opposite the TWO GIRLS - who just stare
           at him.  They are obviously sisters.  JULIA rattles around
           the kitchen.  (When she speaks she hardly breaks for
           breath).

                                 JULIA (O.S.)
                        Oh John, my angel!  I knew you
                        were coming, I just knew it, want
                        to know how I knew because I-

           She appears with a cake.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                        -Baked a cake!  Only this morning,
                        I said to the girls, didn't I, I
                        said lets bake a vanilla bun-

           She wedges herself next to JOHN.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                        -we've got the ingredients - even
                        butter, so hard to get, Bobby, my
                        Bobby, works in a restaurant y'see,
                        has it's perks, and it was all
                        there and, I just felt it, you
                        know, I just felt like baking.  So
                        here it is!

           She practically shovels a piece into JOHN's mouth.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                        What'd'you think?  Huh?

           JOHN nods his head, mouthful.  JULIA carries on handing
           cake out to the GIRLS.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                        A piece for you Julia...and Jackie. 
                        OH!

           JULIA stops.  Raises her hand to her mouth.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                        How rude of me!  I've not introduced
                        you.  John that's Julia and that's
                        Jackie, have I just said that? 
                        Yes I did!
           She giggles.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                           (bight and breezy)
                        They're your sisters!

           Beat.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                        Say hello girls.

                                 JULIA/JACKIE
                        Hello.

           JOHN finds the cake suddenly hard to swallow.

           INT. JULIA'S HOUSE -- LATER

           THE GIRLS play outside John's half-sisters JACKIE (6) and
           JULIA JUNIOR (8). 

           JOHN has picked up the BANJO.  STAN on the piano.  JULIA
           is in the middle of the room - shaking her shoulders with
           the beat.

                                 JULIA
                        I'm digging it!  Really!  John
                        you're fantastic!

                                 JOHN
                        Really?

                                 STAN
                        He's pretty good on the harmonica
                        too.

                                 JULIA
                        The 'ol' mouthie', eh?

                                 JOHN
                        Uncle George's taught me loads.

           An awkward moment.  See JULIA burst away from bad thoughts,
           almost snatches the BANJO away from JOHN.

                                 JULIA
                        Listen to this, then.  A bit of
                        fun.

           She launches into a great GEORGE FORMBY IMPRESSION singing 
           'My Little Stick of Blackpool Rock'.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                        "Every year when Summer comes round,
                        Off to the sea I go, I don't care
                        if I spend a pound, I'm rather
                        rash I know..."

           The REAL GEORGE FORMBY takes over through the following:
           EXT. BLACKPOOL STATION PLATFORM -- DAY

           THE TRAIN approaching -  JULIA jumps off while it's still
           moving, closely followed by JOHN - giggling at the dare. 
           The STATION MASTER points at them - they run off laughing.

           EXT. BLACKPOOL TOWER -- DAY

           JOHN and JULIA, chewing on Blackpool rock, queue up for
           the lift to the TOP OF THE TOWER.

           EXT. BLACKPOOL TOWER -- DAY

           The top.  JULIA looking through a telescope with her right
           eye, left eye shut.  She steps back pretends her left eye
           is glued stuck.

           JOHN laughing.

           EXT. BLACKPOOL PROMENADE -- DAY

           Stupid stalls, candy floss and chip shops.

           DAYTRIPPERS 

           JULIA buys a 'Kiss Me Quick' hat.  Plonks it on JOHN's
           head, proceeds to smother him in quick kisses.  Takes it
           off, puts it in her head - signals it's JOHN's turn to
           pucker up.

           EXT. PLEASURE BEACH/LAUGHING POLICEMAN -- DAY

           THE LAUGHING POLICEMAN

           Giving it a belly-full 24/7.  Whip off to find JOHN and
           JULIA staring with intense, serious faces.  The game being
           who will crack up first?  JULIA nudges JOHN in the ribs -
           his lips start curling.

           EXT. PLEASURE BEACH/ROLLERCOASTER -- DAY

           JOHN and JULIA on the front row, arms up - thrill seeking.

           INT. HALL OF MIRRORS -- DAY

           JOHN and JULIA howling through the distorted reflections. 
           JOHN in particular loving the grotesqueness of it all. 
           Then the last one - a 'straight' mirror. 

           They stand together.  Realise there's nothing funny going -
           but the fact they're there, with each other, dawning on
           them.

           GEORGE FORMBY track finishes.

           INT. BLACKPOOL/TEA ROOM -- DAY

           A rather posh one.  Marble and plants.  LADIES dressed up
           for tea.  A LADY PIANIST playing light classical.  JOHN
           and JULIA, sat, peruse the menu.
                                 JULIA
                        What d'you fancy?

                                 JOHN
                        Dunno, it's all a bit posh.
                           (joking)
                        They all look like Mimi.

           The mention of Mimi ices the atmosphere.  JULIA buries her
           head in the menu.

           A WAITER approaches, mid 30's, slicked back hair, parted,
           mustache.  JULIA spots him - nudges JOHN.

                                 JULIA
                        Got a proper little Hitler here.

           JOHN giggles.  JULIA relieved she has him laughing again. 
           The WAITER arrives - sees the 'Kiss Me Quick' hat - stiffens
           up.  Riffraff

                                 WAITER
                        Can I take your order?

                                 JULIA
                        You can stay out of Poland for a
                        start.

                                 WAITER
                        Excuse me?

                                 JULIA
                        Bit late for apologies mate.

           JOHN loving it.

                                 WAITER
                           (deep breath)
                        Would you like anything from the
                        menu?

                                 JULIA
                        Errrrrrm....
                           (goes posh)
                        What can one recommend?

                                 WAITER
                        I think you'll find everything
                        will be to your satisfaction.

                                 JULIA
                        Really?  Then one will have
                        everything then.

                                 WAITER
                        Everything?

                                 JULIA
                        If one recommends everything then
                        one, I mean one as in 'we',
                                 (MORE)
                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                           (signals to John)
                        Would like everything.  Get one's
                        meaning?  John?  Everything sound
                        good to you?

           JOHN nods.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                        T'riffic.  La-de-da.  Everything
                        please.  And hurry up.

                                 WAITER
                        I think you're being rather rude,
                        madam.

                                 JULIA
                           (spitting)
                        Rude?! Rude is gassing six million
                        Jews!!

           JOHN - embarrassed, shocked.

                                 WAITER
                        Leave.  Now.

           Tries to grab hold of JULIA.

                                 JULIA
                        Get your dirty fucking inferior
                        hands off me!

           JULIA - like she'll rip his head off.

                                 JOHN
                           (calming)
                        Maybe it's best...we should go.

           JOHN gets up.  Gently leads JULIA to the exit who stares
           down the WAITER all the way.

           EXT. BLACKPOOL/TEA ROOM -- DAY

           JOHN and JULIA step outside.  JULIA's face relaxes like
           nothing's happened.  Forgotten.

                                 JULIA
                        Right.  Where next?  Hungry?  Of
                        course, only one thing to eat in
                        Blacky.

           EXT. BLACKPOOL/NORTH PIER -- DAY

           JOHN and JULIA strolling arm in arm, sharing a bag of chips. 
           Suddenly JULIA stops - ears prick up.

                                 JULIA
                        Y'hear that?

           JULIA - excited, grabs JOHN, leads him off.
           EXT. BLACKPOOL/NORTH PIER/MILK BAR -- DAY

           JULIA dragging JOHN around.  The sound of a Rock'n'Roll
           tune growing louder. 

           INT. PIER MILK BAR -- DAY

           A tiny place selling milkshakes and sweets.

           Most importantly a JUKE BOX which at that moment is playing 
           IKE TURNER's 'ROCKET 88' (the first Rock'n'Roll track).

           JULIA immediately starts grooving her head, clicking her
           fingers - sings the lyrics.

                                 JULIA/IKE
                           (singing)
                        "Step in my rocket, And don't be
                        late, We're pulling out 'bout half
                        past eight..." 

           Beat.

                                 JULIA
                        It just vibrates through my bones. 
                        I love it.

           JOHN nodding.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                        Know what it means?  'Rock'n Roll'?

                                 JOHN
                        Music?

                                 JULIA
                           (mischievous)
                        Sex.

           JOHN - eyes light up at the word.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                        Big black fellahs from America. 
                        New sounds.  I dig it, Baby!

           JOHN looks adoringly at JULIA - so exciting.

           JULIA leads him on the floor, starts dancing with him. 
           JOHN's hopeless, but both laughing.

           JOHN

           Having the time of his life.

           End tight on the record spinning..

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. JULIA'S HOUSE -- EVENING

           The same record spinning - on JULIA's gramaphone.
           JULIA watches JOHN ('Kiss Me Quick' hat on) trying to strum
           along on the BANJO.  THE SISTERS asleep on the settee. 
           STAN slumped in the arm-chair - checks his watch - it's
           nearly dark.

           But for JOHN and JULIA it's still early.

                                 JULIA
                        That's it John.  Go from 'A' to
                        'D'.

           JOHN does so - in tune with record.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                        You've got it! 
                           (hillbilly)
                        That's ma boy!

           JOHN nods his head, getting the hang quite easily - getting
           the buzz.  JULIA adds a bit on the piano - for a while
           they jam with the record.  Then JOHN tries to sing.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                        It's like Ike Turner's in the room!

           A TALL, SWARTHY MAN enters from the kitchen, unseen - he
           wears the tails of a Head Waiter.  This is BOBBY DYKINS -
           Julia's boyfriend.  He eyes JOHN suspiciously,  walks to
           the gramaphone - takes the needle off.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                           (excited)
                        Bobby!  Look!  Isn't it wonderful! 
                        John!  Here!  John this is Bobby,
                        my guy.

           BOBBY hold out his hand, shakes with JOHN - no smile.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                        We've been to Blackpool.  Run riot.

                                 BOBBY
                           (to John)
                        How did you find us?

           (BOBBY's delivery is punctuated by a constant nervous
           tick/cough).

                                 JULIA
                           (quickly)
                        Stan brought him over.  Y'remember
                        Stan?  My nephew.

           A vague nod between them.

                                 BOBBY
                        The girls should be in bed.

                                 JULIA
                        I know but John's here!
                                 BOBBY
                        No buts Julia.  It's late.

           JOHN looks to the floor - doesn't want to contemplate
           leaving.  He throws a quick glance to JULIA - who can't
           look back.

           BOBBY lifts the GIRLS up in his arms.

                                 BOBBY (CONT'D)
                        I'll take these two up.
                           (to John, genuine)
                        Nice to see you John.  At last.

           He throws a quick look at JULIA then moves to the stairs.

           The room falls silent. 

           JOHN not making the first move, wants to stay with JULIA -
           who stares into the distance, hating this part of her life.

           Hold.

                                 STAN
                        C'mon John.  We told Mimi-
                           (stops himself)
                        It's getting dark.

           JOHN still not moving.

           EXT. JULIA'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

           JOHN and JULIA walk slowly down the path, taking as long
           as possible - trying to hold on.

           (STAN has conscientiously moved on ahead).

           They reach the gate - stand around - grasping for time. 
           JULIA lets out low, visceral sigh.  Then suddenly jumps
           into life.  Perky.

                                 JULIA
                        Next time we'll make a different
                        kind of cake.  Eccles cakes, I
                        love those.  Have to find raisins. 
                        But you go now and I'll get the
                        recipe.

           JULIA grabs JOHN close.  Shuts here eyes tight, like she's
           been stabbed in the heart.  Then back to being jumpy.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                        We'll have an even better time
                        next time.  I promise.  Go now.  I
                        love you.  You're my dream, don't
                        forget that!

           With that she quickly walks back into the house.  The door
           shuts.  JOHN watching on from the bottom of the path.  He
           finally turns to go - catches up with STAN waiting further
           on up.  Keeps looking back as he walks away. 
           INT. MENDIPS -- NIGHT

           MIMI reading 'A Tale of Two Cities', every so often she
           looks up at the wall clock. 

           Finally the doorbell rings.

           INT/EXT. MENDIPS -- NIGHT

           She opens up - STAN and JOHN on the step.  JOHN, a weird
           look in his eye.

                                 MIMI
                           (pleasant)
                        I was just about to send a search
                        party out.  Nice day was it?

           STAN waits for JOHN to answer - he says nothing - just
           stares at MIMI.

                                 STAN
                           (jumps in)
                        Yeah!  Great!  Wasn't it John? 
                        'The Mouse-Trap'.  'The Grand
                        National' - great fun.

                                 MIMI
                           (smiles at John)
                        Are you hungry?  I could make you
                        a sandwich?

           Beat.

                                 JOHN
                        Too tired.

           JOHN pushes past MIMI and straight upstairs, MIMI looks at
           STAN - who beams her a big 'nothing wrong smile'.

           INT. JULIA'S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

           BOBBY looks on concerned as JULIA frantically searches
           through her record collection on her hands and knees..

                                 BOBBY
                           (soft)
                        Julia.  Why don't I make us a pot
                        of tea before the record...

           JULIA can't hear him.

                                 BOBBY (CONT'D)
                        Julia?

           JULIA finds the record, a 78, title:  "My Son John To Me
           You Are So Wonderful".  She caresses the well worn sleeve,
           gently takes the vinyl out, carefully puts the needle on
           the record - and waits.  As the song washes through her
           heart she lowers herself face-down onto the floor - sobs
           silently.
           BOBBY sits on the floor beside her - seen this a hundred
           times before.  He gently rubs her back - shows her he's
           there.  It's all he can do.

           INT. MENDIPS/JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           (The song still playing).

           JOHN sat on the window sill, in his pyjamas, glasses on -
           staring out the window into the night.  In his hands he
           fingers the 'Kiss Me Quick' hat from Blackpool - a memento. 
           Remembers how she kissed him.

           But her kisses have always been too quick and never enough.

           Slowly he puts the hat on his head.

           FADE TO BLACK 

           FADE IN:

           EXT. SHABBY TOWN-HOUSE (RECURRING DREAM) -- DAY

           Establisher of a bed-sit style town house.  Painted red.

           No sound at all.

           SEA-GULLS SQUARKS crash in.  Violently loud.

           A DONKEY like you find on the beach at Blackpool, trots
           slowly past, a 5 YR OLD JOHN riding it.

           INT. ROOM (RECURRING DREAM) -- DAY

           5 YR OLD JOHN

           On a chair too big for him.  A red front door behind him. 

           TWO ADULTS, man and woman fringe foreground.  A Grandfather
           clock ticks somewhere.

           A HARSH SPOTLIGHT

           suddenly hits 5 YR OLD JOHN from above.  His eyes switch
           methodically to the faces of the ADULTS - who's faces we
           never see.

           Tick-tock.

                                 5YR OLD JOHN (V.O.)
                        Mummy...Daddy...Mummy...Daddy... 
                        Mummy..

           The camera pushes in on JOHN over the mantra.

           Tick-tock. 

                                 5YR OLD JOHN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Daddy...Mummy...Daddy...Mummy..

           Stop on a C/U of JOHN. 
           The clock stops.

                                 5YR OLD JOHN (CONT'D)
                           (speaks)
                        Daddy.

           Hear WOMEN'S HEELS rushing across the room.  Then a door
           bang.

           5YR OLD JOHN

           Confused, frightened.

                                 5YR OLD JOHN (CONT'D)
                        Mummy?

           JUMP CUT TO - JOHN wailing at the front-door.  Tears
           streaming down his face.  Beyond hysteria.

                                 5YR OLD JOHN (CONT'D)
                        Mummmeeeyy!!

           He tugs at the handle with all his might. 

                                 5YR OLD JOHN (CONT'D)
                        MUMMEEEEEY!!!

           But it never opens.

           INT. MENDIPS/JOHN'S BEDROOM -- MORNING

           JOHN takes a gasp of air - waking himself.  He lies
           scrunched up - fetal position.

           INT. QUARRY BANK/ART ROOM -- DAY

           THE BOYS sketching a BOWL OF FRUIT in the middle of the
           room.  On top is a LARGE GREEN APPLE.

           JOHN - lost in his drawing.

           The ART TEACHER moves round the room, checking his pupils
           progress.  POV: Various O/S shots of sketches - all
           standards.  ART TEACHER gets to JOHN.

           JOHN'S SKETCH

           A hairy, naked woman, with small breasts and facial features
           (not unlike Julia's).  On her back a huge hump.  In her
           over-long left fingers she holds a LARGE GREEN APPLE with
           two maggots falling out.

                                 ART TEACHER
                        Is that what you see Lennon?

                                 JOHN
                           (looks up)
                        Don't you?
           EXT. NEWSAGENTS -- DAY

           JOHN and PETE come out.  JOHN has a HIGHLAND CHEW - a
           merciless toffee-bar, PETE has a bag of the biggest GOB-
           STOPPERS.

           JOHN has also bought a magazine, 'WEEKEND'.  On the cover
           a picture of a BRIGETTE BARDOT in a bathing suit.

                                 JOHN
                           (French accent)
                        Briggeeet!  Mon amour!  Nous avons
                        jiggy jiggy n'est pas?

                                 PETE
                        Oooh la la!
                           (confused)
                        Still don't get it.

                                 JOHN
                        To get a life-size poster of that,
                           (points to Brigette)
                        You collect 12 of these.

           He flicks through finds a life-size picture of Bardot's
           left foot.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        Twelve mags.

           The LADS sweets start inhibiting their ability to talk -
           they carry on oblivious and understand each other perfectly.

           (Subtitled).

                                 PETE
                        When do you get the boobs?

                                 JOHN
                        Dunno.

                                 PETE
                        You can't wank over her toes?

                                 JOHN
                           (genuine)
                        Why not?

           EXT. QUARRY BANK SCHOOL -- DAY

           PETE and JOHN walking along the school walls heading for
           the main entrance.  Hear the bell signaling end of lunch. 
           BUS pulls up in the distance - Number 86.

                                 JOHN
                        86, goes to Springwood right?

                                 PETE
                        Think so.

           JOHN immediately jogs off towards the BUS.
                                 PETE (CONT'D)
                           (standing still)
                        We've got history assignments to
                        hand in.

                                 JOHN
                        Who has?

           PETE watches him get on the bus then spits his gob-stopper
           out and heads in for class, massaging his aching jaw.

           EXT. JULIA'S HOUSE -- DAY

           JOHN wandering back down the street.  Pensive.  He wanders
           up the path to the house - curtains drawn.  Finally knocks.

           Nothing.

           He knocks again - louder.

           Nothing.

           He nuts the door in quiet frustration.  Heads off back
           down the path.  Then he hears the door unlock - looks back -
           no-one there - the door open.

           INT. JULIA'S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

           JOHN heads in.  The air is muggy.  The curtains drawn make
           it hard to see.  JULIA is lieing on the couch still in her
           nightgown - eyes closed.  There is a different air about
           her - no smiles.  No joy.

                                 JULIA
                           (yawns)
                        Just had a kip.

                                 JOHN
                        It's lunchtime.

                                 JULIA
                           (defensive)
                        So?  We've got Spanish blood don't
                        you know?  What time is it?

                                 JOHN
                           (checks watch)
                        Two.

                                 JULIA
                        Pass my fags on the table will
                        you.

           JOHN does so.  She lights one up offers JOHN one who
           accepts.

           INT. JULIA'S HOUSE/BEDROOM -- DAY

           JOHN sat on the bed.  JULIA in her underwear getting
           dressed, thinking nothing of a 15 year old watching.
                                 JULIA
                        Your teachers go sick often then?

                                 JOHN
                        The older ones, yeah.  War vets
                        y'see, metal legs, six fingers. 
                        Brains blown out.

                                 JULIA
                        And they just let you out?

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah.

           She snaps her suspenders on.  JOHN trying his best not to
           see this as sexual.

                                 JULIA
                        Turn around will you.

           JOHN does so - faces the dressing table mirror.  Shuts his
           eyes - but not all the way.

           In the mirror JULIA throws her nighty off, see her naked
           breasts which as she quickly slings a bra on then button-
           up dress.  JOHN feeling strange.

           JULIA sits in at the dressing table, brushes her hair. 
           But then she stops - and just stares at herself, like she
           hates what she sees.

           JULIA catches JOHN looking. 

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                        Don't stare it's rude.

           JOHN manages an awkward smile.  No smile back.

           INT. CAFE -- DAY

           JOHN and JULIA walk into a raucous greasy spoon.  WORKMEN
           immediately alerted by her sassy presence.

                                 JULIA
                        I'll order.

           JULIA heads towards the counter.  JOHN sits - looks over
           at the WORKMEN, still perving.  JOHN, embarrassed, angered,
           confused.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                           (sitting back down)
                        This is where I met Bobby.

                                 JOHN
                        Twitchy's kind of place.

                                 JULIA
                        Who?
                                 JOHN
                        Tw,tw,twitchy.  B,bb,Bobby.

           JOHN giggles.  JULIA looks bored, she casts a glance over
           at the WORKMEN, see's them look at her, fancy her.  Finally
           a smile.  JOHN - demeaned.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        So..Where was I?

                                 JULIA
                        What?

                                 JOHN
                        Where was I when you met Twitchy?

           JULIA, face drops, fidgets around for fags.

                                 JULIA
                        You were with me.

                                 JOHN
                        So I was with you before Twitchy,
                        then, suddenly - I wasn't.

                                 JULIA
                        There are things you don't know.

                                 JOHN
                        Tell me them then.

           JULIA goes all quiet.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        C'mon!

           She begins to fill up.

                                 JULIA
                        It's hard all this....

                                 JOHN
                        Really?  Who for?

                                 JULIA
                           (crying)
                        You hate me.  I don't blame you. 
                        I just bring pain and misery -
                        that's what you get with me.

           JOHN - his mothers tears the last thing he wants to see.

                                 JOHN
                        Don't cry..

           He grabs her hand.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        Please don't....I'm sorry.
           JULIA wipes the tears away (a sense of her playing him). 
           They clasp hands tight.  A WAITRESS bring a pot of tea
           over.  JULIA - goes all giddy.

                                 JULIA
                        This tea's great in here.  Strong. 
                        Proper Irish!

           She starts pouring at the same time offers JOHN a fag.  He
           takes it.  Smokes.  His anger subsided...for now.

           EXT. PRIMARY SCHOOL PLAYGROUND -- DAY

           JOHN waiting with JULIA.  MOTHERS stood around, some cast
           unsavoury glances.  JULIA more than aware of it.

                                 JACKIE/JULIA JR
                        John!  John!

           JULIA JR and JACKIE come running out - head straight for
           JOHN, who picks them both up and spins them around.

                                 JOHN
                        Where's those smelly school bins? 
                        I've got some rubbish here.

                                 GIRLS
                           (giggling)
                        No!  No!

           EXT. CHILDREN'S PLAY AREA -- DAY

           JOHN and JULIA pushing THE GIRLS on swings.  Higher and
           higher.

           JUMP CUT TO - them racing across the park to the ROUNDABOUT,
           giggling and laughing.  They all jump on board as JOHN
           pushes them round, fast.  Finally he stands back and
           watches.

           JOHN watching JULIA laugh and joke with THE GIRLS - his
           smile fades.

                                 JOHN
                        I'm going.

                                 JULIA
                        Where?

                                 JOHN
                           (backing off)
                        ...got to.

           JOHN almost sprints out of the play area - head done in. 
           JULIA keeping a brave face on for THE GIRLS.

           EXT. CALDERSTONES PARK -- DAY

           JOHN walking through the park, head of steam.  Reveal MARIE
           KENNEDY and GIRLFRIENDS (from the Girls School) sat on a
           park bench - smoking.
                                 MARIE
                           (to John)
                        Here he comes.  The prize dick.

           JOHN forcibly whips her up from the bench, almost on the
           move.

                                 MARIE (CONT'D)
                        What y'doing?

                                 JOHN
                        Fancy a quick chat that's all.

                                                           CUT TO:

           A EXT. CALDERSTONES PARK -- MOMENTS LATER

           A deserted corner of the  park.

           JOHN pins MARIE to a tree, mouths engage fully open, his
           pelvis bodyslams into hers.  It's all mutual, MARIE finding
           the energy hot.  Then JOHN forces her blazer off, hands
           gripping her breasts.

                                 MARIE
                        Ow.

           They carry on - the discomfort beginning to show on MARIE's
           face.  Buttons on her blouse are ripped off, JOHN buries
           his head into her chest....then he slows down, nuzzling
           his head in her bosom.  Resting.

           Then bites.  Hard.

                                 MARIE (CONT'D)
                        OW!

           MARIE throws JOHN off.  Her eyes water with the pain.

                                 MARIE (CONT'D)
                        You bit me!

                                 JOHN
                        A love bite.

           MARIE quickly does herself up.

                                 MARIE
                        Y'fucking weirdo!

           JOHN hangs his head in shame.  She speedily sets back off
           ot her friends.

                                 JOHN
                        Marie...I'm....I'm sorry.

           She doesn't turn back.

           INT. QUARRY BANK SCHOOL/CLASSROOM -- DAY

           Next day.
           A sad looking JOHN in Chemistry, safety goggles - staring
           into a bunsen burner flame.  PETE nudges him to look out
           of the window.  POV: MIMI striding across the empty
           playground.

           INT. QUARRYBANK SCHOOL/HEADMASTERS OFFICE -- DAY

           MIMI opposite a grave faced POBJOY.

                                 POBJOY
                           (looks at a list)
                        Truancy, five times this month,
                        six including yesterday afternoon. 
                        Caning is a badge of honour,
                        detention no effect.  We're running
                        out if ideas Mrs. Smith.
                           (pause)
                        Is there anything that can be done
                        at home?

           MIMI squints at POBJOY.

                                 MIMI
                        'Home'. 
                           (pause)
                        You think 'home' is a problem here?

                                 POBJOY
                        Well for instance-

                                 MIMI
                           (cuts in)
                        -Home is stable.  Loving. 
                        Disciplined.  Exactly the same as
                        when he left Dovedale Primary to
                        come to this place - the brightest
                        eleven year old in his class I
                        might add.  Then in the four years
                        Quarry Bank has him we get.
                           (looks for word)
                        ..this?  I agree John may be
                        difficult at times, even facetious,
                        but what fifteen year old isn't? 
                        And to infer his scholarly
                        deficiencies are anything else but
                        an exposition of you and your
                        teaching staff's failings is quite
                        frankly ridiculous!

           POBJOY - speechless.

           INT. MENDIPS/MORNING ROOM -- LATER

           Tea-time.  JOHN sat eating EGG AND CHIPS (his favourite). 
           He rolls some chips onto a slice of bread for a chip butty. 
           MIMI comes in - adds more chips to his plate. 

                                 MIMI
                           (can't help herself)
                        Do you have to be so common with
                        your chip sandwiches.
                                 JOHN
                           (mouthful, correcting)
                        'Butties', Mimi.  'Chip butties'.

           She tuts, sits down next to him - watching.

                                 MIMI
                        It's got to stop, John.  This
                        messing about in school.

           JOHN nods nonchalantly.  Finishes his butty - goes to carry
           on eating but MIMI takes the plate away.  MIMI fixes him
           with her eyes. 

                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        When you've been through university,
                        settled into a good job, dentistry
                        for example.  You'll thank me then. 
                        But right now you're going nowhere,
                        understand?

                                 JOHN
                        It's been said before.

                                 MIMI
                        Well, it's being said again.  And
                        I want you to promise to sort
                        yourself out.

           JOHN looks her in the eyes.

                                 JOHN
                        OK.  I Promise.

           MIMI gives him his plate back.  JOHN, good at lying. 

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        It'd help if they taught us
                        something worthwhile.

           MIMI takes the plate away again.

                                 MIMI
                        Explain yourself.

                                 JOHN
                           (sarcy)
                        Algebra.  That's handy. 'The
                        Periodic Table', so useful.  Henry
                        the VIIIth, that's why we go to
                        church isn't it?  Coz he couldn't
                        keep it zipped.  All these things
                        I'm sure will come in use in later
                        life.

           MIMI's eyes fire up.  Him being clever with her.  She gets
           up with the plate of food - scrapes it into the bin.

                                 MIMI
                        I'm wasting my breath.
                                 (MORE)
                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        I should have left you where I
                        found you, in the gutter, with
                        people who cared less.  Maybe that's
                        where you should be - in the gutter. 
                        Maybe it's in your blood.
                           (pause)
                        It's certainly nothing to do with
                        me.

           They stare at each other.  THE DOORBELL rings.  Follow
           MIMI as she goes off to answer. 

           A YOUNG GOOD LOOKING MAN

           on the doorstep, 24, well dressed.

                                 FISHWICK
                        Hello-

                                 MIMI
                        Not today.

           MIMI slams the door shut.  JOHN heading towards her.

                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        Where are you going?

           JOHN opens the front door, (FISHWICK still standing there).

                                 JOHN
                        Pete's.

           He walks off down the path.

                                 MIMI
                        Have you done your home-work?

           JOHN keeps walking away.  MIMI fuming.  Her eyes cast
           themselves on FISHWICK.

                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        I told you - not today!

                                 FISHWICK
                        Er...
                           (holds up a paper)
                        I've come about the advert?  For a
                        lodger?

                                 MIMI
                        Oh.  Right.

                                 FISHWICK
                           (holds his hand out)
                        Michael Fishwick.

           MIMI looks him up and down.

                                 MIMI
                        What do you do?
                                 FISHWICK
                        I'm a medical student at the
                        University.

                                 MIMI
                        A doctor?

                                 FISHWICK
                        In training.

           MIMI takes the handshake.

                                 MIMI
                           (warmer)
                        Come in.

           EXT. JULIA'S HOUSE -- DAY

           JOHN knocks on the door, expects Julia but BOBBY opens up. 
           He eyes JOHN, steps outside, blocking the door behind him.

                                 BOBBY
                        Listen John, you can't just turn
                        up like this, it doesn't-

                                 JULIA (O.S.)
                        -Who is it?

           JULIA appears - eyes light up at seeing JOHN.  She hugs
           him, no tears, just sheer Joy.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                        My day can't get any better now!

           JOHN smiling, looks up at a concerned BOBBY.

           "ONE TWO THREE O'CLOCK FOUR O'CLOCK ROCK"

           Bill Hayley's 'Rock Around the Clock' strikes up.  The
           track that lit the fuse.  

           EXT. WOOLTON CINEMA -- DAY

           (Track still playing). 

           'BLACKBOARD JUNGLE' up in cinema lights.

           JULIA waiting outside.  JOHN rushes up in school uniform -
           wagging it.  They hug and kiss - rush into the cinema.

           INT. WOOLTON CINEMA -- DAY

           JOHN and JULIA, riveted.  Intercut with snippets from 
           'BLACKBOARD JUNGLE'.

           - Glenn Ford as MR DADIER, his first day as teacher at the
           all-boys North Manual High.  Walking through the playground
           menacingly wolf-whistled by the DELINQUENT BOYS, check
           shirts, drainpipe jeans, slicked-backed haircuts..
           JUMP CUT TO - MR DADIER is beaten-up by his the DELINQUENT
           BOYS in his class.

           JUMP CUT TO - the TOUGH DETECTIVE trying to get Mr DADIER
           to press charges:

                                 TOUGH DETECTIVE
                        "Maybe the kids today are like the
                        rest of the world, mixed up
                        suspicious, scared - I don't know. 
                        But I do know this.  The gang
                        leaders have taken the place of
                        the parents."

           JUMP CUT TO - MR DADIER tries to talk to the CHIEF
           DELINQUENT on the STREET.

                                 DELINQUENT
                        "Do you 'Teach'?  Do you understand? 
                        Y'see, you're in my classroom now. 
                        And I can teach you.  The first
                        lesson is don't butt in, just
                        don't....or you can flunk out of
                        this class for good." 

           JUMP CUT TO - The DELINQUENTS smashing up a WEEDY TEACHER'S
           beloved Jazz records.

                                 DELINQUENT (CONT'D)
                        "What about some Bop, Daddio!" 

           JUMP CUT TO - 'THE END'. 

           'Rock Around The Clock' kicks in again.

           HOUSE LIGHTS come up.  Everyone starts bopping - including
           PETE and JULIA.  JOHN sits still and stares at the screen.

           EXT. WOOLTON CINEMA -- DAY

           JOHN and JULIA come out.

                                 JULIA
                        AM-A-ZING!  Sydney Poitier.  Yumm-
                        eey gorgeous scrumptious!

                                 JOHN
                           (buzzing)
                        We've got to see it again!!  See
                        it again, and, and, slash the
                        fuckin' seats up, yeah?!

                                 JULIA
                           (giggles)
                        I've got a new chopping knife in
                        the kitchen.

           INT. MENDIPS/BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           JOHN looks at himself in the mirror.
           JUMP CUT TO - his hand getting a big splodge of Brylcreem,
           smothering it on his hair.

           CHUCK BERRY launches into 'Roll Over Beethoven' , which
           plays over the following...

           EXT. WOOLTON STREETS -- DAY

           JOHN, hair quiffed in a 'Ducks Arse' - wandering the streets
           with PETE, IVAN, NIGEL and LEN (The future Quarrymen). 
           Going for that delinquent 'Blackboard Jungle' look.

           All smoke and swagger.

           INT. RECORD SHOP -- DAY

           The LADS crammed in one booth, listening to CHUCK.  Nodding
           heads.  Mouthing the words.

           EXT. RECORD SHOP -- DAY

           The LADS pile out.  Further on down the street, JOHN
           produces the CHUCK BERRY record from underneath his shirt,
           he's nicked it to the others delight.

           EXT. SHOPS -- DAY

           The LADS walk past an RSPCA CHARITY BOX.

           JOHN - coolly walks back.  Picks the BOX up - runs off.

           INT. OFF-LICENCE -- DAY

           JOHN buying BOOZE with carefully counted out pennies from
           his charity box haul..

           EXT. CALDERSTONES PARK -- DAY

           The LADS getting pissed in the park.  A GROUP OF GIRLS
           walk by.  JOHN and the others call out trying to catch
           their attention.

           JUMP CUT TO - EVERYONE copping off. 

           JOHN, trying to maneuver himself on top of the GIRL -
           getting a bit heavy, his hand riding up her skirt.  Suddenly
           she thumps him in the head - runs off.

           INT. MENDIPS/JOHN'S BEDROOM -- DAY

           A sexually frustrated, semi-pissed JOHN falls back in bed. 
           Looks up at BARDOT. 

           He closes his eyes and suddenly the poster is finished in
           his imagination!  She smiles down at him, sexy, wanting
           it.

           TIGHT on JOHN's face - a smile.  A wanking smile.

           And it doesn't take long.
           As JOHN orgasms, CHUCK BERRY MUSIC STOPS.

           He opens his eyes - sees a HORRIFIED MIMI staring down at
           him.

           EXT. MENDIPS/BACK GARDEN -- DAY

           JOHN lighting a small bin fire - looks back to the kitchen -
           MIMI watching.  Slowly he starts burning all his posters. 
           Punishment.

         100 INT. MENDIPS/KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS

           FISHWICK wanders in with some dirty plates.

                                 FISHWICK
                           (of John)
                        Pagan ritual?

                                 MIMI
                        You could say that.

           POV: JOHN kisses a piece of Bardot before throwing her on
           the fire.

                                 FISHWICK
                        Even Bardot?

                                 MIMI
                        Who?

                                 FISHWICK
                        She's a movie star.

                                 MIMI
                        I'm strictly theatre.

                                 FISHWICK
                           (pause)
                        What's he done?

           MIMI looks at him - a slight grin behind her eyes.

                                 MIMI
                        He's been a filthy boy.

           FISHWICK works it out.

                                 FISHWICK
                        ...seems a bit harsh.

                                 MIMI
                        Michael, your one pound three
                        shillings a week are for food and
                        lodgings.  Opinions and comments
                        are not included.

                                 FISHWICK
                        I do beg your pardon, Mrs. Smith. 
                        It won't happen again.
           MIMI quite liking the lip.

                                 MIMI
                        Fifteen year old boys have such
                        filthy minds.

                                 FISHWICK
                        "The Lady doth protest too much me
                        thinks". 

           MIMI witheringly fixes FISHWICK.

                                 FISHWICK (CONT'D)
                           (stuttering)
                        I didn't mean....I mean I wasn't-

           MIMI walks off.

           FISHWICK - kicking himself for taking it too far.

         101 INT. MENDIPS/JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           JOHN sat at his desk, DRAWING HIS CHARACTERS.  Door open. 
           FISHWICK wanders in.

                                 FISHWICK
                           (small talk)
                        Your Aunt looked all excited for
                        her trip to the theatre.

           JOHN ignores him.

                                 FISHWICK (CONT'D)
                        You like drawing then?

                                 JOHN
                        Clever.  You must go to University.

           Beat.

                                 FISHWICK
                        What is it?

                                 JOHN
                        A big fat ugly thing.  With warts.

           FISHWICK hovers.  JOHN looks up - studies FISHWICK.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        Like the smell of lavender do you
                        ducky? 

                                 FISHWICK
                           (pause)
                        I've got some pictures in my room
                        I think you'd like to see.

                                 JOHN
                        Come on.  You can do better than
                        that. It's supposed to be
                        sweets...or puppies.
                                 FISHWICK
                        No..only pictures..
                           (walks off)
                        ..of naked birds.

           FISHWICK walks into his room, leaves the door open - knows
           this will hook JOHN.  And it does.

         102 INT. MENDIPS/FISHWICK'S ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           FISHWICK lieing on his bed, a pile of 'PARADE' MAGS next
           to him.  He nonchalantly flicks through a copy.

           JOHN cranes his neck round the door.  Curious.

           FISHWICK (without looking up) takes a MAG off the pile -
           tosses it towards JOHN.

           JOHN takes the bait, sits down, opens it up like a treasure
           box - his eyes grow wide, mouth drops open.  Looks over at
           FISHWICK who's still ogling his own copy.  Looking cool.

                                 FISHWICK
                        Try page 52.  Vanda Hudson.

           JOHN does so - his tongue drops out, looks over at the
           pile.

                                 JOHN
                        How many of these have you got?

                                 FISHWICK
                        Twenty-two.

           JOHN nods with respect.

                                 FISHWICK (CONT'D)
                        I should get rid of a few, but..
                           (shrugs)
                        ...you get attached.

                                 JOHN
                        Can I borrow this?

                                 FISHWICK
                        No.

                                 JOHN
                        Why?

                                 FISHWICK
                        You'll only sell it once you've
                        had your fun.  Or lie to me that
                        you've lost it - or the dog's ate
                        it.

           JOHN - impressed FISHWICK could read him.

                                 JOHN
                        OK...I promise I won't let the dog
                        eat it.
                                 FISHWICK
                           (laughs)
                        Careful with her!  Me and
                        Vanda..it's a special thing.  She's
                        not like the other girls.

                                 JOHN
                        She's got bigger baps for a start.

           JOHN looks at FISHWICK - really appreciative.  But also
           with respect - something he doesn't often feel for his
           elders.

                                 FISHWICK
                        Enjoy.

           JOHN smiles - starts to leave.

                                 FISHWICK (CONT'D)
                        And John, if you ever want to
                        talk...y'know...just knock on.

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah?  What about?

                                 FISHWICK
                        Stuff..
                           (pause)
                        Life.

           FISHWICK trying to let him know that he knows.  JOHN studies
           him.

                                 JOHN
                        What do you know about life?  You're
                        a student.

           JOHN flashes a smile and wink - leaves.  FISHWICK - made a
           connection.

         103 INT. MENDIPS/JOHN'S BEDROOM -- LATER

           JOHN in bed, SPECS on, reading PARADE - one of the motoring
           articles.  Crumpled WANK TISSUES on his bed-side cabinet
           testament to a good time spent.

         104 EXT. MENDIPS -- CONTINUOUS

           MIMI walking across Menlove Avenue (the same stretch where
           John was nearly knocked over).  A CAR whizzes by.  There's
           a couple of sherry's worth of smile on her face.

           MENDIPS

           John's BEDROOM LIGHT still on.  It shouldn't be.

         105 INT. MENDIPS/JOHN'S BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           JOHN reading PARADE, suddenly hears the key rustling in
           the front door.
         106 EXT. MENDIPS -- CONTINUOUS

           MIMI having a little difficult finding the key-hole.

         107 INT. MENDIPS/JOHN'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           JOHN throws the mag under the bed, grabs 'Lord Of The
           Rings', lies it on his chest, pretends to be asleep.

         108 INT. MENDIPS/JOHN'S BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           MIMI comes in.  Stands over JOHN - face relaxed, full of
           love - the alcohol forcing her guard down.

           She gently brushes JOHN's hair, leans down - kisses him
           softly on the cheek - like a proud mother.

           She clears the WANK TISSUES, innocently believing them to
           be SNOTRAGS, then backs out of the room, turning the light
           off and closing the door.

           Beat.

           JOHN's eyes flick open - not used to that kind of Mimi
           affection...strange.

         109 EXT./INT. BUS -- DAY

           AN ELDERLY LADY

           sat minding her own business.  JOHN wanders down the aisle. 
           PETE hovers near the stairs, cheeky grin. A BUS CONDUCTOR
           eyes them suspiciously - well aware they're trouble makers.

                                 JOHN
                        This seat taken madam?

                                 ELDERLY LADY
                           (smiles)
                        No.

           JOHN sits in.

                                 JOHN
                        Lovely morning.

                                 ELDERLY LADY
                        Yes it is.

                                 JOHN
                        Although I've heard it's rain
                        Thursday.

                                 ELDERLY LADY
                        Oh dear.

           JOHN gets the PARADE mag out - nonchalantly starts flicking
           through the porn pictures.  At first the LADY is unaware.

                                 JOHN
                        I hope you don't mind me asking...
           Shows her VANDA.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        Did your tits ever look like these?

         110 INT. QUARRYBANK SCHOOL/HEADMASTERS OFFICE -- LATER

           THE BAMBOO CANE whips down.  JOHN and PETE stick their
           stinging hands under their armpits.  POBJOY walks back to
           his desk.  Infront of him lies the copy of PARADE.

                                 POBJOY
                        Would you have shown pornography
                        to your Aunt on public transport?

           JOHN doesn't answer.

                                 POBJOY (CONT'D)
                        I think you're cowards.  Both of
                        you - cowards and bullies.  And as
                        you obviously don't care about
                        this school and it's reputation -
                        it seems only fair that Quarry
                        Bank shouldn't have to care about
                        you.
                           (pause)
                        You're both suspended for a week.

           JOHN and PETE look worried. 

                                 POBJOY (CONT'D)
                        The school secretary has letters
                        for you to collect and give your
                        parents.
                           (rubbing it in)
                        Or Aunt in your case Lennon.

           Beat.

                                 POBJOY (CONT'D)
                        Anything to say for yourselves?

           Beat.

                                 JOHN
                           (can't help himself)
                        Any chance I can have the magazine
                        back-

                                 POBJOY
                        OUT!

           The LADS leave. 

           POBJOY opens his bottom drawer (again), takes a slug of
           whiskey, puts his feet on the desk, starts flicking through
           the Mag.

           Nods his head in approval at Vanda.
         111 EXT. QUARRY BANK SCHOOL -- MOMENTS LATER

           JOHN and PETE walking across an empty playground, reading
           their suspension letters.

                                 PETE
                        I'm dead.  I'd like to think I'll
                        live.  But, no.

                                 JOHN
                        And your parents are nice.  What's
                        Mimi's gonna do?

         112 EXT. MENDIPS -- MORNING

           JOHN leaving for school like normal, no Pete waiting, MIMI
           knocks on the window.

                                 MIMI
                           (through glass)
                        Where's Peter?

                                 JOHN
                        Sick.

         113 EXT. JULIA'S HOUSE -- LATER

           JOHN - knocks on.  JULIA answers in her dressing gown - a
           manic look in her eye. 

         114 INT. JULIA'S HOUSE -- DAY

           THE SUSPENSION LETTER ripped, floating lazily to the bottom
           of the bin (slo-mo).  The QUARRY BANK emblum sawed in two. 

           JULIA takes JOHN by the hand - sits him down by the
           GRAMAPHONE,  kneels infront of him, strokes his hair, runs
           her hands down the contours of his face.

                                 JULIA
                        Oh John!  He's here!  He's come
                        back!

                                 JOHN
                           (nervy)
                        Who?

           JULIA holds his eyes

                                 JULIA
                        Jesus.

           She turns to the gramaphone.  Puts the needle on a record.  
           ELVIS launches into 'Heartbreak Hotel'.

                                 ELVIS
                        "Well since my baby left me, I
                        found a new place to dwell, It's
                        down at the end of a lonely street
                        at,
                                 (MORE)
                                 ELVIS (CONT'D)
                           (pause)
                        Heartbreak Hotel... 

           JULIA gyrates, like the devil being spurned from her body.

           JOHN -  Jesus is talking to him.

                                 ELVIS (CONT'D)
                        "You make me so lonely baby, I get
                        so lonely, I get so lonely I could
                        die..." 

           JULIA thrusts the album sleeve into JOHN's hands. 

           THE FIRST PICTURE OF ELVIS PRESLEY

           Eyes closed, mouth open, guitar slung, on the RCA VICTOR
           ALBUM - you couldn't get a more arresting picture of a
           Rock'n'Roller - timeless.

           ELVIS plays over the following....

           (The idea being both Springwood and Mendips are Heartbreak
           Hotels for John.  Track only 2:10 long). 

         115 INT. WOOLTON CINEMA -- LATER

           ELVIS being shown on PATHE NEWS - storming and sexing up
           the world.  GIRLS screaming at the screen - including JULIA.

           JOHN notes the effect this guy is has on the female sex
           (especially his Mother).

         116 EXT. MARKET STALL -- DAY

           JULIA buying JOHN rock'n'roll clothes.  Checked shirts,
           drainpipe jeans. 

           TEDDY BOYS close by, also buying gear - a whole new fashion
           and youth culture kicking in.

         117 INT. JULIA'S HOUSE -- LATER

           JULIA teaching JOHN more BANJO chords.  JOHN can't quite
           make it with his fingers.  JULIA decides to sit behind
           him, puts her fingers on his, making sure he hits the right
           strings.

         118 EXT. MENDIPS -- MOMENTS LATER

           JOHN rolls up to the gate, back in his uniform - looks at
           MENDIPS.

           Doesn't really want to go in - another Heartbreak Hotel.

         119 EXT. MENDIPS -- NIGHT

           MIMI in the front room - book on her lap, staring out of
           the window.  Lonely.
           Crane up

           JOHN - in his pyjamas.  Staring out.  Lonely.

         120 EXT. JULIA'S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

           High and Wide.

           An excited JOHN sprinting down Julia's street.

         121 INT. JULIA'S HOUSE -- LATER

           JULIA on PIANO, JOHN strumming the BANJO.  Making music. 

           JOHN's first band.

         122 INT. JULIA'S HOUSE -- LATER

           JOHN and JULIA practicing the Jive.  JOHN - two left feet,
           much to the amusement of them both.

           JOHN picks up the picture of ELVIS - stares at the GUITAR. 
           Looks up at JULIA.

         123 INT. CITY CENTRE/HESSY'S MUSIC SHOP -- MOMENTS LATER

           JOHN strumming a NEW GUITAR in the background as JULIA
           hands over some money and signs on the 'never never'.

         124 INT. JULIA'S HOUSE -- LATER

           JOHN playing the GUITAR - doing an Elvis impression.  JULIA
           clapping along.

         125 EXT. MENDIPS/BACK GARDEN -- CONTINUOUS

           JOHN sat in his tree-house watching MIMI inside - not
           wanting to go in.

           'Heartbreak Hotel' ends.

         126 INT. MENDIPS/HALLWAY -- DAY

           MIMI answers the telephone.

                                 MIMI
                        Woolton 2189.

         127 INT. QUARRY BANK SCHOOL/HEADMASTERS OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

           POBJOY on the other end.

                                 POBJOY
                        Mrs. Smith, Mr. Pobjoy here.  John's
                        headmaster.

           Intercut.
                                 MIMI
                           (sighs)
                        Yes, I'm aware of who you are. 
                        What's he done now?

           Stay on MIMI's face as she realises John is suspended.

         128 INT. PETE'S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

           PETE watching adverts on TELLY.  Suddenly MIMI and his MUM
           march in the room and stand infront of him.

                                 MIMI
                        Where!?

           PETE - crumbling

         129 INT. JULIA'S HOUSE -- LATER

           'That'll Be The Day' by BUDDY HOLLY on the gramaphone -
           slowed right down so JOHN and JULIA have a chance to jam
           along.  The song three-quarters through when JULIA freezes. 
           POV: MIMI standing at the front-door (which was open).

                                 JOHN
                           (unaware)
                        C'mon you're missing the beat here.

           He follows her eyeline.  MIMI flicks her eyes into his. 
           He looks back at JULIA.  She starts to nervously fidget. 
           BUDDY HOLLY drones on eerily...

                                 BUDDY
                        "That'll be the day that I die" 

           ..then stops.

           MIMI strides across the room, JULIA instinctively stands. 
           Fear.  MIMI's eyes boring into JULIA's soul.

           SLAP! 

           JULIA yelps, holds the side of her face, hyperventilating. 
           JOHN - indecisive.  Confused.

                                 MIMI
                        You know he's suspended?

                                 JULIA
                        Yes Mimi.

           SLAP! 

                                 JOHN
                        Stop!

           Her withering look shuts him up.  MIMI looks around the
           house with disgust.
                                 MIMI
                           (to Julia)
                        This is why.  Look at it.  This is
                        your life Julia.  Just one, big,
                        common mess.
                           (pause)
                        You may have disgraced yourself
                        and the family.  But you won't
                        disgrace him.  Not as long as I
                        live you won't.

           MIMI grabs JOHN's wrist - the guitar twangs to the floor. 
           He half complies - then yanks his arm free.

                                 JOHN
                        No.

           MIMI turns to JOHN - it's he who looks guilty (the power
           of this woman).

                                 MIMI
                        John!

           JOHN shakes his head, mustering all the courage he can.

                                 JOHN
                        I want to stay here, with Mum.

           JOHN looks to JULIA for support - she avoids him.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        Mum?

           JULIA nervously reaches for her fags - sparks up.  Her
           back towards JOHN.

                                 JULIA
                        Mimi's right.  You shouldn't be
                        here if you've been suspended. 
                        I've been naughty.

           JOHN stares at the back of her head.  She turns round -
           tears in her eyes, shaking, but trying to smile.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                        It's OK...Mimi will look after
                        you...really.

           JOHN realises he's being let go - again.  He picks the
           guitar from the floor, wanders out of the house.

                                 MIMI
                        Leave that thing.

           JOHN ignores her.  MIMI lets him go, save that argument.

                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                           (to Julia)
                        Why are you doing this to him?

           JULIA bows her head.  MIMI leaves, slamming the door.
           JULIA sits down smoking, mumbling - distressed.  Looks at
           her lit fag, holds her palm out - and burns herself.

         130 EXT. JULIA'S HOUSE -- LATER

           It's raining hard.  BOBBY (home from lunch hour shift)
           pulls up in his car.  POV: JULIA sat outside the front
           door on a kitchen chair - drenched - head in her hands.

           BOBBY knows it's bad, seen this before - rushes up.

                                 BOBBY
                           (soothing)
                        Julia, Julia luv what are you doing? 
                        You can't be sat out here.

           Beat.

                                 JULIA
                           (through sobs)
                        She came and took him.  And I let
                        her.

                                 BOBBY
                        Who did?

                                 JULIA
                        Mimi.

                                 BOBBY
                           (angry)
                        I told you-Fuckin' John-!  _

           Contains it.

                                 BOBBY (CONT'D)
                        Where are the girls?

           JULIA suddenly bolts up right.

                                 JULIA
                        School.

                                 BOBBY
                        Jesus Christ, Julia it's four
                        'O'clock!

           BOBBY sprints off back to the car.  JULIA watches him zoom
           off - in a daze.

         131 INT. JULIA'S HOUSE -- LATER

           JULIA - changed into dry clothes, towel dried hair, cooking
           eggs in the kitchen.  BOBBY returns with JULIA JR and JACKIE
           from school.

           JULIA rushes over all smiles.

                                 JULIA
                        There they are!
           She grabs them in a hug.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                           (baby voice)
                        How silly was Mummy?  Forgetting
                        her girls at school.

           THE GIRLS giggle.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                        Give Mummy a slap.  Naughty Mummy

           JULIA hold her hand out to be slapped, THE GIRLS oblige. 
           BOBBY clocks the cig burn on her palm.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                        Cheesy omelets for tea, go wash
                        your hands.

           The GIRLS go off.  JULIA tries to avoid BOBBY, he grabs
           her by the arm, makes her look at him.

                                 BOBBY
                        John's visits have to stop.

                                 JULIA
                        Nonono..

                                 BOBBY
                        That's why he's not in our lives,
                        it's the only way...

                                 JULIA
                        No.

                                 BOBBY
                        I don't want to lose you again
                        Julia.

                                 JULIA
                        NO!

           JULIA calms.  Smiles.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                        Don't you see?  It's too
                        late....he's here.  No-one can
                        make him go away anymore.

           JULIA heads off in to the kitchen to THE GIRLS.  BOBBY
           looking on - helpless and worried.

         132 INT. SHABBY TOWN-HOUSE (RECURRING DREAM) -- DAY

           5YR OLD JOHN wailing at the front-door.  Tears streaming
           down his face.  Beyond hysteria.

                                 5YR OLD JOHN
                        Mummmeeeyy!!

           He tugs at the handle with all his might.
                                 5YR OLD JOHN (CONT'D)
                        MUMMEEEEEY!!!

           But it never opens.

         133 INT. MENDIPS/JOHN'S BEDROOM -- MORNING

           JOHN flicks his eyes open from the dream.  Feels his cheeks,
           wet with tears.

         134 INT. MENDIPS/MORNING ROOM/KITCHEN -- LATER

           MIMI, staring out the window, smoking hardly slept.  Worry. 
           JOHN appears in the doorway.  He avoids eye-contact. 
           They've not spoken.

                                 MIMI
                        Any more lies I should know about?

                                 JOHN
                        I want to see her.

           MIMI takes a deep breath.  This hurts.

                                 MIMI
                        You don't know her.

                                 JOHN
                        It's not a question.

                                 MIMI
                        You're in my house.

                                 JOHN
                        Then I'll leave.  Find a job.

                                 MIMI
                        With no qualifications?

                                 JOHN
                        Dockers don't need 'O' levels.

           JOHN's trump card - and they both know it.

                                 MIMI
                        She'll hurt you.

                                 JOHN
                           (shrugs)
                        Maybe.

           JOHN - aware she hasn't said no.  MIMI seeing a more mature
           JOHN, making his own decisions.

                                 MIMI
                        Sit down.  I'll make you breakfast.

           MIMI heads into the kitchen - takes a moment on her own -
           she's been faced down for the first time.

           JOHN picks up the guitar, stood in the corner - strums it.
                                 MIMI (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        One of Julia's toys I take it. 
                        The guitar.

           The first time she's ever mentioned Julia by name not lost
           on JOHN.

                                 JOHN
                        I'm gonna start a band.

                                 MIMI
                           (suspicious)
                        Really.

                                 JOHN
                        ...like Elvis.

                                 MIMI
                           (sighs)
                        The devil's music they're calling
                        it.

           MIMI pops her head round from the kitchen.

                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        Exams soon too.  Let's try and
                        find some time for those shall we?

           She holds her stare.  JOHN manages a meek nod.

           Almost like normal.

                                                          FADE OUT:

           Fade In:

         135 EXT. ST.PETER'S CHURCH -- DAY

           The sun shining like good news.

           Hear the BRASS BAND of the CHESHIRE YEOMANRY. 

           TITLE CARD: 6TH JULY 1957 

         136 EXT. ST. PETERS CHURCH FIELDS -- LATER

           Bunting and balloons. STALLS and SIDE-SHOWS manned by
           BROWNIES, CUBS, SCOUTS and GUIDES.  CHILDREN in FANCY DRESS
           mix with MORRIS DANCERS.  POLICE DOGS doing obedience
           displays. PLENTY OF GOOD-LOOKING GIRLS.

           MIMI takes tea in the REFRESHMENTS MARQUEE with other CHURCH
           ELDERS.

         137 EXT. ST. PETERS CHURCH FIELDS -- CONTINUOUS

           JOHN and THE QUARRYMEN gathered round the back of their
           LORRY which is also their make-shift stage for the gig.

           JOHN downs a bottle of beer, chucks it with the other
           empties.  Nicks PETE's fag - drags on it.
                                 JOHN
                        Right then.  Are we ready to do
                        this boys?

           There are mumbles of "yeah".

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        Fuck me.  I said, ARE WE READY TO
                        DO THIS?!

                                 QUARRYMEN
                        YEAH!

                                 JOHN
                           (sarcy)
                        OK Calm down.

         138 EXT. ST. PETERS CHURCH FIELDS/FLAT-BED LORRY -- MOMENTS
           LATER

           THE QUARRYMEN take up their positions.  JOHN at the front.

           PEOPLE waiting for the gig, including JULIA and THE GIRLS. 
           JULIA whistles with her fingers.

                                 JOHN
                        Afternoon folks.  Tea mugs down. 
                        Stuff the cake in your cake-holes. 
                        Hide your daughters with your
                        precious stones. COZ WE ARE THE
                        QUARRYMEN!

           JOHN scans the field - a genteel picture of Englishness.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                           (to the band)
                        Maggie May.

           They launch into this track about the famous Liverpool
           prostitute.

           JOHN loving singing this, as CHURCH PEOPLE cross in the
           background oblivious.

         139 INT. TEA-TENT -- CONTINUOUS

           MIMI having tea, hears the band's noise from outside. 
           Spots YOUNGSTERS who are supposed to be serving, excitedly
           run out.

           Curious she follows them.

         140 EXT. ST. PETERS CHURCH FIELDS -- CONTINUOUS

           MIMI

           making her way down to where the band are playing.  Slowly
           but surely she recognises the voice - then as she nears,
           JOHN comes into focus. 

           The first time THE QUARRYMEN have become a reality to her.
           JOHN

           spots MIMI.  His expression changes.  Worry.  Then he lets
           it all go in the song.  Making up lyrics about MIMI coming
           down the path.

           JULIA

           hearing these lyrics she looks over, finds MIMI stood
           watching.

           MIMI

           can't take her eyes off JOHN.  Poker faced.

           'Maggie May' comes to an end.  Huge applause. 

           JOHN

           his eyes only on MIMI.  She nods her head at him - politely.

                                 JOHN
                        Cheers.....Maggie May - out of my
                        price range.

           MIMI and JULIA

           finally find each other through the crowd.  JULIA
           smiles...MIMI returns it, fleetingly.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                           (to the band)
                        Next one's by the Del
                        Vykings...'Come Go With Me'.

           THE QUARRYMEN launches into 'Come Go With Me'.

         141 EXT. ST. PETERS CHURCH FIELDS -- CONTINUOUS

           IVAN VAUGHN jogs across the field with a baby faced, quiffed
           up 15 year old in a white sports jacket and pink carnation -
           this is PAUL McCARTNEY (you may have heard of him).

                                 IVAN
                        Shiite!  They've started!

           They hit the periphery of the CROWD watching.

                                 IVAN (CONT'D)
                           (excited)
                        That's Lennon..Johnny Boy..top
                        nutter bastard.  He can batter
                        Jimmy Tarbuck y'know.

           PAUL

           studying JOHN, like a trainspotter.  How he plays the
           guitar, holds it, how he sings - connects with the crowd.

                                 IVAN (CONT'D)
                        Not bad eh Paul? 
           Big Beat.

                                 PAUL
                        His guitar's cheap.....and he's
                        making the words up.

                                 IVAN
                        Yeah?

                                 PAUL MCCARTNEY
                        It's not "down by the penitentiary"
                        it's "don't send me way beyond the
                        sea".

           IVAN fearing PAUL doesn't think much of JOHN.

                                 PAUL MCCARTNEY (CONT'D)
                           (smiles)
                        John's lyrics are more hip than
                        the Del Vykings.

           IVAN, relieved.

           HIGH and WIDE

           JOHN on stage, JULIA and MIMI on either flank.  And now
           PAUL in the middle.

         142 INT. ST. PETERS CHURCH HALL -- LATER

           THE QUARRYMEN taken over the empty hall, hanging-out for
           their evening gig.  JOHN and PETE still drinking.

           IVAN and PAUL walk in.  No-one really notices.

                                 IVAN
                        Everyone! Paul,  mate of mine from
                        school.

           No-one looks up.  PAUL doesn't look that bothered.

                                 IVAN (CONT'D)
                        Paul plays too.

                                 JOHN
                        With himself?

           Guffaws from the OTHERS. 

           JOHN

           looks at PAUL for the first time.  Thinks he looks a bit
           like Elvis - intrigued.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                           (gets up)
                        I'm John.

                                 PAUL
                        Hello.
                                 JOHN
                        Wanna a beer?

                                 PAUL
                        Tea?

                                 JOHN
                        All out of tea.  Did you watch us
                        play?

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah.

                                 JOHN
                        And?

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah.

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah what?

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah, you were alright.

           JOHN looks through his beer goggles at PAUL - 'alright'? -
           Cheeky bastard.

                                 JOHN
                        We're 'alright'.  You're 'alright',
                        well Ivan likes you, and Ivan's
                        'alright'.

           JOHN hands him his guitar.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        How 'alright' are you on one of
                        these?

           Beat.

                                 PAUL
                           (shrugs)
                        Alright.

           PAUL takes the guitar - immediately flips it over showing
           his left-hand status.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                           (dismissive)
                        I've got a Zenith.

                                 JOHN
                        Good for you.

           Strums it once.

                                 PAUL
                        Out of tune.
                                 JOHN
                        I normally take it to this bloke-

                                 PAUL
                           (cuts in)
                        Want me to do it?

           JOHN holds his hands out to say 'be my guest'.

           PAUL wanders over to the PIANO - starts tuning the guitar. 
           JOHN and THE QUARRYMEN sit up and notice.  None of them
           can do this.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                           (finishing tuning)
                        Any requests?

                                 JOHN
                        Beethovens 5th?

           Half smiles.

           PAUL

           launches into 'Twenty Flight Rock' by Eddie Cochran  - a
           virtuoso performance, knows the words perfectly, a great
           USA accent and PLUS he's playing the guitar upside-down! 

           Mid song heecomes aware of beery breath.  A quick look,
           sees JOHN (shortsighted) studying the way his fingers hit
           the chords.  JOHN gives him one of 'those' quick Lennon
           smiles.

           PAUL finishes.

           EVERYONE impressed.  Except JOHN, (who is impressed, but
           not showing it).  He circles PAUL, takes his guitar back.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        'Alright' that.

                                 PAUL
                        Cheers.

                                 JOHN
                        How old are you?

                                 PAUL
                        Fifteen.

                                 JOHN
                        When?

                                 PAUL
                        Last month.

           JOHN takes this in.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        I can do Little Richard-
                                 JOHN
                        -Sorry.  Tick-tock.  Nice to meet
                        you and all, but we need to rehearse
                        for tonight...so...gonna have to
                        kick you out...

                                 PAUL
                           (slightly ruffled)
                        I've got to get off home anyway.

                                 JOHN
                        Ta Ta then.

           PAUL and IVAN leave.  JOHN coolly sits next to PETE - opens
           another bottle of beer.

           THE QUARRYMEN stare at JOHN in disbelief.

         143 INT. MENDIPS/MORNING ROOM -- NIGHT

           MIMI listening to the radio with FISHWICK.  JOHN comes in
           from the evening gig, not sure what MIMI will say.  FISHWICK
           makes his excuses, gives JOHN a sly wink before heading
           off upstairs.

                                 MIMI
                        You and this band, The Quarryboys.

                                 JOHN
                        'Quarry-men'.

                                 MIMI
                           (ignores him)
                        You said you were just messing
                        about.

                                 JOHN
                        We are.

                                 MIMI
                        That wasn't messing about out. 
                        That was getting up on stage -
                        performing.

                                 JOHN
                        That's what you do when you're in
                        a band.

                                 MIMI
                        Don't be sarcastic John.

                                 JOHN
                           (pause)
                        Did you like it?

                                 MIMI
                        Not my kind of music...but you,
                        you were good up there.  Stood
                        out.

           JOHN - A compliment!
                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        But remember, it's just a hobby,
                        you won't make a living from it.

                                 JOHN
                        Please remind me if I forget Mimi.

                                 MIMI
                        Sarcasm. Again.

           JOHN's heads off upstairs.

                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        John...

           JOHN turns back.

                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        You and your Quarryboy friends can
                        practice here if you like?

           This is a big deal for MIMI to say - JOHN knows it.

                                 JOHN
                           (pause)
                        Cheers Mimi.

                                 MIMI
                        'Cheers'. Since when do I get
                        'cheers'?

           JOHN smiles, heads off upstairs.  MIMI - trying hard to
           help JOHN, despite herself.

         144 EXT. ALLERTON GOLF COURSE -- DAY

           PAUL riding his bike over the course - hears a shout.

                                 PETE (O.S.)
                        Paul!

           PAUL stops, sees PETE frantically pedaling after him. 
           PETE catches him up.

                                 PETE (CONT'D)
                           (out of breath)
                        I saw you...and...
                           (blows out)
                        ..anyway...you OK?

                                 PAUL
                        Not bad.  How'd the gig go?

                                 PETE
                        Good, yeah.  Thanks.  Anyway John
                        was thinking,
                           (deep breath)
                        About you, and stuff, and was
                        wondering if maybe you'd like to
                        join up...like join The Quarry
                        Men.
                                 PAUL
                        John asked you to ask me?

                                 PETE
                        Well he put the word out.  First
                        person to see you - ask.  So...here
                        I am.

           PAUL thinks.

           And thinks.

                                 PAUL
                        Y'sure?

                                 PETE
                        Yeah.  We all want you in.

           Beat.

                                 PAUL
                           (like it's a bind)
                        Oh, alright then.

                                 PETE
                        Cool!  Really cool!  Nigel's booked
                        us a couple of gigs at the end of
                        the month.  'Childwall Golf Club'
                        and this place called 'The Cavern'.

                                 PAUL
                        Can't do it.

                                 PETE
                        No?

                                 PAUL
                        I'm at scout camp.

                                 PETE
                        You're still in the scouts?

                                 PAUL
                        It's called 'scout' camp.

           PETE nods.

           PAUL cycles off.

                                 PETE
                           (after him)
                        So we'll see you when you get back
                        from scout camp, yeah!?

           PAUL just lifts a thumb into the air as he disappears.

                                                          FADE TO:
         145 INT. MENDIPS/HALLWAY -- DAY

           The doorbell being rung - too keenly for MIMI's liking. 
           Opens up.  PAUL stood on the doorstep, guitar slung over
           his back.

                                 MIMI
                           (sharp)
                        Yes?

                                 PAUL
                           (slightly unnerved)
                        John said I could call round.

                                 MIMI
                        Why?  Who are you?

                                 PAUL
                        Er..Paul and..

           PAUL signals to the guitar.

                                 MIMI
                        Oh.
                           (remembers)
                        Oh yes.
                           (calls up)
                        John!

           JOHN comes down.

                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                           (to Paul)
                        If you have to call - backdoor.

         146 INT. MENDIPS/JOHN'S BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           PAUL and JOHN strapped, sat opposite, their guitar playing
           a mirror image.  PAUL teaching JOHN, friendly and gently,
           some new chords which involve 5th and 6th strings.

           JOHN - every bit the studious learner.

                                 PAUL
                        That's it A7, D7, E7.

           JOHN reciprocates.  Struggles.

                                 JOHN
                        Bollocks.  Hang on a sec.

           He reaches for his glasses puts them on.  PAUL is a bit
           taken back at how uncool he looks.  JOHN notices.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        What?

                                 PAUL
                        Nothing.
                                 JOHN
                        I wear glasses.

                                 PAUL
                        I can see.

                                 JOHN
                        Aren't you the lucky one?

           JOHN has another got at the chords - works.

                                 PAUL
                        Good...now add E major.

           JOHN plays them - the chords for 'Blue Moon' by Elvis...PAUL
           joins in with his guitar.  JOHN starts to sing the song.

           Then as the two get more familiar the beat gets faster and
           faster.  They're feet start stomping the ground.  PAUL
           joins in singing.

         147 INT. MENDIPS/LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           MIMI trying to read but the sound upstairs has shattered
           any peace.  Not only that but the vibrations from the foot
           stomping are shuddering the best China on then shelves to
           the point of wobbling off.

           MIMI launches herself across the room just in time to catch
           two tea-cups that fall off.

                                 MIMI
                        JOHN!!

         148 INT. MENDIPS/PORCH -- MOMENTS LATER

           JOHN and PAUL banished to the porch.  PAUL again showing
           some fancy string work.  JOHN allowing himself to look
           impressed.

                                 JOHN
                        So Mummy's gonna be cool when she
                        finds out Baby Paul wants to be
                        Elvis when he grows up?

                                 PAUL
                        She really wanted me to be a doctor?

                                 JOHN
                        Wanted?  Lost hope now has she?

                                 PAUL
                        No, she's dead.  How about yours?

           It's said matter of fact.  JOHN, not sure what to say about
           PAUL's revelation or how to answer the question.

                                 JOHN
                        Erm...no...she's still alive.
                                 PAUL
                           (smile)
                        I know I've met her.

                                 JOHN
                           (confused)
                        When?

                                 PAUL
                           (whispers of Mimi)
                        Seems pretty strict.

                                 JOHN
                        Er...no, that's my Aunt.

                                 PAUL
                        Oh...right.

           PAUL's not sure to push that one.

                                 JOHN
                        You seem OK with it.

                                 PAUL
                        With what?

                                 JOHN
                        Your Mum...

                                 PAUL
                        Well..She's not here anymore is
                        she?
                           (eyes John)
                        Just got to get on with it.

           JOHN and PAUL nod - similar circumstances.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Y'know what we should do?

                                 JOHN
                           (excited)
                        I've got whiskey upstairs.

                                 PAUL
                        Write our own stuff.

           JOHN nods. Thinking.

                                 JOHN
                        I write stuff.

                                 PAUL
                        Songs?

                                 JOHN
                        Poetry.  Stories.

                                 PAUL
                        Add a tune to those, you get a
                        song.
           JOHN nods, taps his head - wise words.

                                 JOHN
                        You written any?

                                 PAUL
                        A couple. Write your own stuff you
                        don't, get stiffed by record
                        companies...

                                 JOHN
                        Elvis doesn't write his own songs.

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah but Elvis is Elvis.

                                 JOHN
                           (eyes him)
                        Why are you so good at all this?

                                 PAUL
                        What?

                                 JOHN
                        This.  I mean, you don't seem like
                        a rock'n'roll kind of guy.

                                 PAUL
                        I'm not a hooligan if atht's what
                        you mean.

                                 JOHN
                           (sarcy)
                        No really?

           Beat.

                                 PAUL
                        I get it....Rock'n'Roll.

           Beat.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        It's the only thing real to me at
                        the moment.  Do you understand?

           JOHN more than understands.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        I think all that delinquent stuff
                        is immature.

           JOHN - wry smile.

                                 JOHN
                        What?  Fucking things up It's all
                        part of it.. Being a teenager.

                                 PAUL
                        Being a dick.
           They have a small friendly stand-off.

                                 JOHN
                        My Mum taught me 'Ain't That A
                        Shame' - Fats Domino.

                                 PAUL
                        Jeez.  I'd like to meet a mum like
                        that.

                                 JOHN
                        You will.

           JOHN starts playing and singing.  PAUL joins him.  Escaping
           themselves in music.

         149 INT. MENDIPS/KITCHEN -- DAY

           There is rapping on the back-door.  MIMI opens up, once
           again, PAUL.  MIMI can't disguise her distaste for the
           guitar, and PAUL, thinks he's leading JOHN astray.

                                 MIMI
                        John!  Your 'little friend' is
                        here!
                           (to Paul)
                        Again.

           Hear rumbling from upstairs. MIMI hates the guitar on his
           shoulder.

                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        Can't you go fishing?  Like normal
                        boys?

           PAUL has no idea how to respond to this request.

                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        Where do you live?

                                 PAUL
                        Allerton.

                                 MIMI
                        The council estate?

           PAUL nods.

           MIMI shakes her head in disgust at a delightfully innocent
           looking PAUL.

           JOHN comes out guitar strapped to his back.

                                 JOHN
                        Going to Pete's.

           JOHN heads out with PAUL.  They grab bikes.
         150 EXT. VARIOUS STREETS -- MOMENTS LATER

           JOHN and PAUL on bikes, riding and freewheeling together. 
           Guitars on their backs.

                                 PAUL
                           (confused)
                        Pete lives round the corner, yeah?

                                 JOHN
                        You wanted to meet my Mum, yeah?

         151 EXT. PENNY LANE -- MOMENTS LATER

           They ride past The Penny Lane Barbers Shop.

         152 EXT JULIA'S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

           JULIA opens up, sees JOHN and PAUL on her doorstep. 

                                 PAUL
                           (to Julia)
                        Mrs. Lennon.

           Holds his hand out, formal.

                                 JULIA
                        Boom! 
                           (laughs)
                        Blasted from the past!

           JULIA misses the hand - feels PAUL's hips.  Flirty.

                                 PAUL
                        MMmmm, slim hips.
                           (strokes his face)
                        Soft face...and the hair!

           JOHN - taking all this in.

           JULIA leads them in.  THE GIRLS fling themselves over JOHN
           as he exchanges looks with BOBBY reading the paper in the
           kitchen.

                                 JULIA
                        John, have you brought Elvis round
                        to practice?

                                 JOHN
                        Paul.

                                 JULIA
                        OH! Paul! Heard all about you.
                           (to John)
                        You never said you he such a treat
                        to look at too.

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah well, I'm not queer am I?
                                 JULIA
                        And neither am I.
                           (pause)
                        Paul, you're welcome round here
                        anytime.
                           (winks)
                        With or without your guitar.

           JOHN, really not liking this.  PAUL doesn't know what to
           do with himself. 

         153 INT. JULIA'S HOUSE -- LATER

           PAUL

           singing 'I Lost My Little Girl', (the first song he ever
           wrote), solo.  A sad song.

           THE GIRLS look on in wonder, JULIA - almost in tears.

           JOHN - getting pissed off that PAUL's hogging his mother's
           attention.

           PAUL finishes.

                                 JULIA
                        Oh my...that was so...
                           (drying her eyes)
                        I am sorry.

           Beat.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                        You wrote that for her didn't you?

           JULIA looks at JOHN fleetingly.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                        John told me about your Mother...if
                        you don't mind me asking how did
                        she-

                                 PAUL
                           (cuts in)
                        -Breast cancer.

           JULIA's hands clasp her mouth, slips in next to PAUL.

                                 JULIA
                        You poor, poor boy.

           Comforts PAUL's head in her bosom.  PAUL going along with
           it - quite nice, the bosom.  JOHN shaking his head.

                                 PAUL
                           (muffled)
                        I did write it after she died.

           JULIA releases his head up in her hands.
                                 JULIA
                        She's so proud!  I can feel her
                        spirit here right now!

           Kisses him on the forehead.

           JOHN - can this get anymore sickly?

                                 JOHN
                        Got any new records then Mum?

           JULIA jumps up excited like the previous Paul exchange
           never took place.

                                 JULIA
                        Have I?!  Yes!  Yes!

           Rushes over to the gramaphone picks up a sleeve.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                        'Searchin' by The Coasters.

                                 PAUL
                           (to John)
                        I've been trying to get a copy! 
                        Where?

                                 JULIA
                        'NEMS' record store off Matthew
                        Street.

           The rasping, rumbling, intro grabs.

                                 THE COASTERS
                        "Gonna find her, gonna find her. 
                        Well Searchin' Yeah I'm gonna
                        searchin'..."

           JOHN and PAUL bang into this one.  JULIA dancing around.

           Listen to the first verse and-

         154 INT. NORRISS GREEN SOCIAL CLUB -- NIGHT

           -THE QUARRYMEN take over 'Searchin'.  JOHN and PAUL lead
           on stage.  ALL wear WHITE SHIRTS, BLACK TROUSERS and
           BOOTLACE TIES however PAUL's decided to wear his WHITE
           SPORTS JACKET.

           PAUL

           nervous as he plays.  Clammy hands.

           THE AUDIENCE

           stretches to over 100 YOUNGSTERS.  Including JULIA and
           BOBBY who are right at the front.

           They finish the song - decent applause.
                                                 PAUL
                        JOHN
               Thanks guys.
                                          Thankyou.

           JOHN darts PAUL a look - he takes the thanks.  PAUL
           intimidated, backs off the mic.

                                 JOHN
                        Next, the scouse Chuck Berry will
                        play 'Guitar Boogie'.  I present
                        to you...Mr. Paul McCartney!

                                 PAUL
                        Thanks John.  Kind words.

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah well...I didn't mean them.

           The AUDIENCE laugh. PAUL more nervous.  He counts the band
           in, opens up with the difficult guitar riff - they get
           rocking - then it breaks down..

                                 PAUL
                           (of mic)
                        Shit.

           Sweat beads forming on his forehead.  JOHN looks out at
           the unimpressed AUDIENCE. A worried looking JULIA who knows
           PAUL's in trouble.

                                 JOHN
                        Sorry folks.  First night on the
                        job and all that.

           Laughs.

                                 PAUL
                           (off mic)
                        Just give us a sec mate.

                                 JOHN
                           (off mic)
                        You've not got a fucking sec mate.

           PAUL desperately fingers the chords over and over, getting
           them right in his head.  JOHN's almost reveling in it.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                           (to barmaid)
                        Stick the kettle on, luv.

                                 PAUL
                        OK.  I'm right.

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah?

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah.

           THE QUARRYMEN open up again.
           PAUL

           Heavy concentration - this time he hits past breakdown
           point.  By mid-song he's in THE ZONE.

           THE AUDIENCE LAP IT UP.  DANCING breaks out everywhere. 
           Including the PRETTY GIRLS at the front - all eyes fixed
           on PAUL.

           JOHN, noticing, then looks at JULIA who's going crazy.

         155 INT. BUS -- LATER

           THE QUARRYMEN run and catch the night-bus home.  A buzz in
           the air, post gig adrenaline.  LEN and COLIN have to haul
           the T-CHEST BASS and DRUMS on respectively, whilst JOHN,
           PAUL and ERIC quickly stash their guitars and rush upstairs
           with PETE (who carrys his WASHBOARD).

           (This is how bands travel in those days).

           LEN and COLIN get done for extra baggage fare off the BUS
           CONDUCTOR.

         156 INT. BUS/TOPDECK -- MOMENTS LATER

           EVERYONE smoking a cig.

           NIGEL (omportant to rememeber him for later) the manager,
           handing out cash.

           JOHN

           takes a long drag, face taught.  POV: PAUL, sitting a few
           rows ahead, holding court with JOHN'S BAND.  Including
           PETE.  EVERYONE smiling and laughing with PAUL.

           JOHN - threatened.

         157 EXT. MENLOVE  AVENUE -- LATER

           JOHN and PETE walking home.

                                 JOHN
                        Found a new best mate have you?

                                 PETE
                        What?

                                 JOHN
                        The housewives choice.

                                 PETE
                           (working it out)
                        Macca?

                                 JOHN
                        Macca is it now?  Well Macca's
                        getting the fuckin' sacka.

           PETE starts giggling then realises...
                                 PETE
                        From the band?

                                 JOHN
                        Where else y'dick?

                                 PETE
                        Fuck off.

                                 JOHN
                        My band.

                                 PETE
                        The Quarrymen were shite before
                        Paul came on board.

                                 JOHN
                        No they weren't?

                                 PETE
                        You weren't.  We were.  Now...we're
                        not bad.  We could even be quite
                        good.
                           (pause)
                        And that's Paul.  Playing with
                        you.

                                 JOHN
                        He's not that great.  A bit tricky
                        but..

                                 PETE
                        Julia says he's the best guitarist
                        she's ever seen.

           JOHN - riled.

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah?  What does she know?

                                 PETE
                        Like, everything.

           The penny drops with PETE, this is about Julia.

                                 PETE (CONT'D)
                        She thinks you're a much better
                        singer though.

                                 JOHN
                        She told you that?

                                 PETE
                           (nods)
                        She didn't want you to get big-
                        headed.  Y'know - it's fuckin'
                        massive as it is.  But your voice,
                        knocks Paul's socks off.

           JOHN's gloom lifts.  PETE's white lie doing the trick..
                                 PETE (CONT'D)
                        You want this band to go somewhere?

           JOHN shrugs a 'yeah'.

                                 PETE (CONT'D)
                        Paul stays....y'dick.

           JOHN smiles, nods.

                                 JOHN
                        I'll think about it.

           PETE puts a comforting arm round JOHN as they disappear up
           the street.

         158 INT. MENDIPS/MORNING ROOM -- DAY

           JOHN fidgeting, nervous - opposite, MIMI, reading.  POV:
           his 'O' LEVEL RESULTS - all 'D's.

           MIMI still. Scary.

                                 JOHN
                        You could look at it this way - I
                        only missed out on passing
                        everything by one grade.

           MIMI just stares.  She holds the results paper close to
           his face.

                                 MIMI
                        You're not clever John. Even if
                        you think you are. 
                           (beat)
                        It's official.

           She drops the results in his lap.

                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        So. I'm listening.

           JOHN not sure what she's on about.

                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        What's the plan?  Get down the
                        pub?  You fancied being a docker?
                        Perhaps an alcoholic docker?

           She waits for an answer.

                                 JOHN
                        Well..the band's doing OK and-

                                 MIMI
                        -That's a hobby John.  Like stamp
                        collecting.  No-one makes a living
                        from stamp collecting.
                                 JOHN
                        Apart from professional stamp
                        collectors.

           MIMI stares hard.

                                 MIMI
                        So. No plans.  Great.

           FISHWICK comes in from the kitchen having made a cup of
           tea.  Overheard the conversation.

                                 FISHWICK
                        There's Art School?

           They both turn and look.

                                 MIMI
                        He failed art.

                                 FISHWICK
                        Because his work's too original,
                        they probably didn't understand
                        it.

                                 JOHN
                           (loving Fishwick)
                        That's right.  They didn't.

                                 FISHWICK
                        John's an ideas man.  Graduate
                        from art school and he could get
                        into advertising or become a graphic
                        designer.

           JOHN likes that, more importantly so does MIMI.

                                 FISHWICK (CONT'D)
                        You'd probably need a letter of
                        recommendation from his headmaster,
                        something like that.

                                 JOHN
                           (sighs)
                        I'd get one for a firing squad.
                        ...maybe.

           MIMI gets up, collects her purse and coat.

                                 MIMI
                        Let's see.

                                 JOHN
                        Pobjoy?  You've no chance.

                                 MIMI
                        We have a special relationship,
                        plus...he's never seen me be nice.

                                 JOHN
                        But-
                                 MIMI
                        -Don't worry John, I'll sort your
                        life out, you just sit there and
                        have a cup of tea.

           And with that she's off out of the door.

                                 JOHN
                           (to Fishy)
                        Stick the kettle on then...

         159 EXT. LIVERPOOL ART COLLEGE -- DAY

           A HUGE VICTORIAN BUILDING in the city centre.

         160 INT. LIVERPOOL ART COLLEGE -- DAY

           JOHN smoking, cocky, wandering in, guitar slung over his
           back.  Collars turned up, black drainpipes, white socks
           and winkle-pickers, hair piled up like Tony Curtis.  Other
           ARTY TYPES gather around, BEATNICKS, PEACENICKS and TEDS.

           He looks free.

           Plasters cover string fingers from over-zealous guitar
           practice.

         161 INT. LIVERPOOL ART COLLEGE/LIVE ART CLASS -- DAY

           THE CLASS painting a NUDE MALE MODEL, JOHN amongst them
           (don't see his work). 

           A HANDSOME BOY next to him, moody looking.  This is STU
           SUTCLIFFE, paints with a disturbing intensity.

                                 JOHN
                        Psst.  Stu.  What d'you think?

           Shows STU his work.  POV: a deformed figure of a man -
           nothing like the model - a BIG DICK coming out of his head.

                                 STU
                        Get rid of that big phallic thing
                        from your own head and you could
                        be quite good at this.

           They crack up.  STU gets back to his painting which see is
           WONDROUS.

         162 INT. LIVERPOOL ART COLLEGE/CANTEEN -- LATER

           The CANTEEN buzzing with STUDENTS and TEACHERS.

           PAUL mooches in, followed by an even YOUNGER LOOKING KID,
           dark hair piled up, protruding cheekbones - GEORGE HARRISON.
           Both in school uniforms.  (Liverpool Institute was next
           door to the Art College).

           Ties and caps off, blazer collars up - they weave through
           the OLDER KIDS - trying to look cool.  (Both have guitars
           slung over their shoulders).
           They climb the stage at the back - and disappear through
           the curtains where....

         163 INT. LIVERPOOL ART COLLEGE/BACK STAGE -- CONTINUOUS

           JOHN is sat strumming, waiting to practice, nibbling from
           a BIG BAG OF CHIPS on the floor.  STU sat with
           him...smoking, (no guitar) just hanging out.  Nods of
           recognition.

                                 PAUL
                        John this is George.

           GEORGE pulls up a chair, takes a handful of chips - no
           hello.

                                 JOHN
                           (sarcy)
                        Have a chip George.

           GEORGE just winks cockily.  JOHN not sure whether to like
           him - or lay him out.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        So...George?

           JOHN swings his neck, looks at PAUL questioningly.

                                 PAUL
                        Let him show you what he can do.

                                 JOHN
                        Like magic tricks?  With rabbits
                        and stuff?

                                 PAUL
                        The magic's there, yeah.

           GEORGE picks up another handful of chips.

                                 JOHN
                        Do you talk George?

                                 GEORGE
                           (shrugs)
                        Yeah.

                                 JOHN
                        How old are you?

                                 GEORGE
                        Nearly fifteen.

                                 JOHN
                           (to Paul)
                        Oh no!  No fucking way!  We've
                        only room for one baby and that's
                        you McCartney.
                           (to George)
                        Soz mate, get back to your 'Victor'
                        and 'Dandy' annuals.
                                 GEORGE
                           (dry)
                        'The Beano', everytime.

           GEORGE grabs his guitar.  Finishes the chips in his mouth
           and without hesitation launches into a complex yet perfect
           version of 'Raunchy' by Bill Justis.

           Afterwards JOHN can hardly believe it.  It was FUCKING
           GREAT.  PAUL smiles at JOHN.

                                 PAUL
                        How fuckin' 'alright' was that!? 

         164 INT. WILSON HALL -- NIGHT

           A bigger place than usual.  Like a community arts theatre. 

           THE QUARRYMEN

           on stage, this time with GEORGE - mid song - belting out 
           'Ready Teddy' by Little Richard.  Tearing the place up -
           and the AUDIENCE.

           HUGE APPLAUSE.  The PRETTY GIRLS lining up at the front. 
           As well as JULIA (No.1 fan) with BOBBY - both jumping up
           and down cheering.

           JOHN, PAUL and GEORGE exchange big grins. 

           This is really working!

         165 INT. JULIA'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

           A PARTY for JOHN's 17th birthday. 

           The house FULL with THE QUARRYMEN and their various
           instruments.  JULIA and THE GIRLS, BOBBY, NEIGHBOURS dance
           about.  GEORGE sits glued to the TV (adverts) with the
           sound turned down.

           BOOZE flows.

           'Hound-Dog' by Elvis on repeat.

           JOHN and PAUL squirreled away with guitars.  PAUL has a
           school text book in which they write lyrics as they jam. 
           Crossing things out.  Thinking of better words, better
           rhymes.  Deep into each other.

                                 PAUL
                           (to John)
                        "She was just seventeen", then
                        what about.."A real beauty queen"

                                 JOHN
                        Shiite.

           JULIA moves in.  Hands JOHN and PAUL another beer.
                                 JULIA
                        Aids creativity.

           She sasses off.  PAUL watches her go, intrigued.

                                 PAUL
                        Can I ask you something...personal?

           JOHN holds his arms out wide.

                                 JOHN
                        ...soft.

           PAUL laughs.

                                 PAUL
                        Seriously?

           JOHN shrugs an 'OK'.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        You know your Mum's great and
                        everything...cool.

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah.

                                 PAUL
                        How come you ended up living with
                        your Auntie then?

           JOHN's face drains of emotion.

                                 JOHN
                        No-one's ever said.  I mean...I
                        dunno.

                                 PAUL
                        And you've never asked?

           JOHN stares PAUL out a bit.  Touched a nerve.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        I guess it's not that easy.

                                 JOHN
                        Good at guessing aren't you?

           JOHN gives a famous Lennon sarcy grin - when you don't
           know if he hates you or loves you.

           Elvis cuts - "HAPPY BIRTHDAY" strikes up.

           BOBBY, JULIA and THE GIRLS come out of the kitchen holding
           a big sponge cake, 17 candles.

           JOHN gives JULIA a look, before blowing out the candles.

                                 EVERYONE
                        Speech!  Speech!
                                 PETE
                        Giz a few words Johnny-boy.

                                 JOHN
                        'Cock' and 'Balls'.  That do you?

           Laughs.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                           (smiling)
                        First of all, Twitchy needs to
                        stop nicking cakes from his hotel
                        kitchen.

           BOBBY nods, rumbled - he exchanges a laugh with JOHN (they
           get on better now).

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        Second, I want to know from my
                        band:
                           (American accent)
                        "Where we goin' boys?"

                                 BAND
                           (American accent)
                        "To the toppity top Johnny".

                                 JOHN
                        That's right to the "toppity top". 
                        Except-

           JOHN grabs PETE's washboard.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        Pete come here mate.

           PETE wanders over - grinning.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        Pete wants to leave the band.

           There are 'No' and 'Boo' from the room.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        Thinks the washboard and rock'n'roll
                        don't mix, plus he feels a dick
                        wearing his mum's thimbles.  I
                        know...

           More boos..

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        A travesty.

           Beat.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        But true.

           JOHN breaks the washboard over PETE's head to big cheers
           and laughs - hands the two broken pieces back to PETE.
                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        Keep that.  Worth a few bob when
                        we're famous.

           More Laughter.

           JOHN spots something - all goes slo/mo.  POV: A beaming
           JULIA has her arm clasped tight around PAUL waist, but not
           only that, her hand rests on his bum - patting it.

           JOHN's face freezes over.

         166 EXT. JULIA'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

           JULIA smoking.  JOHN joins her.  She smiles at him - glad
           of his company.

                                 JULIA
                        Birthday boy!

           JOHN rips the beer bottle cap off with his teeth.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                           (genuine)
                        Impressed.

           He takes a swig.  Offers her some.  She takes it.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                        Oh..

           JULIA lifts up a stray brick outside the house - underneath
           A SPARE FRONT DOOR KEY.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                        Just in case you and the boys want
                        to come round for band practice
                        and no-one's in.

                                 JOHN
                           (half sarcy)
                        Wow.  My own front door key...sort
                        of.

                                 JULIA
                        C'mere.

           She takes JOHN in for a big tight hug.  JOHN smells her
           perfume - closes his eyes and loses himself in 'Mother'.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                        My big, big, boy.  I'm so proud.

           They break.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                        And the band...when I see you on
                        stage...I get that feeling...

           JOHN remembers Ike Turner in Blackpool.
                                 JOHN
                        The vibrations? Through the bones.

                                 JULIA
                           (smiles, nods)
                        The vibrations. 

           JOHN needs to make her feel even more proud.

                                 JOHN
                        We're gonna cut a record.

                                 JULIA
                        No!?

                                 JOHN
                        Well, we need to find three quid
                        first - but there's this studio,
                        basic, but you still come out
                        holding a black round thing.

                                 JULIA
                        Imagine putting a record on, then
                        you're voice booms out!  Imagine
                        John!

           JOHN thrilled he's thrilling his Mother.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                        I'll help you with the money.

                                 JOHN
                        No need.

                                 JULIA
                        I want to.
                           (pause)
                        Then the band'll take off.  You're
                        too good.  George is amazing and
                        Paul, so talented, so handsome! 
                        If I were few years younger!

           It's said jokey.  JOHN's paranoia doesn't see it like that..

                                 JOHN
                           (icy)
                        What?

           Beat.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        You'd shag him?

           JOHN sinks the beer - stares hard at JULIA.  She feels it.

                                 JULIA
                        Let's get back to the party.

           JOHN grabs her, gently.
                                 JOHN
                        Where's my father?

                                 JULIA
                        Who?

                                 JOHN
                        The guy who spunked up my existence. 
                        They're called father's right?

                                 JULIA
                           (struggling)
                        I don't think-

                                 JOHN
                        -I do.  ThinkThinkThink.
                           (sarcy)
                        Where's Daddy, Mummy?  Alf.  That's
                        his name yeah?

           JULIA nods - getting the jitters.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        Where's fuckin' Alf then?

                                 JULIA
                        Please don't swear John.

                                 JOHN
                        Why? Make you feel uncomfortable
                        does it?

           Beat.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        Try being me for the last seventeen
                        years.  Try that for uncomfortable,
                        Mum.

           JULIA starts to cry.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        Oh here we go.  Taps on.

                                 JULIA
                        Don't be horrible to me John.

                                 JOHN
                        Me being horrible to you?  I see.
                           (scolding himself)
                        Horrible John.  Naughty John. 
                        Poor Julia.

           JULIA tries to head back inside.  JOHN blocks her way.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        No running away.  Not tonight.

                                 JULIA
                        John!
                                 JOHN
                        Why did you give me away?

           JULIA backs off, walks round, small circles - distressed.

                                 JULIA
                        Mimi thought it a good idea.  Things
                        to sort out.

                                 JOHN
                        That's a lot of 'things'.  I'm
                        still at fuckin' Mendips if you
                        hadn't noticed.

                                 JULIA
                        I wanted you back, I always wanted
                        you back.

                                 JOHN
                        But I never got back did I?

           Beat.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        Was it Bobby?

                                 JULIA
                           (shakes her head)
                        We tried to get you back, we did,
                        John, I'm sorry, really, please,
                        don't be-

                                 JOHN
                        -Upset?  Angry?  No.  I fuckin'
                        will.  Sorry.

                                 JULIA
                        Mimi can be so strong.  She loved
                        you so much, her and George-

                                 JOHN
                        -More than you?

           JULIA looks at him, the question killing her.

           A yawning YOUNG JACKIE pops her head around the door.

                                 JACKIE
                        Mummy..I'm tired now?
                           (notices)
                        Are you sad again?

           JOHN feeling guilt for pushing.  JULIA wipes her tears,
           smiles brightly.

                                 JULIA
                        Mummy's not sad.  Look!

           She points to her fake smile.  JACKIE smiles back, but
           even she knows it's fake.
                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                        I'm coming in now honey.

           JULIA goes to embrace JOHN - but he holds back, stiff.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                           (whispers)
                        I love you.

           She kisses his cheek, heads back inside.

           JOHN steps back looks at the house, not his house, never
           will be. Fucks the party off. Walks off down the street.

         167 INT. DOCK SIDE PUB -- NIGHT

           JOHN sits alone nursing a near empty pint of BLACK VELVET
           (Guinness and black currant).  The bell rings for last
           orders.  JOHN searches his pockets for money - SIXPENCE,
           some used tissues and a broken fag.

           He wanders upto the bar.

                                 JOHN
                           (to the barman)
                        Same.

                                 BARMAN
                        Not enough.

                                 JOHN
                           (fixes him)
                        It's all I've got right now....so
                        do us a favour eh?

           The BARMAN see's this bloke is on the edge - isn't worth
           the aggro.  He sighs, starts pulling JOHN's pint.

         168 EXT. DOCK SIDE PUB -- NIGHT

           JOHN last out - hits the pavement - the pub door immediately
           shut and bolted behind him.

           Looks around.  Where now?

         169 EXT. CITY CENTRE WATERFRONT -- MOMENTS LATER

           JOHN staring out across the Mersey Estuary.  The deep
           expanse of water.

           AN OCEAN LINER passes in the distance - he thinks of Alf. 
           Thinks of escape - in more ways than one.

         170 EXT. MENDIPS -- LATER

           JOHN meanders up to the front gate.  Looks at the house. 
           Home, whether he likes it or not.

         171 INT. MENDIPS/BACK DINING ROOM -- NIGHT

           JOHN lets himself in.  The house silent, lights on.
                                 JOHN
                        Mimi?

           He wanders down the hallway, smells food from the dining
           room.  Goes in. 

           MIMI

           sat by the window smoking - dressed up.  On the table a
           roasted chicken and vegetables - a special birthday dinner. 
           All cold.  A Birthday Cake sits in the middle, untouched.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        You never said.

                                 MIMI
                           (pause)
                        I got you something.

           She nods to the other corner

           A BRAND NEW HOFFNER GUITAR (electric). 

           JOHN rushes over grabs it - keeps looking over at MIMI -
           who stares out of the window.

                                 JOHN
                        A Hoffner!  Mimi, these things
                        cost an arm and a leg.

           JOHN puts it down - goes over - hugs her tight with feeling,
           with love.  MIMI breaks free - starts clearing up the food. 
           JOHN suddenly feels rejected, again! 

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        I've been at Mum's.

                                 MIMI
                        Drinking I suppose?

                                 JOHN
                        She's said things.
                           (pause)
                        About Alf.

           MIMI immediately stops.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        And you.

           Her body tenses up.

                                 MIMI
                        Did she now?  Well, don't stop
                        there.

                                 JOHN
                        Alf couldn't care less and you
                        never gave me back.  Is that right?
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        I think she was trying to say you
                        stole me.  What d'you think Mimi? 
                        Did you?  Steal me?

           MIMI holds his eyes, piercing stare.  Then starts laughing,
           manically - nasty.  Stops.  Disgusted.  Takes a moment to
           calm herself, but can't - the anger boils over.

                                 MIMI
                        Did she tell you why I 'stole'
                        you?

                                 JOHN
                           (recalls)
                        She had...things, stuff, to sort
                        out.

                                 MIMI
                           (sharp laugh)
                        Things like having another man's
                        child, those kind of things?

           JOHN taken back.

                                 JOHN
                        Bobby's?

                                 MIMI
                        No.

                                 JOHN
                        ....Alf's?

           MIMI shakes her head.  Raises her eye-brows at JOHN.  If
           he wants the truth - she's got it!

                                 MIMI
                        Your Father was away with the war. 
                        Being a Wife and Mother was never
                        enough for Julia.  She needed
                        action.  Do you understand what I
                        mean by action?

           MIMI looks at JOHN - both don't want the word 'sex' to be
           said.  JOHN nods.

                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        She found it at the local cinema. 
                        A young soldier, Welsh.  Long gone
                        before she realised she was
                        pregnant.  Then she couldn't cope,
                        could she?  Not with life.

           Beat.

                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        Not with you - her four year old
                        son.

           Beat.
                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        So guess who's door she came
                        knocking on?

           JOHN wide-eyed with shock - takes a seat. 

           MIMI - on a roll, seeing the effect she's having on JOHN. 
           Wanting to DESTROY JULIA in her quest to keep him.

                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        So you have another sister
                        somewhere, Victoria.

                                 JOHN
                        Where?

                                 MIMI
                        The Salvation Army took her for
                        adoption.

           Beat.

                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        I suppose she was 'stolen' too. 
                        Nothing to do with the fact Julia
                        was incapable.  Oh no.  Never
                        Julia's fault.  How could it be?

           MIMI shakes her head in disbelief.

                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        So soon she was 'seeing' that Bobby
                        Dykins.  Pop shocked us all when
                        he allowed him to move in.  That's
                        when I put my foot down.

           Beat.

                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        This was her shame not yours.

           Beat.

                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        With your mother's consent, you
                        came here to live me and George.
                           (pause)
                        Dykins wasn't sorry to see you go.

           JOHN - getting whiter with each revelation.

                                 JOHN
                        And that was it?

           A slight smile on MIMI's lips.

                                 MIMI
                        Even when your father tried to
                        save the marriage it made no
                        difference.
           JOHN looks up shocked.

                                 JOHN
                        When?

                                 MIMI
                        A year later.  Turned up at Pop's -
                        wanting to see his wife and son. 
                        Naturally.

                                 JOHN
                        But he hadn't written, sent money.. 

                                 MIMI
                        There's more than one way to be
                        "Lost at Sea".

           Beat.

                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        Your father was an orphan at five
                        too.

           Another fact crashes in on him.

                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        Deserted by his Mother after his
                        father died.  Neglect already
                        ingrained in him.
                           (sarcy)
                        Alf. Julia  picked a real winner
                        there.

           JOHN - his head really spinning.  MIMI feeling the power.

                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        He begged Julia to get back with
                        him, get you back,  become a normal
                        family again.

           JOHN looks up.  This is what he would have wanted more
           than anything in the world. 

           TO BE IN A NORMAL FAMILY.

                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        Anyway, she told him to get lost.

           JOHN holds his head in his hands.

                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        Because the only thing that matters
                        to Julia - is Julia.
                           (pause)
                        She'd moved on.  With Dykins.

           Beat.

                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        The fact Alf was her husband and
                        your Father a minor irritant.
           Beat.

                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        But Alf wasn't going that easily.
                           (pause)
                        He had plans....for you.

           JOHN looks up.

         172 INT. MENDIPS/LIVING ROOM (FLASHBACK) -- DAY

           An indignant MIMI, in her early 40's, stood in-front of a
           CURIOUS 5YR OLD JOHN as he cranes his neck around her to
           see ALF, his estranged father, who is charming MIMI.

                                 MIMI (V.O.)
                        Said he wanted to take you to town
                        for the day - shopping.

           ALF gives MIMI twenty quid compensation.  She releases
           JOHN into ALF's arms.

                                 MIMI (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        He took you to Blackpool instead..

         173 EXT. BLACKPOOL BEACH (FLASHBACK) -- DAY

                                 MIMI (V.O.)
                        'Kidnapped' is a better description.

           A HAPPY JOHN eating and ICE CREAM on a DONKEY being led by
           ALF (we recognise John and the donkey from the RECURRING
           DREAM established previously).

                                 MIMI (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        The plan?  To take you on to New
                        Zealand.  Emigrate.

         174 EXT. SEAMAN'S MISSION (FLASHBACK) -- DAY

           A distraught MIMI dragging JULIA up the steps.

                                 MIMI (V.O.)
                        Days later, I had to drag your
                        Mother away from Dykins to 'The
                        Seaman's Mission'.  Ask if they
                        knew where Alf was...

         175 EXT. SHABBY TOWN-HOUSE (FLASHBACK) -- DAY

           JULIA checks an address on a piece of paper.  Looking up
           at the house - the SAME RED HOUSE from the dream.

                                 MIMI (V.O.)
                        They had an address for a brother
                        in Blackpool..

         176 INT. MENDIPS/BACK DINING ROOM -- NIGHT

           JOHN - realising this is his RECURRING DREAM.
         177 INT. SHABBY TOWN HOUSE ROOM (FLASHBACK) -- DAY

           5YR OLD JOHN sat in THAT CHAIR, in THAT ROOM from the dream -
           looking up at ALF and JULIA.

                                 MIMI (V.O.)
                        Again Alf pleaded with your Mother
                        to get back with him.  Again she
                        said no.

           ALF and JULIA stop arguing - they both look at JOHN.

                                 MIMI (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        So in the end they asked you, a
                        five year old boy, who you wanted
                        to be with?

           Holds on a BCU.

                                 MIMI (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        And you said-

                                 5 YR OLD JOHN
                        -Daddy.

           JULIA collects her things, rushes towards the front door.

                                 MIMI (V.O.)
                        So knowing Alf was planning to
                        take you to New Zealand. Knowing
                        she would probably never see you
                        again...

           JULIA leaves the room.

                                 MIMI (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Your Mother just left.

           5 YEAR OLD JOHN watches JULIA leave.

                                 MIMI (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Lucky you changed your mind.

           Suddenly leaps out of his chair, heads to the door. 
           Scrambling to get out (as in the dream).

                                 5 YEAR OLD JOHN
                        MUMMY!  MUMMY!

           Finally a guilt ridden ALF opens it for him.

         178 EXT. SHABBY TOWN HOUSE ROOM (FLASHBACK) -- DAY

                                 5 YEAR OLD JOHN
                        MUMMY!

           JOHN runs down the street.  An underwhelmed JULIA close
           her eyes, then turns around, as JOHN leaps back into her
           life. 
           ALF looks on from the front door - slowly heads back inside. 
           The fight given up.

           JULIA tries to smile at JOHN - but finds it hard.

         179 INT. MENDIPS/BACK DINING ROOM -- NIGHT

                                 MIMI
                        ...any later and she would have
                        got away.  Forever.

           JOHN - head in bits.

                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        Just like you.
                           (pause)
                        Out of sight out of mind.

           The bottom line.  MIMI buzzing with herself - with her
           destruction.

           JOHN - can't take it anymore.  All of this TRUTH, this
           HURT, these LIES, ANGER - everything suddenly boils over,
           rushes past MIMI - nearly knocking her over.

         180 EXT. MENDIPS/MENLOVE  AVENUE -- NIGHT

           JOHN sprints out of the house - down Menlove  Avenue.  He
           sits in the bus stop - hyperventilating.  Mind racing -
           thousand miles an hour.

           Contra-zoom straight into his retina...and into John's
           animated world.

         181 EXT. STREETS (ANIMATION) -- NIGHT

           JOHN sprinting through the streets of Allerton and
           Springwood.

         182 EXT. JULIA'S HOUSE (ANIMATION) -- NIGHT

           JOHN sprinting up the path - boots the door down.

         183 INT. JULIA'S HOUSE (ANIMATION) -- NIGHT

           JOHN wrecking the house.  JULIA screaming at him to calm
           down.  THE GIRLS crying.

           BOBBY launches himself at JOHN - they grapple on the ground. 
           JOHN gets the better of him - pins him down, smashes his
           fist into BOBBY's face and-

         184 INT. JULIA'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

           JOHN freezes.  Dazed.  BOBBY beneath him.  All the animation
           in his head has ACTUALLY HAPPENED. 

           Confused - he sprints out of the house.

                                 JULIA
                        Bobby!
           BOBBY half gets up, nursing a bloody  nose.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                        I need to-!

           JULIA sets off after JOHN.

                                 BOBBY
                        Julia!

           But she's gone.

         185 EXT. CALDERSTONES PARK -- NIGHT

           JULIA wandering through the deserted park.

                                 JULIA
                        John!  John, are you in here! I
                        saw you run in!

           She keeps walking.  Searching.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                        John, c'mon please!  I'm your
                        Mother!

                                 JOHN (O.S.)
                        Victoria's Mother too.

           JOHN appears from the black. Calmer but still psyched.  He
           keeps his distance.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        The other kid you gave away.

           JULIA gulps in the name - Victoria. Shocks her.

                                 JULIA
                        No..no.  John... 
                           (moves towards him)
                        Come here, luv. 

                                 JOHN
                           (backs off)
                        I'm coming nowhere near you ever
                        again.

                                 JULIA
                        It wasn't my choice!  They made
                        me!  Come here John.  I'll explain.

                                 JOHN
                        I get the jist.  My mother fucks
                        blokes.  Lots of them.

                                 JULIA
                        That's not true.  Mimi's twisting
                        it-

                                 JOHN
                        -And I got in your way.
                                 JULIA
                        No!  Nonononono.

                                 JOHN
                        Alf wanted us back.  You and me. 
                        Wanted us to be a normal family. 
                        You didn't care.

                                 JULIA
                        No, John, your father, he didn't
                        want us.  He didn't care.

                                 JOHN
                        Then why did you leave me in
                        Blackpool with him?

                                 JULIA
                        What?

                                 JOHN
                        You remember.  I was five years
                        old!  He was going to take me to
                        New Zealand.  And you just fucked
                        off.

                                 JULIA
                        I was never going to leave you.

                                 JOHN
                        Where did you go then?

           JULIA has no answer - she starts shaking.

                                 JULIA
                        Police.  I was going to get the
                        police.

                                 JOHN
                        Liar!

                                 JULIA
                        I was ill.  I get ill, and I'm not
                        myself..

                                 JOHN
                        So you left because you were ill? 

                                 JULIA
                        Yes!!  Everything goes crazy!  I
                        don't think straight!

           JULIA getting more hysterical.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                        I was never going to leave you. 

                                 JOHN
                        You left me for thirteen years! 
                        For thirteen years I've prayed for
                        you to come back.  That's all I've
                        wanted, my Mum back.
                                 JULIA
                        They took you away!  Me and Bobby
                        we got a flat, but it was only one
                        bedroomed.  We all slept in the
                        same bed.  But because Bobby's not
                        your dad Mimi got the Social
                        Services.

         186 INT. JULIA AND BOBBY'S FLAT (FLASHBACK) -- DAY

           JULIA having to be restrained by an UPSET BOBBY, as TWO
           SOCIAL SERVICES OFFICERS forcibly remove 5 YR OLD JOHN.

           MIMI stands by the door watching.

         187 INT. CALDERSTONES PARK -- NIGHT

                                 JULIA
                        They took you away!  And they gave
                        you to Mimi!

           JOHN - another proper head-fuck.  Can't hear anymore, walks
           off.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                        John!

           JULIA runs after, grabs him round the waist, JOHN forcibly
           picks her arms off - she drops to the ground.  He keeps
           walking.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                        John come back!

           Beat.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                        Please don't leave me!  Not now!

           JULIA alone - in a right mess.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                           (chunnering)
                        I'm here now, I'm here.  I never
                        meant to leave you.  Please.. I
                        love you John.  I love you.  I'm
                        here.

           JOHN slowly returns.  Looking down on his broken mother. 
           Can't leave her like this.  He helps JULIA up from the
           ground - they sit on a nearby bench, JULIA still hysterical
           crying, her head in his lap.

                                 JULIA (CONT'D)
                           (over and over)
                        I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

           JOHN gently strokes her hair, soothing her - like a parent
           would a child.
         188 INT. JULIA'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

           JOHN in the living room replacing the records he'd thrown
           around earlier.  Picks up one Buddy Holly 'That'll Be The
           Day' - a record that symbolises Julia.  Smiles sadly.

           BOBBY comes down from upstairs.

                                 BOBBY
                        She won't surface for a couple of
                        days now.

           JOHN stands - awkward.

                                 JOHN
                        The nose?

                                 BOBBY
                        Sore.

           JOHN shrugs apologetically.

                                 BOBBY (CONT'D)
                        Mimi really twisted the knife in
                        didn't she?

           JOHN stares at him.

                                 JOHN
                        Mum said she was ill.

           Beat.

                                 BOBBY
                           (surprised)
                        She doesn't usually admit it.
                           (pause)
                        She can hit rock bottom.  Then
                        suddenly fly into the clouds. 
                        Sometimes she's normal, feet on
                        the floor.  But you never can tell. 
                        There's been many occasion I was
                        scared she may-
                           (stops himself)
                        She visited you, at Mendips, until
                        you were around seven, but Mimi
                        never wanted Julia there, it
                        reminded her she wasn't your Mother.

           Beat.

                                 BOBBY (CONT'D)
                        I know you think there are no
                        excuses...

                                 JOHN
                        But there are?  Is that what you're
                        saying?

           BOBBY nods - it's all a mix up.  JOHN's heard enough, calmly
           leaves.
         189 EXT. MENDIPS -- NIGHT

           JOHN arrives back.  Sees the light on in the front room -
           curtains drawn.  Can do without a MIMI conversation.  Too
           tired.

         190 EXT. MENDIPS/BACK GARDEN -- NIGHT

           JOHN, sat up in his tree house, lights up his last fag.

           POV: THE KITCHEN LIGHT turned on, FISHWICK stands at the
           sink washing tea mugs.  Soon joined by MIMI.  FISHWICK
           suddenly grabs MIMI into his arms.

           JOHN - tenses up.

           FISHWICK and MIMI kiss - long and hard.  They break smile
           lovingly at each other - then leave.  The light turned
           off.

           JOHN - gobsmacked, can't believe what he's just seen.

           He starts chuckling - the madness - his laugh grows louder.

         191 EXT. MENLOVE  AVENUE -- NIGHT

           High and Wide.

           John's manic laughter reverberates over the rooftops.

         192 INT. MENDIPS/MORNING ROOM -- MORNING

           FISHWICK and MIMI sat at the table for breakfast.  JOHN
           breezes in.  A glint in his eye.

                                 JOHN
                        Michael!  Aunt Mimi!  How the devil
                        are we both today?  Good, yes?

           MIMI and FISHWICK look at him - acting strange.

                                 MIMI
                        Do you want breakfast?

                                 JOHN
                        I'll grab something at college
                        thanks.  What about you two?  Any
                        fun planned?

           JOHN swings his neck - making eye contact with them both. 
           MIMI - suspecting he knows something.

                                 FISHWICK
                        Just a normal day for me.

                                 JOHN
                        Well enjoy your normal day.  Both
                        of you. Normal can be so exciting
                        sometimes.
           JOHN gives them both a big sarcy Lennon smile.  Sets off
           down the hallway.  FISHWICK and MIMI exchange looks.

           MIMI follows JOHN, who's putting his coat on, slinging his
           guitar over his shoulder.

                                 MIMI
                        John?

                                 JOHN
                        Yes Aunt Mimi?

                                 MIMI
                        Where did you go last night? After
                        our chat?

                                 JOHN
                        After our chat I went and had
                        another chat with Mum.  Y'know
                        'the slut'.

           JOHN eye's MIMI with the word - suddenly she knows he knows. 
           Her face drops.

                                 MIMI
                        John?

                                 JOHN
                        Yes?

           MIMI wants to ask, can't.  Can't be honest.

                                 MIMI
                        Eat something.

           JOHN gives her a wink.  Leaves.

           MIMI stares down the corridor at FISHWICK, both know their
           secret is out.

         193 INT. PAUL'S HOUSE -- DAY

           PAUL, GEORGE and JOHN sit in the front room, guitars on -
           but practice stopped.  PAUL and GEORGE stare at JOHN, he's
           just told them.

                                 GEORGE
                        So that Fishwick bloke, he's only
                        twenty four...

                                 JOHN
                        I know.

                                 GEORGE
                        What's Mimi?  Fifty?

                                 JOHN
                        Fifty one.
                                 GEORGE
                        So...he's only eight years older
                        than you.

                                 JOHN
                        George!

           GEORGE backs off.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        All those morals.  Judging my Mum. 
                        Judging me.

           Beat.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        And she ends up shagging the lodger.

                                 GEORGE
                        Who's half her age.

                                 JOHN
                           (laddish joke)
                        I'll break your fuckin' hands in a
                        minute Harrison.

           Beat.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        It's all bollocks.  The lot of it.

                                 PAUL
                        Maybe you should just stop caring.

                                 JOHN
                        Eh?

                                 PAUL
                        I mean, what can you do about it?

                                 JOHN
                        It's all there, shoved in my face.

                                 PAUL
                        They both love you right?  Julia
                        and Mimi?

                                 JOHN
                        In their own twisted ways.

                                 PAUL
                        But it's still love?

                                 JOHN
                        'Suppose so.

                                 PAUL
                        Then just take it. And move on. 
                        They are who they are.  Sort your
                        own life out, not theirs.
           Beat.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        They'll never be the people you
                        want them to be anyway.  Most people
                        aren't.

           JOHN nods.  PAUL gets through to him again.

                                 JOHN
                        Just be nice to have a woman in my
                        life who isn't a nutter.

                                 GEORGE
                        More chance of finding The Holy
                        Grail.

           FADE.

           FADE IN:

         194 EXT. MENDIPS -- DAY

           A bright, sunny summers day.

           JOHN pulls up on his bike, hears voices in the back.  POV:
           MIMI and JULIA sat on deck chairs in the garden, taking
           tea.  FISHWICK prunes the privets.

           JOHN - curious.

         195 EXT. MENDIPS/BACK GARDEN -- CONTINUOUS

                                 JULIA
                        Isn't the garden one of John's
                        chores?

                                 MIMI
                        He's not done a chore since you
                        bought him that bloody guitar.

                                 JULIA
                           (mock horror)
                        Mimi!  The language.  What would
                        The Reverend say?

                                 MIMI
                           (smiles)
                        I have my moments Julia.  You'd be
                        surprised.

           JULIA sensing something.  Looks at MIMI who can't keep her
           eyes off FISHWICK.

                                 JULIA
                        I think I probably would.

           JOHN walks around, stands in front of them.  He smiles - a
           bit suspicious.
                                 JOHN
                        Nice day for it?

                                 JULIA
                        A beautiful day for it!  Whatever
                        'it' is.  I've always wondered. 
                        Everything feels so much better in
                        the sunshine.

                                 JOHN
                        Like warmer?

           JOHN looks at them both - waits for an explanation.

                                 MIMI
                        What?  Can't I invite my sister
                        round?

                                 JOHN
                        It's not 'usual' is it?

                                 MIMI
                        Sarcasm John.

                                 JOHN
                        No sarcasm there Mimi.

           MIMI and JULIA shift in their seats.

                                 MIMI
                        Where've you been?

                                 JOHN
                        Pete's. Off to Paul's in a bit.

                                 JULIA
                        You can eat at my house if you
                        want?
                           (to Mimi)
                        If that's OK.

           JOHN looks at MIMI.

                                 MIMI
                           (shrugs)
                        I had nothing special planned.

                                 JOHN
                           (to Julia)
                        At yours for six then.

           He gives them both a wink.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        Stay out of trouble.

           He wanders off inside.
                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                           (To Fishwick)
                        Get to it, Fishy Lad!  Privets
                        don't prune themselves y'know!

           EVERYONE giggles at FISHWICK's expense.

           MIMI turns - makes sure JOHN has disappeared inside the
           house.

                                 MIMI
                        Julia,  I was thinking...maybe
                        it's time...

           MIMI takes a moment - this is so tough for her to say.

                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        ...that John lived with his Mother
                        again.

           JULIA - half in shock.  Let's this sink in.

                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        I mean he's hardly ever here.  He
                        seems to get on with Bobby now...I
                        can still help out financially if
                        needs be.

           MIMI giving JOHN back.

                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        What do you think?

           JULIA nods - emotions welling up.

                                 JULIA
                        I'm thinking how to not cry.

           They share a feint smile.  MIMI reaches for her hand.

         196 INT. PAUL'S HOUSE -- DAY

           PAUL stringing up JOHN's guitar, tuning it.

                                 PAUL
                           (excited)
                        I knew it!  You had a cheeky twinkle
                        in your eye.

                                 JOHN
                        Can't hide my cheeky twinkles.

           Handing the guitar back. 

                                 PAUL
                        What's it's called?

                                 JOHN
                        Guess.
           JOHN launches into 'Hello Little Girl' (The first song he
           ever wrote).  Plays it to the end.

           JOHN checks for PAUL's reaction.  Needs his affirmation.

           PAUL no expression.  Then he just sticks his trade mark
           two THUMBS UP.

         197 EXT. MENDIPS -- DAY

           MIMI walking JULIA to the front gate.  They stop and bask
           in the evening sun.

                                 JULIA
                        Come for tea too.  Hotpot.  Bobby's
                        cooking.

                                 MIMI
                        Thanks...but I've made some soup.

                                 JULIA
                        One day?

                                 MIMI
                        Yes.  One day.

           They embrace.  JULIA almost squeezing the life out of MIMI.

                                 JULIA
                        I think we should ask
                        him...John..together.  Let him
                        make his own decision.

           MIMI smiles graciously, nods.  JULIA opens the gate, heads
           off down Menlove Avenue.  MIMI turns heads back inside.

         198 INT. MENDIPS/KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS

           MIMI walks in to the kitchen where FISHWICK washes his
           hands in the sink.  They fall into each others arms - hungry
           for each others mouths.

           LUST AND LOVE the perfect combination.

         199 EXT. MENLOVE  AVENUE -- CONTINUOUS

           JULIA, a spring in her step, meets NIGEL WALLEY (the band's
           manager who we've seen plenty of times before) on his bike.

                                 NIGEL
                        John in Julia?

                                 JULIA
                        Round at mine, Nigel.

                                 NIGEL
                        Tell him I've got more bookings,
                        'Wilson Hall' and a new one at
                        'Stanley Abattoir Social Club'.
                                 JULIA
                        You'll get slaughtered there.

           SARCY LAUGHS at the bad joke.

           NIGEL breaks off, riding his bike up Vale Road.  He grins
           again at the bad joke.  JULIA, in the background, crossing
           the road - then suddenly the screeching of tyres

           A SPEEDING CAR

           THUMP! 

           JULIA is wiped out.  He body scattered across the road.

         200 INT. MENDIPS/KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS

           MIMI and FISHWICK - heard the noise - frozen.

           THEY KNOW.

         201 INT. JULIA'S HOUSE -- LATER

           'Jail House Rock' plays.  JOHN doing a great Elvis
           impression infront of THE GIRLS who lap it up.  BOBBY in
           the kitchen cooking, singing away too.

           Hear a knock on the door.  JOHN shimmy's over, still
           singing.  Opens up - A SOLEMN LOOKING POLICEMAN.

                                 POLICEMAN
                        Where's your Father son?

                                 JOHN
                        You taking the piss?

           BOBBY arrives behind JOHN.

         202 INT. CASUALTY WAITING AREA -- LATER

           JOHN and BOBBY sprint down the corridors. FISHWICK waiting
           alone  - he stands up - face says it all.

                                 FISHWICK
                        Mimi's with her.

                                 BOBBY
                        Where?

                                 FISHWICK
                        She wanted to be alone...She's...I
                        think she's..

           MIMI walking back with a NURSE.  Ghost white.  JOHN and
           BOBBY stare.

                                 BOBBY
                        Mimi?

           MIMI shakes her head.
                                 BOBBY (CONT'D)
                        Julia....Jesus..

                                 MIMI
                        She died in the ambulance.

           BOBBY breaks down, uncontrollable weeping, he falls into
           JOHN's arms.  FISHWICK tries to take MIMI's hand - she
           shakes it free.  JOHN locks eyes with MIMI, his devastation
           obvious.  No tears.  Frozen inside.

         203 EXT. GRAVESIDE -- DAY

           Julia's COFFIN lowered into the ground amidst a cacophony
           of mourning.

           JOHN, glasses on, (flanked by THE QUARRYMEN) and MIMI,
           (flanked by her SISTERS), stare at each other across the
           grave - opposite sides.  The only one's not crying.

           JOHN throws his 'Kiss Me Quick' hat from Blackpool into
           the grave.  Turns and leaves.

                                 PAUL
                        John...?

                                 JOHN
                           (calm)
                        Need a smoke.

         204 INT. JULIA'S HOUSE -- DAY

           The wake.  House full of NEIGHBOURS, FAMILY and FRIENDS.

           JOHN sits in the living room in between MIMI and the OTHER
           SISTERS.  Crying everywhere.  He holds a large whiskey,
           stares at the pile of records and gramaphone. Nothing is
           real.

           Then he hears the BANJO being played in the kitchen.  His
           face clouds over, necks his whiskey.  Storms in.

           PAUL strumming the BANJO - all THE QUARRYMEN dotted around
           drinking, talking.

                                 JOHN
                        It's not fuckin' band practice!

           He grabs the BANJO Off PAUL, heads outside, holding it by
           it's neck - like a sledgehammer.

                                 PETE
                           (sensing)
                        Don't John!

         205 EXT. JULIA'S HOUSE -- DAY

           JOHN raises the BANJO above his head about to smash it
           down, when PETE catches it - rips it off him.
                                 PETE
                        It's your Mum's!

                                 JOHN
                        Was!  She's fuckin' dead y'mong!

           PETE hangs on tight - and is headbutted, hits the ground -
           still clutching the BANJO.  PAUL rushes out, checks PETE's
           OK.

           JOHN steams off.

                                 PAUL
                        John!

           He runs after him.

         206 EXT. BLOMEFIELD ROAD/JULIA'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

                                 PAUL
                        John!

           PAUL grabs JOHN's shoulder stops him.  JOHN turns round,
           aggression burning through, fists clenched.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        You wanna hit me too? 

           JOHN on the verge.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Hit me!

           BANG!

           JOHN lands a straight right in PAUL's face sending him
           crashing into the road.  PAUL stays down - dazed.  Blood
           spilling from his mouth.

           JOHN remorseful, rushes down to see if he's OK.

                                 JOHN
                        Paul, I'm sorry mate.

           JOHN picks PAUL up in his arms.  Hugs him.  Then suddenly
           that human connection sets him off - A HUG.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        I'm sorry....

           JOHN's floodgates open.  It all comes out.  All the pain
           and anger, the tears that have been kept in for so long.

           PAUL hugs him back.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        I was just getting to know her. 

                                 PAUL
                        I know.
                                 JOHN
                        She's never coming back.

                                 PAUL
                        No...no she's not.

           On JOHN and PAUL in each others arms, lieing in the street -
           crying.

         207 INT. JULIA'S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

           JOHN comes back in with PAUL.  THE QUARRYMEN can tell
           they've both been crying.  JOHN goes upto PETE.

                                 JOHN
                        I'm a dick. Soz.

           JOHN starts crying again.  As does PETE.  Then all THE
           QUARRYMEN start crying.  The whole kitchen at it.  JOHN
           looks around.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                           (through his tears)
                        Right!  Everyone stop fucking
                        crying!  We're meant to be a
                        rock'n'roll band for fucks sake!

           PETE starts giggling, then JOHN...soon the whole room is
           full of watery giggles.

           BOBBY appears from the lounge.

                                 BOBBY
                        John.

           JOHN wanders over.  BOBBY hands him an envelope, with money
           it, near enough three quid.

                                 BOBBY (CONT'D)
                        She was saving this for you...

           JOHN takes the envelope.  Knows exactly what it's for.

           FADE.

           FADE IN:

         208 EXT. VICTORIAN TERRACED HOUSE -- DAY

           Establisher.  Normal house, normal street.

         209 INT. PERCY PHILLIPS RECORDING STUDIO -- DAY

           The middle living room of the house, scattered MICROPHONES
           and HEAVY CURTAINS to drown the passing trains out.

           THE QUARRYMEN sit in position ready for their first
           recording session.  The song:

           'In Spite Of All The Danger'  
           JOHN, PAUL and GEORGE - sit close to the CENTRAL SINGING
           MIC hung from the ceiling.

                                 JOHN
                        I,2,3,
                           (sings)
                        In spite of all the danger...

           Stick with this haunting, melodic, momentous track, on
           this momentous occasion, all the way through to it's end. 
           PAUL singing beautiful harmonies over JOHN's lead.  GEORGE
           takes the guitar solo mid-point.

           THEY get to the end.

           JOHN looks at PAUL.  Both nodding.

                                 PAUL
                        One take wonders, eh?

           PERCY PHILLIPS, 60 YEAR OLD OWNER and engineer barges in
           through the studio door.

                                 PERCY
                        Crack on!  I've got six other groups
                        of stargazers to get through.

           He leaves.

                                 JOHN
                        No choice with that twat.

           Beat.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        OK.  Side B....Ready?

           PAUL nods.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        1,2,3,
                           (sings Buddy Holly)
                        Yeah, that'll be the day when you
                        say goodbye..

         210 EXT. JULIA'S HOUSE -- DAY

           (The Quarrymen's version of Buddy Holly keeps playing over
           the next three scenes).  

           JOHN walks up the path, guitar slung over his back, THE
           NEW RECORD in his hands, he check under the rock - finds
           THE SPARE KEY.

         211 INT. JULIA'S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

           An empty house.

           THE RECORD spinning on the gramaphone - mid song.
           JOHN sat on the sofa - playing and singing along with his
           guitar.  Begins to smile through the words....closes his
           eyes...and he heads off in a dream.....

         212 INT. JULIA'S HOUSE (DAY-DREAM) -- CONTINUOUS

           JULIA is now sat opposite JOHN - she plays along on THE
           BANJO.  John's first band re-united in his head.  Both
           stare and smile at each other as they sing along to what
           is in fact

           THE FIRST BEATLES RECORD

           The instrumental kicks, they get up, jive together.  JOHN
           still with two left feet - both of them giggling, dancing.

           The track finishes, JULIA and JOHN beam into each others
           eyes, holding both hands.

           LOVE.

         213 INT. JULIA'S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

           JOHN finally opens his eyes, still sat on the settee, the
           needle making a jumping noise at the end of the record -
           has been for some time.

           JOHN - a sad smile.

           FADE.

           FADE IN:

         214 EXT. MENDIPS -- DAY

           MIMI, with shopping bags, makes her way upto the front
           door.

           TITLE CARD: AUGUST 1960 

         215 INT. MENDIPS -- DAY

           MIMI lets herself in, smells cig smoke, surprised at seeing
           JOHN, sat in the morning room.  JOHN looks up - sheepish.

           MIMI gives him a look.  Stern, but loving.

                                 MIMI
                        You should have rang.

                                 JOHN
                        We don't have a phone..

                                 MIMI
                        Do you have anything in that dingy
                        flat you call home?

                                 JOHN
                        Ashtrays.
           MIMI wanders down, puts the bag in the kitchen.  Lights
           her own cigarette.  No kisses.  No hugs.

                                 MIMI
                        So, what do I owe the pleasure.

                                 JOHN
                        I'm off to Hamburg...with the band.

           MIMI takes this in (John is still at College).

                                 MIMI
                        Hamburg?

                                 JOHN
                        Germany.

                                 MIMI
                        I l know that John. How long for?

                                 JOHN
                        Couple of months...maybe more.

           MIMI trying not to look affected.

                                 MIMI
                        This with the new band...The..

                                 JOHN
                        ...Beatles.

           Shakes her head in disbelief.  What a stupid name.

                                 MIMI
                        And college?

                                 JOHN
                        Not working out.

                                 MIMI
                           (sarcy)
                        But the guitar is?

                                 JOHN
                        It's not a hobby anymore Mimi.

                                 MIMI
                        You'll never make a living out of
                        it.

           Beat.

                                 MIMI (CONT'D)
                        When do you leave?

                                 JOHN
                        Saturday.

           MIMI a bit taken back. So Soon.
                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        Have you go my birth certificate?
                        I need to get a passport.

                                 MIMI
                           (hurt)
                        Would you have come and said goodbye
                        otherwise?

           JOHN feels guilty.  No.

         216 INT. MENDIPS/MORNING ROOM -- DAY

           MIMI comes from downstairs with John's birth certificate -
           she leaves it on the table.

           JOHN digs in his jacket. Brings out a passport application
           form.

                                 JOHN
                        Can you sign this aswell?

           He sets it out on the table, grabs a nearby pen.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        Where it says 'Parent or Guardian'.

                                 MIMI
                        But I'm really neither am I?

           MIMI signs.

                                 JOHN
                        You're both.

           MIMI - her heart touched. Leans in kisses her gently on
           the cheek.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        Passport office shuts at three.

           He sets off down the hallway.  MIMI, now trying not to
           cry.  Doesn't want him to go.  Wants to reach out.

                                 MIMI
                           (grasping)
                        I love you.

           JOHN

           stops by the front door.  The words he's always wanted to
           hear - but never has - until now.  He doesn't turn round,
           tears in his eyes.

                                 JOHN
                        I'll call you when I get to Hamburg
                        OK?

                                 MIMI
                        OK.
           He quickly opens the front door - and disappears.

           ON MIMI - alone.

         217 EXT. MENDIPS -- CONTINUOUS

           JOHN walks down the path out through the gate.  He takes a
           last look at Mendips, his bedroom window.

           HOME.

           Then sets off down Menlove Avenue towards his REVOLUTION. 
           Let him walk off into the distance.

           Away from us - and into The Beatles .

                                 CAPTION
                        JOHN CALLED MIMI AS SOON AS HE
                        ARRIVED IN HAMBURG....

           The funeral bells of thee primal Lennon track 'Mother'
           ring out.

                                 CAPTION (CONT'D)
                        ...AND EVERY WEEK THEREAFTER FOR
                        THE REST OF HIS LIFE.

           BLACK

                                 LENNON

                        Mother, you had me,
                           (pause)
                        but I never had you,
                           (pause)
                        I wanted you,
                           (pause)
                        you didn't want me,
                           (pause)
                        so I,
                           (pause)
                        I just gotta tell you,

                        Goodbye. 
                           (pause)
                        Goodbye.

           The songs plays out. Roll credits.

           THE END
