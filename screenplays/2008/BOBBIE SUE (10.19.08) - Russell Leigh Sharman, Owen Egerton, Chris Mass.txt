               BOBBIE SUE

                                                               FADE IN:

           EXT. COFAX HOUSE - DAY

           On the front lawn of a working class suburban home, EIGHT 
           strapping, sandy-haired YOUNG MEN line up opposite each other 
           in descending ages from early 20s to 10. 

           By the time we get to the youngest, we can tell these are all 
           brothers and they are about to show no mercy in an informal 
           game of TACKLE FOOTBALL.

           But past the youngest boy, last in the line-up, is little 
           BOBBIE SUE. She’s 8 years old, the only girl. But under that 
           bob haircut is a gameface to put her brothers to shame.

           Her 16 year-old brother, CHIP, lined up opposite her, gives 
           her the EVIL EYE.

                                 CHIP
                        Get ready to eat my dust, Bobbie Sue.

                                 YOUNG BOBBIE SUE
                        I got eight brothers, bitch. Which 
                        one are you?

           DADDY COFAX, paunchy, middle-aged, and dressed in his high 
           school coach’s uniform, hikes the ball and the kids scramble.  

           Chip is HOOFING it, going long. Daddy Cofax lets the ball 
           FLY. Chip lays out his arms, ready to catch the sweetest 
           pass. The ball just TOUCHES his hands, and Bobbie Sue APPEARS 
           two steps ahead of him. She lays down a shoulder, taking the 
           HIT like a man, and Chip goes FLYING end over end.

           Daddy Cofax is all SMILES.

                                 DADDY COFAX
                        Thataway, Bobbie Sue!

           Chip, SPRAWLED on the ground and GASPING for air, looks up to 
           see Bobbie Sue STRUT in close to GLOAT.

                                 YOUNG BOBBIE SUE 
                             (mock concern)
                        You okay, Chip? You know, when you 
                        went end over end like that, I think 
                        I caught a glimpse of your vagina.

                                 CHIP
                        Fuck you, Bobbie Sue.
               BOBBIE SUE

           EXT. COFAX HOUSE - DUSK

           The Cofax boys still PLAY in the front yard. Several of them 
           throw the football, one tries to BURN AN ANT with the last of 
           the sunlight through a magnifying glass, and two just take 
           turns punching each other in the face.

           Daddy Cofax and Bobbie Sue SIT on the front steps of the 
           porch WATCHING the boys with peaceful grins on their faces. 
           Daddy POPS open a BEER and gives Bobbie Sue a SWIG.

                                 DADDY COFAX
                        Bobbie Sue, there’s nothing any of 
                        them can do that you can’t. I want 
                        you to remember that.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Pee standing up?

                                 DADDY COFAX 
                             (shrugs)
                        A little practice...
                             (beat)
                        The point is, people are gonna try 
                        and tell you different. But don’t you 
                        listen.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        I know, Dad.

                                 DADDY COFAX
                        Your mother would be real proud.

           They sit in SILENCE a moment as her brother still tries to 
           catch an ant on fire with a magnifying glass.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Tell me about Mom again.

                                 DADDY COFAX
                        She was just like you...

           Daddy Cofax hesitates with his beer to his lips. An older 
           brother wheels an acetylene tank up to the boy with the 
           magnifying glass, drops a face shield and lights a blow 
           torch. As he FRIES the ant...

                                 DADDY COFAX (CONT’D)
                        ...taller maybe.

           We pull back, revealing each brother performing a stupid feat 
           of masculinity as we launch into a TITLE SEQUENCE...

                                                                CUT TO:
               BOBBIE SUE

           INT. COFAX HOUSE - DAY

           With little Bobbie Sue at his side, Daddy Cofax holds a 
           TROPHY with “SPELLING BEE 1st PLACE” engraved on its base. He 
           places the trophy on the mantle next to a picture of Bobbie 
           Sue. He SMILES down at her and musses her hair.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SCHOOL BUS - DAY

           Bobbie Sue, FIVE YEARS LATER, sits against the window on her 
           way to junior high. A FAT BULLY walks up and SCOWLS at her.

                                 FAT BULLY
                        Move your ass!

           One of Bobbie Sue’s brothers POPS his head above a seat. He 
           nods - Need help? Bobbie Sue WAVES him off. 

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                             (to Bully)
                        Seriously tubs, pretend this is a 
                        buffet line and keep moving.

           With wild-eyed anger, the Bully LUNGES at Bobbie Sue.

           EXT. BOSTON STREET - CONTINUOUS

           The bus PASSES and we see the bully’s face FLATTENED against 
           the glass in anguished pain. Behind him, Bobbie Sue is “death-
           locked” on his crotch, LIFTING him off the seat by his balls.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. COFAX HOUSE - DAY

           On the mantle next to Bobbie Sue’s picture now sits SIX 
           trophies of assorted sizes for a variety of accomplishments: 
           District Wrestling Championship, Debate Team President, State 
           Jr. Marathon 1st Place, etc.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Another FIVE YEARS LATER and Bobbie Sue skims a TEXTBOOK 
           while walking down a crowded high school hallway. Unlike most 
           of the other girls, she sports no make-up or mid-90’s fashion 
           sense, but she does have a striking natural beauty. 
               BOBBIE SUE

           By some lockers, a group of JOCKS terrorize two GEEKS. The 
           ALPHA-JOCK leans with both hands on a BASEBALL BAT. The jocks 
           laugh, and even the Geeks chuckle out of self-preservation. 

           Bobbie Sue passes between the two groups and nonchalantly 
           KICKS the baseball bat from the jock’s hands, he FALLS - THE 
           BAT RAMS INTO HIS NUTS. He CRUMPLES to the floor in pain.

           Ignoring the fallen Jock, the boys all STARE longingly and 
           lustfully as Bobbie Sue WALKS ON still buried in her book.

                                 JOCK
                        Damn she’s hot!

                                 GEEK
                        I heard she was raised by wolves.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. COFAX HOUSE - DAY

           The trophies are MULTIPLYING like rabbits - ten, twelve, 
           fifteen. All different accomplishments: Academic Decathlon 
           National Champion, Boston League Hockey MVP, Speech State 
           Champion. It is beginning to look precarious.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HARVARD LAW SCHOOL - DAY

           Another FIVE YEARS LATER and Bobbie Sue STANDS in an 
           auditorium filled with LAW STUDENTS. The large banner above 
           the stage reads: “HARVARD SCHOOL OF LAW: CLOSING ARGUMENT 
           DEBATE FINALS.” The crowd is in the middle of uproarious 
           APPLAUSE as Bobbie Sue accepts a ridiculously LARGE TROPHY. 
           She HOLDS IT high above her head in victory while her 
           brothers and father WHOOP IT UP in the front row. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. COFAX HOUSE - DAY

           The mantle is now OVERLOADED with trophies. With an adult 
           Bobbie Sue at his side, Daddy Cofax SQUEEZES the new trophy 
           into place, almost PUSHING off several more. After a few 
           adjustments, he steps back and smiles at Bobbie Sue. She 
           wraps her arms around him as he musses her hair.
               BOBBIE SUE

           And then the mantle COLLAPSES under the strain sending 
           trophies CRASHING to the floor.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

           Adult BOBBIE SUE COFAX stands in the middle of the courtroom, 
           and as usual, all eyes are on her. She’s grown to a 
           BREATHTAKING 30 year-old woman. And from the way she commands 
           the room, it is clear she took her Daddy’s advice that she 
           can do anything she sets her mind to.

           Over at the defense table, the DEFENDANT, a middle-aged man, 
           and his two lawyers, JACK and LARRY, look NERVOUS. Jack, 
           young, good-looking, scribbles on a pad as Larry, older, 
           fatter, less hair, leans over to whisper to his client.

           In the witness box, Bobbie Sue’s CLIENT, a frail but 
           attractive woman, waits for her next question.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        And when he gave you the device, did 
                        he explain the risks involved?

                                 CLIENT
                        Risks?

           Bobbie Sue TURNS to her client, feigning surprise.

                                 CLIENT (CONT’D)
                        It was... just a thigh exerciser.

           Bobbie Sue MARCHES over to her table and HOLDS UP a bizarre, 
           rather dangerous-looking contraption.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        A prototype thigh exerciser. Never 
                        tested. Given to you for your 
                        endorsement.

                                 CLIENT
                        He said I could be the next post-
                        career Suzanne Sommers. 

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        And he never explained the risks?

                                 CLIENT
                        No.

           Bobbie Sue sets the thigh exerciser down and STROLLS over 
           toward the jury.
               BOBBIE SUE

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Will you please tell us what happened 
                        when you first used the device?

           Bobbie Sue LEANS on the railing of the jury box and catches 
           the eye of a cute JUROR.

                                 CLIENT
                             (embarrassed)
                        Do I have to?

           Bobbie Sue SMILES at the jury.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        No.

           She gives the cute juror a WINK - he BLUSHES.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        I’ve got photos.

           Bobbie Sue steps to her table and reveals a LARGE POSTER. She 
           sets the poster on an easel in front of the jury. We can’t 
           see what they see, but they all RECOIL IN HORROR.

           INT. COURTHOUSE CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

           Bobbie Sue and her client sit opposite the defendant and his 
           two lawyers.

                                 JACK
                        We’re prepared to settle for five 
                        hundred thousand.

                                 LARRY
                        It’s a sizable offer.

                                 JACK
                        More than you can possibly hope to 
                        get from that jury.

           Bobbie Sue smiles and leans in closer to Jack. 

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Twenty minutes ago, Larry here...
                             (pointing to Larry)
                        offered me fifty bucks for my 
                        underwear.

                                 LARRY
                        What!? Come on, Ms. Cofax!
               BOBBIE SUE

                                 JACK
                        I don’t see how this is relevant.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Hey, if Larry wants to be queen for a 
                        day, it’s fine by me.

           Bobbie Sue pulls out a fifty dollar bill.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        But I’m fifty bucks richer and three 
                        ounces of nylon and lace lighter.
                             (beat)
                        Point is, I know a good deal when I 
                        see one. And five hundred grand is a 
                        slap in the face.
                             (to her client)
                        Come on. We’ll take our chances with 
                        the jury.

           Bobbie Sue stands and we see, for the first time, the client 
           is in a WHEELCHAIR. Bobbie Sue rolls her toward the door. 

                                 CLIENT
                             (whispering)
                        When did you give him your panties?

           INT. COURTROOM - LATER

           The JURY FOREMAN stands to render the VERDICT.

                                 JURY FOREMAN
                        We the jury find for the plaintiff 
                        and recommend one million dollars in 
                        compensatory damages.

           Bobbie Sue LEAPS to her feet, POINTING at the jury.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Yeah, you do!

           She PUMPS her fist and turns to the defense team.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        Suck it! Ain’t no second place in 
                        this house!

           JUDGE JUDITH ROBERTS, a serious-minded, competent judge, 
           BANGS her gavel.

                                 JUDGE ROBERTS
                        Ms. Cofax. Please restrain your 
                        outbursts.
               BOBBIE SUE

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                             (mock respect)
                        If it pleases the court, I’d like to 
                        do a victory lap around the 
                        defendant’s table.

                                 JUDGE ROBERTS
                        It does not please the court. Sit 
                        down.

           Bobbie Sue sits down, but leers at the defendant and his 
           lawyers. POINTING at her CROTCH, she MOUTHS the words, “Suck 
           my dick, bitches.”

                                 JUDGE ROBERTS (CONT’D)
                        Ms. Cofax. I can see you.

           Bobbie Sue faces forward.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Sorry, judge.

           INT. BLIND JUSTICE BAR - NIGHT

           It’s an old school lawyer bar, lots of mahogany, pinstripes 
           and single malt scotch. 

           Bobbie Sue is at the bar, SURROUNDED by other LAWYERS, and 
           still GLOATING. She’s got three drinks in front of her and 
           the thigh exerciser on the bar.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        And he says, “But if you rub it, it 
                        turns into a briefcase.”

           The lawyers all LAUGH and Bobbie Sue POUNDS another drink. 
           One of the lawyers finishes his and FALLS OVER. They all look 
           at him on the floor a moment, then laugh even harder.

           Another lawyer picks the thigh exerciser up from the bar, 
           turning it over in his hands, fascinated.

                                 LAWYER #1
                        How the hell did you get one million 
                        dollars out of this thing?

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        God bless the visual aid, my friend.

                                 LAWYER #2
                        When are you gonna get tired of 
                        chasing ambulances and come work for 
                        the big boys?
               BOBBIE SUE

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        You guys had your chance. 
                             (to Lawyer #1)
                        You tell one dick joke in an 
                        interview and suddenly you’re a 
                        “loose cannon”.

                                 LAWYER #3
                        Come on, you know you want it. 

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        No shit. You think I want to chase 
                        ambulances for the rest of my life? 
                        But who’d have me? I’m damaged goods.

                                 LAWYER #2
                        We’d take you in a heart beat.

           Bobbie Sue smiles and pats Lawyer #2 on the arm.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                             (sarcastic)
                        Aw, that’s sweet. 
                             (beat)
                        But get past the thrill of watching 
                        me in action, and you’ll realize I’m 
                        not the one you bring home to the 
                        senior partners. To them, I’m like 
                        Vegas. Nice place to visit, but you 
                        wouldn’t want to live there.

           Bobbie Sue takes another drink and Lawyer #1 PERKS UP, 
           remembering something important. He turns to Lawyer #2, 
           TALKING OVER Bobbie Sue.

                                 LAWYER #1
                        Hey, what about Fleet Tech’s big 
                        class action suit? What would you 
                        give to be on that team?

                                 LAWYER #2
                        Two hundred women whining about men 
                        running a company with their dicks? 
                        Let me at ‘em.

           The men LAUGH and, feeling excluded, Bobbie Sue FROWNS. But 
           then the crowd parts. She SEES Jack from the courtroom down 
           the bar talking to a gorgeous, younger WOMAN.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Excuse me, boys. Gotta go run that 
                        victory lap.

           As she walks toward Jack, the lawyers all watch her go.
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 LAWYER #1
                        She is a piece of work.

                                 LAWYER #2
                        I feel so cold when she walks away.

                                 LAWYER #3
                        Rumor has it, she was raised by 
                        wolves!

           Lawyer #2 raises an eyebrow - Are you serious?

                                 LAWYER #3 (CONT’D)
                        Well, that’s the rumor.

           Bobbie Sue steps down the bar and slips in between Jack and 
           his date, INTERRUPTING their conversation.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Hey, Jack. Buy you a drink?

                                 WOMAN
                             (angry)
                        Excuse me.

           Bobbie Sue turns to see the woman.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Oh, I didn’t even see you there.
                             (to Jack)
                        She blends in doesn’t she? Fake tan, 
                        dark mahogany.

                                 JACK
                             (annoyed)
                        What are you doing?

                                 WOMAN
                             (to Jack)
                        You know this woman?

           Bobbie Sue puts her arm around Jack and the woman.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Let me buy us all a drink.
                             (to bartender)
                        Frank, two Glenlivets and a Shirley 
                        Temple for the little lady.

           The woman SHAKES OFF Bobbie Sue’s arm and gets to her feet.

                                 WOMAN
                        Who the hell do you think you are?
              BOBBIE SUE

           Bobbie Sue moves in close to the woman.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        I’m the one who cleaned the court 
                        with your would-be one night stand’s 
                        ass today. And from what I can tell, 
                        you’re the set of implants he’s 
                        claiming as a consolation prize. 

                                 WOMAN
                             (to Jack)
                        Are you going to let her talk to me 
                        like that... um...

                                 JACK
                        Jack.

                                 WOMAN
                        ...Jack.

                                 JACK
                             (half-heartedly)
                        Bobbie Sue...

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                             (interrupting)
                        By the way, are they saline or 
                        silicone? Cause if they’re silicone 
                        we have a case.
                             (pulling out a card)
                        Here’s my card.

           The woman is SHOCKED. She looks to Jack, but Jack is no help. 
           The woman STOMPS from the bar. Bobbie Sue turns to Jack.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        She’s cute. I like her.

                                 JACK
                        I did too.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Aw, don’t take it so hard. You would 
                        have been thinking of me anyway.

           INT. JACK’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Bobbie Sue and Jack BURST into his bedroom TEARING at each 
           other’s clothes. Before Bobbie Sue is even indecent, Jack’s 
           pants are around his ankles and she’s CLIMBING on top of him.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Okay, baby. Show me what you got.
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 JACK
                        Oh, I’m gonna show you...

           But before he can finish his sentence, Bobbie Sue lets out a 
           TOE CURLING SCREAM.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                             (confused)
                        Are you all right?

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Oh, yeah. Ohhh, yeah.

           It becomes OBVIOUS Bobbie Sue is DONE.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        Was it good for you?

           Bobbie Sue smiles, dreamy, and gives Jack a little post-
           coital KISS.

                                 JACK
                        Was what good?

           Bobbie Sue is off of him and straightening up her clothes.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Listen, baby. I gotta get up early 
                        tomorrow, so let’s just call it a 
                        night. Okay?

           Jack is SPEECHLESS, sitting on the edge of his bed, his pants 
           still around his ankles.

                                 JACK
                        Are you kidding me? I was just 
                        getting started.

           Bobbie Sue moves in, taking his face tenderly in her hand.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Let’s not spoil it by getting needy. 

           She turns and HEADS for the door.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll call you.

                                 JACK
                             (as the door SLAMS)
                        You don’t even have my number!
              BOBBIE SUE

           EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

           Two POLICE OFFICERS SHOVE a YOUNG MAN into the back of a 
           patrol car. Before shutting the door, they pause AWKWARDLY, 
           allowing the young man his line. He FACES the camera.

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        Sure, I had a few drinks. But 
                        intoxicated? Where’s my justice?

           EXT. STATE SUPREME COURT - DAY

           Bobbie Sue is RUNNING up the steps briefcase in hand. INTENSE 
           music looming. Halfway up she TURNS dramatically. The picture 
           FREEZES on a serious looking Bobbie Sue. The words “CALL 
           COFAX!” FLASH across the screen.

           INT. COUPLES HOME - DAY

           A HUSBAND sits in a RASCAL SCOOTER as his WIFE feebly 
           attempts to PULL him up some stairs. She can’t make the first 
           step. They are HORRIBLE ACTORS. The wife gives up and buries 
           her face in her hands. The husband turns to the camera.

                                 HUSBAND
                        The man said he was a doctor, but he 
                        was just a chiropractor. Where’s my 
                        justice?

           EXT. STATE SUPREME COURT - DAY

           We see the exact SAME SHOT of Bobbie Sue running up the steps 
           and turning dramatically. “CALL COFAX!”

           EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY

           A MAN stands alone on an empty sidewalk FACING the camera.

                                 MAN
                        The bus driver touched my dangly 
                        bits. Now I’m too scared to ride the 
                        bus. Where’s my just...

           The crummy EDITING, unfortunately, CUTS him off.

           EXT. STATE SUPREME COURT - DAY

           The EXACT same footage of Bobbie Sue. “CALL COFAX!” Then the 
           picture unfreezes. Bobbie Sue faces the camera. 
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        I got your justice. I got it right 
                        here.

           She TURNS her head DRAMATICALLY to another camera angle.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        If you’ve been wronged, injured or 
                        mistreated in any way and feel 
                        there’s even the slightest chance you 
                        could get financial compensation, 
                        then call me, Bobbie Sue Cofax. 

           She awkwardly GRINS at the camera and the picture FREEZES. A 
           THEME SONG plays as “CALL COFAX! 617-555-6734” appears.

                                 CHORUS (O.S.)
                        Bobbie Sue will sue for you... Call 
                        Cofax!

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           We pull back from Bobbie Sue’s frozen image to see that it is 
           displayed on a FLAT SCREEN TV in the opulent conference room.

           Sitting at the other end of the room are THREE AGING LAWYERS 
           in leather chairs: REGINALD STEVENS, round, stern-faced; 
           WINSTON SMITH, thinner, older, on the downhill slope to 
           senility; and JOE BAKER, SR., the meanest of the bunch. They 
           are AGHAST at what they’ve just seen.

           JOE BAKER, JR. (35) STANDS before them with a remote in his 
           hand. He’s handsome, immaculate, and soaked with charm.

                                 STEVENS
                        Is this some kind of joke?

                                 SMITH
                             (too loud)
                        I miss radio! 

           Everyone tries to IGNORE Mr. Smith, who’s clearly there in 
           name only. 

                                 JOE
                        It’s no joke, Mr. Stevens. In the 
                        seven years since she left Harvard, 
                        Bobbie Sue Cofax has won every case 
                        she’s ever tried. 
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 STEVENS
                        From what I understand we don’t have 
                        any malpractice or DWI cases on the 
                        books.

                                 JOE
                        Fleet Tech is our largest client. We 
                        billed more than 10 million from them 
                        last year alone. 
                             (pointing at Baker Sr.)
                        Hell, dad plays golf with Bill 
                        Bradley, their CEO, every Sunday.

                                 BRADLEY
                        Joe. What the hell does Bobbie Sue 
                        Cofax have to do with Fleet Tech?

           Joe APPROACHES the stodgy old men gravely.

                                 JOE
                        They’ve got 212 angry women on their 
                        backs, the largest class action 
                        sexual harassment and discrimination 
                        suit in Massachusetts history. We’re 
                        going to have a court room filled 
                        with sniveling man-haters. Who’s 
                        going to face them? 

                                 STEVENS
                        Well, I’m sure one of us could...

                                 BAKER
                             (interrupting)
                        Reginald, you’ve been divorced three 
                        times.

                                 STEVENS
                        Technically, the second was 
                        annulled...

                                 JOE
                        Baker, Stevens and Smith already has 
                        an image problem. We’ve got fewer 
                        female junior partners than any other 
                        law firm in the city. Have you seen 
                        today’s paper?

           Joe TOSSES the Boston Globe onto the table. Smith grabs it, 
           looking at the papaer’s date.

                                 SMITH
                             (shocked)
                        Two thousand and what?!
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 JOE
                        Below the fold.

           Stevens TAKES the paper from Smith and TURNS it over. 

                                 STEVENS
                             (shocked)
                        18th century law firm defends 19th 
                        century company. Baker, Stevens and 
                        Smith is coming out of the dark ages 
                        to defend the reprehensible Fleet 
                        Tech.
                             (beat)
                        They misspelled chauvinist pigs.

                                 BAKER
                             (beating the table)
                        We’ll sue their asses for libel and 
                        poor grammar!

                                 JOE
                        No. We’ll show them how progressive 
                        we are. We need a woman in that court 
                        room. One who thinks like a man.

                                 STEVENS
                        What about Susan Sullivan? 

                                 JOE
                        With all due respect, she’s a tax 
                        attorney. And if she wins, she’ll 
                        expect a promotion. Besides, can you 
                        imagine her in a courtroom?

           The men all CHORTLE. 

                                 SMITH
                             (too loud, still laughing)
                        Laughing makes me winkle!

           INT. BAKER, STEVENS AND SMITH - DAY

           Joe STRUTS out of the conference room and WINKS at ROSALIND 
           WILKS, the prim, middle-aged secretary. She blushes.

           He passes into a large, richly-appointed central hallway. 
           SECRETARIES busy themselves at their desks in the center of 
           the room, occasionally crossing to the lawyer’s offices along 
           the walls. Everything is burgundy and dark wood.

           PHIL (30), a lawyer, sidles up to Joe as he makes his way 
           through the room.
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 PHIL
                        Did they go for it?

                                 JOE
                        You bet your ass.

                                 PHIL
                             (giddy)
                        This is going to be great! Finally, 
                        some excitement around here. No 
                        offense.
                             (beat)
                        Have you seen her commercial?

                                 JOE
                        I just showed it to the old men.

                                 PHIL
                        She is so sexy. Once, I saw her bitch 
                        slap two bikers in a bar fight.  

                                 JOE
                             (quieter)
                        Well, Phil you’ll have to fly stand-
                        by because if we do land her here, 
                        she’s got a round trip ticket on Joe 
                        Air. First class, if you know what I 
                        mean. 

           Phil laughs, and Joe goes with it.

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        Soon after check in, I’ll be looking 
                        to board her immediately...
                             (pauses, thinking)
                        ...so she should return to her seat 
                        cause things are gonna get bumpy.
                             (on a roll)
                        And, after she handles Fleet Tech, 
                        her return flight will be departing 
                        pretty quick...

           Joe motions toward the exits like a flight attendant. Phil 
           STOPS walking, Joe moves on.

                                 PHIL
                             (confused)
                        Is she the plane, or...never mind, 
                        good metaphor!

                                 JOE
                             (calling out to no one)
                        All aboard!
              BOBBIE SUE

           Joe passes his gorgeous, young secretary, LINDA. 

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        Linda, set up a meeting with Bobbie 
                        Sue Cofax.

           Linda reaches for the phone as Joe passes into his office.

           INT. BOBBIE SUE’S OFFICE - DAY

           The cramped office is the POLAR OPPOSITE of the moneyed charm 
           of Baker, Stevens and Smith. Metal file cabinets line the 
           walls, papers cover every flat surface, and the only 
           decoration on the bare white walls are Bobbie Sue’s diplomas. 

           Bobbie Sue TYPES away on an oversized desktop computer when 
           the phone RINGS. She answers.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                             (hi-pitched, feminine)
                        Law offices of Bobbie Sue Cofax. May 
                        I help you?
                             (beat)
                        Let me see if she’s available.

           Bobbie Sue holds the phone away from her ear for a beat, then 
           in her normal, aggressive tone...

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        Cofax here. How can I help?

           Bobbie Sue checks her watch.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        I’m due in court in half an hour. Can 
                        I meet him after?
                             (beat)
                        Great. I’ll have my secretary pencil 
                        him in.

           Bobbie Sue hangs up the phone and stares at it for a beat.

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

           Joe sits in a sparsely filled courtroom gallery watching 
           Bobbie Sue questioning a witness. Judge Roberts once again 
           presides. We have yet to see the witness.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        I find it hard to believe, Ms. 
                        O’Brien, that you were unaware of my 
                        client’s medical condition.
              BOBBIE SUE

           Bobbie Sue gestures to her CLIENT, an obese woman weeping at 
           the prosector's table. Bobbie Sue turns to the gallery.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t think there’s a person here 
                        who doesn’t recognize someone with 
                        hypo-active thyroid leading to morbid 
                        obesity. And yet you...

           Bobbie Sue SPINS, pointing directly at the UNSEEN witness.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        ...Ms. O’Brien, and your 
                        organization, insisted on goading my 
                        client with ungodly manipulation to 
                        purchase and consume your product. 
                        Practically force feeding my client a 
                        product which, it has been 
                        established, is directly linked to 
                        obesity, heart disease and type-two 
                        diabetes. And you did this all in the 
                        name of profit. 

           We finally see the witness chair. A 9 YEAR-OLD GIRL dressed 
           in a GIRL SCOUT UNIFORM sits TERRIFIED.

                                 GIRL SCOUT
                        We were saving up for a trip to the 
                        Smithsonian.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        A sight-seeing vacation. Nice. At 
                        what cost, Ms. O’Brien? At what 
                        cost?!

                                 GIRL SCOUT
                        She loves those thin mints.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        You have the nerve to blame the 
                        victim? 
                             (to Judge Roberts)
                        Permission to treat the witness as 
                        hostile. 

           Judge Roberts SHAKES her head in disbelief. The girl scout 
           starts to WHIMPER. 

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        You should be ashamed to wear that 
                        uniform.

           Joe smiles to himself. He’s impressed.
              BOBBIE SUE

           EXT. COURT HOUSE - LATER

           Bobbie Sue is grinning and shaking hands with her grateful, 
           obese client and turning to walk from the courthouse. Behind 
           her we see the girl scout CRYING into her mother’s arms.

           As Bobbie Sue STRUTS from the court house, Joe walks to her 
           side, keeping perfect stride with her. 

                                 JOE
                        That was quite an impressive 
                        performance, Ms. Cofax.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                             (without looking at him)
                        The truth tells itself. I’m just a 
                        damn fine piece of mouth.

                                 JOE
                        Could I buy you a drink?

           Bobbie Sue GLANCES at him without slowing her pace.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        You work on that line all day? It 
                        feels fresh. 

                                 JOE
                        I’m Joe, Joe Baker, of Baker, 
                        Stevens, and Smith. My secretary 
                        arranged a meeting.

           Bobbie Sue STOPS to shake Joe’s hand, and it is clear it’s a 
           firmer grip than he expected.

                                 BOBBIE SUE 
                        Oh, of course. Guess I expected 
                        someone older.

                                 JOE
                        I’m a junior partner. Dad’s the Baker 
                        of Baker, Stevens and Smith.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Send a boy to do a man’s job, huh?

           There’s an AWKWARD BEAT, then Bobbie Sue BURSTS into a laugh. 
           Joe catches up, laughing too. She slaps him hard on the back.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        How about that drink? 
              BOBBIE SUE

           INT. BLIND JUSTICE BAR - LATER

           The bar is less crowded. Bobbie Sue sits with Joe at a table 
           near the back, a couple of drinks ahead of him.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        I interviewed with you guys my last 
                        year at Harvard. 

                                 JOE
                        Really? I don’t remember...

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Yeah. I did. My half-day interview 
                        took about 15 minutes. 

                                 JOE
                        That’s all yesterday. We’ve been 
                        watching you. Seeing you progress. 
                        Mature. Bloom into one hell of a 
                        lawyer. You’re strong, fierce, and 
                        obviously smarter than just about 
                        anyone in the room.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Wow, Joe. When you kiss ass, you use 
                        tongue.

           Joe smiles, relaxes.

                                 JOE
                        Look. All of that is true. Especially 
                        that part about being smart. You’ve 
                        seen the papers. We need more women 
                        like you.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        More women like me?

                                 JOE
                        Okay. We need at least one woman like 
                        you.

           Bobbie Sue relishes the thought.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Look, Joe, I was never good at poker. 
                        I want the job. I’m not gonna lie. I 
                        never wanted to be out here on my 
                        own. I’m good at what I do, but I’m 
                        getting sick and tired of nickels and 
                        dimes.
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 JOE
                             (surprised)
                        You settled more than three million 
                        in damages last year. That’s a lot of 
                        nickels and dimes.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        What, are you stalking me? Don’t 
                        forget I only get a percentage, and 
                        that’s after counter suits, back door 
                        deals with slippery judges and 
                        overhead. Don’t let the slick 
                        commercial fool you.

           Joe raises an eyebrow - it’s not that slick.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        I work for a living.

                                 JOE
                        I tell you what, come by the office 
                        in the morning. Meet the partners. 
                        See if it feels right. 

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Aw, shit. I know how that goes, Joe. 
                        They’ll take one look at me and think 
                        you’ve lost your mind. Frankly, I 
                        can’t spare the fifteen minutes.

                                 JOE
                        Times have changed, Bobbie Sue. They 
                        already see things my way. The “boy’s 
                        only club” is a thing of the past. 
                        Hell, we might even install a ladies 
                        bathroom in the company gym.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        No need. I pee standing up.

           Joe laughs. So does Bobbie Sue. The moment lingers. Joe’s 
           smile DROPS a little.

                                 JOE
                        You’re serious, aren’t you?

           INT. BOBBIE SUE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Bobbie Sue BURSTS through the door of her modern loft 
           apartment with a celebratory WHOOP! She FLIPS a switch and 
           Under My Thumb by the Rolling Stones BLARES through speakers. 
           She DANCES around her apartment. She’s an awful dancer.
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Who’s the man? I’m the man! Who’s the 
                        man? I’m the man.

           Eventually she turns the music down and DIALS into her phone.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        Dad. I got the break. They finally 
                        came knocking.

           INT. COFAX HOUSE - NIGHT

           Daddy Cofax is older, but basically the same. Behind him we 
           see Bobbie Sue’s rabble of brothers, now all grown men, 
           WATCHING pro-wrestling on television. 

                                 DADDY COFAX
                        Honey, that’s great! I knew those 
                        fuck knots would get wise.

           Behind him we see two of the brothers start to WRESTLE. 

           INT. BOBBIE SUE’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                             (losing some enthusiasm)
                        Yeah, well, tomorrow I meet the 
                        partners. So I still have time to 
                        screw it up.

           INT. COFAX HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Behind Daddy Cofax one of the brothers has another in a 
           headlock and is jumping up and down.

                                 DADDY COFAX
                        Robby, don’t injure his spine. I’m 
                        not paying for another surgery.
                             (to phone)
                        So Bobbie Sue, you like this firm?

           Another brother jumps from the couch on the other two.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (O.S.)
                        Dad, they’re the biggest, oldest firm 
                        in Boston.

           The brother in the headlock reaches out, grabs a half-filled 
           BEER BOTTLE, SMASHES it on the coffee table and STABS his 
           brother in the arm.
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 DADDY COFAX
                        Okay, okay, but do you like them?

           INT. BOBBIE SUE’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Dad, they’re lawyers. No one likes 
                        them.

                                 DADDY COFAX  (O.S.)
                        Is that blood, Chip!? You sew up your 
                        brother right now! 

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        I’ll call you tomorrow.

           INT. UNKNOWN LOCATION - DAY

           Bobbie Sue cozies up to a cup of tea talking with an UNSEEN 
           friend. We may be in a coffee shop...

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Some people find me off-putting. A 
                        little intimidating, especially men. 
                        Honestly, I just treat guys like they 
                        treat me. But I really want this job. 
                        These guys are pros. I mean, they’ll 
                        suck your blood faster than a tick on 
                        a hard-on.

           A WOMAN, also unseen, clears her throat, obviously offended.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                             (to unseen woman)
                        What?

           Bobbie Sue looks back to her “friend” and rolls her eyes.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        Anyway, I feel like this is the break 
                        I’ve been waiting for.

           We pull back to see we are in a nail salon and Bobbie Sue’s 
           friend is a Vietnamese manicurist. 

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        For the first time I feel...

           We see Bobbie Sue from the MANICURIST’S POINT OF VIEW...
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                             (English gibberish)
                        Blah doe ga so ah blah kron blon doa 
                        nop. Gum ploy nape sah blah rapter -

           We’re back on Bobbie Sue, who is really “connecting” with the 
           manicurist.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        You know what I mean? 
                             (sigh)
                        It is so good to talk to someone who 
                        really listens. 

           The manicurist holds up two different polish colors.

                                 MANICURIST
                        Thu phai dac sen?

           Bobbie Sue’s smile deflates. She points out one of the 
           polishes and leans back in her seat. 

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING

           The three partners and Joe sit at one end of the long table. 
           Stevens’ cigar smoke spirals in the low light of the room.

                                 BAKER
                             (into intercom)
                        Send her in, Ms. Wilks.

                                 JOE
                        I should warn you, she can be a 
                        little brash.

                                 STEVENS
                        Ha! A bucking filly, huh? 

                                 JOE
                        Rabid might be a better word.

                                 SMITH
                             (too loud)
                        With turnips!

           The double doors at the far end of the room creak open. 
           Bobbie Sue STEPS IN. She’s dressed in a black business dress 
           which is both intimidatingly professional and breathtakingly 
           sexy. She walks the length of the table, owning the room. 

           She SHAKES the hand of each partner in turn.
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Nice to meet you boys.

           She sits down and inhales deeply.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        Cohiba. Nice.

                                 STEVENS
                        You smoke cigars?

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Only when I’m drinking.

           Everyone LAUGHS.

                                 JOE
                        Too bad it’s 9:30 in the...

           Bobbie Sue STOPS laughing and CUTS Joe off.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                             (interrupting)
                        I don’t mind.

           There’s an awkward PAUSE. Then Baker turns to Joe.

                                 BAKER
                        Joe, pour the lady a drink.

           Joe gets to his feet and walks to the bar as Stevens opens a 
           box of cigars for Bobbie Sue. 

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Make mine neat, would you Joe?

           Stevens lights her cigar.

                                 STEVENS
                        I think I’ll join you. Splash of 
                        water in mine.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                             (cigar in mouth)
                        Water? What’s next, growing tits and 
                        some lactating?

           The men are STUNNED into silence.

                                 SMITH
                             (too loud)
                        A nice rabbit stew!
              BOBBIE SUE

           Bobbie Sue gives Smith a DOUBLE TAKE, but let’s it lie. Joe 
           hands Bobbie Sue her drink.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        So, who wants to hire a lawyer?

                                 BAKER
                        Ms. Cofax. We have a long tradition 
                        of providing the finest legal support 
                        to some of the largest, most 
                        influential corporations in the 
                        world. That means, hiring the very 
                        best lawyers with a range of 
                        expertise.

                                 STEVENS
                        Frankly, we lack a take charge 
                        litigant. No offense to Joe and his 
                        team, but what we need is someone who 
                        knows the law and shows no mercy to 
                        their opponent. Legally speaking.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        No need to soften me up, boys. I’m 
                        already sitting at the table. 

                                 BAKER
                        I presume you’ve heard about our 
                        client Fleet Tech and the recent 
                        class action suit filed against them.

           Bobbie Sue takes the cigar from her mouth and stares hard at 
           the old men.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Yeah. What about it?

                                 STEVENS
                        Well, I think we’d all be interested 
                        in how you might approach such a 
                        case. Given it’s...nature.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                             (slightly mocking)
                        It’s...nature? What? Cause it’s a 
                        bunch of whining women? The law’s the 
                        law, boys and Fleet Tech has the 
                        right to counsel. I do my job, and I 
                        do it better than most. 

           Bobbie Sue sits back, ready to show her skills.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        Tell me what you know.
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 JOE
                        212 female employees are claiming 
                        sexual discrimination against Fleet 
                        Tech.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Yeah, I read the papers. What’s the 
                        damage? How exposed are they?

           Joe sits and slides a thin folder over to Bobbie Sue.

                                 JOE
                        Internal memos show that women were 
                        systematically paid lower wages, 
                        assigned meager tasks, and 
                        purposefully passed over for 
                        promotions again and again. Basically 
                        sexism was the unwritten policy of 
                        the company.

           Bobbie Sue flips through the file.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                             (shaking her head)
                        And the whiny slits want to sue.

                                 SMITH
                             (too loud)
                        Malt liquor?

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Where does Bradley stand?

                                 JOE
                        CEO and majority shareholder. He is 
                        Fleet Tech. And a jury is sure to 
                        despise him. In the last ten years 
                        he’s wriggled out of four separate 
                        sexual harassment suits.

           Bobbie Sue leans over and elbows Stevens.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        I don’t know about you, but I like my 
                        sex a little harassed.

           She closes the file and takes a slow drag on her cigar. She 
           looks the four men in the eyes and switches into game mode.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        Have you counter sued for detriment 
                        of character and frivolent lawsuit?
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 BAKER
                        Might that be seen as a little too 
                        aggressive?

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        You want a wart gone, you burn it 
                        off. I’d recommend filing those suits 
                        this morning and adding individual 
                        suits against each employee 
                        participating in the suit for mental 
                        anguish of our boy. 

                                 STEVENS
                        That would never stand.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Doesn’t have to. Let it get thrown 
                        out. The threat’s enough. Make them 
                        sweat. Women hate to sweat.

           Bobbie Sue SWIGS the last of her drink.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        Next we get those Norma Rae’s off 
                        their Oprah asses and collect some 
                        depositions. With a woman running the 
                        defense, there’s no way they’ll go to 
                        court. We’ll throw them a settlement 
                        bone and go out for steaks.

           Bobbie Sue leans back and smokes her cigar, waiting for the 
           men’s response. For a minute everyone is SILENT. Bobbie Sue 
           can’t tell how she’s been received, but she keeps her cool. 
           Finally Stevens removes his cigar and speaks slowly. 

                                 STEVENS
                        Well, I think we’ve found the perfect 
                        man for the job.

           Smiles all around as Bobby Sue shakes each hand again.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        So when do I start?

                                 JOE
                        The sooner the better. How about 
                        first thing tomorrow morning?

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        I’ll drink to that.

           Everyone laughs.
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                             (suddenly straight-faced)
                        No, seriously.

           She slides her empty glass toward Joe.

           INT. BAKER, STEVENS AND SMITH - DAY

           Bobbie Sue is just leaving the meeting, saying goodbye as she 
           squeezes out. She keeps her composure until the doors close, 
           then does a victory leap and shout witnessed only by the 
           secretary. Ms. Wilks looks at her with disapproval.

                                 MS. WILKS
                        Good meeting?

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Like an ass slap to the soul, Betty.

                                 MS. WILKS
                        My name is Rosalind.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        I’m sure it is.

           Bobbie Sue walks out, ecstatic.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Joe is walking back from the door. Bobbie Sue has just left. 
           He’s smiling at Baker, Stevens and Smith.

                                 BAKER
                        Quite the specimen.

                                 STEVENS
                        I stand corrected, Joe. She’s perfect 
                        for the case.

                                 BAKER
                        She’s certainly full of life...

                                 SMITH
                             (too loud)
                        And spunk...

                                 BAKER
                        And when the case is over...

                                 STEVENS
                        She’s gone...
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 BAKER
                        Is that clear, Joe?

                                 JOE
                        Crystal clear.

                                 SMITH
                        Bury her in Jersey!

                                 BAKER
                        We’re not going to kill her, Smith.

                                 SMITH
                        No, no, no.
                             (brightens)
                        Bury her alive.

           EXT. BAKER, STEVENS AND SMITH - MORNING

           It’s her first day at the new firm and Bobbie Sue is dressed 
           to kill. She pauses for a moment at the large glass doors 
           leading into the building. This is it. She takes a breath and 
           walks in full of purpose and pride.

           INT. BAKER, STEVENS AND SMITH FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           A security guard sits behind a large round desk.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Good morning, Ms. Cofax. Welcome to 
                        the firm.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                             (serious)
                        Morning.

           Once past the guard she allows herself a gleeful smile.

           The elevator doors are just closing, but she swings her 
           briefcase between the doors and steps inside. She stands with 
           FOUR MEN. She can sense their stares. 

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        Like that scent? It’s called 
                        pheromones. God made it.

           INT. BAKER, STEVENS AND SMITH - CONTINUOUS

           The doors slide open and Bobbie Sue steps out into the 
           bustling offices of Baker, Stevens and Smith. 
              BOBBIE SUE

           LAWYERS and their SECRETARIES are busy with morning office 
           work, typing notes, briefing lawyers, delivering paperwork.

           Bobbie Sue is greeted at the elevator by HUNTER PUNTS (25) 
           handsome, smiley and slightly effeminate. 

                                 HUNTER
                        Ms. Cofax, good morning. I’m Hunter. 
                        Your office is this way.

           He leads her past the desks and down the hall. Heads turn and 
           the murmuring starts. Bobbie Sue notices the curious looks 
           but keeps her game face on. 

           They pass Phil and RICH (32), a confident young lawyer and 
           one of the only black employees of the firm.

                                 RICH
                        She looks younger than on the ad.

                                 PHIL
                        If she gives me half a chance, I’m 
                        going to cheat on my wife.

           Hunter is walking fast, handing her papers as they walk.

                                 HUNTER
                        So the new schedule will arrive by 
                        ten. I’ve set an appointment with 
                        your prosecuting team for tomorrow 
                        lunch... and here’s your office.

           Hunter opens the office door and Bobbie Sue steps in.

           INT. BOBBIE SUE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           The floor to ceiling window overlooks downtown Boston. A 
           large polished oak desk sits in the center of the room. 
           Hunter pauses and allows Bobbie Sue a moment to absorb it 
           all. She walks to the window and stares out.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                             (to herself)
                        Welcome to the big league.

                                 HUNTER
                        The latest briefs are on your desk. 
                        Do you need anything else?

           Bobbie Sue turns to Hunter.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Great. No. Thanks....who are you?
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 HUNTER
                        Hunter. Hunter Punts.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Yeah, heard that, but who are you? 

                                 HUNTER
                        I’m your office assistant.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        I have a secretary?!

                                 HUNTER
                        I prefer the term office assistant.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                             (overlapping)
                        You people have any coffee in this 
                        place? I take mine black. The 
                        stronger the better.

                                 HUNTER
                        No problem.

           As Hunter places a folder on her desk, Bobbie Sue gives him a 
           slap to his butt. 

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        And see if you can find me a bagel.

           Hunter huffs and heads out. Bobbie Sue plops down in her 
           leather chair and throws her feet onto the desk.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        Bobbie Sue, you have arrived...

           Bobbie Sue leans too far back and the chair falls over. 
           Hunter reenters and Bobbie Sue pops up from behind the desk.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        And... uh, order a new chair. This 
                        one’s broken.

           Cake’s Short Skirt Long Jacket erupts onto the sound track as 
           we cut to...

           INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

           She laughs along with a table full of male LAWYERS. She slaps 
           one on the back, and he spits up his scotch.

           INT. BOBBIE SUE’S OFFICE - DAY

           She sits on her desk skimming a volume of case histories, but 
           manages to catch a lingering glimpse of Hunter’s ass as he 
           walks from the office.

           INT. COPY ROOM - DAY

           She passes a MALE INTERN bent over a copier. She’s engrossed 
           in a file, but the intern JUMPS from an unseen pinch on his 
           ass. He turns to see Bobbie Sue. She blows him a kiss.

           Bobbie Sue struts down the hall as SUSAN SULLIVAN, mid-40s, 
           tall, attractive, appears from an office. Phil sidles up to 
           her. The music fades to the background as they both watch 
           Bobbie Sue disappear down the hall.

                                 SUSAN
                        That’s her?

                                 PHIL
                        Every inch of her.

                                 SUSAN
                        My kind of woman.

                                 PHIL
                        What? No. 
                             (confused, deflated)
                        Really?

           Susan shakes her head and frowns at Phil.

                                 SUSAN
                        Trust me.

           INT. BAKER, STEVENS AND SMITH - DAY

           The music slams back into the foreground as Bobbie Sue steps 
           from her office. From the looks of it, it’s a HOT DAY in the 
           office, as she walks in SLOW-MOTION towards the water cooler. 
              BOBBIE SUE

           Gawking male interns STOP mid-stride, lawyers PEEK from their 
           doors. 

           Bobbie Sue seductively THROWS BACK her head and lets the 
           water FALL from the cup to her mouth.

           Phil leans on his door frame, RUBBING his face.

           Bobbie Sue POURS water over her hair, face and chest.

           Rich’s eyes nearly EXPLODE, as he DROPS a stack of papers. 

           Bobbie Sue gargles water, SHOOTING streams up as if her mouth 
           were a fountain.

           Phil’s jaw DROPS. He SLAMS a fist against his door frame. A 
           distracted intern WALKS HIS CROTCH into the corner of a desk. 

           Bobbie Sue, SEEMINGLY UNAWARE of the scene she’s causing, 
           WALKS BACK to her office as the music slowly fades out.

           INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

           Joe Baker is sitting with Phil and Rich. The three are 
           enjoying a business lunch of lobster and martinis.

                                 PHIL
                        She’s like a Wonder Woman woman.

                                 JOE
                        A what?

                                 PHIL
                        You know. Wonder Woman’s tribe.

                                 RICH
                        Amazons?

                                 PHIL
                        Was that it? That doesn’t sound 
                        right.

                                 RICH
                        Wonder Woman was an Amazon.

                                 PHIL
                        Okay fine, point is, she’s hot.

                                 JOE
                        She’s okay.

                                 RICH
                        She’s a little uppity.
              BOBBIE SUE

           Joe and Phil glance at Rich but say nothing.

                                 PHIL
                        She scares me. In a tingly way.

                                 JOE
                        I’ll let you know what she’s like.

                                 RICH
                        You and her?

                                 PHIL
                        Susan said...

                                 JOE
                             (interrupting)
                        She’s wrong. Give me a week. I’ll hit 
                        it.

                                 PHIL
                        Do I hear, “office pool”? 

                                 RICH
                        I want in on that...the bet, I mean. 

                                 PHIL
                             (to Joe)
                        One week would be some crazy odds. 
                        Even for you.

                                 JOE
                        I’ll cover the spread...like a hot 
                        slice of man toast with a side crock 
                        of butter. If you know what I mean...

           Phil and Rich laugh half-heartedly, but Joe is on a roll.

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        Odds are she’ll be play’n the one-
                        armed bandit, and the house always 
                        wins. ‘Cause Vegas knows who “shaves” 
                        the points. It’ll be all comp’d hotel 
                        rooms and limos.

           Joe rolls some air dice.

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        All aboard!

           INT. BOBBIE SUE’S OFFICE - LATER

           Bobbie Sue is working through a pile of papers, head down. 
           Susan appears in her doorway.
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 SUSAN
                        Well, hello.

           Bobbie Sue looks up. 

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Can I help you?

           Susan steps inside. Bobbie Sue stands and shakes her hand.

                                 SUSAN
                        I’m Susan. Susan Sullivan.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Bobbie Sue Cofax.

                                 SUSAN
                        Right, the new hot shot litigator. 

           Bobbie Sue takes her seat and Susan moves closer, sitting on 
           the corner of Bobbie Sue’s desk.

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m a tax attorney, but I have a 
                        feeling we play for the same team.

           Susan raises her eyebrows. Bobbie Sue is all smiles.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        You guys have a league? Tell me it’s 
                        kickball, I hear it’s making a 
                        comeback.

                                 SUSAN
                             (mildly flustered)
                        No, I mean...
                             (suggestive, leering)
                        We have the same specialty.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        I know nothing about tax law.

           Bobbie Sue frowns. So does Susan.

                                 SUSAN
                        You’re not a member of the tribe?

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Excuse me?

                                 SUSAN
                        Don’t speak in tongues?
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                             (confused)
                        What are you talking...

                                 SUSAN
                        Not a Lesbyterian?

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Uh...I’m Catholic.

                                 SUSAN
                        You’re not a sister of Dorothy?

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Is she in accounting?

                                 SUSAN
                        So you’ve never plugged the dyke?

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                             (confused)
                        Like the Little Dutch Boy?

                                 SUSAN
                             (excited)
                        Yes!

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        No.

           Susan is off the desk, FRUSTRATED. 

                                 SUSAN
                        You’re not a todger dodger, a bean 
                        flicker, muff muncher, kitty puncher, 
                        a Jodi Foster fan?

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        I like Jodi Foster.

                                 SUSAN
                        Really, really like her?

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        She was good in Sommersby. Man, that 
                        Richard Gere is hot.

           INT. BAKER, STEVENS AND SMITH - DAY

           Susan STORMS OUT of Bobbie Sue’s office with Bobbie Sue 
           TRAILING after her.
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Let’s do lunch sometime!

           Susan is GONE. Bobbie Sue SHRUGS and heads back to her desk.

           INT. OFFICE GYM - DAY

           Joe, Rich and Phil are JOGGING around the indoor track.

                                 PHIL
                        Everything is different. In the 
                        mornings I put on my clothes and 
                        wonder, “Will she like these colors?”

                                 JOE
                        Nothing’s changed. You’re still a 
                        freak.

                                 RICH
                        I don’t like it. This is a man’s 
                        firm. I don’t mind women having their 
                        own firms. Separate. But the 
                        same...equal, you know?

           Joe and Phil give Rich another look. Phil leans over to Rich.

                                 PHIL
                        You know you’re black, right?

                                 RICH
                             (shaking his head)
                        That’s some racist shit, man.

                                 PHIL
                             (to Joe)
                        Hey, the office bookie posted the 
                        odds. Ten to one, you bag her in the 
                        first week.

                                 JOE
                        What? That’s crazy. That red-headed 
                        intern from the seminary was seven to 
                        one. What about precedent?

                                 PHIL
                        It’s a whole new ballgame. Hell, week 
                        two is still at five to one. 

                                 JOE
                        It just means when I win, I win big.
              BOBBIE SUE

           INT. OFFICE GYM LOCKER ROOM - LATER

           Joe, Rich and Phil UNDRESS by the lockers.

                                 PHIL
                        Maybe I’ll wear the dark grey suit 
                        tomorrow. I bet she likes earth 
                        tones. 

                                 JOE
                        Pin stripes. GQ says vertical lines 
                        are slimming.

           Bobbie Sue WALKS OUT of the showers DRAPED in a towel.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Pinstripes are for Yankees fans. 

           The three men JUMP and throw hands over their PRIVATES. 

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        It’s not what you wear, it’s how you 
                        wear it.

           She slaps Phil’s ass as she walks past and into the lockers. 
           Phil smiles.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Hit those showers, boys. First round 
                        is on me.

           INT. BLIND JUSTICE BAR - NIGHT

           The bar is PACKED, the drink is flowing and the music is 
           pounding. Phil is in a corner pressing his mouth into a cell 
           phone, trying to talk over the music.

                                 PHIL
                        Honey, no. It’s work. A big case. 
                        I’ve got to stay... Yes, I’m at a 
                        bar. I’m collecting evidence... 
                        you’ve seen Law and Order...

           At a nearby table Bobbie Sue sits with Joe, Rich and a 
           handful of other LAWYERS from the firm.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Then the farmer hears, “A good 
                        goat’ll do that.”

           The table ERUPTS in laughter. Joe just stares, smiling at 
           Bobbie Sue. He’s obviously planning his move. 
              BOBBIE SUE

           INT. BLIND JUSTICE BAR - LATER

           Standing at the bar, Bobbie Sue is ordering another scotch. 
           Joe SQUEEZES next to her.

                                 JOE
                        Hey, Cofax! This place is getting a 
                        little crowded. Might be time for a 
                        change.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        What do you have in mind?

                                 JOE
                        My place, few drinks.
                             (leering)
                        You’re dreams coming true.

           There is a long beat, then Bobbie Sue BURSTS out laughing. 
           Joe offers a chuckle, but Bobbie Sue is really letting loose. 

           She has to GRAB the bar to steady herself, laughing right in 
           Joe’s face. Joe is no longer in on the joke. Her scotch 
           arrives and she TURNS back to the table.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Hey, guys! You’ve got to hear this...

           Joe STAYS by the bar, trying to DISAPPEAR.

                                 JOE
                             (to himself, defeated)
                        All aboard...

           INT. BLIND JUSTICE BAR - LATER

           Like Marian in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, Bobbie Sue sits 
           across from Rich, several rounds into a DRINK OFF. Lawyers 
           CROWD around.

           Bobbie Sue, VERY DRUNK, slowly lifts a shot. She HESITATES, 
           resting her head on the back of her hand. The lawyers, 
           thinking the bout is over, start SETTLING bets.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Wait! Wait.

           She shoots back the shot and SLAMS the empty glass upside 
           down on the table. Rich SMILES and lifts his next shot. His 
           hand TREMBLES. He sips the drink down. 

                                 RICH
                        Jesus was a black man.
              BOBBIE SUE

           Rich FALLS to the floor, STILL smiling. Bobbie Sue JUMPS UP 
           in VICTORY. She collects her winnings, HOLDING them up.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Who wants a margarita!?

           The lawyers all CHEER.

           INT. BAKER, STEVENS AND SMITH - MORNING

           It’s the next morning. All the lawyers CRAWL into work with 
           killer HANGOVERS. The office looks like a WAR RECOVERY 
           HOSPITAL. GROANS fill the air. One INTERN fights a GAG REFLEX 
           as he swigs from a bottle of Peptobismal.

           Baker, Stevens and Smith walk from the elevator. They’re 
           SHOCKED at the shape of their lawyers.

                                 STEVENS
                        My God, what happened?

           Coming from behind is Joe. He looks as bad as everyone else.

                                 BAKER
                        You too? Is everyone a wreck? We have 
                        depositions today. Where’s Cofax?

           In the background, Smith grabs the bottle of Peptobismal from 
           the intern and starts to chug it.

                                 JOE
                        I doubt you’ll see her today. 

           The elevator DINGS, making Joe FLINCH in pain. Out BOUNCES 
           Bobbie Sue looking FRESH and AWAKE.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Morning, everyone!

           The office CRINGES at the volume of her voice.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        Let’s get to lawyering!

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

           Bobbie Sue sits across the table from two lawyers, SARAH 
           BOYD, competent, no nonsense, and WILLIAM PRAIL, nerdy, 
           intelligent. 
              BOBBIE SUE

           Between them is SERENA NORMAN, an attractive, blue-collar 
           worker. Serena DABS A TEAR from one eye. Bobbie Sue SEEMS 
           very sympathetic and understanding.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Wow, I didn’t even know that term 
                        could be meant as sexual, I’ll have 
                        to remember that.

           Bobbie Sue JOTS down the term...for future use.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        So, what was the final straw? What 
                        made you decide you’d had enough?

                                 SERENA
                        When they asked some of the girls to 
                        pose for a calendar. They said it was 
                        for The Don McDonald House.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Who’s Don McDonald?

                                 SERENA
                        I thought it was the clown, you know, 
                        the one who helps sick little kids. 
                        But it was just this guy in shipping 
                        who wanted a calendar of some of the 
                        girls.

           Bobbie Sue PICKS UP the CALENDAR on the table to PERUSE it.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        He wasn’t even sick!? 

           Our attention DRIFTS to a LARGE MIRROR behind Bobbie Sue.

           INT. LISTENING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Joe and the three old men stand before the TWO-WAY MIRROR 
           watching Bobbie Sue work. 

                                 BOBBIE SUE (O.S.)
                        That’s not right.

           Baker and Stevens are NOT HAPPY as they watch Bobbie Sue hand 
           Serena a tissue. 

                                 STEVENS
                        Who the hell’s side is she on!?

           Smith PICKS up a REMOTE CONTROL and POINTS it at the mirror.
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 SMITH
                             (too loud)
                        It’s on every channel!

                                 BOBBIE SUE (O.S.) 
                        Hey, look you’re Miss June.

           Joe, still hung-over, SQUINTS.

                                 JOE
                        Why must everyone yell?

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Serena WIPES her eyes as Bobbie Sue, from across the table, 
           PATS her other hand.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        I mean if this Don guy in shipping 
                        would have been sick and the calendar 
                        was to help raise monies for his 
                        recovery, that’s one thing right?

                                 SERENA
                        I guess.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Because nude pictures like that are 
                        okay, as long as the cause is worthy 
                        enough...

           Serena NODS, but Sarah, her attorney, is CATCHING ON.

                                 SARAH BOYD
                        Look, my client is not here...

           Bobbie Sue CUTS HER OFF.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        You grew up in South Boston, right?

                                 SERENA
                             (suspicious)
                        Yeah.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Hey, don’t get me wrong. I’m a 
                        Southie, too. 

                                 SERENA
                        Really? 
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        We’ve both come a long way.

           Serena NODS, as Bobbie Sue LOOKS AROUND at the plush 
           conference room.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                             (pointing to Prail)
                        I mean that guy’s suit is worth more 
                        than two months of my old man’s 
                        salary.
                             (to Prail)
                        You got robbed. No offense.

           Both Bobbie Sue and Serena LAUGH. Bobbie Sue LEANS IN.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        Where we’re from, we girls use what 
                        we got. Am I right?

           Serena, TRUSTING Bobbie Sue, gives a little shrug.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        And you’ve got a lot more than most 
                        girls in South Boston.

                                 SERENA
                        What do you mean?

           Bobbie Sue POINTS to Serena’s BREASTS.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Don’t tell me you haven’t relied on 
                        the twins a time or two to help out.

           Sarah Boyd goes to SPEAK but Bobbie Sue HOLDS UP a hand.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        I mean, your looks have guys stop, 
                        and hold the door open for you.

                                 SERENA
                        Sure.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        And at work, it’s probably helped 
                        open a door or two there, right? 

           Bobbie Sue HOLDS UP the calendar.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        I mean versus, let’s say, Miss July?
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 SERENA
                        Mary Chenowith? She’s a bitch and 
                        that’s been photoshoped. And yeah, 
                        this...
                             (indicating her figure)
                        ...is going to get farther than that 
                        fat cow.

           With that, Serena’s lawyers DROP their heads and Bobbie Sue 
           GRABS her stuff and HOPS UP to leave.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        No further questions, see you at the 
                        next one.

           Serena is CONFUSED by the abrupt ending, she LOOKS to her 
           lawyers. Bobbie Sue is already out the door.

                                 SERENA
                        What? She’s a cow.

           INT. LISTENING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The men are ALL SMILES with Bobbie Sue’s performance. 

                                 JOE
                        I told you. She’s like a ninja.

           INT. BOBBIE SUE’S OFFICE - LATER

           Linda, Joe’s secretary, leans over Bobbie Sue’s desk. Bobbie 
           Sue busily signs several documents as Linda waits patiently.

                                 LINDA
                        I just don’t understand why he hasn’t 
                        called.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                             (without looking up)
                        What time is it?

                                 LINDA
                        Five o’clock.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                             (rolling her eyes)
                        The Red Sox are in Anaheim.

           Bobbie Sue looks up and Linda gives her a blank stare.
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        They’re kicking ass at eighty-four 
                        and fifty for the season and they’re 
                        only a game and a half behind the 
                        Yankees. 

                                 LINDA
                        Are we still talking about my 
                        boyfriend?

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        The game started an hour ago. He’s 
                        not gonna call for another two hours 
                        at least.
                             (beat)
                        Don’t confuse team loyalty for 
                        disinterest in you. Classic chick 
                        mistake.

           Linda still pouts, taking it in. Bobbie Sue looks down and 
           signs the last document.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry. Lester’s on the mound. 
                        He’ll call at 7:30. Guaranteed.

           Joe breezes through the door.

                                 JOE
                        Great work today, Bobbie Sue.

           Linda gathers up the documents.

                                 LINDA
                             (quietly)
                        Thanks, Bobbie Sue.

           Linda hurries out as Joe saunters up to Bobbie Sue’s desk and 
           picks up the Don McDonald calendar.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        It was a piece of cake. Just because 
                        I don’t act like a sniveling priss 
                        doesn’t mean I don’t know how they 
                        think.

           Joe, HEAD COCKED SIDEWAYS, is DISTRACTED by the calendar. 

                                 JOE
                        So, what are your plans tonight?

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        I usually like to spend time gloating 
                        in victory...
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 JOE
                        Why don’t you join me at the club? 
                        It’s a hell of a lot nicer than that 
                        dive bar you hang out in.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        The Club? 
                             (mocking)
                        Do you have a secret password and 
                        everything?
                             (beat)
                        And what do you mean “dive bar”. Beer 
                        costs 10 bucks at that place.

                                 JOE
                        Well, the beer is free at the club.

           Bobbie Sue STARES him down for a beat.

                                 BOBBIE SUE 
                        What time should I be there?

                                 JOE
                        We’ll be there at eight.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        I’ll be there at seven. 
                             (beat)
                        And hey, do I have to be a member of 
                        this thing?

                                 JOE
                        You already are.
                             (beat)
                        And maybe afterwards you and I can 
                        make a little club of our own. What 
                        do you say?

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        I think you’ll have better luck with 
                        the calender

           Joe TRIES to act surprised that he still has it. He sets it 
           on her desk and heads to the door. 

           INT. HUNTER’S DESK - CONTINUOUS

           Joe is out by Hunter’s desk. The area is bustling with 
           people. Bobbie Sue comes over Hunter’s INTERCOM.
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 BOBBIE SUE (O.S.)
                        Humper, make Joe a copy of the girly 
                        calendar from the Fleet Tech case. 
                        He’d like it for some hands on work.

           The dozen or so EMPLOYEES within ear shot LOOK at Joe. Joe 
           QUICKLY heads for his office. Hunter smiles.

                                 HUNTER
                             (calling after Joe)
                        You want color or black and white?

           EXT. THE CLUB - NIGHT

           It’s a dim-lit BROWNSTONE on BEACON HILL. A limousine pulls 
           up to the curb, and an elderly couple in formal attire steps 
           out of the building and heads for the car.

           INT. THE CLUB FOYER - NIGHT

           The cozy foyer of the club reeks of money. Bobbie Sue PUSHES 
           through the front door and takes it in - she’s impressed. A 
           humorless HOST beckons from behind a podium.

                                 HOST
                        May I help you?

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Yeah. Is this “the club”.

                                 HOST
                        Your name, please.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Bobbie Sue Cofax.

                                 HOST
                        Oh yes. 
                             (disdain)
                        I’ve seen your commercial.

           As the host SCANS a list...

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        If you could just point me in the 
                        direction of the free beer.

                                 JOE (O.S.)
                        Bobbie Sue.

           Bobbie Sue turns to see Joe approaching. The Host looks up.
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 HOST
                        You can go right in, Ms. Cofax.

                                 JOE
                        You look delicious. We were just 
                        sitting down to dinner. Why don’t you 
                        join us?

           INT. THE CLUB RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Bobbie Sue sits with Joe, Baker, Stevens and Smith at an 
           elegant table in a quiet, luxurious dining hall. Bobbie Sue, 
           as usual, is anything but quiet.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        And he says, I just fucked your cat 
                        and shit in your purse. I’m done!

           There is a moment of SHOCKED SILENCE... then the table ERUPTS 
           in laughter. 

           Stevens SLAPS Bobbie Sue on the back, and Bobbie Sue slaps 
           him back so hard he stops laughing. 

                                 BAKER
                        Ms. Cofax, I must say I misjudged 
                        you. The way you handled that 
                        deposition... it was masterful.

                                 STEVENS
                        You keep that up and those simpering 
                        man-haters will be begging to settle.

                                 SMITH
                             (too loud, to Bobbie Sue)
                        And I have an excellent tailor!

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Boys, boys, enough. You’re 
                        embarrassing yourselves. Anyone of 
                        you could have done the same, if you 
                        had the balls to speak truth to 
                        weakness. I’m just laying it out like 
                        I see it, and damn if most of the 
                        time people don’t see it the same 
                        way.

                                 JOE
                        I don’t think just anyone could...

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Maybe I got something in common with 
                        the plaintiffs. 
                                 (MORE)
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT'D)
                        Maybe we share the same plumbing. But 
                        that only gets you so far.

           Bobbie Sue LEANS IN, conspiratorially.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        Let’s face it, Fleet Tech isn’t the 
                        exception. They just got caught with 
                        their pants down. 

           The men stare in STUNNED silence, searching for something to 
           say, when BILL BRADLEY (60) appears at their table.

                                 BILL BRADLEY
                        Evening boys. 

                                 BAKER
                             (relieved)
                        Bill!

                                 BILL BRADLEY
                             (nodding at Bobbie Sue)
                        Is this our new secret weapon I’ve 
                        been hearing so much about?

                                 BAKER
                        I’d like you to meet...

           Bobbie Sue is on her feet and shaking Bill’s hand.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Bobbie Sue Cofax.

                                 STEVENS
                        You’re in good hands, Bill.

           Bill looks down at Bobbie Sue’s hand, still holding his.

                                 BILL BRADLEY
                        I can see that.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Oh, you old dog. No wonder those 
                        women are suing you for everything 
                        you’ve got!

           Bill HESITATES, then LAUGHS, and the others laugh with him.

                                 BILL BRADLEY
                        I was just heading for the lounge.

                                 BAKER
                        We’ll join you.
              BOBBIE SUE

           INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT

           Bobbie Sue STROLLS with the men down the plush hallway. She 
           is still at Bill Bradley’s side.

                                 BILL BRADLEY
                        I love women. Too much. And I want to 
                        see them succeed. But on their own 
                        merits, you understand. Call me old 
                        fashioned, but I believe equality is 
                        something you earn.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Tell that to the founding fathers.

           The group pauses in front of a door marked, MEN’S LOUNGE.

                                 BILL BRADLEY
                        What do you mean?

           Before Bobbie Sue can respond, Baker butts in.

                                 BAKER
                        Well, this is where we part ways.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Part ways?

                                 BILL BRADLEY
                        Pleasure was mine.

                                 STEVENS
                        See you at the office, Cofax.

           Baker, Stevens, Smith and Bradley all turn into the door, as 
           they disappear inside we hear...

                                 BAKER 
                        She’s got a good head on her 
                        shoulders.

                                 BILL BRADLEY
                        And a nice rack below them...

           Joe steps BETWEEN Bobbie Sue and the door.

                                 JOE
                        The ladies lounge is right over 
                        there.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Ladies lounge?
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 JOE
                        It’s old fashioned, I know. They’re 
                        basically the same. Just separate.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Are you kidding me?

                                 JOE
                        It’s tradition. Don’t worry. You’ll 
                        have a great time. The drinks are 
                        just as free in the ladies lounge.

           INT. THE LADIES LOUNGE - NIGHT

           The ladies lounge resembles a women’s nursing home. Those not 
           dozing off are playing cards, knitting, chatting loudly. 

           A few younger LAWYERS and WIVES are sprinkled in, but mainly 
           it’s the OLD MATRIARCHS.

           Bobbie Sue breezes in and it all goes QUIET - the ones not 
           sleeping, stare at her.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Aww, fuck me.

           Susan APPEARS at Bobbie Sue’s side.

                                 SUSAN
                        Best offer I’ve had all night.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        I need a drink.

           INT. THE LADIES LOUNGE - LATER

           Bobbie Sue, a LIT CIGAR in her mouth, and Susan sit at a card 
           table surrounded by drinks and stodgy old ladies in various 
           states of undress.

           From what we can tell, they are all DRUNK and halfway through 
           a game of strip-bridge. And with all that free beer, Bobbie 
           Sue is finally starting to slur her words.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        So, the guy says, look lady...

           She’s cut off by MRS. STEVENS, who’s down to a BRA and 
           BLOOMERS.
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 MRS. STEVENS
                        Is this the joke about the feline 
                        defecating in the handbag?

           Bobbie Sue, JAZZED for the punch-line, is DEFLATED.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Yes. Well, actually no, the cat 
                        doesn’t... never mind.

           Bobbie Sue THROWS down her cards, FRUSTRATED. She looks at 
           Susan, who by the looks of it, is VERY BAD at Bridge.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        Free beer or not, this is bullshit. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Yeah. I suck at this game.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        No, this separate lounge crap. I 
                        mean, what are they doing in there?

                                 OLD LADY 
                        That’s what they always ask about us.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        But aren’t you tired of being 
                        shuttled off to the ladies lounge?

                                 OLD LADY #2
                        That’s the way it’s always been.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        My god, you sound like sheep.

           Bobbie Sue is on her feet.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        Well, I’m not going to take it.
                             (beat)
                        Who’s with me?

           One old lady THROWS down her cards.

                                 OLD LADY #3
                        Count me in!

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        All right! Who else?

           The half-naked women all look at each other. 
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 SUSAN
                        Bobbie Sue. I don’t think this is 
                        such a good idea.

           Mrs. Stevens throws down her cards and gets to her feet, 
           INDIGNANT and PANTLESS.

                                 MRS. STEVENS
                        Come on, girls! Let’s show ‘em who 
                        wears the pants in this joint!

           INT. THE CLUB - CONTINUOUS

           Bobbie Sue leads a dozen half-naked LADIES through the club, 
           crouching behind potted plants and sneaking around corners.

           They reach the door to the men’s lounge, and Bobbie Sue 
           notices a display of VINTAGE PISTOLS on the wall. She 
           wrenches one loose and turns to find the Host between her and 
           the door to the lounge.

                                 HOST
                        Excuse, me, Ms. Cofax. But where do 
                        you think you are...

           Before he can finish, Bobbie Sue CLOCKS him with a round 
           house PUNCH and lays him out cold.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Come on, girls!

           And they all rush through the door.

           INT. MEN’S LOUNGE - NIGHT

           The MEN are all seated in plush leather chairs or around 
           poker tables. Joe, along with Baker, Stevens, and Bill 
           Bradley, are sipping scotch on a set of leather sofas. Smith 
           is fast asleep.

                                 BAKER
                        Joe, it’s physically impossible. She 
                        has to sit down to do it.

                                 STEVENS
                        How could she aim?

           Just then Bobbie Sue RUSHES the room with the women close 
           behind WHOOPING and HOLLERING. They overturn tables, raid the 
           bar, generally cause unbridled panic. Several club EMPLOYEES 
           race after the women, trying to round them up, but find it 
           difficult and distasteful to grab a half-naked old woman.
              BOBBIE SUE

           Bobbie Sue leaps onto a poker table with her pistol raised.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Poker? I don’t even know her!

           She kicks a pile of chips and let’s off a round into the 
           gabled ceiling.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        There’s a new sheriff in town, boys. 
                        And her name is Bobbie Sue!

           INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

           Bobbie Sue wakes up, groggy, unsure of her surroundings. She 
           looks under the covers, notices she is mostly undressed, then 
           tries to piece together what happened.

           Shaking off the attempt, she climbs out of bed.

           INT. BATHROOM - MORNING

           Bobbie Sue stands at the sink looking at the various feminine 
           grooming products.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                             (to herself)
                        What is this guy? Married?

           She shrugs, grabs a toothbrush, and starts brushing her 
           teeth. Just then, Susan pulls back the shower curtain and 
           steps out, wrapping herself in a towel.

                                 SUSAN
                        Morning. Sleep okay?

           Bobbie Sue freezes as Susan exits. She is VERY confused.

           INT. SUSAN’S KITCHEN - MORNING

           Bobbie Sue and Susan, both dressed for a day at the office, 
           sit in an awkward silence over breakfast.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        So... How did I get here?

                                 SUSAN
                        I had the police drop us off. 

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Police?
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 SUSAN
                        I didn’t know your address.

           Susan seems undisturbed by the dynamic, but Bobbie Sue is 
           still focused on one thing...

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        And then we...

           Susan looks up and laughs.

                                 SUSAN
                        You passed out in the elevator. I had 
                        to carry you in here.
                             (beat)
                        Nothing happened, Bobbie Sue. You’re 
                        innocence is intact.

           Bobbie Sue is visibly relieved.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Not that I wouldn’t... I mean, all 
                        things considered, you’re...

           Bobbie Sue searches for the right word.

                                 SUSAN
                        It’s okay. You’re not my type anyway.

           Bobbie Sue raises an eyebrow, a little miffed.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Oh, well. Then the feeling is mutual.

                                 SUSAN
                        Yeah. You’re more like a guy.

           INT. BAKER, STEVENS AND SMITH - MORNING

           Bobbie Sue and Susan step off the elevator together laughing.

                                 SUSAN
                        Go get ‘em tiger.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        It’s what I do.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Bobbie Sue BURSTS into the conference room with renewed 
           passion. Sarah Boyd is there, along with Prail and a new 
           female PLAINTIFF.
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        All right, let’s get this girly show 
                        on the road.

           She throws down her files and sets herself for war.

           INT. JOE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Joe stands in a semi-circle of other LAWYERS. They are 
           gathered around a small dry-erase board, where Phil is 
           writing down bets, while Rich takes wads of cash.

                                 LAWYER #1
                        Put me down for two hundred.

                                 JOE
                        You got it.

                                 LAWYER #2
                        He’s crazy.

                                 LAWYER #3
                        It can’t be done.

                                 LAWYER #4
                        I heard she can change her gender at 
                        will. Like a warlock.

                                 LAWYER #2
                        I’m gonna want proof.

                                 JOE
                        It’ll be written all over her face.
                             (beat)
                        We’ll have to fire her just so I can 
                        shake her off.

           They all laugh.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Bobbie Sue is steely-eyed, staring down the plaintiff who 
           squirms in her seat, mortified.

                                 SARAH BOYD
                        That is out of line!

           Bobbie Sue turns on Boyd.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        You see a judge in this room? I can 
                        ask anything I want.
                                 (MORE)
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT'D)
                             (to plaintiff)
                        It’s real simple, honey. Orgasm 
                        equals consent.

           INT. LISTENING ROOM - DAY

           Stevens and Baker, arms folded, watch Bobbie Sue’s attack. 
           Joe, Phil and Rich all stand in the background.

                                 BAKER
                        She’s an animal.

                                 STEVENS
                        The club is holding us responsible 
                        for the damages. It’s outrageous!

                                 BAKER
                        Boys will be boys. Besides, with the 
                        way she’s tearing through these 
                        depositions, she’ll be gone soon 
                        enough.

           Our attention drifts back to Joe, Phil and Rich as they 
           whisper among themselves...

                                 RICH
                        How the hell are you gonna pull this 
                        off?

                                 JOE
                        Don’t worry. I have a time-tested 
                        plan.

                                 PHIL
                             (light going off)
                        Drugging her...That’s good.

           Joe and Rich give Phil a double take, alarmed.

                                 JOE
                        What? No!
                             (to Rich)
                        She wants to think she’s the one in 
                        control. So I’m gonna to play hard to 
                        get, give her a challenge. Let her 
                        seduce me. If she wants to walk in 
                        the lead, fine. Like a dog on a 
                        leash. 

           Joe fixes on Bobbie Sue through the mirror.
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        ‘Cause I’ve got a year’s supply of 
                        kibble just wait’n for her bits.

           This time, Phil and Rich are struggling to keep up.

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        On a scale of one to ten she’ll be my 
                        “K-nine.” She’ll be rubbing my belly, 
                        making my leg twitch like a...
                             (unsure, hesitating)
                        ...dog. 
                             (recovering)
                        If you know what I mean.

                                 RICH
                        Not really. Who’s the dog?

                                 PHIL
                        Yeah, yeah, and she’ll be begging for 
                        your milk bone.

           Joe turns on Phil.

                                 JOE
                        What do you mean?

                                 PHIL
                        You know, your milk bone. 

                                 JOE
                        That’s doesn’t make any sense.

                                 PHIL
                             (trailing off)
                        It’s a metaphor.

           Rich shakes his head and exits.

                                 JOE
                        Well, as I was saying, she’ll be 
                        rubbing my soft, furry little 
                        belly...Oh yeah, she might be a 
                        stray, but there’s a pound in her 
                        future all right. She’ll be riding 
                        that gravy train...

           Baker, Stevens and Phil all stare at Joe who is still 
           transfixed by Bobbie Sue.

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                             (pumping his fist)
                        All aboard!
              BOBBIE SUE

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Bobbie Sue sits opposite a new female PLAINTIFF.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Hey, you expect time off to have a 
                        baby, why not give male employees 
                        time off to make one?

           The lawyers and the plaintiff stare at Bobbie Sue in 
           disbelief.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        Sounds like a double standard to me.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

           Bobbie Sue is staring down yet another new PLAINTIFF. This 
           time, Bobbie Sue has her shirt unbuttoned to the navel. The 
           plaintiff can’t help looking at her chest.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Now, Ms. Cavanaugh...

           Bobbie Sue notices her stare.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        What? What are you...

           She looks down, then back up at the plaintiff.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        Oh, are they distracting?

                                 PLAINTIFF
                        No, no. I just...

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        You just what? Undressed me with your 
                        eyes?

                                 PLAINTIFF
                        No. I...

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Maybe I should... sue you for sexual 
                        harassment.
                             (beat)
                        You should be ashamed of yourself.

           Sarah Boyd rolls her eyes and throws her pencil in the air.
              BOBBIE SUE

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Bobbie Sue is grilling the last in a long line female 
           PLAINTIFFS.

                                 PLAINTIFF
                        What kind of proof?

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Hickies, pinch marks, bruising...

           Bobbie Sue stands, revealing a polaroid camera.

                        If you could just remove what’s left 
                        of your dignity for a few photos.

                                 SARAH BOYD
                        Ms. Cofax!

           INT. BOBBIE SUE’S OFFICE - EVENING

           Bobbie Sue has her head on her desk, exhausted, when Joe 
           walks in.

                                 JOE
                        Hey champ.

           Bobbie Sue looks up, tries to smile.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Fuckin-A.

                                 JOE
                        You look like you could use a drink.

           Bobbie Sue shakes off the fatigue and stands.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Sure. I got time for a drink. Wanna 
                        hit “The Club”.

           Joe moves over to a bookcase.

                                 JOE
                        You’re banned for life.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        So, that means I get parole in five?

           Joe presses one panel of books. It pops open to reveal a 
           hidden MINI-BAR.
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                             (shocked)
                        What the hell? I didn’t know that was 
                        there.

           Joe starts to mix them drinks.

                                 JOE
                        This used to be my office.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        I should read more.

           Joe hands Bobbie Sue a drink and leans against the desk. He 
           takes a breath and launches into what is obviously a lie - he 
           is a terrible actor.

                                 JOE
                        Look, the real reason I came by is to 
                        apologize for how I acted at the bar 
                        the other night. I came on a little 
                        strong. The truth is I’m not 
                        attracted to you at all. I mean, not 
                        in the least. So it was wrong of me 
                        to pretend I was interested. 

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Oh, I see.

           Bobbie Sue moves in close.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        But I was just beginning to take an 
                        interest in you, Joe.

           Joe does a little DOUBLE-TAKE.

                                 JOE
                        Really?

           Once again, Bobbie Sue BURSTS OUT laughing. She puts a hand 
           on his shoulder to steady herself.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                             (laughing)
                        You should see the look on your face.

                                 JOE
                             (trying to play it cool)
                        What look?

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                             (laughing harder)
                        Oh Joe. Was this your plan? 
                                 (MORE)
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT'D)
                        Play hard to get. What are you? 
                        Thirteen? The old, “pretend not to 
                        like her and she’ll fall at your 
                        feet.” Why don’t you just punch me 
                        during recess?

           Joe sips his drink, embarrassed. Bobbie Sue tries to catch 
           her breath.

                                 JOE
                             (mumbling)
                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Tell me you didn’t use the “like a 
                        dog on a leash” line when you were 
                        talking to the guys.

                                 JOE
                             (surprised)
                        You knew about that?

           Bobbie Sue does a spit take - He really used it?

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Oh, my God! 
                             (beat)
                        What was the backup plan? The 
                        sensitive guy who isn’t interested in 
                        sex, just wants to talk about my 
                        feelings? Wait, wait, maybe you 
                        should write me a little note with 
                        check boxes!  

           Joe sets down his drink and takes a step toward the door.

                                 JOE
                        Whatever.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        No. Wait, Joe. Come on. Don’t take it 
                        so hard. It was a nice try. Really.

           Joe stops but doesn’t turn around. 

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        Let me make it up to you. Let me take 
                        you to dinner.

           It’s Bobbie Sue’s turn for a sly smile.
              BOBBIE SUE

           INT. COFAX HOUSE - NIGHT

           Bobbie Sue and Joe stand in the entry way of the Cofax house. 
           She has two six packs of Pabst Blue ribbon.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Daddy!

           A knife flies into view and STABS into the wall next to Joe.

                                 BROTHER (O.S.)
                        Sorry!

           We see Daddy Cofax in an apron setting a table for eleven.

                                 DADDY COFAX
                        Hey, Bobbie Sue!

           Daddy Cofax swallows her up in a hug as her brothers all call 
           out a greeting. Daddy Cofax releases Bobbie Sue and Joe 
           sticks out a hand. He pretends to own the room, but looks 
           hopelessly out of place.

                                 JOE
                        Nice to meet you, sir.

                                 DADDY COFAX
                        Sir? What are you a fucking butler?

           Daddy Cofax laughs loudly and grips Joe around the back of 
           the neck, shaking him for a moment. 

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Let me introduce you to the brothers.

           Bobbie Sue names each one of the towering, brawny men as she 
           throws a can of beer at them. Joe’s fake smile fades a bit 
           with each name.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        Robert, Rob, Bob, Bobo, Bobby, Robby.

           Robby’s beer FLIES past his open hand.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                             (to Joe)
                        Robby is mostly blind. Fireworks 
                        accident.

                                 ROBBY
                        I can still legally hunt.
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Chip and Roberto... hey, where’s 
                        Roberto?

                                 CHIP
                        Feeding the dogs.

                                 JOE
                             (quietly to Bobbie Sue)
                        Chip?

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Adopted.

           A basement door opens and the sound of a dozen wild dogs 
           fills the room.

                                 ROBERTO
                        Down! Down! No more! Back! Back!

           Roberto squeezes through the door, slams it shut and turns, 
           smiling, to the others.

                                 ROBERTO (CONT’D)
                        Evening.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                             (to Joe)
                        Roberto’s a private dog catcher.

           She BULLETS a beer at Roberto. He catches it with one hand.

                                 JOE
                        Private dog catcher? Doesn’t the city 
                        usually take care of that?

                                 ROBERTO
                        Not if I get ‘em first.

                                 DADDY COFAX
                        Who’s hungry.

           INT. COFAX HOUSE - LATER

           The family and Joe crowd around a table devouring plates of 
           pasta. Joe still tries to put up a front.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Daddy, this is excellent.

                                 ROB
                        Yeah, nice job, pops.
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 DADDY COFAX
                        Amazing what you can do with a little 
                        imagination and a can of Spam.

                                 JOE
                             (laughing)
                        Spam...

           Everyone stares, stone-faced. Joe swallows his laugh. 

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        ... is delicious. I love the stuff.

           Joe takes a huge bite.

                                 DADDY COFAX
                        You play any sports, Joe? 

                                 JOE
                        Ah, yes. I play golf every weekend.

           The brothers all snicker.

                                 CHIP
                        Yeah, but do you play any sports?

                                 JOE
                        Golf, technically, is a sport.

                                 ROBERT
                        And a bull’s cock is technically 
                        beef. Doesn’t mean I want to eat it.

           Joe tries to change the subject.

                                 JOE
                        So, you must be proud of your 
                        daughter. Very talented lawyer.

                                 DADDY COFAX
                        I’m proud of all my kids. Each of 
                        them followed their dream.

                                 JOE
                        So, Roberto, what do you do?

                                 BOB
                        I’m Bob. He’s Roberto. And I’m a high 
                        school football coach.

           Each of the brothers answer the question.

                                 ROBERT
                        Coach.
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 BOBBY
                        Coach.

                                 ROBBY
                        Coach.

                                 CHIP
                        Coach.

                                 ROBERTO
                        Dog catcher.

                                 JOE
                        That’s right.

                                 BOB
                        And Robby’s just blind all day.

                                 ROBBY
                        I can see enough to kick your big 
                        ass, Bob.

                                 BOB
                        Yeah? You and what seeing impaired 
                        army?

                                 ROBBY
                        That’s it!

           Robby and Bob both JUMP to their feet. Robby HURLS himself 
           over the table, MISSING Bob completely.

                                 BOB
                             (shaking his head)
                        I thought his other senses were 
                        supposed to compensate...

           Bob is cut short as Robby YANKS him to the floor. FISTS FLY. 
           Chip looks thoughtfully at his spoon, then up at Joe, who is 
           distracted by the fight.

                                 CHIP
                        Say, Joe.

           Joe turns to see Chip smiling like an inbred banjo player.

                                 JOE
                        Yes?

                                 CHIP
                        I got an idea.

           Joe tries a smile, but it fails miserably.
              BOBBIE SUE

           EXT. COFAX HOUSE - NIGHT

           Bobbie Sue and Daddy Cofax sit on the porch swing. Bob and 
           Robby sit on the steps - Bob with a RED PUFFY EYE, quickly 
           turning purple, and Robby with a satisfied GRIN on his face.

           The rest of the brothers are in the front yard as Chip and 
           Joe square off, each holding a metal spoon.

                                 CHIP
                        Here’s the rules. Two men. Two 
                        spoons. One winner. One man bends his 
                        head down, the other puts the spoon 
                        in his mouth...

           Chip places the HANDLE of the spoon in his mouth.

                                 CHIP (CONT’D)
                             (spoon in mouth)
                        ...and smacks his opponent as hard as 
                        he can on his skull. They go back and 
                        forth till someone cries mercy, 
                        looses a tooth, or passes out. You 
                        hit first.

           Bobo and Rob pump up Joe like a boxer’s corner team. Bobby 
           and Roberto do the same for Chip. Robert stands in the middle 
           as a referee. 

           Chip bows before Joe. Joe looks a little unsure, but places 
           the handle of the spoon in his mouth. 

                                 ROBERT
                        Okay. One, two, three.

           With a whip of the neck, Joe mildly WHACKS Chip on the skull. 
           Chip LEAPS up, grabbing his head.

                                 CHIP
                        Ow! Butter nuts, that hurt!

           The brothers behind Joe SLAP his back in congratulations. 

                                 CHIP (CONT’D)
                        Okay, my turn.

           Joe is hesitant. He glances at a smiling Bobbie Sue and 
           RALLIES his courage. He bows his head before Chip. 

                                 ROBERT
                        One, two...

           Unseen by Joe, Bobby pulls a HUGE metal spoon from behind his 
           back and raises it over Joe’s head.
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        Three!

           Chip moves his neck, but Bobby SLAMS the spoon down on Joe’s 
           head. Joe SCREAMS out in pain. He stumbles back and almost 
           looses his footing. Bobby quickly HIDES the spoon. Bobbie Sue 
           and the family HIDE their laughter.

           The brother’s grab Joe and pat him on the back. 

                                 BOBO
                        Come on, soldier. Buck up! 

           Joe rubs the back of his head, blinking his eyes. He glances 
           at Bobbie Sue. She gives him a thumbs up. Rob sticks the 
           spoon in his mouth. Chip BOWS and awaits the spoon.

           Joe, revved up by the brothers cheering behind him and the 
           presence of Bobbie Sue, straightens up. He’s ready to fight. 

                                 ROBERT
                        One, two, three!

           Using his whole body, Joe SLAMS the spoon down on Chips head. 

                                 BOBO
                        Yes! That’s the shit!

           Chip is jumping up and down. Joe is rubbing his tooth.

                                 JOE
                        I think I chipped something.

                                 CHIP
                        Mother Suck! Man, you’re good. You’re 
                        damn good. My turn now.

           We see a quick series of shots, all of Joe, bent over, 
           getting WHACKED with a giant spoon by one of the brothers.

           In the last shot, we see Bobby heating the large spoon with a 
           small BLOWTORCH. 

                                 ROBERT
                        One, two, three!

           Bobby’s spoon, GLOWING RED, SMASHES DOWN on Joe’s skull. Joe 
           FALLS to the ground.

                                 ALL THE BROTHERS
                        Owww.

           Joe jumps to his feet, the spoon still stuck to his 
           SMOLDERING SCALP.
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 ALL THE BROTHERS (CONT’D)
                        OWWWW!

                                 JOE
                        Yeah! Yeah! Let’s go again!
                             (beat)
                        What’s that smell?

           Bobo DOUSES Joe’s head with his beer. The large spoon falls 
           to the ground and Joe looks at the spoon in Chip’s mouth.

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        But...

           Chip slaps Joe’s shoulder.

                                 CHIP
                        That was fucking incredible, Joey.

                                 ROB
                        Most guys Bobbie Sue brings home 
                        don’t make it past round one.

                                 JOE
                        I’m blistering.

                                 BOBBY
                        Blister with pride!

                                 CHIP
                        Can we get this man a beer?

           INT. BOBBIE SUE’S CAR - LATER

           Bobbie Sue FLIES down the highway as the two head back to 
           downtown Boston. She is LAUGHING HER HEAD OFF as Joe holds an 
           ice pack to the back of his head.

                                 JOE
                        It’s not THAT funny.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Oh, it’s funny.

                                 JOE
                        The hair is all gone.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        It’ll grow back.

                                 JOE
                        I’m not sure it will.

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        How the hell did you survive that 
                        house?

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        What? My brothers?

                                 JOE
                        I had my balls handed to me. 

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        At least you walked away with them.

                                 JOE
                        Well, it all makes sense now.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        What?

                                 JOE
                        You. At the office. Making grown men 
                        cry. Terrorizing those women in the 
                        depositions. You were raised by 
                        wolves. 

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Watch your mouth.

                                 JOE
                        And it explains why you’re always 
                        trying so hard.

           Bobbie Sue smiles and condescendingly pats his knee.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Oh, Joe.

           Her smile turns cold, unsettling Joe.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        Most men live in fear that everyone 
                        will find out they aren’t who they 
                        pretend to be. Maybe they secretly 
                        love musicals, or like the way lace 
                        feels against their skin. Maybe 
                        sometimes they would rather just 
                        cuddle. I don’t know.

                        I’ve never pretended to be anyone but

                        Kelly, and with the right guy, yeah, 
                        I’ll cuddle all night.

                        But I also prefer tackle to touch 
                        football, drink my scotch neat, and 
                        never take no for an answer...unless 
                        it’s the answer I’m looking for.
                             (beat)
                        Men build lives trying too hard. It’s 
                        why they’re easy marks. I don’t try. 
                        I just am.

           Joe sits speechless for a beat, then notices his exit.

                                 JOE
                        Um, you just missed my exit.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Well, Sir Spoonalot, I think you’ve 
                        earned it.

                                 JOE
                        Earned what?

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        My place. A few drinks.
                             (beat)
                        Your dreams coming true.

           Bobbie Sue laughs again as she weaves in and out of traffic. 
           Joe grips his seat, terrified.

                                 JOE
                        Oh, DEAR LORD!

           INT. BOBBIE SUE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Bobbie Sue leads Joe into her apartment. She leaves him by 
           the door and GRACEFULLY PREPARES the room. 

           She lowers the lights, strikes a match and LIGHTS a row of 
           CANDLES. With a flip of a remote the stereo begins playing 
           Fiona Apple’s Criminal. With another button cursive NEON 
           letters spelling “LOVE DRAGON” appear above the bed. She 
           lights a stick of INCENSE and slowly waves it before her face 
           as she walks towards Joe. 

                                 JOE
                        Bobbie Sue, I...

           She puts a finger to his lips.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Shhh. 

           She kisses his cheek.
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        Joe Baker, I’m going to tie you up 
                        and make you cry.

           Joe barely smiles and makes a tiny squeak.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        And tonight, there is no safe word.

           She give him an outrageously long and deep KISS. 

           INT. BOBBIE SUE’S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

           The apartment is a MESS. Clothes are SCATTERED everywhere, 
           the TABLE is OVER TURNED, the CANDLES are MELTED to hardened 
           puddles, and part of the COUCH looks as if it’s been CHEWED 
           on by a pack of wolves. An industrial-sized vat of OLIVE OIL 
           is half empty on the floor, and by the foot of the bed lies 
           the THIGH EXERCISER from the earlier case. 

           Sideways in the bed, Joe sprawls asleep with a HUGE GRIN on 
           his face and hair sticking up in every direction. He slowly 
           blinks his eyes open and sees he is alone in the bed.

                                 JOE
                        Bobbie Sue?

           Bobbie Sue walks from the bathroom completely dressed and 
           groomed for work. She sits on the edge of the bed and smiles 
           sweetly, stroking his cheek.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Don’t worry, it’s still early. I’ve 
                        got some work to do. You sleep in.

           She stands and picks up her briefcase. Joe sits up.

                                 JOE
                        Last night was...

           He squirms a bit and comes up with a POTATO MASHER from 
           somewhere beneath the sheets. He tries to recall it but then 
           tosses it aside.

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        Last night was a harrowing journey. 
                        You took me places I thought only 
                        existed on the internet.

           Bobbie Sue smiles and Joe quivers.
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        I’m scared, Bobbie Sue. 
                             (reaching out)
                        Hold me?

           Bobbie Sue opens the door to leave.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        There’s an egg frittata in the 
                        fridge.

           She blows him a kiss and walks out. Joe FALLS back into the 
           fetal position. After a beat, he reaches for his phone on the 
           night stand. He begins typing out a message.

                                 JOE (V.O.)
                        Dear Bobbie Sue...

           INT. BOBBIE SUE’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Joe dreamily walks through the apartment eating a frittata. 
           He gazes adoringly at some framed pictures of Bobbie Sue.

                                 JOE (V.O.)
                        Last night was the most amazing thing 
                        that’s ever happened to me. 

           INT. BOBBIE SUE’S CLOSET - LATER

           Joe lovingly flips through her hanging clothes.

                                 JOE (V.O.)
                        I walked into your life a man, and 
                        somehow you’ve brought out the boy in 
                        me. The wounded child, healed in your 
                        embrace.

           He pulls a shirt to his face and deeply inhales.

           EXT. CITY STREET - MORNING

           Joe walks down the street as if in a dream. He stops, picks a 
           flower from a bush and slips it into his lapel.

                                 JOE (V.O.)
                        I feel so safe with you. So alive.

           INT. BAKER, STEVENS AND SMITH FOYER - MORNING

           Joe breezes through the entrance, giddy as a school boy.
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 JOE (V.O.)
                        So in love.

           He boards the elevator with a few other LAWYERS.

                                 JOE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And I always will. Your lover, Sir 
                        Spoonalot.

           INT. BAKER, STEVENS AND SMITH - CONTINUOUS

           The elevator doors slide open. BING. A visibly love-sick Joe 
           waltzes out and heads towards his office waving casual 
           greetings. He’s too in love to notice all the eyes STARING at 
           him. But the WHISPERS and SNICKERING slow his steps. 

           People peek from behind doors. Young lawyers and secretaries 
           alike seem to be stealing glances and laughing. His SMILE 
           FADES. Susan walks past from the opposite direction. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Morning, Sir Spoonalot.

                                 JOE
                             (distracted)
                        Morning.

           Joe gasps - What did she say? He gives Susan a double-take, 
           then dashes for his office.

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        Oh, shit.

           INT. JOE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Joe slams the door behind him and quickly checks his 
           computer. There in his inbox is an office-wide, forwarded 
           email from Bobbie Sue titled “WHIPPED.”

           He opens the email and sees the very love note he sent 
           earlier that morning.

                                 JOE
                        Oh, shit!

           Joe rushes to the window next to his office door. He peaks 
           through the blinds. On the far side of the office he sees 
           Bobbie Sue sitting on the edge of a desk surrounded by a 
           crowd of LAUGHING LAWYERS. She’s holding her WRISTS together, 
           loosely bound by a tie, and she’s making an exaggerated 
           CRYING FACE. The lawyers laugh even harder.
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        OH SHIT!

           Rich walks through the door, making Joe jump into the blinds.

                                 RICH
                        Well, you won the bet, but you sure 
                        as hell lost the war.

           Joe scrambles to quiet the blinds and turns on Rich.

                                 JOE
                        How many people got that message?

                                 RICH
                        How many people have email?

                                 JOE
                        Why would she do that!

                                 RICH
                        You don’t know?

                                 JOE
                        Know what? All I know is this is the 
                        worst thing I can imagine and yet I 
                        have an overwhelming urge to buy her 
                        a plush toy or an assortment of 
                        Gerber daisies.

           Joe grabs Rich by the lapels.

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        What in the name of God is happening 
                        to me!

                                 RICH
                        Joe. She made side bets that she 
                        could have you whipped by the time 
                        the case was settled. 

           Joe backs off.

                                 JOE
                        Side bets? She knew about the office 
                        pool?

           Joe lunges for the window again and peers out. On the far 
           side of the office, Bobbie Sue is now collecting stacks of 
           cash from the surrounding lawyers.

           Joe staggers to his desk.
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 RICH
                        Sir Spoonalot? I don’t even know what 
                        that means, but it sounds pathetic.

           Joe’s phone rings and he jumps in terror. After an agonizing 
           hesitation, he answers.

                                 JOE
                        Hello?

                                 BAKER (O.S.)
                        Son, have you checked your email 
                        recently?

                                 JOE
                        I can explain.

                                 BAKER (O.S.)
                        What’s to explain? You and Bobbie Sue 
                        did it!

                                 JOE
                        Yes, but...

                                 BAKER (O.S.)
                        She found the soft spot and rammed it 
                        home!

                                 SMITH (O.S.)
                             (loudly in the background)
                        Ram! Ram! Ram!

                                 JOE
                        She told you about that?

                                 BAKER (O.S.)
                        What are you talking about?

                                 JOE
                        What are you talking about?

                                 BAKER (O.S.)
                        The case. The women want to settle. 
                        They’re on their way over.

                                 JOE
                        Oh.

           Joe collapses into his chair.

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        That’s great.
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 BAKER (O.S.)
                        And son.

                                 JOE
                        Yes, dad?

                                 BAKER (O.S.)
                        If their lawyers get rough, just 
                        remember how safe she makes you feel.

                                 SMITH (O.S.)
                             (loudly in the background)
                        Pussy!

           There is wild laughter from the phone. Joe hangs up. 

           INT. BAKER, STEVENS AND SMITH - DAY

           Bobbie Sue, papers in hand, marches through the office, chin 
           up and confident. Joe appears and falls in next to her, 
           trying to play it cool.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Morning, Joe! You ready to go settle 
                        this thing?

                                 JOE
                        Sounds great. I would have come by 
                        sooner, but I’ve been hiding in my 
                        office.
                             (hurt)
                        I can’t believe you sent that email.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        They needed proof.

                                 JOE
                        Are you telling me you didn’t sense 
                        something between us? You didn’t 
                        feel...a spark, something big 
                        inside...? 

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Um, no, I’d say it was fairly 
                        average. 

                                 JOE
                        That’s not what I... What do you mean 
                        average?!

           Bobbie Sue stops and faces Joe.
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Look, Joe. Don’t play the wounded 
                        lover routine. You had every swinging 
                        dick in the office playing the odds 
                        you could get me in bed before the 
                        settlement. Hell, you should be 
                        thanking me. From the looks of it, 
                        you won big.

                                 JOE
                             (muffled scream)
                        That’s different!

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                             (sarcastic)
                        You mean, like, a double standard? 

           Bobbie Sue resumes her march to the conference room. Leaving 
           Joe a blubbering mess.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                             (calling back to him)
                        Careful, Joe. You don’t want your 
                        mascara to run.

           INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Bobbie Sue sits across from Boyd and Prail as they sign the 
           last of the settlement documents.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        I guess that wraps it up. Our client 
                        is fine with those terms and of 
                        course the usual confidentiality 
                        agreements will be in effect.

           Sarah Boyd stands, defeated and demoralized. Bobbie Sue 
           stands as well and shakes her hand.

                                 SARAH BOYD
                        Congratulations, Ms. Cofax. You’ve 
                        just set gender equality back thirty 
                        years.

           Bobbie Sue’s smile fades slightly.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        What? Equality? Is that what you 
                        think this was about?

                                 SARAH BOYD
                        Well you didn’t think it was about 
                        the money, did you?
              BOBBIE SUE

           Bobbie Sue’s angry and she points to her own forehead.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Hey, equality is all up here, you 
                        don’t win it in court. Women can do 
                        anything men can do, and they don’t 
                        need to sue for permission.

           Boyd shakes her head and allows herself a chuckle.

                                 SARAH BOYD
                        You think your swagger makes you 
                        equal to the men behind that mirror?
                             (leaning closer)
                        Sinking to their level is not the 
                        same thing as wielding their power. 
                        Remember that when you crash into 
                        that glass ceiling. 

           Boyd straightens up, gives the two-way mirror the finger, and 
           storms out. Bobbie Sue just stands there, speechless.

           INT. LISTENING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Baker, Stevens and Smith congratulate each other as Joe 
           watches Bobbie Sue through the glass. Baker lays a hand on 
           his son’s shoulder. 

                                 BAKER
                        Son, we owe you, nice work. And the 
                        first thing I’m gonna do for you is 
                        get rid of Bobbie Sue. 

                                 JOE
                        About that. Maybe she’s worth...

                                 BAKER
                             (interrupting)
                        Son, you don’t need anymore 
                        embarrassment.

           He slaps him on the back and chuckles.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

           Bobbie Sue sits across from Baker, Stevens and Smith. She is 
           confident, basking in the glow of victory. The old men seem 
           grave, unsettling Bobbie Sue.
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 BAKER
                        We want you to know the work you did 
                        was first rate. You should be proud. 
                        Has the press started to call?

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Hell, I feel like I’m running some 
                        Indian call center.

                                 SMITH
                             (too loud)
                        I love their casinos!

           Bobbie Sue jumps. She’s still not used to Smith’s outbursts.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                             (re: Smith)
                        When does his golden parachute kick 
                        in?

           Still no smiles from the old men. She shifts in her seat.

                                 BAKER
                        Ms. Cofax, we’ll get right to the 
                        point. Because of the scrutiny and 
                        publicity this case has generated, we 
                        have been advised to implement a zero 
                        tolerance policy towards sexual 
                        harassment.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Advised? By who?

                                 STEVENS
                        And unfortunately we’ve had several 
                        reports of highly inappropriate 
                        behavior around the office. 

                                 BAKER
                        Even in your short time here, you’ve 
                        terrorized most of the staff. Grown 
                        men weeping in the break room.

                                 STEVENS
                        We have no choice, Ms. Cofax.

                                 BAKER
                        Zero tolerance, you understand.

           Bobbie Sue goes white, and then red with anger.
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        What are you saying?
                             (beat)
                        I’m fired?

                                 BAKER
                        It’s a zero tolerance policy.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        I just settled the largest sexual 
                        harassment case in Massachusetts...

           Bobbie Sue stops, she looks at the men squirm. She stands, 
           shaking with anger.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        This was planned all along.

           Baker and Stevens look down at the table. Smith is 
           distracted, discovering his suit has pockets.

                                 STEVENS
                        Our hands are tied...

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                             (interrupting)
                        THAT’S HORSE SHIT!

                                 BAKER
                        Please collect your belongings and 
                        leave...or else... 

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Or else WHAT!

           INT. BAKER, STEVENS AND SMITH FOYER - DAY

           The elevator approaches from an upper floor, and as it gets 
           closer, the sounds from the elevator car, like a busy bowling 
           alley, grow.

           The doors open and we see Bobbie Sue taking on THREE SECURITY 
           GUARDS. A fourth GUARD holds a box, the contents of Bobbie 
           Sue’s office.

           A flash fills the foyer and we pull back to see dozens of 
           REPORTERS snapping away at the melee in the elevator. One 
           guard stops to stare out at the media, and Bobbie Sue takes 
           the opportunity to LAY HIM OUT COLD.

           Finally, she sees the reporters and stops the struggle. She 
           straightens herself, SNATCHES the box from the guard and 
           heads to the front door.
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 NEWS REPORTER
                             (quietly to camera guy)
                        Tell me you got that.

           Bobbie Sue disappears through the front door as the guards 
           all watch her go.

                                 GUARD #1
                        Man, I hope she doesn’t sue us.

                                 GUARD #2
                        She’s a bad ass.

                                 GUARD #3
                        Fuck you. You just held the damn box.

                                 GUARD #4
                             (longingly)
                        I’ve never thought I’d wish I needed 
                        a lawyer....

           The other three nod dreamily in agreement.

           EXT. BOSTON STREET - DAY

           Bobbie Sue walks the sidewalks, lost in thought.

                                 TRUCK DRIVER (O.S.)
                        Hey, Bobby Sue!

           She looks up to see a TRUCK DRIVER leaning out his window.

                                 TRUCK DRIVER (CONT’D)
                        Way to stick it to those whiny 
                        broads!

           Bobbie Sue cocks her head, not sure how to respond. She 
           notices a newsstand in front of her. Every paper has a 
           similar headline: SHE-LAWYER WOMAN HATER; BOBBIE SUE COFAX - 
           A TRAITOR TO HER SEX; GOOD RIDDANCE - COFAX GETS THE AXE!

           While Bobbie Sue is still gasping over the headlines, two 
           BUSINESSWOMEN pass.

                                 BUSINESSWOMAN
                        Bitch.

           She turns, but they are gone before she can reply. She turns 
           back to the newsstand to pay, and the IMMIGRANT behind the 
           counter slams down the gate with a scowl.
              BOBBIE SUE

           INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           Bobbie Sue stands in a short line waiting to be served. The 
           MAN in front of her finishes and moves to the side. The 
           female BARISTA looks down at Bobbie Sue. 

                                 BARISTA
                        May I help who’s next?

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Could I have a tall...

           The Barista ignores her, then addresses the WOMAN behind her.

                                 BARISTA
                        Ma’am, what would you like?

           Bobbie Sue is taken aback.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Excuse me, I’m clearly next.

           The Barista ignores her.

                                 WOMAN
                        I would like a decaf tea...

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                             (to Barista)
                        You can’t treat me like this.

           The Barista keeps smiling at the next woman but points to a 
           small sign: “We reserve the right to refuse service.”

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                             (to Barista)
                        You think that’s actually legal!?

           The Barista finally looks Bobbie Sue in the eye.

                                 BARISTA
                        So, sue us.

           INT. NAIL SALON - DAY

           Bobbie Sue once again sits chatting as the same Vietnamese 
           manicurist works on her toes. 

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        I just don’t see where all the 
                        animosity is coming from. I was just 
                        doing my job.
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 MANICURIST
                        Than tu.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Traitor to my sex? I was just trying 
                        to be the best in my field.

                                 MANICURIST
                        Vang, van.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        And now it’s like the whole city is 
                        against me.

                                 MANICURIST
                        Co gai ngheo.

           Bobbie Sue smiles.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        It’s good to know I have at least one 
                        friend left.

                                 MANICURIST
                        Tat ca lam.

           The manicurist puts down her bottle of NAIL POLISH and RUBS 
           her hand. The job is done and she SMILES like a proud child.

           Bobbie Sue sees her toes and her face FALLS. Spelled out on 
           each foot, one letter per toe nail, is the word B-I-T-C-H in 
           bright red nail polish.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        What have you done!

                                 MANICURIST
                             (broken English)
                        You bitch! You hurt women. You dirty 
                        whore, dirty, dirty whore!

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        You do speak English!

                                 MANICURIST
                             (broken English)
                        You stink up chair with whore smell. 
                        Get out, devil vagina!

           Bobbie Sue stands and stumbles to the door, shocked at the 
           barrage of insults.
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Wow! That’s awful. Did Rosetta Stone 
                        teach you that?

                                 MANICURIST
                        Out! Whore-bitch nob-sliming whore-
                        dog!

           INT. BOBBIE SUE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Bobbie Sue is on the phone, pacing in her apartment.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Dad, that’s not the point.

           INT. COFAX KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Daddy Cofax, on the phone, is cooking up Manwiches.

                                 DADDY COFAX
                        I’m just saying, lead with your left 
                        next time. That second guard would’ve 
                        gone down like a sack of bowling 
                        balls.

           INT. BOBBIE SUE’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           The doorbell rings and she opens the door still on the phone.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Everybody hates me! 

           Joe stands in the doorway with a large stuffed animal and the 
           pathetic look of hope in his eyes. Joe mouths, “Not me”.

                                 DADDY COFAX (O.S.)
                        Hey, not everybody hates you. But 
                        what have I always said? If you can’t 
                        take the shit...

           Bobbie Sue snatches the stuffed animal, then slams the door 
           in Joe’s face.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Stay out of the bathroom. I know. But 
                        it’s like the entire city of Boston 
                        is the bathroom. I am living in the 
                        bathroom.
              BOBBIE SUE

           INT. COFAX HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Daddy Cofax puts down his ladle and leans against the 
           counter.

                                 DADDY COFAX
                        Bobbie Sue. I hope you know I did the 
                        best I could.

                                                              INTERCUT:

           INT. BOBBIE SUE’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Bobbie Sue sits on the couch holding the ridiculously large 
           stuffed animal.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Oh, Dad. It’s not about you.

                                 DADDY COFAX
                        I just mean, when your mom died, 
                        certain things, you know, girl 
                        things...great things, died with her.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                             (embarrassed)
                        Dad.

                                 DADDY COFAX
                        Being a woman...well, it’s gotta be 
                        tough. Tell you the truth, I don’t 
                        think I could do it myself. 
                             (beat)
                        I always said you could do anything 
                        the boys could do. But if your mother 
                        were still around, she would have 
                        said “Yeah, but they can’t do half of 
                        what you can.”

           Bobbie Sue pauses.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        I went and visited her grave 
                        yesterday.

                                 DADDY COFAX
                        How was it?

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        She didn’t say much.

                                 DADDY COFAX
                        Yeah...she never does.
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Thanks Dad.

                                 DADDY COFAX
                        Now go get some rest. You’ve got a 
                        new practice to open.

           INT. BOBBIE SUE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Bobbie Sue is alone at her desk. Bored. She rearranges her 
           pencils, straightens papers, checks for a dial tone, but it 
           is obvious the phone has not rung in quite some time. 

           Finally, the phone rings and she brightens. 

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                             (hi-pitched, feminine)

                        Let me see if she is available.

           Bobbie Sue holds the phone a beat.

                        Sure I bought the ticket for the 
                        ride. I knew what I was in for. But I 
                        didn’t know how rough it would be. 
                        When I got to the end, I was hollow 
                        inside. Turns out, I was tall enough 
                        for the ride...but my heart wasn’t.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Joe?
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 JOE (O.S.)
                        No.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Stop calling me.

                                 JOE (O.S.)
                        It’s not me.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        I’m hanging up.

           As she hangs up...

                                 JOE (O.S.)
                        All aboard...

           INT. BLIND JUSTICE BAR - NIGHT

           Bobbie Sue is at the bar, dark sunglasses, well on her way to 
           drunk. Susan Sullivan and Linda sit on stools next to her.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        I was just doing my job!

                                 SUSAN
                        Isn’t that what Goebbels said?

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        You know, if a man was in there 
                        mixing it up, he wouldn’t be public 
                        enemy number one.

                                 SUSAN
                        If a man had been in there, it would 
                        have gone to court and Baker, Stevens 
                        and Shit-for-brains would have lost 
                        the case. Hands down. 

                                 LINDA
                        They picked you because you’re a 
                        woman.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        You said it sister.

                                 SUSAN
                        They’re all a bunch of spoiled little 
                        boys who don’t like being told how to 
                        behave. 

                                 LINDA
                        Especially in public.
              BOBBIE SUE

           A LIGHT IS GOING OFF in Bobbie Sue’s booze-soaked brain.

                                 LINDA (CONT’D)
                        And if I were you I’d...

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                             (interrupting)
                        Sue the bastards!

           Bobbie Sue is clear-eyed and EXCITED.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        That’s it!

                                 LINDA
                        I was going to say go to this great 
                        day spa on Newberry...but okay.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Thanks, girls!

           Bobbie Sue slaps some money down on the bar and hurries out.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Baker, Stevens and Smith stand at one end of the conference 
           table. They are all livid. Joe enters and Baker turns on him.

                                 BAKER
                        Junior!
                             (mocking)
                        Have you seen today’s paper?

           Baker slams down a copy of the Boston Globe. We see the 
           headline: BOBBIE SUE COFAX SUES BAKER, STEVENS AND SMITH.

                                 STEVENS
                        Your father and I were served with 
                        subpoenas this morning.

                                 SMITH
                             (too loud)
                        Sir Penis!

           Joe pulls an envelope from his jacket pocket.

                                 JOE
                        Me too.

                                 BAKER
                        Who else is she dragging into this 
                        circus?
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 JOE
                        Half the junior partners. Most of the 
                        secretaries.

                                 BAKER
                        Good Lord.

                                 SMITH
                             (too loud)
                        I’m not wearing any underwear!

                                 STEVENS
                        Thank God she had the good taste to 
                        leave Smith out of this.

           Baker moves in close to Joe, trembling with anger.

                                 BAKER
                        What the hell is she trying to pull?

           Joe looks at his shoes for the beat, then, brightening, looks 
           back up at his father.

                                 JOE
                        You think she wants her old job back?

           INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           The small shop bustles with PATRONS sitting at small tables 
           or waiting in line. A few of them watch the television 
           mounted in one corner. 

           On the screen we see an image of Bobbie Sue from her 
           commercial, then an ANCHORWOMAN.

                                 ANCHORWOMAN
                        Bobbie Sue Cofax has enlisted her own 
                        services to go after her old law firm 
                        Baker, Stevens and Smith.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Serena Norman pours milk into a bowl of cereal for her 6 year-
           old SON while watching a small television on the counter.

                                 ANCHORWOMAN (O.S.)
                        After settling the largest sexual 
                        harassment case in Massachusetts 
                        history, Cofax was herself dismissed 
                        from the firm for alleged sexual 
                        harassment of male employees.
              BOBBIE SUE

           Serena straightens up.

                                 SERENA
                             (to herself)
                        You’ve got to be kidding me.

           INT. HEALTH CLUB - DAY

           Three WOMEN jogging on elliptical machines watch the 
           television mounted above them.

                                 ANCHORWOMAN (O.S.)
                        Dogged by the press and women’s 
                        groups across the country, the so-
                        called “Beatrice Arnold” of women 
                        everywhere is turning the tables.

           EXT. BOSTON NEWSTAND - DAY

           Sarah Boyd pauses to buy a Globe and is struck by the 
           headline. 

                                 ANCHORWOMAN (O.S.)
                        She’s suing for wrongful dismissal 
                        and detriment of character. Well, you 
                        know what they say. If you can’t join 
                        ‘em. Beat ‘em.
                             (beat)
                        The case begins later this week.

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

           Bobbie Sue is on her feet and back in her element. Phil sits 
           nervously in the witness box as Baker, Stevens and Smith 
           squirm at the defense table. The gallery is sparsely 
           populated, mostly with JOURNALISTS. Judge Roberts presides 
           over the questioning.

                                 PHIL
                        I do not recall.

           Phil feigns some pride over his tactical maneuver.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        You do not recall asking if I was 
                        double jointed?

                                 PHIL
                        No. I do not recall that exchange.
              BOBBIE SUE

           Bobbie Sue retrieves a sheet of paper from her desk. As she 
           does so, Sarah Boyd slips into the courtroom and takes a seat 
           at the back of the gallery.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Maybe this will help...
                             (reading, robotically)
                        Cause if you are, I’d like to fold 
                        you up and stuff you in an envelope 
                        and send you special delivery to my 
                        secret hideaway of guilty pleasure.

                                 PHIL
                             (shocked)
                        That message was private.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Not anymore. Exhibit 29, your honor.

           Bobbie Sue hands the sheet of paper to the judge. She begins 
           to read as Phil looks from her to Bobbie Sue and back again.

                                 PHIL
                        Well, she started it! 

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Excuse me?

                                 PHIL
                        You said you liked my pants.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Your pants?

                                 PHIL
                        And that shirt, the pink one. You 
                        were clearly sending a message.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Yes, I was. You’re a snappy dresser. 
                        But what’s that got to do with your 
                        secret hideaway of guilty pleasure?

           Phil stares at her, then addresses the judge.

                                 PHIL
                        She tortured us, your honor. Every 
                        man in that law firm fell over 
                        themselves just to watch her walk 
                        down the hall. And she encouraged it.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        You felt intimidated?
              BOBBIE SUE

           Phil looks back at Bobbie Sue, betrayed and hurt.

                                 PHIL
                        Yes.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Harassed?

                                 PHIL
                        Yes!

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Why?

           Phil is caught off guard.

                                 PHIL
                        What?

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Why did you feel harassed? Were you 
                        afraid that if you didn’t say yes to 
                        my advances you might suffer 
                        professionally?

                                 PHIL
                             (confused)
                        I don’t... what?

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Or did you feel “harassed” precisely 
                        because I wouldn’t consummate any of 
                        your little fantasies?

           Phil looks from the judge to the senior partners and back to 
           Bobbie Sue.

                                 PHIL
                             (frustrated)
                        It was a hostile work environment!

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Why? Because I could fire you?

           Phil lets down his guard, amused at Bobbie Sue’s last 
           question.

                                 PHIL
                        Fire me? You were a glorified temp!

           Phil covers his mouth - he said too much. Sarah Boyd smiles.
              BOBBIE SUE

           INT. COURTROOM - LATER

           Rosalind Wilks, the executive secretary, is on the stand 
           nervously twisting a hanky.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Ms. Wilks, for the court, would you 
                        estimate how often the women’s 
                        lavatory was stocked with toilet 
                        paper.

                                 MS. WILKS
                             (embarrassed)
                        I’d rather not say.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Please, Ms. Wilks. You’re under oath.

           Ms. Wilks hesitates for a moment, then confesses.

                                 MS. WILKS
                        They never restock. I bring my own 
                        toilet paper.

           Ms. Wilks breaks down into tears. The court gasps.

           INT. COURTROOM - LATER

           Rich is on the witness stand.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        So you never felt I behaved 
                        inappropriately on the job?

                                 RICH
                        I didn’t say that.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Care to elaborate?

                                 RICH
                        Working in an environment such as 
                        Baker, Stevens and Smith requires a 
                        certain degree of conformity...

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Conformity? You mean, acting like 
                        everyone else to promote teamwork and 
                        reduce problems of miscommunication.

                                 RICH
                        Exactly.
              BOBBIE SUE

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        So, as a woman entering a 
                        predominantly male work environment, 
                        I should have suppressed my “natural” 
                        tendency to remain passive and 
                        nurturing.

                                 RICH
                             (his temper rising)
                        That’s not what I’m saying. Your case 
                        is completely different.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Perhaps I should have been more 
                        aggressive, shared more of the ribald 
                        humor of the office...

           Rich is steaming. He sets his steely gaze on Bobbie Sue.

                                 RICH
                        That’s not the kind of conformity I’m 
                        talking about!

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Oh, you mean, conforming to their 
                        image of you? Hiding who you are? 

           Rich’s eyes are ablaze - a damn has burst.

                                 RICH
                        That’s right! You wanna be in the 
                        game you play the game! You know how 
                        hard it is to hear your co-workers 
                        mispronounce Kanye West and not 
                        correct them? And yes, I admit it, I 
                        like Tyler Perry. 
                             (defeated, trembling)
                        Sometimes you’re just like Martin 
                        Lawrence in Wild Hawgs, selling out 
                        for that paycheck!

           Bobbie Sue approaches and lays a hand on his.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        We’ll always have Bad Boys Two. Just 
                        remember that.

           Rich breaks down into sobs, clutching her hand.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                             (to judge)
                        No further questions.
              BOBBIE SUE

           In the back of the gallery we see Sarah Boyd busily typing 
           out a text message on her phone - her grin widening.

           INT. COFAX HOUSE - NIGHT

           Daddy Cofax sits in his living room watching the news with 
           four of his sons. On the screen we see a REPORTER outside the 
           courthouse.

                                 REPORTER
                        After several days of testimony, 
                        Bobbie Sue Cofax is steadily building 
                        her case that not only is there a 
                        double standard at Baker, Stevens and 
                        Smith when it comes to appropriate 
                        office behavior, but that her 
                        reputation for taking no prisoners is 
                        well-founded.

           The brothers high-five and Daddy Cofax beams.

                                 DADDY COFAX
                        Thattaway, Bobbie Sue!

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

           The gallery is half full of WOMEN, a few of whom we recognize 
           from the depositions. Bobbie Sue busies herself at her table 
           when the bailiff enters.

                                 BAILIFF
                        All rise!

           Bobbie Sue gets to her feet as Judge Roberts enters. She 
           turns back, notices the women, then catches Sarah Boyd’s eye 
           for a moment.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Your honor, I’d like to call Joseph 
                        Baker to the stand.

           Joe Baker, Sr. stands from the defense table, ready to take 
           on Bobbie Sue.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Joe Baker, Junior.

           Baker’s smirk turns to a frown as Joe stands in the gallery.
              BOBBIE SUE

           INT. COURTROOM - LATER

           Bobbie Sue paces before Joe pining away in the witness box.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        So it was originally your idea to 
                        hire me?

                                 JOE
                             (sweetly)
                        Hi, Bobbie Sue.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Just answer the question! Why me? Did 
                        it have something to do with your 
                        wager?

                                 JOE
                             (nervous)
                        My wager?

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Did you or did you not organize a 
                        betting pool on how quickly you could 
                        get me into bed?

           We hear gasps from the audience. Joe tries to smile, play it 
           off, but he’s in agony.

                                 JOE
                        It was just a bit of office humor...

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Answer the question, Joe!

                                 JOE
                        Yes.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Is that why you hired me?

                                 JOE
                        What?

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        To have sex with me? Then fire me?

                                 JOE
                        No!

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Seems rather convenient. Win your 
                        bet, then kick me to the curb.
             BOBBIE SUE

                                 JOE
                        That’s not how it was! It had nothing 
                        to do with the bet. They were going 
                        to fire you anyway.

           More gasps, this time from Baker, Stevens and Smith. 

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Oh really?

           Joe looks to his father, who shakes his head slowly. Joe 
           looks back at Bobbie Sue.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        Tell me, Joe. What were the 
                        conditions of my employment? Just how 
                        did you convince Baker, Stevens and 
                        Smith to hire me?

           Joe glances at his father again, steels himself, and 
           confesses...

                                 JOE
                        We needed a woman to win the Fleet 
                        Tech case. It was a PR move. Nothing 
                        more.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        And after I won?

                                 JOE
                        They’d invent a reason to fire you.

           The gallery buzzes.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        One last question. Beyond the Fleet 
                        Tech case, did I have any influence 
                        over the firm? Any power at all?

           Joe looks to his father who is seething across the room.

                                 JOE
                             (staring down Baker)
                        You were a joke to them.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        No further questions

           Joe looks back to Bobbie Sue, hopeful.

                                 JOE
                        But you’ll always have power over me.
             BOBBIE SUE

                                 JUDGE ROBERTS
                        You may step down.

                                 JOE
                        Really?

           Joe gets to his feet, but he does not step down.

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        I have a question! 

           For a moment he has the court’s attention, then...

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                             (to Bobbie Sue)
                        What are you doing tonight? Say seven 
                        o’clock?

                                 JUDGE ROBERTS
                        Step down, Mr. Baker.

           Joe looks from the judge and back to Bobbie Sue. He mimes a 
           phone to his ear and whispers...

                                 JOE
                        Just call me.

           EXT. BOSTON STREET - DAY

           Bobbie Sue struts down the street with a new confidence. A 
           few WOMEN recognize her and nudge each other with a smile. 

           EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           Bobbie Sue approaches the entrance as two WOMEN exit. 

                                 WOMAN #1
                        Hey, it’s Bobbie Sue Cofax.

                                 WOMAN #2
                        Keep up the good work, Bobbie Sue!

           INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           Bobbie Sue is in line for coffee. She can tell that most of 
           the CUSTOMERS around her are talking about her, and a smile 
           creeps across her face.

           The CUSTOMER in front of her steps away and the same Barista 
           that snubbed her before notices it’s Bobbie Sue.
             BOBBIE SUE

                                 BARISTA
                        Hi! May I help you?

           INT. NAIL SALON - DAY

           The manicurist finishes Bobbie Sue’s toe nails. She looks 
           down to read, painted out on her toes, Y-O-U G-O G-I-R-L-! 

           Bobbie Sue smiles and the manicurist gives her a thumbs up.

           EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BOBBIE SUE’S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           Joe digs through a trash can, searching through discarded 
           papers and old food. He finds a strand of dental floss and 
           lovingly caresses it against his cheek. After a moment’s 
           hesitation, he runs it between his teeth.

           Bobbie Sue exits her building ready for another day in court. 
           As she passes the alley, she notices Joe.

                                 BOBBIE SUE 
                        Joe?

           Joe, startled, turns to Bobbie Sue, the floss still hanging 
           from his teeth.

                                 JOE
                        Bobbie Sue. Hi.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Is that my dental floss?

           Joe pauses, thinking...

                                 JOE
                        I hope so.

           Bobbie Sue sighs and extends a hand.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                             (motherly)
                        Come on in. 

           Joe’s face brightens and he scrambles to her side.

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

           The audience is overflowing with WOMEN as Bobbie Sue prepares 
           for her next witness. 
             BOBBIE SUE

                                 JUDGE ROBERTS
                        All right, Ms. Cofax. Whom do we have 
                        today?

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        I’d like to call Bill Bradley to the 
                        stand, your honor.

           INT. COURTROOM - LATER

           Bill Bradley is on the witness stand, squirming under Bobbie 
           Sue’s questions.

                                 BOBBIE SUE 
                        Mr. Bradley. How did you respond when 
                        you heard your law firm, Baker, 
                        Stevens and Smith had hired a woman 
                        to lead your defense against more 
                        than 200 women suing your company for 
                        sexual harassment?

                                 BILL BRADLEY
                        It was a brilliant strategy.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        How so?

                                 BILL BRADLEY
                        Well, it worked didn’t it?

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Yes, well, before it worked, you 
                        still thought it was brilliant. Why?

                                 BILL BRADLEY
                             (hesitant)
                        Because...

           Bradley straightens up, confident... he’s found the words he 
           think will save him.

                                 BILL BRADLEY (CONT’D)
                             (lying)
                        Because, I’ve always been a great 
                        admirer of women’s equality with men. 
                        As I often say, women can do anything 
                        a man can do, and there is no reason 
                        a woman shouldn’t have led our 
                        defense.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        I see. And what about men’s equality 
                        with women?
             BOBBIE SUE

                                 BILL BRADLEY
                        Excuse me?

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        You’ve established your conviction 
                        that women can do anything a man can 
                        do. Does it work the other way 
                        around?

                                 BILL BRADLEY
                             (confused)
                        I don’t...

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Can men have a baby?

                                 BILL BRADLEY
                        Well, no...

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Breast feed?

                                 BILL BRADLEY
                        No.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Stop traffic if they’re topless?

                                 BILL BRADLEY
                        Depends on the man, but...

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        So you don’t, in fact, think men are 
                        equal to women?

           Baker stands from the defense table.

                                 BAKER
                        Objection, your honor! How does any 
                        of this have any bearing on the case 
                        at hand. The suit against Fleet Tech 
                        was settled weeks ago.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Your honor, Mr. Bradley has implied 
                        that my role in his case had nothing 
                        to do with my gender. I intend to 
                        show otherwise.

                                 BAKER
                        That is simply absurd.

                                 JUDGE ROBERTS
                        Overruled.
             BOBBIE SUE

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Thanks, your honor.
                             (to Bill Bradley)
                        Where were we?

                                 BILL BRADLEY
                             (weary)
                        Men are not equal to women.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Right. Thanks. 

                                 BILL BRADLEY
                             (panicking)
                        That’s not what I’m saying... It’s 
                        just...

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Were you pleased with the job I did 
                        on your case, Mr. Bradley?

                                 BILL BRADLEY
                        Pleased? Well, yes.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                             (pointing at the defense)
                        Do you think any one of the men 
                        sitting at that table could have done 
                        better?

           Bill Bradley looks at his friends - the three old men of 
           Baker, Stevens and Smith - then hangs his head.

                                 BILL BRADLEY
                        No.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        And why not?

                                 BILL BRADLEY
                        Because they’re men.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        If you had a strong case why should 
                        that matter?

                                 BILL BRADLEY
                        Because we had no case! Those damn 
                        women would have eaten us alive!

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        No further questions.

           Bobbie Sue turns but Bill Bradley isn’t finished.
             BOBBIE SUE

                                 BILL BRADLEY
                        Don’t you turn away from me, you 
                        uppity little skirt!

                                 JUDGE ROBERTS
                             (stern)
                        You may step down, Mr. Bradley.

                                 BILL BRADLEY
                             (to Bobbie Sue)
                        You’re just like the rest of them! 
                        Weak-willed and good for one thing...

           Judge Roberts raises an eyebrow.

                                 JUDGE ROBERTS
                        And what would that be, Mr. Bradley?

                                 BILL BRADLEY
                        Don’t interrupt me, woman!

                                 JUDGE ROBERTS
                        Bailiff. 
                             (to Bill Bradley)
                        That’s thirty days for contempt.

           The Bailiff starts to pull Bill Bradley from the witness 
           stand, but he’s still going strong...

                                 BILL BRADLEY
                        Contempt? I’ve got nothing but 
                        contempt! It’s a man’s world, 
                        sweetheart! Get used to it.

                                 JUDGE ROBERTS
                        Sixty days. Do I hear ninety?

           As Bill Bradley is pulled from the room...

                                 BILL BRADLEY
                        Fuck you! Mouthy bitch!

           Judge Roberts bangs her gavel and with a slight smile...

                                 JUDGE ROBERTS
                        Ninety days for Mr. Bradley.

           The gallery of women is alive with satisfied murmuring and 
           Bobbie Sue settles into her seat with a huge grin.
             BOBBIE SUE

           INT. COURTHOUSE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Bobbie Sue sits across the conference table from Baker, 
           Stevens and Smith. The old men talk through forced smiles.

                                 BAKER
                        We’re prepared to offer you a 
                        handsome settlement, Bobbie Sue.

                                 STEVENS
                        A handsome settlement.

                                 SMITH
                             (too loud)
                        Hand some fecal matter!

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        How handsome?

           Baker writes a figure on a sheet of paper and slides it over 
           to Bobbie Sue. She raises her eyebrows.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        I can see why you wouldn’t want to 
                        say a number like that out loud.

           She slides the paper back to Baker.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        What else you got?

                                 BAKER
                        You want more?

                                 STEVENS
                        It’s a handsome offer.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Look, boys, your offer, while 
                        “handsome”, just ain’t doing it for 
                        me. Maybe it’s because I’ve always 
                        thought of handsome as something you 
                        say to a 13 year-old on his Bar 
                        Mitzvah, but I’m looking for more. 
                        And unless you can write your 
                        collective dignity down on that piece 
                        of paper, I’ve got a closing argument 
                        to make.

           Bobbie Sue stands and leaves the three men in stunned 
           silence. After a beat...
             BOBBIE SUE

                                 SMITH
                             (too loud)
                        I like her!

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

           Bobbie Sue stands before the jury. The gallery is standing 
           room only, mostly women. 

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Ladies and gentlemen. Sounds nice, 
                        doesn’t it? Ladies. And gentlemen. 
                        Our best versions of ourselves. Women 
                        who know their place and men who make 
                        sure they remember. As you’ve seen 
                        over the last few weeks, no one ever 
                        taught me how to be a lady. I’m loud. 
                        I’m offensive. I probably drink too 
                        much, and you probably shouldn’t 
                        bring me home to meet your parents. 
                        But I’m a damn good lawyer. And I 
                        proved that in the worst way with 
                        Baker, Stevens and Smith. I took 212 
                        women and put them through hell 
                        because that’s what it took to win. 
                        But there’s one thing I never fully 
                        understood. The difference between a 
                        men and women isn’t what’s under the 
                        hood... it’s power. Who controls 
                        whose fate. The good old boys at 
                        Baker, Stevens and Smith would like 
                        you to believe I am as guilty of 
                        sexual harassment as the good old 
                        boys of Fleet Tech. But as we’ve 
                        learned, I never controlled anyone’s 
                        fate. And mine was sealed the moment 
                        I took the job. I was a glorified 
                        temp.
                             (beat)
                        The women of Fleet Tech were 
                        intimidated and afraid and they 
                        should have been - their jobs were at 
                        stake, their futures. The men of 
                        Baker, Stevens and Smith were 
                        intimidated and afraid cause they 
                        wanted what they couldn’t have. And 
                        after they were done with me, they 
                        finally had what they no longer 
                        wanted. So I got canned.
                             (beat)
                        Ladies. And gentlemen.

                        You’re going go in that little room 
                        and you’re going decide if that’s the 
                        way we want this to go. And if I’ve 
                        done my job, and I always do, you’re 
                        going to come back in here and tell 
                        those men, ‘Not on my watch.’ 
                             (beat)
                        But here’s what you’re not going to 
                        do. You’re not going to give me 
                        anything. Not one cent. All I want is 
                        for you to stand up and say they’re 
                        wrong. That Baker, Stevens and Smith - 
                        and every other Fleet Tech men’s club 
                        - has given the shaft to women and 
                        you’re not going to take it anymore.

           INT. COURTROOM - LATER

           The JURY FOREMAN stands to render the verdict.

                                 JURY FOREMAN
                        We the jury find for the plaintiff. 

           The gallery ERUPTS IN CHEERS and Bobbie Sue LEAPS to her 
           feet, pointing at the jury.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Yeah, you do!

           Judge Roberts BANGS her gavel.

                                 JUDGE ROBERTS
                        Order!

           But it’s no use, the women in the audience continue to cheer. 
           Bobbie Sue takes it all in, then turns to the judge.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Judge. About that victory lap...

           Judge Roberts finally smiles.

           FADE TO BLACK...

           Bobbie Sue sits at her desk pouring over documents. The phone 
           rings. She answers.
             BOBBIE SUE

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                             (hi-pitched, feminine)
                        Cofax and Boyd. May I help you?
                             (beat)
                        Let me see if she’s available.

           Bobbie Sue holds the phone away from her ear for a beat, then 
           in her normal, aggressive tone...

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        Cofax here. How can I help?

           Just then, Joe Baker stumbles into the office carrying a 
           heavy box of files. Bobbie sue covers the mouth piece.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        Joe, stay near the phone. I can’t 
                        keep answering it myself.

                                 JOE
                        Sorry.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        What the hell am I paying you for?

           Bobbie Sue returns to the call as Joe starts filing papers.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry Ms. O’Hanlon, we handle 
                        these kind of cases all the time. 
                        We’ll get those bastards.

           Bobbie Sue hangs up the phone.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        Boyd!

           Sarah Boyd pokes her head in from the next room.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        Carrie O’Hanlon from the Quick Lube 
                        on Dorchester Ave.

                                 SARAH BOYD
                        Wage discrimination?

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Peep hole in the women’s bathroom.

                                 SARAH BOYD
                        That’s what I’m talking about!
             BOBBIE SUE

           Bobbie Sue holds out a hand and Sarah gives her a high five 
           before disappearing into her office. She notices Joe bending 
           over the file box and stares for a lingering moment.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        Nice filing system, Joe.

           Joe turns, realizes Bobbie Sue has been checking him out, 
           then shakes his head.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        What? I was talking about your ass. 
                        What did you think? I was actually 
                        complementing your filing?

           Bobbie Sue returns to her paperwork.

                                 BOBBIE SUE (CONT’D)
                        So what’ll it be for dinner tonight?

                                 JOE
                        I invited your dad over for tapas.

           Bobbie Sue looks up.

                                 BOBBIE SUE
                        You got my dad to our house for 
                        tapas? You are some kind of man, Joe 
                        Baker.

                                                              FADE OUT.

                                         THE END
