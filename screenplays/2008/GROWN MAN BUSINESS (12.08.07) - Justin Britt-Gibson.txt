STREET - NIGHT 

           A BOY (pre-teen) 

           Short, slim, black.  Cloaked in a black hoodie, eyes almost 
           completely obscured.  He faces us, reciting a passage from 
           Mobb Deep's 'Survival of the Fittest.'  His delivery is 
           drilling, fearless.  Behind him, a GRAFFITI ARTIST (same age) 
           bombs a brick wall.

                                 BOY
                        There's a war goin' on outside, no man is 
                        safe from...
                             (he continues; the lyrics 
                              are cutting, potent, 
                              honest.)
                        ...My goal's to stay alive.  Survival of 
                        the fit only the strong survive.

           He walks away from us as the graffiti artist completes his 
           latest creation, the titles: GROWN MAN BUSINESS.

           LEGEND:  HOUSING PROJECT, '91

           INT. HIMES UNIT - NIGHT

           Monday night football on a 20' television.  A bag of chips, a 
           can of beer, a jar of baby food - all opened and exhausted on 
           the table.  

           A PAGER rattles near the table's edge.

           A MAN sleeping on the couch, his right arm holding his BABY 
           BOY (2) against his chest.  

           The Man's eyes open -

           JOE (early 20's)

           Lean and boyishly handsome, his looks deceptive for a gang 
           enforcer and corner dealer.  He grabs the pager, careful not 
           to wake the baby, COREY (barely a year old).

           IN THE KITCHEN

           Joe grabs the phone, dials, cradling Corey.  Then -

                                 PRINCE (O.S.)
                        Joe.

                                 JOE
                        Yeah.

                                 PRINCE (O.S.)
                        It's Duke.  He gone.
                             (beat)
                        Niggas from eighth street rolled by on 
                        wheels, let loose.  Pumped into him 'till 
                        he had nothing left. 

           Joe processes the news, mournful, filled with malice for the 
           culprits.  His expression remains hard, neutral, like a rock. 

                                 PRINCE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Joe, you there?

                                 JOE
                        Yeah, I'm here.

                                 PRINCE (O.S.)
                        Strap up.  Be downstairs.  I sent a ride.

           INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Joe places Corey in his crib.  He crosses to his bed, 
           produces a .38 Revolver from under the pillow, tucks it in 
           the waistband of his jeans.  

           PATTY (20's), his girlfriend, sleeps on the other side of the 
           bed, inches from an opened Essence Magazine.  Joe kisses her, 
           lightly stroking her back.  She stirs.  

                                 PATTY
                             (half awake)
                        Come to bed.

                                 JOE
                        Gotta make a run.  Back in a bit.

                                 PATTY
                        You be careful.

           Joe moves quietly, stops at the bedroom door.  He takes one 
           last look at his family, leaves.

                                                  OVER BLACK:

'84 SEVILLE (NOW) - MOVING - NIGHT

           JAY-Z on the stereo.  Windows throbbing.  

           JAVIER (14)

           Angelic features.  Ebony on the outside.  Salvadoran by 
           blood.  Growing before our very eyes.  He sits in the 
           passenger seat, gazing out the window.  What he sees:

           After hours on a mean street.  The urban wild.  A third world 
           pocket of a major American city.  Derelicts wrapped in 
           blankets, making beds out of sewer grates.  Pre-teens flank 
           the corners, working the night shift.  Boys hawk narcotics; 
           girls peddle pussy.  No law in sight. 

           As Javier continues to digest the view -

           INT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT (DAYS EARLIER)

           Javier taking inventory in an aisle, toughing out the 
           graveyard shift.  He eyes a giant CLOCK above the meat 
           section: "1:00 A.M.".

           INT. GROCERY STORE - LATER

           Javier in line behind fellow employees, waiting for his 
           check.

           INT. CITY BUS - NIGHT

           Javier reviewing his check.  His earnings read: "$5.50/hr."

           Off Javier -

           Javier comes to, looks beside him -

           TWIN (18) 

           Legal adult, a man since twelve.  Tall, toned, handsome.  A 
           consciously smooth criminal.  

           He cuts the engine, opens the glove box, pulls out a .45 
           AUTOMATIC, unlocks the safety.  He passes the gun to Javier, 
           lights a cigarette, peering out the windshield, spots -

                        You know him?

           Javier shakes his head, clearly doesn't.  Twin passes him a 
           bandana. 

           Javier dons the bandana, conceals his face, gloves his hands.  

           EXT. STREET, GRIFFITH AVE - JAVIER - MOMENTS LATER

           Marching for the boy, heart punching his chest.  He trains 
           the .45 on him, empties two heartless SHOTS.

           The boy collapses onto the pavement, goes into shock.  His 
           PIT BULL barks, keeping a safe distance from his master's 
           killer.  He begins crawling on the cement, breathing his last 
           breaths.  

           Javier follows close behind, trembling, .45 smoking in his 
           grip.  He FIRES again, paints the curb with brain matter.  

           A long, silent beat.  Javier can't take his eyes off the boy.  
           Then, he gags, nearly loses his food.

           The Seville pulls up.  Twin kicks open the door.  Javier 
           starts for the car in a daze, not quite there.

                        Leave it!  

           Javier drops the .45, jumps in the Seville - already tearing 
           off.

           INT./EXT. '84 SEVILLE - MOMENTS LATER

           Javier removes the bandana, looking through the rear 
           windshield: the boy's corpse grows smaller.  He turns to the 
           road ahead, digests a new, unsettling reality:  he is now a 
           killer.

           The Seville barrels down the boulevard, into the night.

           The man stands over a hot stove.  He cooks four dishes at

                        You respect it and it's gonna respect 
                        you.

           Javier slips the pistol beneath his pillow.

                                 CASINO (CONT'D)
                        Own your corner, like it's your property.   
                        Make 'em fear you.  Someone tries to take 
                        your property, don't even hesitate.  And 
                        if you do end up making an example of 
                        some nigga, make sure every other nigga 
                        'round the way knows, so don't happen 
                        again.  

           He sinks under the covers, trembling with chills, the night's 
           events finally realized.  He shuts his eyes, fights for 
           balance, focus.

                        sleeping.  That's all I ask.  Sky's the 
                        limit from there. 

           Finally, slow breaths, gradually coming down.  Cool.  
           Assured.  Initiated.

           INT. MORGUE HALLWAY - EARLY MORNING

           Patty (mid-30's now), weathered by years of stress, deceitful 
           men, rare periods of intimacy.  She's in a hurry.  Breath 
           short, heels clapping the floor.  She's praying silently, 
           preparing for the worst.  Arrives at two DETECTIVES flanking 
           the double doors,  expressions wearing bad news.

           INT. MORGUE, EXAMINATION ROOM - EARLY MORNING

           She sobs mascara onto a corpse: the boy Javier shot.  COREY 
           (18 now), her only son.  Her body quakes with extreme bouts 
           of sadness, anger, frustration - this is the most painful 
           moment of her life.

                        The body was found around 11:45 last 
                        night on the corner of Griffith and 
                        Sixteenth.

                        Ballistics reports he was shot three 
                        times at close range with a forty-five 
                        caliber hand gun.  Murder weapon was left 
                        at the scene.  No prints were found.  We 
                        have yet to generate an ID on the weapon 
                        because the serial numbers were worn 
                        down.  At this point it's untraceable.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER

           Patty in a chair.  Physically and emotionally drained.  
           Across from her: the two detectives, hands around empty 
           coffee cups, pens perched on blank pads.  Waiting. 

                                 PATTY
                        Can I have some water?

           Detective #1 pushes away from the table, moves for the 
           cooler.  #2 avoids eye contact with Patty, uneasy, eager to 
           get the questioning over with.

           Detective #1 returns with a cup of water.

                                 PATTY (CONT'D)
                        Thank you.

           She reaches into her purse, pulls out a PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE. 

                                 DETECTIVE #1
                        Did your son have any enemies, Ms. Himes?

           She shakes her head, tapping out two pills.  She swallows 
           both, chases them with water.

                                 DETECTIVE #1 (CONT'D)
                        You sure there wasn't someone he didn't 
                        gel with at school, or around the 
                        neighborhood?  Anyone.

                                 PATTY
                        I'm sure.

                        With all due respect Ms. Himes, these 
                        cases aren't solved overnight.  We're 
                        going to need some time on this one.

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Patty hunched over the toilet bowl, vomiting, eyes flooded 
           with tears.  She hugs the bowl, losing her mind.

                        Hard to say.  Wish I could give you a 
                        definite timetable, but it varies from 
                        case to case.

           The MANAGER answers the phone.  He cradles it, looking out 
           into the garage.

           He marches past a series of cars in repair, mechanics toiling 
           beneath them.

           The mechanic stops at a sedan.  Kneels below it.

           JOE (mid-30's now)

           Emerges from beneath the car, soaked in sweat and oil.  His 
           build is hard, muscular.  An old SCAR runs the length of his 
           cheek.  His arms are adorned in a rich assortment of tattoos -
           - some from prison, some from the military.  This man has 
           lived.

JOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Low rent housing.  Sparse furnishings and blank walls.  
           Soulless and lonely.  Joe emerges from the bedroom with a bag 
           slung over his shoulder.  He gives the place a once-over, 
           switches off the light, leaves.

           INT. JAVIER'S BEDROOM - MORNING

           MYRNA (30's)

           Salvadoran import.  Working class features, but a natural 
           beauty beneath the wear and tear.  From the sound of her 
           inflection she's still learning English. 

           She sits on the edge of Javier's bed, fiddles nervously with 
           the money her son slipped into her purse the night before.  

                                 MYRNA

                        Javie.

           Myrna grows impatient, removes the sheets.

           He opens his eyes, gives her his attention.  She brandishes 
           the money, demands an explanation.

                        Where did you get this?

           He turns on his side, away from her gaze, closes his eyes.

                                 JAVIER

                        Baby, this is five-hundred dollars.

           Javier is comatose.  Myrna rocks him hard.

                        Parking cars downtown.  At the Grand.

                        I got hooked up.  

           She lays the money down, senses it's wrong.

           Javier turns to her, awake now, tosses his clothes on the

                        No! 

           He grabs the money, places it in her hand, closes it.  He 
           looks into her eyes, decided.

                                 JAVIER (CONT'D)
                        This is my new job.  We can start living 
                        on what you and I are making now, maybe 
                        start saving real money.  Don't ask me to 
                        go back to minimum.

                        We need this. 

           Myrna sighs, confused, tempted.  She places a hand on him, 
           wants to trust his word, kisses him.

                        I have to work.  Don't be late for 
                        school.  

           She drops the money in her purse, exits.

           Javier falls back onto the bed, passes out.

           INT. HOUSING PROJECT, HALLWAY - MORNING

           MARCUS (14), pushing his skateboard down the hallway.  He 
           glides though a maze of discarded wrappers, cigarette butts, 
           beer cans and 40 oz. bottles.  Total disarray.

           He KNOCKS on the bars.  Myrna opens the door. 

                                 MYRNA

                        He's in his room.  Go on back.

           She gathers her keys, walks for -

           FELIPE (30's) 

           her boyfriend, slouched in a chair, shoveling Corn Flakes 
           before 'The Today Show.'  Bitter at the world, in no hurry to 
           find a job.

           She wraps her arms around him from behind, kisses him 
           goodbye.  He remains glued to the television, unresponsive.

           Marcus moves past the living room, dragging his board.

                        Then pick it up.

           Marcus picks up the board.

           Myrna: frozen in place, quietly embarrassed.

           INT. JAVIER'S BEDROOM - MARCUS - CONTINUOUS

           Enters, jovial, eager to get the jump on his partner in 
           crime.  

                                 MARCUS
                        What up, boy?  

           Javier doesn't answer, savoring his sleep.

           Marcus crosses to the window, draws the curtains, opens the 
           window.  The roar of the city floods the room, wakes Javier.  
           Groggy.

                                 MARCUS (CONT'D)
                        Time for school, negro.

           He grabs a towel off the bed, places it at the bottom of the 
           door, plugs the opening.  He sparks a JOINT.  Offers Javier a 
           hit.  He accepts. 

                                 MARCUS (CONT'D)
                        Damn, kid what's up with the eyes?  You 
                        look dead.

           Javier grabs the towel from the floor, throws it over his 
           shoulder, tries to wake himself up.

                        Where you been all weekend?  Terrell had 
                        a little thing on Saturday.  Your boy was 
                        dropping fools.  Can't nobody see me on 
                        'GOW'.

           He draws twenty dollars, boastfully waves it in his friend's 
           face.

                                 MARCUS (CONT'D)

                        No-uh!

           Marcus launches under Javier's pillow.  Steals the PISTOL.  
           Javier grabs back.  Marcus recoils excitedly.

                                 MARCUS (CONT'D)
                        Shit is heavy.

                        Jericho, nine-forty-one-F.

           He stands in front of the mirror, poses with the pistol.  
           Like they do in the movies.

                                 MARCUS (CONT'D)
                        Goddamn.  You could really hot someone 
                        with this.  How'd you get it?

           Javier takes the pistol from Marcus, places it back under the 
           pillow.

                                 JAVIER
                        Don't worry about it.

           Marcus steals back his joint.

                                 MARCUS
                        Stole it didn't you?

                        Liar.  Yeah you did.

           Javier moves past Marcus, disappears into the bathroom, 
           starts a shower.

           Marcus creeps to the bed, retrieves the gun.  Back in front 
           of the mirror, he levels the pistol, trains it on his image, 
           unlocks the safety, draws back the hammer.  Fakes a shot.  
           Enamored.

           Exiting the apartment.  Backpacks slung over their shoulders. 

           As the two reach the curb, an '84 Seville rolls to a stop.  
           The windows roll down, Twin inside.

           Javier moves for the car, reaches through the window.  Trades 
           a dap with Twin.

                                 TWIN
                        Hey, partna'.  You going to school.

                        My boy Marcus.

           Javier turns to his friend, eyes apologizing.

           The Seville screams from the curb.  Leaves Marcus in its 
           wake.  He lowers his skateboard to the concrete.  Kicks off.

           Twin lights a cigarette, offers Javier a smoke.

                        I threw up all night after my first time.

           furtively pulls his pistol, drops it in the bushes amongst an 
           arsenal of hidden firearms. 

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

           Javier standing in line as other students have their bags 
           thoroughly checked, proceeding through METAL DETECTORS.  

           A SECURITY GUARD checks Javier's bag.  They exchange a look.  
           The guard pockets the baggie and bill - currency for Javier's 
           passage.  The guard nods approvingly.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Have a good day.

           INT. JOE'S CAR - MORNING 

           Joe taps ash into a the tray, takes a drag from his 
           cigarette.  He takes in a view of the city as his car crosses 
           the bridge.  It's been a while since both have seen each 
           other.

           LATER:

           DOWNTOWN - JOE

           Watching the drones rush to work in their suits and skirts, 
           barking into their mobiles, tapping their Blackberries.  
           Gradually the city devolves.  Skyscrapers become tenement 
           buildings, abandoned property.  The people get darker, 
           poorer.  He's almost home.  

                                                  CUT TO:

           INT./EXT. '91 SEDAN/STREET (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT 

           Rain assaulting the windshield.  NWA on the radio.  Mood 
           vengeful.

           Young Joe riding shotgun.  ROSCOE (22), Joe's running mate, 
           behind the wheel, smoking a joint, murder in his eyes.  He 
           offers Joe a hit, who passes.

           A YELLOW LIGHT turns RED.

           Roscoe mashes the gas, burns through the intersection.  An 
           oncoming TAXI slams its brakes, honks in protest.

           Joe looks to Roscoe: "are you crazy?"

                                 ROSCOE
                        Fuck him.  We gotta be someplace.

           The Sedan edges a curb, parks.

           Roscoe composes himself, wiping away tears.

                                 JOE
                        You aight?

           Roscoe rips the keys from the ignition, climbs out of the 
           car, evasive.

                                 ROSCOE
                        Yeah.

           INT. DUKE'S BAR, BACK OFFICE (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT

           Whiskey pouring into two highballs.

           PRINCE (30's) scarred, prodigious, the next in charge, hands 
           the glasses to Joe and Roscoe.  He sits at the edge of Duke's 
           desk, not quite ready to take the chair and assume command of 
           his superior's organization.

                        gave me a home when I had none.  Fed me,  
                        taught me how to work the corner, taught 
                        me how to be a man.

                                 ROSCOE
                        Good man.

                                 PRINCE

           He raises his glass.  The soldiers follow suit, drink.

           Prince rises from the desk, sinks into Duke's seat, gets 
           comfortable.  He removes a gold chain around his neck, 
           polishes it with a handkerchief.

           INT. JOE'S CAR (PRESENT) - DAY

           Joe, pensive, drives by Patricia's building, rounds the 
           corner.

           INT. CLASSROOM - MORNING

           Pre-lecture bustle.  A Freshman class indulging in gossip, 
           horseplay.  Young and restless.

           Javier scribbling through homework he was supposed to do the 
           night before.  A VOICE on the loudspeaker says the Pledge of 
           Allegiance.  Some stand.  Most sit, talking amongst 
           themselves.

           A TEACHER, 30's, enters.  Late.  Face transmitting stress.    
           She places her belongings on a desk, removes her coat,   
           breathes.

           Javier notes her arrival, picks up the pace.  

           Then, another VOICE on the loudspeaker, the PRINCIPAL:

                                 PRINCIPAL (O.S.)
                        Good morning students and faculty.  This 
                        is your Principal speaking.  Before you 
                        begin your week I'd like to take a moment 
                        and remember a dear student we lost over 
                        the weekend.  As some of you may, or may 
                        not know, Corey Himes, a high school 
                        senior and former varsity guard here at 
                        Kennedy was shot and killed on Griffith 
                        Avenue last night.  

           Javier freezes, pencil in mid-stroke.  He keeps his eyes on 
           the homework, remaining calm as the principal remembers the 
           boy he shot last night.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        No news on the suspects, but you are 
                        urged to come forward if you have any 
                        information that pertains to Corey's 
                        murder.  Thank you and have a pleasant 
                        day.

           The teacher stands before class.

                        name's on it.

           Students groan as they comply, gathering their homework.

           A STUDENT tosses his papers onto Javier's desk.  Javier 
           glances at it, steals the remaining answers.  Lightning 
           quick.  Then, passes both papers forward.

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - AFTERNOON

           Joe walks down the hall.  Two small CHILDREN blaze past him, 
           playful, unattended.

           He stops at a unit.  KNOCKS.

           Patty opens the door, regards Joe's image, incredulous, yet 
           relieved to see this man.  

           He remains silent, evasive, unsure what to say to the woman 
           he abandoned fifteen years ago.  

           INT. PATTY'S UNIT - PATTY - LATER

           On the couch, her hands keeping warm around a cup of coffee.  
           Joe sits beside her.  SHUGGIE, Corey's pit-bull sits by Joe's 
           knees.  They trade gazes, both equally curious about the 
           other.

                                 PATTY
                        That's Shuggie.  Boy rarely ever left the 
                        house without him.  Dog meant the world 
                        to him.

           Joe shows Patty a pack of smokes.  She waves them off.

                                 PATTY (CONT'D)
                        Knock yourself out.   

           Joe lights up.  He notes Patty, tapping out two pills, 
           chasing them with coffee.  

                                 PATTY (CONT'D)
                        Puts me in a better mood.

           Joe pick up a picture of Corey - in basketball uniform.

                                 PATTY (CONT'D)
                        He was real good.  Scouts from all over 
                        showed up for a couple of games.

                                 JOE
                        I saw him in the newspaper, when he 
                        dropped fifty.

                                 PATTY
                        You should've have been there to see it.  
                        It was like the whole gym exploded.  I 
                        was so proud.  But, you couldn't pull him 
                        away from that guitar.  Quit ball after 
                        junior year.  Said the only schools he'd 
                        consider were music schools.  I thought 
                        it was stubborn.

           Patty returns to silence, the grim reality of a life without 
           Corey still washing over her.

                                 PATTY (CONT'D)
                        Police had the nerve to ask if he was 
                        hustling.  

                                 JOE
                        Was he -

                                 PATTY
                        Never.  

                                 JOE
                        What did they say about the weapon?

                                 PATTY
                        I don't know, said it was a forty-five.  
                        One of them told me something about the 
                        serial numbers being worn off, so it was 
                        hard to match, or something.  The hell do 
                        I know about guns?   It's like nobody 
                        knows anything.  And if they did, 
                        well...you know how it goes.  

           Joe nods, he does.

           INT. CLASSROOM - AFTERNOON

           Javier, tuning out as the teacher writes on the board.  He 
           senses something.  Draws a mobile from his pocket - lighting 
           up.  He reads the screen.  Rises from his seat, leaves.  The 
           teacher takes note, continues to write on the board, 
           indifferent.

           COURTNEY (16, white)

           emerges from a stall.

                                 GIRL
                        You Javier?

                                 JAVIER
                        Yeah.

                                 GIRL
                        Courtney.

           Courtney pulls a wad of cash from her pocket, offers it to 
           Javier.  He takes it, counts.

                                 JAVIER
                        You're short twenty.

                                 COURTNEY
                        Then put me on credit.  Twin knows I'm 
                        good for it.

           Javier hands the money back, moves for the door.

                                 JAVIER
                        I don't.  Come back with twenty.

                                 COURTNEY
                        Okay.

           She spits her gum in the garbage, blows past him.  Locks the 
           door.  

                                 JAVIER
                        What are you doing?

                                 COURTNEY
                        Paying you what I owe.

           Courtney gently guides Javier against the wall.  She 
           unbuckles his pants, gets to her knees.  

                                 COURTNEY (CONT'D)
                        Pull out when it comes.  I hate the 
                        taste.

           Joe enters cautiously.  His son's memories are everywhere. 
           Posters of Jimi Hendrix, John Lee Hooker and Rage Against the 
           Machine grace the wall.  Countless basketball trophies line 
           the dresser.  Guitar pics litter the nightstand.  
           APPLICATIONS for various colleges on the floor.  A young life 
           left behind.

           Joe's eyes catch a Fender Stratocaster propped on it's stand 
           by the bed, gives him pause.  

                                 JOE
                        Thank you.

                                 PATTY
                        Don't say it again.  He'd want you here.

                                 JOE
                        No he wouldn't.

                                 PATTY
                        He never hated you for leaving.  I told 
                        him what happened and he understood.  We 
                        both did.

           She tries to keep it together.

                                 PATTY (CONT'D)
                        It means a lot, you being here.  I didn't 
                        know who else to call.  After you went 
                        away...Corey - he was it.  He was all I 
                        had.  I know I'm supposed to be strong, 
                        but it hurts.  God does it hurt.  I just 
                        wish I knew who did it.  I'd kill him - 
                        him and every other nigger he knows, just 
                        so they could feel what I feel.  Boy, if 
                        I could do what you could do, well, I'd 
                        have done it. 

           Patty begins to cry.  Joe inches towards her, wraps his arms 
           around her.  This is her release.

                                 PATTY (CONT'D)
                        I'm sorry.  
                             (beat)
                        Why would anyone want to hurt him?  It 
                        don't make no sense.

CORNER - NIGHT

           Javier deals to an unseen CUSTOMER in a car.  The exchange is 
           quick, furtive.  Like magic.  The car drives off.

           LATER - JAVIER

           Dealing to another CUSTOMER.  Same execution, only faster.  
           He's getting better.

           EXT. HOUSING PROJECT - NIGHT

           He steps off a city bus, walks for his building, comes upon 
           Marcus, pulling tricks on his skateboard.  

                                 MARCUS
                        Where you been at?

                             (passing him by)
                        Working.

           Marcus kicks the board into his hands, follows Javier.  
           Curious.

                                 MARCUS
                        Oh, yeah?  For who?

                                 JAVIER
                        Nobody you know.

           They enter -

           THE LOBBY

           passing stragglers, tenants and finally a SECURITY GUARD - 
           sitting behind a desk, lost in a magazine.

                                 MARCUS
                        You're hustling for Casino, ain't you?

           Javier shrugs, pleading the fifth.  They stop at an elevator.  
           Marcus pushes the "UP" button.  They wait.

                        Whatever.  My cousin used to work for

                        Good for him.

           They continue up the staircase, losing breath, passing a 
           JUNKIE huddled in the corner, passed out under a blanket, 
           high.

                                 MARCUS
                        So.  You gonna put a word in?

           They arrive at a door.  Javier inserts a key, opens it.  He 
           lets himself in, blocks Marcus's entry.

                                 MARCUS
                        If you can do it, I can do it.

           Javier slams the door.  Marcus lays down his skateboard, 
           kicks off, gliding down the hall.

           INT. JAVIER'S APARTMENT - ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Javier drops his bag on the bed, unzips it.  He ferries the 
           remaining dope into a brown paper bag - there's hardly any 
           left.  He pulls a wad of CASH from his pocket, counts it,  
           shakes his head, impressed with the day's take.  He places 
           the cash in an empty tissue box, save a few large bills.

           A loud VIBRATION.

           Javier draws his cell. 

           ON THE SCREEN: WASHINGTON AND FAIRVIEW.  10:30.  SENDER: TWIN

           He texts back : ALMOST OUT.  NEED MORE.

           Javier takes a deep breath, rubs his temples.  Exhausted.  He 
           transfers the dope back into his bag, shoulders it.

           HALLWAY

           Felipe emerges from Myrna's room smoking a cigarette.  He 
           steps in the bathroom, lobs the cigarette into the toilet, 
           stands against the door.

                                 FELIPE
                        Why you home so late?  

           Javier ignores the comment, continuing for the door.  There's 
           a history of tension between the two.

           Felipe clears a path, helpless.  

           Javier creeps to his mother's nightstand.  He gingerly slips 
           the two bills into her purse.  

           HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Javier blows past Felipe, not a word.

                        Where'd you get the money?  

           Javier doesn't respond, continues for the door.

                        Oh I see how it is.  A little change in 
                        your pocket makes you a man.  Think that 
                        gives you the right to disrespect me?  
                        I'm talking to you.  Don't think 'cause I 
                        ain't your pops I got no say around here.

           Javier is already out the door.  Felipe stands alone in the 
           hallway, emasculated.

           INT. SUBWAY STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT

           A late night car.  Littered with refuse from the day's 
           passengers.  Virtually empty save for Javier, slouched in a 
           seat, gazing enviably at a YOUNG COUPLE at the other end of 
           the car.  Hands locked.  The girl's head perched on the boy's 
           shoulder.  Seemingly comfortable in each others embrace.  
           Dead asleep.

           INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT

           Javier slides a five dollar bill into a slot.

           A CASHIER receives him behind bulletproof glass.  The cashier 
           examines Javier's face a moment, shakes his head with 
           indifference.  Then, places a pack of cigarettes through the 
           slot.   

           EXT. WASHINGTON AND FAIRVIEW - NIGHT

           Javier exchanges dope for cash to someone in a luxury car.  
           The customers:

           A WHITE COUPLE (20's), young, privileged, miles away from the 
           high life downtown.

           Pockets his fee, strikes a match to his cigarette.  A 4X4 
           cracks him from behind.   He falls hard to the concrete. A 
           YOUNG THIEF (early teens) relieves his pockets of his dope, 
           cash.  He takes off running.  

           Javier draws his pistol, takes aim, FIRES into the thief's 
           leg, drops him onto the cold cement.

           On his feet, staggering for the thief - crying like a baby. 

           He takes his property back, trains his pistol on the teen, 
           finger on the trigger - tempted, ultimately terrified.  Then, 
           he stalks away.

           INT. COREY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Joe sits against the wall, smoking, knees drawn up, staring 
           at Corey's bed.  He grabs a pillow, drops it on the hardwood 
           floor.  He shuts off the lamp, lies down.  

                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. '91 SEDAN (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT

           Joe loads his colt.  

           Roscoe reaches into the glovebox, retrieves his pistol, an 
           eighth of cocaine.  He snorts a line off the dashboard, 
           checks his magazine, slams it into his pistol.  

           They peer out the window, into the bar standing beside them: 
           four HOODS at the counter, smoking cigarettes, liquering up.

                                 ROSCOE
                        How many you count?

                                 JOE
                        'Bout five from here.  Could be more in 
                        the back.

           Roscoe takes a deep breath - he's scared shitless.

           INT. BAR (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT

           GUN SHOTS tear into a HOOD, throwing him off the barstool, 
           onto the floor next to a bloodied CORPSE. 

           Joe, mouth obscured by black bandana, moving past the hood -  
           reaching inside his coat, attempting to retaliate.  Joe 
           blasts the man's firing hand, kicks away his pistol.

                                 HOOD
                        Fuck you!

           Joe pops a kneecap, steps hard on the wound.  The hood WAILS.

                                 JOE
                        Where's your man?

           He levels the colt over the hood's balls, FIRES.  He CRIES 
           mercy.  

                                 HOOD
                             (freaking out)
                        At his lady's!  31 Market.  Jesus Christ!  

           That's all Joe needs from the hood, shoots him, point blank.

           Roscoe stands over another HOOD - multiple wounds, groaning 
           in agony. 

           Joe watches Roscoe struggle to finish him off.

                                 JOE
                        Hey!  Finish up!

           Roscoe starts out of his daze, levels his pistol, trembling 
           with fear.  Finally, he shoots the man in the head, walks 
           off, shaking his head to himself.

           He passes by the bar, spots the BARTENDER, hugging his knees 
           in the corner, praying he survives this God awful bloodbath.  
           A tense BEAT.  

                                 ROSCOE
                        What about him?

           Joe shakes his head.

           Roscoe turns back to the bartender, he can't do it.  Joe 
           steps in, kills the bartender with two callous shots.  He 
           marches out.

                                 JOE
                        Let's go.

           Roscoe stands frozen in place, repulsed with himself, 
           surrounded by bloodied corpses.

           He wants to fall to his knees, cry, beg for forgiveness; he 
           is not Joe.  Dealing death is killing him.

                        Let's go!

           Joe, wide awake on his side.  Then, a WHIMPER from the 
           hallway. 

           INT. PATTY'S UNIT - JOE - MOMENTS LATER

           Moving down the hall, sees Shuggie sniffing at the bathroom 
           door, whining, clawing at the wood.

           Joe opens the door -

           Patty lies on her stomach, foam dripping from her mouth, into 
           a puddle on the floor.  

           Joe looks to the counter: an empty bottle of pills.

           He hurries for Patty, cradles her, slaps her face, attempting 
           to revive her.  She doesn't respond.  A beat as Joe holds 
           Patty in his arms, numb, vacant.

           INT. STASH HOUSE - DAYS LATER - CASINO AND JAVIER (MONTAGE)

           Moving down the hallway.  

           IN THE KITCHEN

           Leila and another YOUNG GIRL count stacks of large bills, 
           thumbs working overtime, punching calculators, scribbling 
           totals in notebooks.

           Javier watches Leila work, following Casino.  They trade 
           curious looks.  She slows her count, almost loses her place.  
           Then, she re-focuses on the money.  Back to reality.

           IN THE BASEMENT

           TEENAGE GIRLS in surgical masks cut mounds of cocaine on 
           steel tables.  Others pack the substances into plastic bags.  
           Daytime television plays on a wall-mounted plasma screen.  A 
           slight diversion from the workday tedium.

           Casino introduces Javier to WORLD (30), associate and 
           overseer to the stash house.  They shake hands.

           LATER

           Casino grabs a dozen bags off the table, hands them to 
           Javier, who puts them in his bag. 

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY

           Javier pulls his cell out.  It BEEPS silently.  He rises from 
           the desk, leaves.  Unnoticed.

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Courtney enters the BOYS RESTROOM.  Javier follows.

           INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY

           Javier deals to a MAN in a robe.  Tired eyes, manicured 
           nails.  A PIMP.  

           Amidst the exchange, Javier sneaks a glance at two WHORES 
           smoking on the couch, bags beneath their eyes, noses red.  
           They watch daytime television, minds elsewhere.

           The Pimp pays Javier, sends him on his way.

           EXT./INT. STREET/ BMW - DAY

           A BOY (17) breaks into a BMW.  The execution is a crime it's 
           so effortless.  This is RAOUL.  

           Another BOY (17) plays lookout.  JAMES.  Both soldiers for 
           Casino.

           Raoul hot-wires the car.  The engine ROARS.  James jumps in 
           the passenger seat.  The BMW takes off.

           INT. TWIN'S GARAGE - DAY

           A storage house for stolen goods.  Stereos, DVD Players, 
           televisions, cars.

           Javier and Twin fire their pistols at paper targets.  
           Practice.

           The BMW comes rolling in, HONKING.  Javier and Twin turn.

           Raoul and James emerge from the car, proud, accomplished.  

           As Javier and Twin marvel at the purloined vehicle,  Raoul 
           and James grab pistols, FIRE at the targets.

'84 SEVILLE (MOVING) - DAY

           Twin rounds a corner.  Javier observes from the front seat.  
           Raoul shoots a rival CORNER KID - three callous shots.  
           Breaks his drive-by cherry.

           INT. '84 SEVILLE - NIGHT

           Marcus dons a bandana.  Twin smokes a cigarette, waiting.

           Javier rides shotgun, audience to his friends initiation.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT 

           Marcus moves in on a YOUNG COUPLE, holding hands, taking a 
           stroll.  He draws the pistol, FIRES on the male.  He goes 
           down.  The female CRIES for help.  Marcus turns the pistol on 
           her, FIRES.  

                                                  CUT TO BLACK.

           END MONTAGE.

           FADE IN:

           EXT. CEMETERY - MORNING

           Cold and cloudy.  Thousands of headstones stand on rotting 
           grass.  Numerous inscriptions indicate early departures; 
           teens, toddlers, babies - all buried much too early.

           Joe and a few ATTENDEES watch GRAVEDIGGERS lower Patty and 
           Corey's caskets into the dirt. 

           EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

           Joe ties Shuggie's leash to a bike rack.

           TWO OFFICERS exit the stations.  DISPATCH announces a 187 
           from their radios.  The officers stroll to their cruiser, 
           trading jokes, not a care in their world.

           Joe watches the cruiser take off, unties Shuggie's leash, 
           walks on.  Resigned.

           EXT. BAR - NIGHT 

           Joe enters, bumps shoulders with Twin - on his way out, 
           jiving into his cell phone.

                                 TWIN
                        Watch where the fuck you going.

           Twin looks Joe up and down, stalks away, returns to his 
           phone.

           INT. BAR - CONTINUOUS

           Limited space.  Old school furnishings.  A real hole in the 
           wall.  Framed photographs of James Brown, Isaac Hayes, Curtis 
           Mayfield on the wall.  

           A crew of OLD TIMERS play chess at a booth in the rear.  A 
           few others are glued to the television above the bar, slaves 
           to the lottery numbers.  

           Joe grabs a stool.  Meets eyes with the BARTENDER -

           RETHA (30's)

           Dark and full bodied.  Pretty for a woman who's lived.  Her 
           sleeveless top reveals strong arms.  "Jamal" is tattooed in 
           cursive on her left shoulder.  

           She plants a napkin before Joe.  

                                 RETHA
                        What are you having?

                                 JOE
                        Bud.  From the bottle.

           Retha pulls a beer from the ice-box, twists the cap.  Joe 
           takes a long, thankful swig.  He pulls a pack of NEWPORTS.  
           Fires up.  

                                 RETHA
                        Mind if I steal one?

           Joe taps out a stick for Retha, lights her up.

                                 RETHA (CONT'D)
                        You're a new face.  Where you coming 
                        from?

                                 JOE
                        Out of town.

                                 RETHA
                        I hope you got a good reason to be here.

           Joe's gazes straight ahead, evasive. 

                                 JOE
                        Funeral.

                                 RETHA
                        Seems to be the only reason anyone visits 
                        this part of town anymore.  I'm sorry.  
                        Were you close with the -

                                 JOE
                        No.

           Retha backs off.  Point taken.

           Joe clears the bottle.  He shifts in his seat, restless.  
           Something vicious is stirring inside.  A hunger for resolve;   
           a desire for retribution.  

           He rises, digs into his pocket.

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        How much I owe?

                                 RETHA
                        No.  It's on me.  

           Joe watches her return to the register, back to her own 
           business.  He wants to apologize, start the conversation 
           over.  Doesn't know how.  He pockets his money, leaves.

           INT. COREY'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Joe tosses his belongings in the duffle bag.  No time for a 
           neat pack; the guilt, frustration, helplessness are 
           suffocating him.  He wants out.  Then, he freezes, eyes on 
           Corey's guitar.  He lays a hand on it, caressing it, plucks a 
           string.

           He hefts his bag, ready to leave, stops in his tracks as his 
           eyes fall on a SCRAPBOOK wedged between the bed and the 
           nightstand.  

           IN THE KITCHEN - JOE - LATER

           Sitting by an open window, scratching Shuggie's neck.  He 
           smokes a cigarette, leafing through the scrapbook, learning 
           about the life he missed:

           News clippings report Corey's athletic career at Kennedy 
           High.  Polaroids of Corey and Patty, happy together.  Then, 
           he comes across a dated PICTURE OF HIMSELF, cradling BABY 
           Corey in his arms.  The only picture of Joe in the entire 
           book.

           (cid:13)           INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           A circle of MEN shout and cheer, fists wet with C-NOTES - 
           bloodthirsty.  They surround two PIT-BULLS, brawling to the 
           death.  Raw, bloody and inhumane.  A decent living for these 
           low lives.

           Joe observes from a entrance.  Shuggie sits beside him, 
           curious about the carnage.

           CHESTER (40's) 

           crouches near the center of the ring.  Short and portly.  
           Skin like cheap leather.  A hustler way past his prime.  He 
           studies the combat with a steely confidences.  

           One of the pit-bulls locks its jaw on the competition, begins 
           the end.  The loser slowly dies, neck soaked in blood.  

           A faint smile creeps across Chester's face; his dog has won.

           LATER

           The crowd begins to empty out.  The losing MASTER wraps his 
           bull in a blanket, carries it out.

           Chester towels blood from his bull's mouth, muzzles it.  He 
           rises, meets eyes with Joe.  He links his bull to a leash, 
           moves for the exit in a hurry, away from Joe.

           EXT. WAREHOUSE - CHESTER'S PIT BULL - NIGHT

           Taking a leak on a light post.  Chester shifting impatiently.

           Joe and Shuggie are on their way, strides casual, brave.

           Chester yanks his bull, scurries away.  Judging by his build, 
           he won't get far.  

                                 JOE
                        Why you running, big man?

                                 CHESTER
                        'Cause last I saw you there was a strap 
                        in your hand and I still ain't got what I 
                        owe, never will.  I'm broke.

                                 JOE
                        That ain't what it looked like back 
                        there.  I saw you collect.  Shit, thought 
                        you'da grown into a better liar by now.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT 

           Joe and Chester on the side walk, catching up.  Their dogs 
           pad beside them.

                        Scared the shit out of me, man.  
                        Thought you was here to settle my debt 
                        with Duke.

                        I heard you did at Drew's I saw the last 
                        of you.  Damn shame what happened, but in 
                        a weird way, I was glad it went down.  
                        Long as you were gone and Duke was dead, 
                        my slate was clean.

           INT. CASINO'S HOUSE, BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Casino's soldiers getting fucked up on weed, booze and 
           powder.   A real party.

           Javier sits in a barber's chair, nervous and eager.  A GIRL 
           (15) tattoos CROSSHAIRS on the back of his hand.  He smokes a 
           blunt for the pain.  

           Marcus stands beside him,  provides emotional support.  He 
           snatches the blunt, tokes, chases it with a bottle of Malt.

           Javier's eyes fall on Leila, holding a cocktail, gliding 
           through the horde, looking for an exit.  She discovers his 
           gaze, sizes him up.  Looks away, unimpressed.

           LATER - JAVIER

           On the couch, rubbing balm on his new tattoo, admiring the 
           craftsmanship.  He finds Marcus amidst the mob, spitting game 
           to a young lovely.

           Twin approaches with two beers.  A MAN (18) in a blue 
           Phillies cap trails close behind - tall, lineman's build.  A 
           white towel hangs over his left shoulder.  MOE.

           Twin hands Javier a beer.  They tap bottles, drink.  Twin 
           makes introductions.

                        Hey, we playing cards?  Who's in?

           The men read their hands.  Hector and World throw down their 
           cards, fold.

           Twin reads his cards, frowns, folds.

           Casino looks to Javier.

                                 CASINO
                        What about you?  Staying?

           Off Javier.

           INT. CASINO'S HOUSE, GAME ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           The bosses empty out, bested, each short a grand.  Casino 
           pays Javier, gives him a proud dap.

                                 CASINO
                        Have fun with that.  You earned it.

           Javier nods, takes it to heart.

CASINO'S HOUSE, ROOFTOP - NIGHT

           Javier smoking a cigarette, counting his winnings.  He sits 
           on the edge of the roof, takes in a majestic view of 
           downtown.  Only twenty blocks from where he stands, yet very 
           far away.  

                                 LEILA
                        How many times you gonna count it?

           Javier faces Leila, emerging from darkness.  She joins him on 
           the edge, rolling a spliff.

                                 JAVIER
                        You been watching me?

                                 LEILA
                        You got a lighter?

           Javier gives her a lighter.

                                 LEILA (CONT'D)
                        He let you win, you know.

           Javier shoots her a look, pride diminishing.

                                 LEILA (CONT'D)
                        He cheats. That's how he controls the 
                        game.  Been doing it for years.  That's 
                        how you won.

           She offers him a hit, he waves it off.

                                 JAVIER
                        Why'd he do it?

                                 LEILA
                        He likes you.  You make good money for 
                        him. 

                                 JAVIER
                        That why he likes you?

                                 LEILA
                        I'm different.  He loves me.

           Three GUN SHOTS echo in the distance.  A robbery, gang beef, 
           who knows?  Leila doesn't like it.

                                 LEILA (CONT'D)
                        There they go.  Can't never be quiet 
                        around here.

                        I don't even hear it anymore.  But them 
                        helicopters?  Those I can do without.

                                 LEILA
                        Glad I never got used to it.

                                 JAVIER
                        Where do you live?

                                 LEILA
                        Not around here.

           Leila puts out her spiff, heads back inside.

           Javier shakes his head.  What was that?

           A POLICE HELICOPTER roars overhead, searchlights canvassing 
           the slum below, looking for culprits.

           INT. JAVIER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Javier enters furtively, closes the door behind him.

           He turns on the kitchen light, opens the fridge.  Felipe 
           charges him, holds a KNIFE to his throat.

                                 FELIPE
                        Give it to me.

                                 JAVIER
                        What are you talking about -

                                 FELIPE
                        The fucking money.

           Felipe goes for Javier's pockets, digs out his winnings.  He 
           backs off slow, removes the knife.

                                 FELIPE (CONT'D)
                        You don't tell, I don't tell.  Be a shame 
                        if she had to find out how her boy was 
                        making bread.  It'd break her heart.

           Felipe pockets the money, places the knife on the counter.  
           He leaves Javier standing in the kitchen.  Boiling.

           EXT. HOUSING PROJECT - NIGHT

           Twin's Seville skids to a stop.  Javier slides in, ready to 
           explode.

'84 SEVILLE - CONTINUOUS

           Twin lights two cigarettes, passes one to Javier.  He waves 
           it off.  Twin persists.

                                 TWIN
                        Be cool, nigga.

           Javier takes the cigarette, drags hard.

                                 TWIN (CONT'D)
                        So where's he at?

           Off Javier.

           INT. POOL HALL - NIGHT

           Felipe sinks an eight-ball, smiles.  His OPPONENT angrily 
           drops his cue on the table.  

                                 FELIPE (IN SPANISH)
                        Let me give you chance to win your money 
                        back.  Best out of five.

           The opponent peels off a C-note, throws it on the table.  
           Storms off.  Felipe calls after him, adds salt to the wound.

                                 FELIPE (IN SPANISH) (CONT'D)
                        Don't get mad.  Guess I wasn't as rusty 
                        as I thought.

           The opponent flips the bird passing Javier and Twin on his 
           way out.  They stand at the entrance, getting into character,  
           watching Felipe giggle to himself.  He throws back the rest 
           of his beer, half-drunk.  

           Twin turns to Javier.

                                 TWIN
                        That him?

           Javier nods.

                                 JAVIER
                        Yeah.

           Twin moves to the bar, whispers to the BARTENDER, slips money 
           in his pocket.  The bartender rushes for the entrance door, 
           locks it.

           Twin moves for the pool tables,  patrons clear a path.  
           They've seen his face enough to realize it's smarter to turn 
           the other way, give him room.

           Felipe notes Twin's approach.

                                 FELIPE
                        Sup, dog, you want to play?

           Twin yanks a handful of Felipe's hair, disables him.  He cuts 
           into Felipe multiple times with a pocket dagger, maliciously 
           punching through various points of his upper body.  He 
           reaches for Felipe's jeans pocket, rips out Javier's money, 
           shows it to him.

                                 TWIN
                        This yours?

                                 FELIPE
                        Yeah.

           Twin stabs Felipe again, he can hardly stand on his own.

                                 TWIN
                        This yours?

                                 FELIPE
                        No!

                                 TWIN
                        If I gotta see you again, I'ma use my 
                        gun.

           He slams Felipe's head on the pool table, wipes his blood on 
           his own clothes.

           The Bartender unlocks the door for Twin, lets him out.  

           Javier barely hides his shock, watches Felipe bleed on the 
           floor.  Their eyes meet.  Javier looks away.  There's no 
           satisfaction in his revenge.  He exits the bar, remorseful.

           INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           Myrna enters the hospital, hurried and anxious.  She tugs 
           Javier's hand, begs him to keep up.

           INT. HOSPITAL, PATIENT ROOM - LATER

           Myrna holds Felipe's hand.  He lies in a bed, wrapped in 
           bandages.  Myrna wipes away tears, relieved he's still alive.  
           Javier sits next to her, avoiding eye contact with Felipe.

           An OFFICER (30's) stands at the foot of the bed, blank pad in 
           hand.

                                 FELIPE
                             (weak)
                        It happened so quick.  It was like one 
                        minute I was drinking my beer and the 
                        next minute I was bleeding on the floor.

                                 OFFICER
                        So you blacked out?

           Felipe looks to Javier.  The sight of this boy instills the  
           fear of God.  He returns his gaze to the officer.

                                 FELIPE
                        Yeah.  Yeah, I blacked out.

           The officer hands Myrna a card.

                                 OFFICER
                        Let me know if anything comes back to 
                        him.

           He leaves.

           Myrna holds Felipe's hand, tears streaming.  He and Javier 
           continue to exchange looks.

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING, REAR ENTRANCE - AFTERNOON

           Joe smoking by the entrance, waiting.  

           A MOTHER struggles through the doors, pushing a stroller.  
           Joe comes to her aid, holds the door open for the woman and 
           her INFANT.

                                 WOMAN
                        Thank you.

           Joe nods, drops his cigarette, enters.

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY - JOE - LATER

           Moving down the hall.  Faulty lights humming on and off.  
           Leaky ceilings caked in mold.  The walls are bombed by 
           graffiti.  In an art gallery, this would be a masterful 
           installation.  Up ahead -

           A KID emerges from one of the units.  He tucks a pistol into 
           his waistband, drapes his hoodie over the handle, concealing 
           his new purchase.

           The kid greets Joe in passing with a nod.  He looks no older 
           than twelve. 

           Joe stops at a door.  The number 9 hangs sideways above the 
           peephole.  He knocks.

           A TITAN in a wifebeater answers the door.  Jail ink, shifty 
           eyes, too much muscle.

           MOSES (30's) 

           He studies Joe.

                                 MOSES
                        I help you?

                                 JOE
                        Chester told me I should see you. 

                                 MOSES
                        Chester?  You mean crackhead who owes me 
                        five-hundred dollars, Chester?

                                 JOE
                        That'd be him.

                                 MOSES
                        What you want?

                                 JOE
                        Strap.

                                 MOSES
                        How much you got?

           Joe draws a thick wad of cash, rolled tight by a rubber band. 

           Off Moses.

           INT. MOSES'S UNIT - CONTINUOUS

           Sparse furnishings, garbage advertising fast food chains 
           litter the floor.  The space is forgetful, easy to abandon.  
           A disassembled pistol lies on the coffee table.  Next to it, 
           a hammer and chisel for wearing down the serial numbers.

           Moses unscrews a portion of the floor.  Joe's eyes dart to 
           the television: an episode of 'The Cosby Show.'  

           Moses removes hardwood, reveals a cache of weaponry.  
           Pistols, shotguns, knives, hand-held explosives, an assault 
           rifle fitted with a grenade launcher.

           Joe hefts the assault rifle, levels it.

                                 MOSES
                        Got that in Chicago.  Man sold it to me 
                        turned out to be a UC, Fed related.  
                        White boy thought he had his man when I 
                        bought it from him.  Nigga was too slow.  
                        You want it, I start at twelve thousand.

           Joe smiles, lowers the launcher back into the floor.  

                                 JOE
                        How about something lighter.

                                 MOSES
                        Straps.  P226, Sig Sauer.  Homeland 
                        Security and Navy SEALs shoot with these, 
                        very reliable.  They're in limited 
                        production.  The lowest I can go is 
                        fifteen, but it's bang for your buck no 
                        doubt.

           Joe examines the weapon, checks the gate, tests the weight 
           like a customer who knows his firearms.  Moses is on to the 
           next pistol, a .38 REVOLVER.  

                                 MOSES (CONT'D)
                        Old school, but it works. 

           He passes it to Joe.  He holds it, releases the cylinder, 
           takes it for a spin.

                                 JOE
                        I used to run with this.

                        It was reliable. 

                                 MOSES
                        Costs a stack.

                                 JOE
                        You got any .45's?

                                 MOSES
                        All out.  Sold four of 'em few weeks ago.  
                        But ain't nothing a .45 can do that these 
                        here can't do ten times better.

           Joe produces a wad of cash, lays it on the table.

                                 JOE
                        That's fifteen for the .38.

                                 MOSES
                        I only asked for a grand.

                                 JOE
                        The five's an extra something for telling 
                        me where I can find homey with the .45's.   
                        Figure I'll buy one off him.

                                 MOSES
                        Don't even worry about.  I'll hit up my 
                        connec, get you one in a few days.

                                 JOE
                        Or you could just tell me what I need to 
                        know.

           Moses smiles, realizes the score.  He studies Joe, a tense 
           beat.

                                 MOSES
                        You a cop?

                        Fuck the police.  

           Joe peels off more money, lays it on the table.

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        That's another two thousand.  

           Moses looks at the money, tempted.

                                 MOSES
                        What's the beef?

                             (pointing to the money)
                        This is your only concern.

           Moses collects the money, counts it, over and over.

                                 MOSES

                        On me.  Along with the cartridges.

           Moses wraps Joe's pistol and suppressor in black cloth, hands 
           them to Joe.  He places the cartridges in a plastic bag.

                                 JOE

                        Down the hall, hang a right.

           Joe rises, moves behind Moses - storing his take in a shoebox 
           brimming with cash.

                                 MOSES (CONT'D)
                        Yup, I'm a Toys-R-Us to these little 
                        niggas.  So long as they got the pocket, 
                        I got the business -

           A silenced bullet cuts him off, exits through his skull and 
           punches a hole through the sofa.  He slumps awkwardly onto 
           the coffee table, dies, hands squeezing the money. 

           Joe stands behind the corpse, lowers the smoking gun.  A beat 
           as he watches Moses bleed.  His expression is cold, pitiless.  
           This man's business is a factor in Corey's death.

           He quickly pockets the shells, covering his tracks.  Scans 
           the space, eyes a gym bag.  Loads it with more cartridges and 
           a few grenades, leaves.  Ready for war.

           INT. BAR - NIGHT 

           Joe throws back a shot of whiskey.  He signals for another 
           one.  Retha pours it.  He sucks it down, lights a cigarette.

                        Thought I kicked it.  That was three 
                        years ago.  I was doing good 'till you 
                        came along.

                        I suppose.  But if it ain't these that 
                        take you, it's something else.

                                 JOE
                        Huh?

                        My name.  Retha.

                        Joe.

           Retha hides her excitement.  She barely knows this man, 
           thinks she could love him.

                                 RETHA
                        So how long you here for, Joe?

                                 JOE
                        Don't know.  Got some things to take care 
                        of before I go.  You know how it is after 
                        funerals: lots of cleaning up to do.

                                 RETHA
                        That's my dad talking.  He'd always say, 
                        'Retha, keep it neat, 'cause some other 
                        asshole's gotta clean up after you.'  He 
                        was right, too.  I'm still paying off 
                        that man's debt.

           Joe pays his tab.

                                 JOE
                        That help?

                                 RETHA
                        Oh, big help.

           He rises to leave.  She calls after him.

                                 RETHA (CONT'D)
                        Hey.  Don't be a stranger.  I'm here 
                        everyday.

           Joe nods, exits.  She watches him leave, very interested.

           INT. JAVIER'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

           Myrna taps Javier awake.  He barely moves, dressed in last 
           night's clothes, utterly beat.

                        Tell Marcus I'm sleep.

                                 MYRNA
                        It's not Marcus.  It's a girl.

           Javier opens his eyes, unsure he heard his mother right.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Leila standing in the living room, taking in the apartment.  
           She spies pictures of an infant Javier and Myrna on the 
           mantle.  

           Myrna gathers her keys, purse, heads for the door.  She 
           switches off the television, calls out of Javier.

                                 MYRNA (IN SPANISH)
                        I'm getting Felipe from the hospital!  Be 
                        back soon!

           Myrna trades an hurried smile with Leila.

                        Hi.  Have fun.

           She leaves.

           Javier stands in the hallway, looking Leila up and down. 

           She produces Javier's lighter, places it on the table.

                                 LEILA
                        Sorry.  Forgot I had it.

                        Chill.

           A beat.  The silence is awkward - young love always is.

                        So, whatchu' up to?  Wanna do something?

                        But you ain't working now.

           Javier shifts uneasy, knows this is a bad idea.

           He studies her, wary.

           INT. ELECTRONICS STORE - DAY

           Javier and Leila point plastic pistols at a wall-sized 
           television, sampling the latest first-person shooter.  

                                 JAVIER
                        How long you know Casino for?

           She ignores the question, finishes him off easy.

                                 LEILA
                        That's twice I beat you.

                        I let you win.

                        No you didn't.  I beat you.  Let's go 
                        again so whup your ass some more.

           Javier puts down the gun, walks.

                                 JAVIER
                        You got it.

           Leila grabs a system beneath the display case, catches up to 
           Javier.

                        Why not?

           She's already heading for the register.

           INT. ELECTRONICS STORE - CONTINUOUS

           Leila counts five-hundred dollars, hands it to the cashier.  
           The cashier bags the system, holds it out for Leila.

                                 LEILA
                        It's his.

           The cashier passes it to Javier, who hesitates.  

                                 JAVIER
                        Hold up.   Me?  I can't let you do that.  
                        You take it.

                        I already got one.

           The cashier drops the bag on the counter, moves on to the 
           next customer.  Leila walks away, strolls through the sliding 
           doors.

           Javier stands alone, staring at his gift, awful tempted. 

           INT. MALL - CONTINUOUS

           Javier slings the gift over his shoulder, jogs up to Leila.

                                 JAVIER
                        Yo, why you being all nice to me?

                        I can't buy you something?

           Leila slows by an athletic shoe store, glimpses a pair of 
           kicks.

                                 LEILA (CONT'D)

           She heads into the store.

SUBWAY CAR - MOVING - DAY

           Javier and Leila seated in the far corner of the car.  A 
           cluster of shopping bags rest below her feet.  The girl spent 
           some money. 

                                 LEILA
                        No you weren't.

                                 JAVIER
                        No joke.  Moms woke up in her water and I 
                        was on my way out.  Medics showed up.  
                        She had me right there in her bed.

                                 LEILA
                        Your dad couldn't take her to the 
                        hospital? 

                                 JAVIER
                        He was gone before I got here.  Got 
                        killed back in San Miguel.

           A BEAT as Leila processes this; she doesn't pry: she's been 
           there.

                                 LEILA
                        You know, I lost my mom that way.  She 
                        was sick even before she went into labor.  
                        Woulda' had a little brother if they made 
                        it.

                        Your dad raise you?

                                 LEILA 
                        Nah, locked up since I was six.  I lived 
                        with my Auntie for a while until I went 
                        to juvie.  When I got out, she didn't 
                        want nothing to do with me.  Thank God 
                        for Casino.

           Off Javier.

           INT. LEILA'S APARTMENT - DAY

           Leila switches on a light, reveals the layout: rich, 
           spacious, excessive.  Leather furniture, a home theater, 
           artwork by Bua, luxury rugs.  Casino has spoiled this girl.  
           Javier is speechless.

           She slips out of her boots.

                        Mine.

           Javier kicks off his Nikes, surveys Leila's apartment, 
           incredulous.

                                 JAVIER
                        How much this cost?

                             (shrugs)
                        Casino pays for it.

           Leila drops her bags, turns on the stereo - M.I.A.

           Javier puts his shoes back on, shakes his head.

                                 LEILA (CONT'D)
                        What?

                                 JAVIER
                        I can't be here.

                                 LEILA
                        Don't trip.  He's hardly ever here.  Sit 
                        down.  

           Leila marches for the kitchen.  She opens the fridge, junk 
           food, champagne and not much else. She grabs an open bottle 
           of Chandon.

           Javier carefully takes a seat, adjusts to the leather, likes 
           the feel.  He looks behind him, on the wall are several blow-
           ups of half-naked women, their backs turned to the camera.  

           She returns pouring a steady stream into two glasses, hands 
           him one.

                                 JAVIER
                             (waving it off)
                        I'm good.

           She doesn't move her hand, insists.  Javier takes it.  She 
           sits beside him.  They tap glasses.  He gulps.  Leila laughs.

           She points the remote at the TV, switches on 'South Park.'  
           She wants to make a move, chickens out, laughs at the 
           television instead.

                        This show is hilarious.  You ever watch

           Javier's phone rattles, he eyes the screen: "Twin."  He 
           answers it.

           Javier disconnects, places the glass on the table, get on his 
           feet, chop-chop.

           He crosses to the door, jumps in his shoes, grabs the XBox.

           She keeps her gaze on the television, feigns indifference.

           Entering.  Sees Twin, Marcus, James, Raoul and a few others 
           around the pool table - trading jokes, loading pistols.  

           Two CHINESE PUSHERS (16, 17) sit blindfolded on the floor, 
           their hands tied, faces bloodied and bruised.

           Marcus moves to greet Javier.  

                                 MARCUS
                        Sup boy, you got your strap?

                        You ain't hear?

           Javier shakes his head.  Marcus laughs, delighted he's more 
           informed than his friend is.  

                                 MARCUS (CONT'D)

           Casino comes walking down the stairs.  The room goes silent.  
           He moves to the pushers, kneels to their level, removes their 
           blindfolds.

                        We told him everything.

           Casino stomps on #1's head with the heel of his Timberland.  
           The pusher tilts over, head streaming blood.  

                                 CASINO
                        I didn't ask you.

           Casino continues the assault, kicking, stomping.  Javier 
           studies the faces of his crew: all grins and giggles, as if 
           they're relishing in the brutality.  It goes on longer than 
           it should.

           Finally, Casino stops, out of breath - boot and jeans a 
           bloody mess.  He uses #2's shirt as a doormat, cleaning his 
           boot.

           Casino spits on his victim, turns to Twin.

                                 CASINO (CONT'D)

                        ain't lying.

           Twin checks the gate on his pistol, tucks it in his jeans, 
           heads out.  The boys follow. 

           Off #1, barely breathing.

           INT. '84 SEVILLE - NIGHT

           Javier rides shotgun, warms his hands, fighting off the 
           nerves.  Marcus, James, Raoul and #2 ride in the backseat, 
           gearing up.  Twin drives fast, focused.

           Javier turns to #2, reads his panic.  Then, fixes his gaze on 
           the road ahead.  They close in on a wall of bright lights.   
           Billboards and storefronts advertise in Chinese.  The Seville 
           rolls into Chinatown.

'84 SEVILLE - TWIN - NIGHT

           Tapping the steering wheel to a beat in his head, ashes his 
           fourth cigarette.  The others sit impatiently, knees 
           restless, watching the door to a meatpacking house -

           Where Raoul stands against the wall, pistol trained on #2 - 
           knocking on the door.  

           A hefty BODYGUARD opens the door, exchanges dialogue with #2.  
           Then, the Raoul makes his move, trains his pistol on the 
           gangster, forces him on the ground, relieves his pockets of 
           all weapons.  

           Twin dons a bandana.  The rest follow suit.  

           EXT. MEATPACKING HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           They exit the car, make a mad dash to the building.  Marcus 
           and James brandishing lead pipes.

           INT. MEATPACKING HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           The crew climbs a long flight of stairs.  Twin keeps his 
           pistol jammed in the bodyguard's back, who leads the way.  
           Javier is last up the stairs.

           INT. MEATPACKING HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Rusted doors, torn carpeting, the dumps.  They march down the 
           narrow hallway. Javier glimpses a room along the way: off the 
           boat hookers huddled in corners, drowning in their high, 
           drained from a hard day's work.

           INT. STASH ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Chinese immigrants, all female, hunched over metal slats,   
           cutting and packaging heroine for distribution.

           The crew bursts through the doors.  Twin trains his gun on 
           the OVERSEER (male, 40's), clears his pockets, finds a small 
           pistol.  The overseer curses in Chinese, spits in Twin's 
           face.  Twin responds, smashes his pistol against the man's 
           skull.  He falls hard, cowers.  Twin wants to kill him, 
           refrains.

           The crew moves full tilt, clearing kilos from shelves, 
           loading them into duffle bags.  The employees watch quietly, 
           indifferent.

           Javier fills his bag, zips up, runs past Twin - pistol-
           whipping the overseer unconscious.  Marcus and James pummel 
           the bodyguard with lead pipes, luxuriating in the experience.

           INT. DELILAH'S - NIGHT

           A DANCER grinds the pole, bored, detached, performing for a 
           dead room.

           Moe emerges from the VIP area, arm hooked around a STRIPPER'S 
           waist, hand wrapped around a bottle of Grey Goose.  He spanks 
           her, watches her walk towards the stage.  He moves for the 
           restroom.  Joe follows.

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Moe pissing in a stall.  He lays a hand on the wall, steadies 
           himself, faded. 

           He emerges from the stall, notes a urine stain on his ivory 
           Jordans.  He grabs his towel from over his shoulder, bends 
           over, placing the bottle of Goose beside him, wipes away the 
           stain.  His ankle explodes.  The BULLET blows through his 
           wrist, mists his face with his own blood.  He YELPS, topples, 
           head over heels -

           A HAND catches him before he smacks the floor, drags him 
           across the tiles, back into the stall.

           Joe props him against the wall, presses the hot barrel of his 
           COLT under Moe's chin, draws back the hammer.  

                                 JOE
                        Scream and I kill you.

           Moe bites his lip, draws blood - the pain is hell.

                        Corey.

           Moe shakes his head, trembling, dizzied.

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        Listen to me.  Cor-ey.  Recognize that 
                        name?

           Moe shakes his head again.

                        Someone got smoked on Griffith Ave last

           Joe moves for the bottle of Goose on the floor, grabs it, 
           pours vodka on Moe's wounded ankle.  He SCREAMS.  Joe muzzles 
           him, muffles the cry.   A beat.  Moe calms, as best he can.

           A beat as Joe contemplates his next move.  Then, he empties 
           two shots through Moe's head, exits the restroom.

           INT. THE DARK ROOM - JOE - NIGHT

           Heading for the nearest exit, unseen, out of sight, like a 
           ghost.

           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A PATRON enters unfastening his belt.  His eyes fall on Moe - 
           face down on the floor, pooling blood.  Dead.

           EXT. PARK - AFTERNOON

           Old-timers meditating over games of chess.  Children 
           recreating on the jungle gym.  A cluster of brothers in a 
           heated pick-up game.

           Casino smokes on a bench, surveying the park activity.  

           Twin and Javier play cards at a table nearby, keeping a 
           vigilant eye on their boss.

           A TRIAD BOSS (late 20's) takes a seat beside Casino, eyes 
           averted.  

           Javier and Twin eyeball his BODYGUARDS (late teens), heading 
           for their table, shouldering backpacks.

           Twin and Javier furtively tuck their pistols beneath their 
           thighs - just in case.  The Bodyguards join the table.  Twin

                        I watch kung-fu movies.  Only the 
                        classics though. Gordon Liu, Jet Li,

                        computer-trickerated nonsense.  Killed it 
                        dead.  Ya'll ever see 'Fist of Legend'?

           One of the Bodyguards nods.

                        Yeah?  That's the Jet Li I'm talking 
                        about.  Nigga used to be a brawler.  Cold 
                        killer.  Damn shame what they done to him 
                        since. 

           All eyes turn to the bench: Casino and the Triad boss shake 
           hands.  The deal is done.  Crisis averted.  The bodyguards 
           rise, pass Javier and Twin the backpacks.

                                 BODYGUARD #1

                        Industry murdered that, too.  Used to be 
                        the truth.  Now?  Bunch of Uncle Tom-ass 
                        niggas posing like they hood, bragging 
                        about bills and bling.  Fuck that.  

           Twin smiles, steals himself from killing this man.

                        Under the table.

           The bodyguards reach under the table, retrieve their stash.  
           He holds their gazes, dead serious.

           EXT. MARSHLANDS, NEAR THE AIRPORT - SUNSET

           A 757 screams on its descent, sailing over the Caprice, 
           parked at the foot of the marshlands .  

           Twin opens the trunk, inside:  PUSHER #1 bound and battered.

                                 TWIN
                        Make this quick.  I'm starving.

           Off Javier.

           EXT. MARSHLANDS - MOMENTS LATER

           Javier walks reluctantly behind the young pusher - lumbering 
           through the grass with his hands tied, face wet with tears.

           Javier reaches into his jeans, produces his pistol.  He racks 
           the slide.

           The hood turns on the sound, sees Javier raise the pistol, 
           takes off running.

           Javier hesitates, lowers the gun, musters strength, wrath.  
           Then, he FIRES a shot into the Pusher's back.  He stumbles 
           hard into the grass, struggles to get to his feet, desperate.  

           Javier marches forward, catching up.  The hood worms away 
           slowly, screaming from the pain.  The process is grotesque, 
           futile, all too real.

           Javier stands over the boy.  Another JET descends from above 
           as he empties the clip - all eleven shots.  

           A beat of silence.  Javier looks at the corpse, smoke rising 
           from multiple wounds.  He drops the pistol, loses balance - 
           vomits.

           Javier sits on the sofa, head buried in his hands, like he 
           just confessed his sins to a father.  Leila puts a hand on 
           his face, caresses it.  She brings his head into her lap, 
           strokes him.

           Clumps of hair on the floor.  Football on the television.  
           Ohio Players clapping from the stereo, 'Is Anybody Gonna Be

           Casino getting a trim.  The BARBER (50's) in the middle of a

                        'fuck this', goes to his closet and loads 
                        his gun intending on doing his woman and 
                        the negro sticking it to her.

           Morbid silence.  Angry tears in almost every eye in the room.  
           Casino's soldiers stand with their heads down, mourning the 
           loss of one of their own.  

           Casino paces back and forth, holds Moe's Phillies cap in one 
           hand, grips a bottle of Cognac in the other.  Drunk.

                        In my two years running shit I ain't lost 
                        a single one of ya'll.  There ain't a 
                        motherfucka for eighteen blocks that 
                        don't know we hold it down.  We family, 
                        you hear?  Moment that hand gets inked 
                        makes us related.  Means when one of you 
                        gets smoked, somebody done disprespected 
                        the whole unit.  All of us.

                        time to speak up. 

           The silence continues.

           He turns to James, eyes hidden behind the brim of his black 
           baseball cap.

                        was good peoples. 

           He empties the entire bottle onto the floor, in memory of 
           their fallen comrade.

           He pitches the bottle at the wall.  It shatters inches from a 
           Marcus's head.  Casino scans the faces of his crew, eyes 
           imploring.

           Joe fucks Retha from behind.  He turns her over, looks into 
           her eyes as she climaxes.

           INT. RETHA'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Joe smoking in a chair across from the bed, hunched over, 
           pensive.  Retha lies on her side, gazing at him.

                                 RETHA
                        You okay?

           Joe nods, clearly isn't.

                        He was just minding his business when 
                        someone put three bullets in him.  Only 
                        witness was the dog he was walking.  
                        Police, well, they done gave up the 
                        moment they found him.  As for her, it 
                        was all more than she could handle, so 
                        she followed him.  

           Retha looks like she could cry.

                        I got a boy.  Little older than yours.

                        check in on me.  Used to be real close.  
                        Now, it's like he's a different person.  
                        I know he thinks he's grown and all, but 
                        I still see my baby boy.  I don't know 
                        what I'd do if someone took him from me.  
                        He's all I got to love.

           Joe looking into our eyes.

                        Don't look good for you, Clyde.  Your 
                        niggas, they all gone.  Every one of 'em.  
                        Didn't have to be this way. 

           Roscoe ties a MAN's hands.  CLYDE (30's), chairman of the 
           Eighth Street crew, gagged, trembling in his underwear, 
           waiting to die.

           His LADY cries through her gag in the corner, back against 
           the wall, hands tied behind her back.

                        Duke never tried to move in on your 
                        territory.  He let ya'll be.  We ain't

                        Things was peaceful before last night.  
                        But you decided you was going to fuck it 
                        all up.  Push on corners that weren't 
                        yours, take tribute that didn't belong to 
                        you.  All Duke asked was for you to step 
                        off.  He didn't insult you.  He just 
                        asked.

                        The real bitch: some of them shots 
                        reserved for Duke made their way to his 
                        wife.  Took her down with him.  Shame.

                         Roscoe. 

           Roscoe looks at Clyde's lady, hesitates.  He turns to Joe, 
           eyes telling all: he can't do this.

           Joe just looks at him, steady, menacing.

           Roscoe gets the picture, marches for Clyde's lady, grabs her 
           by the hair, presses the barrel to her head.  FIRES.  

           Clyde SCREAMS.  Joe empties all six bullets into him.

           Roscoe darts out of the room, hand over his mouth, vomit 
           dripping through his fingers.  

           BATHROOM

           He's over the toilet, dispensing what's left.

           HALLWAY

           Joe steps out, meets a BOY (11) in his pajamas.  Clyde's son.  
           They exchange looks.  

                                 BOY
                        Where's my dad?

           Joe draws his colt, loads two bullets, draws back the hammer.  
           A tense beat, then, he releases the hammer.  Turns his back, 
           stalking away.

           BATHROOM - JOE

           Grabs Roscoe, drags him out.  

           LIVING ROOM

           He pushes Roscoe through the entrance.  

           Off Clyde's son, moving slowly into his dad's bedroom.

           INT. '91 SEDAN - NIGHT

           Joe throws Roscoe in the passenger seat.  He takes the wheel, 
           keys the ignition.  Drives.  He looks beside him, Roscoe 
           explodes into tears. 

           Off Joe.

                                                  CUT BACK TO:

           INT. RETHA'S APARTMENT (PRESENT) - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Joe in the chair, eyes to the floor.  Retha gazes at him, 
           digesting the account.

                                 JOE

           Off Joe.

           EXT. PARKING STRUCTURE - NIGHT

           A COMMUTER in a suit walks to his Mercedes, briefcase in 
           hand.  His eyes meet -

           Javier, standing in the doorway next to the elevator, 
           watching him.

           The commuter disables the alarm, opens his trunk, 
           expeditiously throws in his briefcase and slides in.  He 
           locks the doors as fast as he can, fires up the engine.  
           Peels out.  

           Silence now, save for the structure's flourescents, buzzing 
           ceaselessly.  Then -

           A BROWN SEDAN rounds the corner, parks.  The DRIVER (40's, 
           Latino) climbs out, walks away, neglecting to lock the door.  
           He moves towards Javier, nods as he taps the down button for 
           the elevator.  Speaks with a slight accent.

                                 DRIVER
                        Sorry to hear about Moe.  He was a good 
                        kid.  

           Javier hands him a backpack.  The driver checks it.  He zips 
           up, satisfied.

                                 DRIVER (CONT'D)
                        Drive safe.

           The elevator bell chimes, opens.  The Driver steps inside.

           Javier walks for the sedan. 

           He opens the trunk, stares at kilos of cocaine, packed and 
           stacked.  

           INT. SEDAN - NIGHT

           Javier reaches under the seat, finds the keys, starts the 
           car.
                                       (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                     (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                         (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                          (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)

           The sedan draws up to the booth.  Javier rolls down the 
           window.  The ATTENDANT (30's, Ethiopian) speaks his native 
           tongue into his mobile.

           Javier passes him an envelope.  The attendant checks the 
           contents: a wad of C-notes.  He smiles at the kid, raises the 
           turnstiles, returns to his conversation.  The sedan spills 
           out of the garage.

           INT. SEDAN - NIGHT

           Javier stops at a red light, nervous, completely on edge.  

           A POLICE CRUISER brakes beside him.

           He fixes his gaze forward, avoids eye contact with the 
           OFFICER in the car beside him.

           The Officer turns to Javier, studies him.

           Javier struggles to face forward - the pressure is murder.  
           Finally, he looks to his left, trades gazes with the officer.  
           A beat.  

           The officer nods to the light.  Javier follows his gaze:  the 
           light is GREEN.

           He foots the gas, lurches forward.

           The cruiser changes lanes, driving behind Javier now.  The 
           SIRENS begin to flash, wail.

                                 JAVIER
                        Fuck.

           He steers the sedan to the curb.  The cruiser screams past, 
           in pursuit of some other offender.  

           Javier lays his head on the wheel, sighs.

           EXT. STASH HOUSE - LATER

           An abandoned row house: broken, unassuming, antiquated.  
           Ideal real estate for housing millions in imported narcotics.

           The sedan is parked idle in the backyard.  Three young HOODS, 
           QUENTIN, WOOD, NATE (late teens) unload the trunk, transport 
           the kilos inside.  
                                         (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)

WORLD'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           The office is modish, very white collar.  Photos by Gordon 
           Parks on the wall.  Imported furniture.  African idols.  A 
           bookshelf crammed with books.  This is World's pride.   

           World twists the dials of a wall safe behind his desk.  
           Javier sits before the desk, studies World's holstered pistol 
           jutting out of his waistband.  He turns to the kid.

                                 WORLD
                        You're early.  No trouble on the way?  

           Javier shakes his head.

                                 WORLD (CONT'D)
                        Moe was always late.

           He pays him.

           INT. TWIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Twin on the floor, head between the legs of TRACY (17), his 
           girl.  She carefully braids his hair into cornrows as he 
           watches football with HERB (18), another enforcer.

           Twin's mobile rings beside Tracy, she answers it, hands it to 
           him.

                                 TWIN
                        Yeah...aight, I'm sending Herb over.

                                 HERB
                        What?

                                 TWIN
                        Go grab my load.

                                 HERB
                        Fuck that, nigga.  You do it.

                                 TWIN
                             (watching the game)
                        I'm busy.

                                 HERB
                             (resigned)
                        Gimme the keys.

           Twin tosses keys at Herb.

                        Drive slow.  You fuck it up, I fuck you 
                        up.

           Tracy snickers.  Herb leaves, bitter.

           EXT. TWIN'S BUILDING - NIGHT

           Herb fires up the Caprice, takes off.  Beat.  An ENGINE 
           rattles to a start a few cars behind - Joe.  The car peels 
           quietly from the curb, trails after the Caprice. 

           INT. JOE'S CAR - NIGHT

           Joe watches Herb climb the stairs.  Javier emerges from the 
           entrance, passes Herb on his way down the staircase.  They 
           exchange nods, never halting stride - a quick and formal 
           greeting.

           Joe switches focus to Javier, tries to get a better look, but 
           he disappears into the darkness.  

           INT. STASH HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           World stands over a hot stove, prepares his dinner: stir-fry 
           vegetables, steak.  He sips a glass of scotch.

           LIVING ROOM

           Wood gets cozy on the couch, places his pistol on the table.  
           He turns on the football game, winding down.

           World calls out from the kitchen.

                                 WORLD (O.C.)
                        Tell them clowns downstairs to hustle up 
                        if they want in on this grub.

           Wood rolls his eyes, already situated.  He moves to sit up, 
           feels a breeze.  Turns to the door: open.  Then, a HAND 
           clasps his mouth shut from behind, it's strength is 
           overwhelming, forces him back on the couch.   

                                 WORLD (O.C.) (CONT'D)
                        Wood!  You hear what I said?!

           World steps out into the living room holding his glass, 
           witnesses Joe twist Wood's neck to a break.  He goes limp, 
           dies quietly.  

           A beat as the two exchange glances, consider their options.  
           Then, World drops the glass, draws his glock.

           Joe throws himself at World, guides his arm upward, sends a 
           SHOT into the ceiling.  

           World launches a series of sharp jabs into Joe's gut, steals 
           the wind out of him.  Joe throws a hard elbow, repeats.  
           World spits blood, a tooth.  Joe controls his shooting arm, 
           hurls it against the wall.  The glock drops.

           What follows is a brawl.  No grace, or fancy footwork.  Just 
           two men desperately trying to kill each other with their bare 
           hands.

           INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Quentin and Nate load a duffle bag with Twin's consignment.  
           Herb smokes a joint, waiting, perusing a comic book.  Mobb 
           Deep thumps from a Bose, muffling the fight upstairs.  

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Joe tackles World.  They crash the stove, pots and pans 
           collide, hot food scatters.  World steals a kitchen knife, 
           slashes Joe across the cheek.  Joe grabs the knife hand, 
           slams it down onto the hot stove.  Worlds squeals, releases 
           the blade.  

           Joe socks World across the chin.  He presses the man against 
           the counter, pounds his face pulpy - jab after jab.  He locks 
           his hand around his neck, squeezes.  

           World struggles to breathe, returns with a knee to the groin.  
           Joe winces.  World knees harder as Joe continues to choke 
           him.  

           World knees him for a fourth time.  Joe reels, grabs a 
           fistful of World's hair at the same time.  He kicks his knee, 
           grounds him.  

           Joe forces World's head into the counter - repeatedly, with 
           murderous force.  The final blow kills him.

           Joe's hands are covered in blood.  World is slumped against 
           the counter, on his knees.  Joe catches his breath.  He draws 
           his revolver, lumbers for the basement.

           INT. BASEMENT - JOE - NIGHT

           Staggering down the steps, meets Herb, Nate and Quentin as 
           they trade jokes.  Their smiles quickly fade.

           Joe shoots Nate, Quentin, one after the other.  Their blood 
           freckles Herb's face, who pisses himself.  Joe turns off the 
           stereo.  

                                 JOE
                        You Twin?

           Herb is in shock.  Joe grows impatient, CRACKS him over the 
           head with the revolver - TWICE.  He hits the floor, sobs.  
           Joe is losing his mind.

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        Your name!

                                 HERB
                        Herb!

           Joe shakes his head, picks him up by his shirt, pistol-whips 
           him mercilessly.  Herb returns to the floor a bloody pulp.

           Off Joe, aggravated.

           INT. TWIN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Twin shouts at the television, disapproves of a call made by 
           the ref.

                        Hold still.

           Twin's mobile rattles beside him.  He reads the ID, answers 
           it.

           Joe trains the gun on Herb, who SCREAMS.  

           The gun shot CRACKS in Twin's ear.

STASH HOUSE - BASEMENT - JOE - NIGHT

           Standing among the corpses, empty, detached, lost.  He 
           surveys the room: kilos of cocaine, heroin, marijuana, 
           ecstacy - all neatly stacked on metal shelves.  Enough 
           narcotics to supply an entire community. 

           EXT. STASH HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Joe opens the trunk of his car, unzips Moses's gym bag.

           AT THE DOORSTEP 

           Joe pulls the pins on TWO GRENADES, pitches them inside.  
           They barrel through the living room, tumble down into the 
           basement.  Joe closes the door, heads back to his car.

           INT. LEILA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Casino in bed with Leila.  He tries to pull her to his side 
           of the bed, wants some.  She declines.

                                 LEILA
                        Stop.

                                 CASINO
                        Hell is wrong with you?

                                 LEILA
                        I told you it's my week.

                                 CASINO
                        Think I give a fuck?

           His phone interrupts, rattling on the nightstand.

           He answers it.

                                 CASINO (CONT'D)
                        Yeah.  

           A beat as he listens to the news on the other end.  

                                 CASINO (CONT'D)
                        Yo, slow down.  

           Then, he hustles out of bed, dashes out of the room.  He 
           cries angrily from the hallway.

           EXT. STASH HOUSE - NIGHT

           Sirens bathe the block in red and blue.  Firemen scramble 
           with the hose.  Officers bark into their radios, take 
           statements.  Neighbors stand in their pajamas, watching the 
           stash house burn to the ground.

           A Cadillac rolls to a stop, not too far from the scene. 

           INT. CADILLAC - CASINO -CONTINUOUS

           Watching hopelessly from the driver's seat.  His supply is no 
           more.  His heart, hopes, dreams - all broken.

           Medics wheel out body bags - members of his crew, presumably 
           burned beyond recognition.  Casino drives off.  He's seen 
           enough.

           INT. TWIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Twin crashes into his television, rolls onto the floor.  His 
           faces is bloodied and bruised.  He tries to get to his feet.  
           Casino strikes him with a baseball bat.

           Tracy cowers in the corner.  All she can do is watch.

           Casino kneels to Twin's level, looks him in his swollen eye.

                                 CASINO
                        Just tell me you set it up.

           Twin shakes his head, battered and weak.

                                 TWIN
                        He called me...told me what I told you.  
                        He told me what I told you -

           Casino takes another swing, cracks him in the face.

                                 CASINO
                        You really expect me to believe that?  

           He swings, connects.

           Twin doesn't answer.  Casino grabs him by the ear, makes sure 
           he's listening.

                        That's why you sent Herb, right?  I

                        irks me.

           Casino shakes his head, drops the bat, draws his colt, 
           presses it against Twin's head.

           Tracy comes to a boil, charges him.  She grabs the bat, swats 
           him from behind.

                                 TRACY
                        Stop it!

           Casino turns, socks her in the jaw.  She falls hard to the 
           floor.  He moves for her - crawling away.

                        You wanna go with him?   

           He trains the Colt on Tracy, presses the barrel to the back 
           of her head.

           Then, the HAMMER of a .45 cocks behind him, millimeters from 
           his head.  Twin holds it, barely standing.  A beat as Casino 
           studies Tracy, fearing for her life.  He lowers his Colt, 
           slow.

                        Turn around.

                        happened to Herb.  But fuck you for 
                        thinking it was me who burned you.

           Twin hands him the pistol, buys back his boss's trust.  He 
           wipes blood from his lip.

                        So, what we gotta do to make this right?

           Casino comes down from his breakdown.  His eyes are dancing.  
           He's still processing the loss.  He isn't well.

                        Man took everything - the whole stash.  
                        Brought me down to zero.  I worked hard 
                        for that.  Years, man.

           INT. PATTY'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Bottles of alcohol and peroxide on the rim of the sink.  
           Blood-stained gauze in the bowl.  

           Shuggie sits at the doorway, watches Joe stitch his cheek.  
           Not a wince.  His method is studied, like he's done this 
           before.

           INT. JAVIER'S APARTMENT - JAVIER - NIGHT

           Moving down the hall, opens the door to his bedroom.

           Myrna wipes tears from her face.  She gathers Javier's stash, 
           assiduously places the product back in his bag.

                        Felipe is gone.  He left this morning.  I 
                        thought he was crazy for even 
                        considering.  I begged him to not to 
                        leave.  

           She pitches the bag at his feet, parcels of his consignment 
           spilling onto the floor.

           Myrna cups her face, broken.  Javier sits beside her, strokes 
           her shoulder. 

                                 JAVIER
                        I'm just trying to help you.

                        I don't need your help.  Not this way.  
                        You do business for evil men.  Men like 
                        the ones who took your father from me -  
                        my husband! 

           Myrna turns to him, gives him a look he's never seen before.  
           It's cold, disappointed.

                        I want you to leave.

           Javier loses his breath.

                                 JAVIER
                        No.  Don't say that, mami.  You don't 
                        mean that.

                        I do, Javie.  I want you to leave.  

           Javier tries to console her.

                        Don't say that.  Please.  I'm sorry.  I 
                        won't do it again.

           Myrna pounds on Javier, beating him off.

           She pounds harder, forces his bag into his hands, shoving him 
           out - towards the door.

           She slams the door in his face, locks it, sinks to the floor, 
           buries her head in her knees.

           Javier bangs on the door, begs for Myrna to open up, like an

           Myrna just sits there, crying.

           EXT. HOUSING PROJECT - JAVIER - NIGHT

           Sitting alone on the curb, smoking.  Homeless.  He calls 
           Leila, gets her answering machine.  Doesn't leave a message.  
           He pockets his phone, it RINGS.  He checks the ID: "TWIN",

           INT. PATTY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Darkness, save for the television glowing in the corner.  The 
           nightly news on mute.  Joe sleeps in a chair facing the door.  
           Shuggie is curled up beside him.  Then, the sound of 
           FOOTSTEPS in the hallway, multiple pairs.

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Twin and company move down the hall, bandanas obscuring their 
           faces.  Javier trades glances with an OLD WOMAN entering her 
           apartment.  She notes the procession with indifference, 
           feigns like she didn't see it.  The soldiers stop at the 
           door.  Twin knocks with the barrel of his .45.

           Opening his eyes.  Shuggie is on alert.  Another KNOCK.  
           Shuggie moves for the door, Joe grabs the dog's collar, keeps 
           him at bay.  His free hand establishes a firm grip on the 
           revolver resting on the nightstand beside him.

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Twin clears the way.  James kneels before the handle, unrolls 
           a set of LOCK PICKS and two TORSION WRENCHES.  He begins 
           picking the lock.

           Joe restrains Shuggie by his collar - SNARLING at the 
           commotion behind the door.  Dog and master listen as the door 
           unlocks.

           James kicks open the door.  Joe FIRES through the dark, 
           shoots the boy in the head. 

           Twin shuts the door. They all hesitate.  James convulses on 
           the floor, dies before them.  Javier is sweating through his 
           bandana.

           Shuggie BARKS furiously.  Joe drags him into the hallway, 
           away from danger, as fast as he can.

           Twin charges inside, fires aimlessly into the hallway - FIVE

           tears into Twin's throat.  He reels, trips over furniture.  

           Joe forces the wounded pit bull into the bathroom, shuts the 
           door.

           HALLWAY

           Raoul looks to Javier, sees fear in his eyes, takes off into 
           the room - BLAZING.  Javier follows after him, takes cover in 
           the kitchen, crouches near the stove.

           Joe stands calmly, hidden behind the doorway of Corey's room.  
           His eyes are on the wall.  They follow Raoul's shadow - 
           exposed by the errant muzzle flashes.  Joe spins out, wastes 
           no time firing two shots into Raoul. 

           Joe moves.  Raoul crawls away, leaving a trail of blood on 
           his way, swearing in Creole.  Joe comes upon the fallen 
           soldier, executes him, moves on. 

           LIVING ROOM - JOE

           Sees Twin helping himself onto the couch, applying pressure 
           to his throat, choking on blood.  

           Twin struggles to train his .45 at Joe.  His strength fades 
           fast.  He drops the .45.

           Javier listens behind the stove, terrified. 

           Twin is losing blood - and time.  He looks at Joe, removes 
           his bandana, ready to die.

                                 TWIN
                        You know what's funny...I ain't the one 
                        you're looking for.  I saw it...
                        ...watched your boy die.  But I didn't do 
                        it.

           Joe puts the revolver to Twin's head.

                                 JOE
                        Then who did.

           Javier is losing it.  He wants to make a move, doesn't have 
           the courage.  He's a coward.

           Twin shakes his head, begins to tremble.  Dies.

           Javier cries silently.

           Joe darts for the bathroom, opens the door.  

           BATHROOM

           Shuggie whines on his side, bleeding.  Joe strokes him, 
           comforting the dog through his final moments.  His eyes open 
           and close, fighting to stay.  Then, they cease movement.  
           He's dead.

           LIVING ROOM - JOE

           Gathers his belongings - anything that connects him to this 
           place.

           JAVIER IS RIGHT BEHIND HIM.  He takes aim, finger on the 
           trigger, lowers the gun.  Impotent.  He trembles in the big 
           man's presence.

           COREY'S ROOM - JOE

           Grabs his son's guitar, places it in it's case.  He scoops 
           Corey's scrapbook.

           LIVING ROOM - JAVIER

           Quietly freaking out amongst his comrades' corpses.  He 
           inches towards Twin's corpse.  Paces back and forth, cursing 
           himself.  He rips off his bandana, wipes away tears.

           SIRENS cry in the distance.  He peers out the window, sees 
           CRUISERS racing for the building.  In the sky, a POLICE 
           CHOPPER glides in the same direction. 

           Javier steals one last glance at his crew, bails.

           Joe returns.  Sees the law, incoming.  He turns to leave, 
           then, TWIN'S MOBILE RINGS.  He stops, hesitates.  Beat.  On 
           the ID: CASINO. 

           He grabs it, exits the apartment.

           INT. HALLWAY - JOE - NIGHT

           Moving down the hall, listening. 

                                 CASINO (O.S.)
                        What's the status?

           Joe doesn't answer, takes the stairs.

           INT. CASINO'S HOUSE, GAME ROOM - NIGHT

           Casino smoking a joint, anxious, worried, coming apart. 

                                 CASINO 
                        Hello?

                        Twin's gone.  Who's this?

           Casino grits his teeth, stress restored.

                                 CASINO
                        I'm the man he worked for.

                                 JOE
                        Good.  Guess I come for you next.  
                        Casino.

                                 CASINO
                        Why the fuck you doing this to me, man?  
                        What you want from me?

           Joe climbs into his car.  Drives with a wounded arm.

           A phalanx of POLICE CRUISERS barrel in the opposite 
           direction, screaming for the housing project.

                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

           Javier spills out of the building amongst a cluster of 
           panicked tenants. 

                                 JOE (O.S.)
                        I want the one who did it.  I want the 
                        one who did Corey.  You give me that, 
                        I'll probably walk.

                        You're top dog, son.  Got too many people 
                        looking up to you to pull the trigger 
                        yourself.  

           Cruisers edge the curb of the building.  Officers jump out.

           Javier retreats back into the building, away from the law.

           INT. HALLWAY - JAVIER - NIGHT

           Pushing through tenants, heading for the front entrance.  

                                 CASINO (O.S.)

           He bursts out, jumps off the loading dock.  Runs.

           Javier runs for his life, never breaking his stride, heart

           INT. JOE'S CAR - JOE - CONTINUOUS

           Pulls beside a gutter, tosses the phone.  Drives.

           INT. CASINO'S HOUSE - SAME TIME

           Casino slams a fist on the table, tilts it over.  Chips spill 
           onto the floor, cards disperse.  He paces the room, thinking 
           on his feet.  Then, he grabs his coat off the chair, leaves 
           in a hurry.

           INT. RETHA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Retha drops her purse, keys onto the counter.  It's been a 
           long night.  

           BATHROOM 

           She stands in the shower, scrubs away the stench of booze, 
           cigarettes, men.

           KITCHEN

           She smokes a joint, counts her tips for the evening -
           budgeting.  

           LIVING ROOM 

           She sits on the couch before a television, bites her nails, 
           mind elsewhere.  

           BACK IN THE KITCHEN 

           She leans against the counter, cradling her phone:

                                 RETHA
                        It's been a few weeks, Jamal. Please give 
                        me a call.  It's momma.

           She hangs up.  A KNOCK at the door.

           She opens it, regards Joe - shouldering his belongings.  He 
           leans on the frame, drained.  Blood leaks from his sleeve, 
           drips onto the floor.

           Joe on the rim of the tub, hand wrapped around the neck of a 
           whiskey bottle, drinking it down, numbing the pain.  Retha on 
           a stool, stitching him up.  

                                 RETHA
                        Hope I'm doing this right.

                                 JOE
                        You got it.

           She smiles.

                                 RETHA
                        So how'd you get this? Or is it none of 
                        my business?

                                 JOE
                        Someone's gotta answer for what they done 
                        to Corey.

           Retha nods, registers the implications.

                                 RETHA
                        And getting even, that's justice to you?

                                 JOE
                        You've lived here long enough.  

                                 RETHA
                        My whole life.

                                 JOE
                        Then you know the deal. 

                                 RETHA
                        Bullshit.  It's why Corey grew up without 
                        his father. 

           Joe turns away, doesn't like where she's taking this.

                                 RETHA (CONT'D)

           Joe begins to shift, temper tested.

           Joe puts down the bottle, picks up stitching where she left 
           off.

           INT. LEILA'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

           Casino sparks up a cigarette, takes a seat beside the 
           dresser, cools off.  

           The WATER runs in the bathroom for what seems like an 
           eternity.

           Then, Leila's mobile rattles on her bed.  He stares at it, 
           annoyed.  Marches for the phone, grabs it.

           On the screen: "ONE MESSAGE RECEIVED."  He turns to the 
           bathroom door, still closed, opens the text, reads it.  He 
           sinks onto the floor, fixed on the message.  We never see the 
           text, and don't need to - Casino is hurt, betrayed.  

           He slowly walks to the bathroom, lets himself in.
                                       (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)

SUBWAY CAR - MORNING

           Javier opens his eyes, groggy.  The train is still moving.   
           Morning sunlight pours through the windows as the car emerges 
           from the tunnel.  He's been sleeping for hours.

           The train slows to a stop.  Morning commuters flood the car.  
           Javier gets off.

           INT. RETHA'S BEDROOM - JOE - MORNING 

           Watching Retha sleep.  

           He grabs his coat, shoulders his belongings, takes a look at 
           Retha, envying her peace.  He leaves.

           EXT. CASINO'S HOUSE, ROOFTOP - DAY

           Casino paces near the roof's edge.  His affect is 
           apprehensive, agitated.   

           LATER: 

           He opens the front door, welcomes Curtis, Hector and a third 
           MAN (20's) inside.  We'll call him SHAW.  All furtively 
           carrying SAWED-OFF SHOTGUNS by their sides.  

           INT. MARCUS'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - DAY

           Marcus tucks his pistol in his waistband, dons a hoodie.  

           BATHROOM

           His MOTHER bathes his two BABY BROTHERS.  He kisses his 
           mother, ruffles his brothers' hair.

           EXT. HOUSING PROJECT - MARCUS - LATER

           Slides into an idling car.  MIKE (18) waits behind the wheel, 
           drives off.

           EXT. HAIR SALON - DAY

           Javier on a bench, eyes locked on his mother - across the 
           street, working like a dog behind the store windows.  She 
           washes a woman's hair, moves to the row of hair dryers, 
           checks on another customer, multitasking.

           Joe stands over his family's graves.  He falls to his knees, 
           nearly breaks into tears - the side effects to his reckoning 
           painfully manifested.  This is a broken man.

           EXT. HAIR SALON - NIGHT

           Early evening.  Javier on the same bench.  He watches his 
           mother sweep the floors, take out the garbage, count her 
           day's take.  She's exhausted.

           Then, Javier's mobile pulls him out of his daze.  He checks 
           the ID: "CASINO", hesitates, then -

                                 JAVIER
                        Hello?

                                 CASINO (O.S.)
                        Been a minute, son.  Where you been 
                        hiding?

                                 JAVIER
                             (nervous)
                        Nowhere.

                                 CASINO (O.S.)
                        You aight?  Don't sound too good.

                                 JAVIER
                        I'm straight.

                                 CASINO (O.S.)
                        Bad news.  Twin's gone.

           Javier perks up, realizes Casino doesn't know he was present 
           for the enforcer's demise. 

                                 CASINO (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Left this world fighting.  Can't nobody 
                        take that from him.  But I don't need you 
                        sweating about it.  I'm taking care of 
                        it.  I just need you working, hear me?

                                 JAVIER
                        Yeah.

                                 CASINO
                        Good.  Need you to do a pick-up tonight.  
                        Ten o'clock.  Think you can handle that?

                        I got it.  

                                 CASINO
                        That's my boy.  Marcus will meet you 
                        there.  Don't be late.

           He hangs up.  Javier sits there thinking, knows something's 
           awry.  He steals one last glimpse of his mother, vacates the 
           bench.

           INT. CASINO'S HOUSE, DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Casino watches his phone, reads the time: "7:59."  Waits.

           Curtis, Hector and Shaw smoke cigarettes, trade stories, prep 
           their shotguns.  Mike and Marcus watch, slouched in their 
           chairs.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Joe at a pay phone.  He inserts some quarters, dials a 
           number.

           INTERCUT:

           INT. CASINO'S HOUSE, DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Casino's mobile rings.  The room goes silent.  He takes a 
           deep breath, answers it.  A tense beat, then.

                                 CASINO
                        The garage on Fenton.  Bottom floor.  Ten 
                        o'clock.  Gonna have a black bookbag on 
                        him.  Name's Javier.  That's your man.

           The line goes dead.

           Joe exhales, hangs up the phone.

           INT. CASINO'S HOUSE, DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Casino turns to Mike and Marcus - waiting for his word.  He 
           focuses on Marcus, penetrating, reads concern.

                                 CASINO
                        Nervous?

           Marcus shakes his head, lying.  He tries to keep his 
           attention on Casino, but the CLICKING and LOADING of shotguns 
           only amplifies his anxiety.

           INT. MORGUE - NIGHT

           A GLOVED HAND unzips a body bag, reveals Twin's corpse - 
           frigid, vacant.

           Retha stares at him, incredulous, fighting back tears.  A 
           DETECTIVE watches her react, waiting.  

                                 DETECTIVE
                        Is this him?  Is this your son?

           Retha shudders, looks like she's going to be sick.  She 
           begins to cry. 

           The Detective motions the Coroner to zip up the bag.  He 
           does.  Retha stands there, trembling, her arms crossed tight - 
           holding it all back.

                                 RETHA
                        Where did you find him?

           BILL O'REILLY and BERNARD GOLDBERG on television, bashing the 
           left, giving props to the 2nd Amendment.

           Curtis drinks a Vitamin water, shotgun resting in his lap.  
           Hector browses an issue of KING MAGAZINE.  Shaw listens to 
           his iPod, in his own world.

           Casino sits alone in the dining room, knees restless, praying 
           for a happy ending.  Then -

           A KNOCK on the front door.

           Casino rises from his chair, panicked.  Everyone stops what 
           they're doing, fall into character.

           Hector drops the magazine, grabs his shotgun, heads for the 
           door.

           Curtis sits up, lowers the volume, gets a grip on his rifle.

           Hector opens the door, sees -

           RETHA 

           Face filled with panic, soaked in tears.  She looks beyond 
           Hector, meets eyes with Casino.  He already knows what this 
           is about.

           Casino closes the door behind him.  Retha paces the room, 
           unable to sit.

           Retha SLAPS him across the face.  He just stands there, takes

                        I tried so hard.  Lord did I try - 
                        school, curfews, but nothing took.  
                        Because you were always there, setting a 
                        fine example for your nephew.  All I 
                        would hear from his mouth is how he 
                        wanted be like Uncle Casey.  And even 
                        though I never approved, I never told you 
                        how to live your life.  Just so long as 
                        it didn't involve my boy.

                        It was hell keeping him from you.  And 
                        you didn't do a damn thing to change his 
                        mind.  You just let him in.  You let him

                        through, I don't know if I blame him.

           Mike hands Marcus a pistol.

                                 MIKE
                        You better wake up.

           He fires up the engine, turns into the structure.

           INT. JOE'S CAR - NIGHT

           Joe smoking a cigarette, fingers tapping the cold steel of 
           his revolver, pointed downward in his grip, occupying the 
           passenger seat.  Classic soul on the radio.  His eyes express 
           fatigue, angst, disconsolation.  He wants this to be over, 
           fears it never will be.

                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. '91 SEDAN (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT

           Joe parks at the entrance of his building, turns to Roscoe.

                                 JOE
                        You alright to drive?

           Roscoe nods, eyes fixed straight ahead.

                                 ROSCOE
                        You know we going to hell, right?  For 
                        what we done.

           Joe doesn't respond.

                                 ROSCOE (CONT'D)
                        I used to think I could handle this.  I 
                        mean if you could, why couldn't I?  And I 
                        ain't blaming you.  I wanted the work.  
                        Thought it'd be easy.  After 
                        tonight...well I ain't you, I know that.  
                        Don't know how you do it.  You just turn

           (cid:13)           INT. HIMES UNIT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Patty paces back and forth, Baby Corey crying on her 
           shoulders.  Joe stands at the door, watching.   She catches 
           his eye, shakes her head -

                                 PATTY
                        I tried everything.  He don't want no 
                        milk, he don't want no food.  He just 
                        wants to fight.  
                             (beat)
                        I need you to play.

                                 JOE
                        Thought you hate that song.

                                 PATTY
                        It's the only one you know how to play, 
                        right?

           Joe nods.

                                 PATTY (CONT'D)
                        I'm out of ideas.

                                 JOE
                        Put him in the crib.  I'll be right 
                        there.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Baby Corey, wailing in his crib.

           Joe pulls up a chair, cradling the GUITAR Corey will inherit.  
           He tunes it.  Then, he strums a blues melody.  The song: John 
           Lee Hooker's "I'm Bad Like Jesse James."  The lyrics are 
           angry; the theme is revenge.  Joe's voice is amateur, raspy, 
           suitable for a blues singer.  Corey doesn't understand a 
           word, but the melody calms him, gradually induces sleep.

           Joe stands over the crib, kisses Corey one last time.

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        'Night son.

JOE'S CAR (PRESENT) - JOE - NIGHT

           Peering out into the lot, parked cars are his only company.  
           No sign of the "bookbag".

           Then, the groan of the STAIRWELL DOOR, swinging open, feeding 
           out a young boy - bookbag slung over his shoulders.  JAVIER.

           Joe studies the boy, incredulous.  His features are soft, 
           innocent, angelic, like a baby's.  He watches Javier post up 
           beside the elevator, wait.

           Joe takes a deep breath, gathers strength, courage.  He 
           checks the revolver's cylinder - all six chambers are loaded.  
           He locks it in place.  A beat.  Now or never. 

           He jumps out of the car, moves for Javier.

                                 JOE
                        Javier.

           Javier spots the revolver in the man's hand.  Reacts, 
           dropping his bag.  THEN -

           A CAR screams around the corner, barrels for Joe and Javier -  
           High beams blinding.

           INT. MIKE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

                                 MIKE
                        Yo, that's them!  Do 'em both!

           Marcus struggles to unlock the safety on his pistol, jittery.  
           Mike takes note, shakes his head.

                                 MIKE (CONT'D)
                        Little bitch.  I knew you couldn't do it!

           He steals the pistol from Marcus's hand.  FIRES out the 
           window.

           INT. PARKING STRUCTURE - SAME TIME

           A BULLET screams past Joe, punches the wall.  He reacts, 
           crashes the cement, rolls away.  

           Mike empties his pistol carelessly.  Javier is hit in the 
           multiple times, bullets ripping through him.  He drops.

           Joe levels the revolver as Mike continues shooting at him.  
           He FIRES once, hits Mike in the head.

           The car continues to accelerate.  Sweeps past Joe and Javier.   
           SMASHES INTO THE WALL.

           Joe gets to his feet, walks for the car: Mike is dead.  
           Marcus is slumped forward on the dashboard, face pummeled, 
           bloodied beyond recognition.  He looks behind him, sees 
           Javier lying motionless.

           EXT. PARKING STRUCTURE - NIGHT 

           Joe's car barrels through the turnstiles.

           INT. JOE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Joe drives frantically.  He looks beside him: Javier is 
           unconscious, losing blood.  He slaps the boy hard, tries to 
           keep him here.

                                 JOE
                        Come on.  Wake up, boy!  

           Javier doesn't react.  Joe floors it. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Joe storms the lobby carrying Javier in his arms, pushes 
           through nurses, patients, everyone.  A MALE NURSE takes note, 
           signals a COLLEAGUE.

           LATER:

           They ease Javier onto a gurney, wheel him forward.  

           Doctors surround him, checking for vitals.  Joe follows 
           closely behind.  

           They burst through the operating room, cut through Javier's 
           clothes, get to work.  Frenzied speeds.  A NURSE guides Joe 
           out of the room.  He fights to stay.  The nurse persists, 
           forces Joe out. 

           He stands at the door, catches his breath, peering through 
           the glass, watching the doctor's work.  He looks at his 
           hands: they're covered in blood. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Javier lies in a bed, breathes through an oxygen mask.  His 
           body is linked to a series of tubes.  His chest is wrapped in 
           a bandage.

           Joe sits beside him, watching over.

                                 JOE
                        When they gave you up, I thought about 
                        how I'd do it.  Figured I'd look you in 
                        the eyes, make sure you got a good look 
                        at me.  I was ready.  Had my heart set.  
                        Then I saw you.  Told myself 'this ain't 
                        him.  He's too young to take my boy.  He 
                        ain't a killer.  Just a kid.' 
                             (beat)
                        You probably didn't even know Corey.
                             (beat)
                        I was seventeen first time I took 
                        somebody.  Worked for this man named 
                        Duke.  Everybody loved him.  Drove a 
                        Cadillac.  Had more money than I ever 
                        seen.  Closest thing I had to a father.  
                        One day he gave me a gun, told me to see 
                        a problem that needed fixing.  Boy about 
                        fifteen. Little hustler who was stealing 
                        from him.  So I fixed it.  Didn't think 
                        nothing about it.  Found him on a corner, 
                        laughing with his boys.  I shot him 
                        twice, ran for blocks.  It didn't matter.  
                        I could still hear his boys - screaming. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

           Myrna runs through the sliding doors, in a panic.  Her face 
           is a mask of tears.  

                                 JOE (O.S.)
                        It does something to you, taking a life.  
                        You turn off.  It's like you die, too.  I 
                        look at you, I don't see me.  I don't see 
                        those people you run with.  You don't 
                        belong.  

           She asks a NURSE where her son is.  He directs her to the 
           front desk.  She runs for it.  The RECEPTIONIST gives her a 
           room number. 

                                 JOE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        I see someone who don't know what he got 
                        himself into.  And now you're in trouble, 
                        'cause the minute you step outside, they 
                        gonna be coming for you.  And they ain't 
                        gonna stop until you're dead.

           She rushes through the bustle, breathless, fearing the worst.  
           On her way to Javier's room, she passes Joe - walking in the 
           opposite direction, leaving the hospital.

CASINO'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Joe parks his car, exits.  

           We FOLLOW him from behind, moving for the house.  Shaw sits 
           on the stoop, smoking a cigarette, getting some air.  Joe 
           opens the gate.  Shaw stands, curious about the stranger.

                                 SHAW
                        Can I help you?

           Joe draws on him.  Shoots him through the head.  He moves up 
           the steps, enters -

           INT. CASINO'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Steps into the living room.  Hector raises his rifle.  Joe 
           FIRES first, nails him to the wall.  

           A BULLET cuts through Joe's shoulder.  He turns to the 
           source, SHOOTS CASINO'S RIGHT EAR OFF.  

           Casino fires a wayward shot - deaf, disoriented.  He drops 
           the gun, stumbles out of the house.  

           Joe gives chase, but a GUNSHOT blasts through his collar 
           bone, drops him.  

           Curtis races down the stares, pumps his shotgun for the final 
           blow.  

           Joe FIRES twice, kneecaps him.  Curtis stumbles down the 
           stairs.  

           Joe struggles to his feet as Curtis tries to level his rifle - 
           PAINED.  Joe puts the revolver to his temple, FIRES.

           He clutches his wound, lumbers outside. 

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           In the distance, Casino staggers in the middle of the street, 
           like a drunk.  

           Joe releases the cylinder, empties spent shells onto the 
           sidewalk.  He reloads, fast, clumsily - in severe pain.  
           Casino's image grows smaller as he stumbles away, hand over 
           what's left of his right ear.  Joe FIRES at his target, 
           misses.  He proceeds, fires again -

           The bullet punches pavement.  Dogs bark, O.S.  Neighbors 
           curse from their windows, beg for peace.

           Joe FIRES again, shatters a parked car's windshield - closing 
           in on Casino.  He shoots once more, nails Casino in the lower 
           back.  He falls to the ground, gets back up, limps.  

           SIRENS wail in the distance:  the cops are en route.

           Joe shoots Casino through the back again, drops him this 
           time.  He lurches for him, strength diminishing.  

           Cruisers speed down the block, closing in on the two gunmen.

           Joe stands over Casino, who turns on his back, meets his 
           maker.

                                 CASINO
                             (out of breath; giggling)
                        You better drop it.
                             (beat)
                        Looks like we goin' to jail.  See you 
                        inside, Joe.

           Joe turns, the cruisers are barely a block away.  Then, he 
           turns back to Casino, shoots him in the face.  He drops the 
           revolver, falls to the ground.

           The cruisers brake before Joe.  

           Officers jump out, guns drawn, surround the two gunmen.

           Officers YELLOW TAPE the perimeter, preparing the crime 
           scene.

           The entire neighborhood is watching.

           FADE IN:

           INT. HOSPITAL, PATIENT ROOM - EARLY MORNING

           Javier's eyes open slowly, gradually focus on Myrna, sleeping 
           in a chair.

                                 JAVIER
                             (groggy)

           Myrna wakes up, rises, kisses him, puts a hand on her baby's 
           head.  She's never been happier to see him.

           INT. PRISON - DAY

           Joe in prison blues, hunched over the edge of the bed, 
           confined to a cell.  His hair is longer, a beard is growing.  
           Time has passed.  Pictures from Corey's scrapbook crowd his 
           wall.

           Myrna stands at the door, gathering her belongings. She grabs 
           two plane tickets and two passports off the counter, calls 
           for Javier.  

           He emerges from his room, walks with a cane, still healing, a 
           bit harder than before.  He drags a large suitcase behind 
           him.  Myrna helps him.

           She turns off all the lights.  They leave.

           The entire space is empty.

           INT. PRISON - DAY

           Joe watches the GUARD unlock the cell door, slide it open.  
           The Guard steps back.  Joe rises, steps out.

           EXT. HOUSING PROJECT - DAY

           Myrna and Javier stand at the curb.  A CAB draws up beside 
           them.  The DRIVER hops out, hefts their luggage into the 
           trunk.  Myrna and Javier climb in the backseat.

           The cab peels away from the housing project.

           INT. PRISON - DAY

           The Guard leads Joe down a long corridor.  He passes other 
           inmates.  One gives him a look, tries to start trouble.  He 
           ignores the offense, gaze fixed straight ahead.

           INT. CAB - DAY

           Myrna and Javier in the backseat, gazing out their windows, 
           watching their neighborhood pass them by for the last time.

           INT. PRISON, VISITORS ROOM - DAY

           The Guard enters first, leads Joe inside.  He hesitates for a 
           moment, whoever he sees gives him pause.

           RETHA sits at a table, her eyes penetrating Joe.

           He takes a seat before her, guilt-ridden, too ashamed to face 
           her after all the pain he's caused.

           Retha continues to look him in the face, mournful, angered, 
           brave.

CAB/STREET CORNER - DAY

           The cab brakes at a red light.  Javier spots a KID dealing to 
           a CUSTOMER on the corner.  Marcus.

           Marcus glances over at the cab, his face scarred from the 
           accident.  He sees Javier in the cab.  

           Beat.  The two friends exchange looks.  Then -

           Marcus nods to him.  

           Javier nods back.  Their last goodbye.

           The light turns green.  The cab drives off.  

           INT. PRISON - DAY

           Retha reaches her hand out to Joe's, takes hold.  Joe is 
           taken aback, speechless.  He finally looks at her as she 
           pulls his hand towards her.  She strokes it lovingly - 
           beginning to forgive.

                                                  CUT TO BLACK.

                                 END
